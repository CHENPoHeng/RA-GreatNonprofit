Big Tree International	224673		/users/profile/288432	Thomas_Barry	General Member of the Public	5	10/21/2014	My name is Tom Barry.  I served as a teacher at the FIRE School of Ministry and as its Director of Pastoral Care during the time that Matt Ziebart attended FIRE. My wife and I became very well acquainted with the Ziebarts and spent a significant amount of time with them during their early years as husband and wife.  I also employed Matt as a contractor to build an outdoor deck at my home. We have seen them do what was necessary to have a successful marriage and family.  We have watched as they have worked hard to pour themselves out in behalf of others and have boldly taken the initiative to help those who cannot help themselves. We can give the Matt and Hallie our highest recommendation for their personal character, work ethic, zeal and concern for others, and would be glad to answer any additional questions you may have. Sincerely,Tom Barry704-905-3435
Big Tree International	221126		/users/profile/284838	Jason_Fer	Donor	5	10/09/2014	My wife and I love the heart of Big Tree. They truly understandthe role we, as the church, are to have in the lives of orphans. Not only do they understand it, but they are passionate about helping to equip the church to pour out into these little lives as well. They have a very real and unique vision that we find refreshing. We feel honored to be apart of such an awesome organization.

If half of the other non-profits i know were run with this efficiency we would be living in a different world.

Big Tree International	220225	1	/users/profile/283871	d.booleigh	Client Served	5	10/06/2014	I love Big Tree International because their work is hands-on, personal, and practical. I have worried with other nonprofits that my money will get lost in advertising or paying for overhead and very little of it will do any good. Not so with Big Tree International! No middle-men, just their work to help orphans and churches around the world. Plus, the people that run it are super kind and down-to-earth. The website is organized well, and it's easy to donate. Absolutely love them!
Big Tree International	220176		/users/profile/283804	fullspectrum.tech	Donor	5	10/06/2014	We have supported Big Tree for a few years.  They are amazing people and we just love them, the work they do and their Big Hearts :)I know how much they do, and how they really live what they believe.  It makes a real difference in the lives of the people they touch.  We need more people like this to put their own lives 'on hold', and travel to serve others.So thankful for them.
Big Tree International	220174		/users/profile/283802	Greg53	General Member of the Public	5	10/06/2014	I have known Matt and Hallie Ziebart for years! They are incredibly loving, honest, loyal,  human beings, that live to love and serve! I fully support this organization  and what they do! 
Big Tree International	220173		/users/profile/283801	Rubydia	Donor	5	10/06/2014	I have known the founders of this non-profit for years and they are amazing high-quality people.

Big Tree International	220171	1	/users/profile/283798	Rachel126	Donor	5	10/06/2014	I am constantly impressed by these people! They are highly professional, honest, and have a dedication, that stands the test of time!

Any monies giving to their organization is money truly well spent.
Big Tree International	220169	1	/users/profile/283796	Aurora E.	Donor	5	10/06/2014	The founders of BTI are passionate and diligent in their work. As they serve struggling families, foster children and orphans in China, the needs they seek to meet could easily be daunting and depressing, but BTI always communicates with hope and clarity, joyfully spreading their vision for all Chinese children to enjoy a home with loving parents. They NEVER appeal for support using guilt or pity, but because they have genuine joy in their work and believe in what they are doing, their compassion is contagious.  I always show my children the update letters from Matt and Hallie, and my children were so excited when they got to meet them at a local presentation. As an organization, BTI is mobile, agile, flexible, full of "salt of the earth" kinds of people. They welcome new visionaries and leaders onto the team, and give them great freedom *and* accountability to pursue their area of passion. BTI seems more focused on their growth in impact than financial comfort. They are resourceful and diligent in their use of funds, pushing their resources to do as much good as possible. I am very impressed with BTI's relationships in China and their diligence to build a good reputation with individuals and with the government.  They believe the highest impact for the welfare of Chinese families is equipping native families and communities. It might be easier--and less effective--to set up orphanages and foster homes run by American staff, but the BTI has something much bigger in mind: influencing a culture and a nation to take care of its children. As they put in time to build relationships in China and train Chinese foster parents and adoptive parents, they are building a legacy that, Ibelieve, will span generations.Bravo, BTI!

They are an advocate and a voice for so many precious babies and are there to offer guidance, comfort, and love to parents who might otherwise feel alone and unsure about decisions regarding their and their children's future. I whole-heartedly support Big Tree International and appreciate their candor and reporting on a situation that might otherwise be virtually unknown.

Big Tree International	220119		/users/profile/283744	SBNelson	General Member of the Public	5	10/05/2014	I met Matt and Hallie while they served alongside of me at a different non-profit, it was  where I was first introduced to their genuine care and love for anyone they came in contact with. Being almost fourty years old and working in and with many other non-profits, along with following this one and watching it grow through the years seeing many wonderful results from the dedication invested, I can honestly say they are going the distance and care so much about every life they come in contact with.  Hallie and Matt have spent time meeting with those who have questions and they always go above and beyond by even going as far as asking personal questions back with answers and remedies for those they see are in need spiritually and physically. They have always been folks who will stop what they are doing to be a friend if I've needed and have always remained very transparent while being extremely professional in all that they do. I'm am not one to put any man on a pedistool but I can say my hat goes off to them and they have my utmost respect for all that they do in their personal lives and their professional lives too! Thank you Matt and Hallie for all that you do!

Big Tree International	219999		/users/profile/283623	duck55	Donor	5	10/05/2014	I have known Matthew and Hallie of Bigtree for many years. The integrity they have exibited over the years has never wavered. I know that the support I send will be used as designated every time. Bigtree does the work that I had only dreamed of doing - caring for the hurt and needy people in parts of the world where the need is greatest. Their work with orphans (of which they are adopting one), babies, prenatal training, and families are just a part of what they do. The entire staff is deeply dedicated to the causes they are involved with, not seeing their work as 'just a job'. I have found the transparency of Bigtree to be a pleasant relief, knowing my investment is not wasted. I strongly encourage others to seriously look into supporting Bigtree International.

They are able to  speak with scared, and hurting women who are getting ready to abort their babies, so the babies can have a chance to live. They also work with orphanages, and other organizations to facilitate a healthy woman, and foster loving families in China. The Zieberts don't just do this work, it's their passion. They don't just administrate, they actually live in China to be hands-on. How many other charitable non-profits do you know of where they actually live there!?!?Know that when you get involved with this organization, it is for a wonderful cause, and your dollars are used wisely.

Big Tree International	219183	3	/users/profile/282809	mgrankin1	Donor	5	10/02/2014	My wife and I have know Matt and Hallie (founders of Big Tree International)  for quite some time now.   From day one I knew there was something different about this family. There was a wisdom for overseas community transformation work that I haven't seen before. There was a commitment that went deeper than just the top level of excitement you hear from many young travelers who are going into the non for profit world.  There was also a consistency in their lifestyle and commitment to Jesus that has rarely been duplicated by any others and hasn't waned in them either.  There is a call on this family that cannot be denied.  Just like in parenting, your kids resemble the parents and in business the business looks like the owner.  In the same way there is no doubt that Big Tree international is a top notch non for profit because it resembles the Ziebart family. Your money is wisely invested when you give to Big Tree International and I don't take that lightly. - Mike Rankin

Big Tree International	219159		/users/profile/282778	Susan335	Donor	5	10/02/2014	This is an amazing charity that is focused on helping families in China.  They are selfless servants who are giving their time, energy, love and devotion to helping families achieve new and better goals for themselves and their future.  They are committed on all levels--personally involving themselves in seeing these babies, children, and adults grow and prosper, while also remaining professional and aiding other professionals in their fields of expertise.  They are highly communicative, always working to involve donors and sponsors in current and ongoing projects and making it easy for them to be involved financially and practically.

BTI is only a part of their lives as they serve the people of their community.  They are bringing an awareness to others of how they might help encourage adoption and support for those who have no one else to care for them.   The faithful activity of BTI to help sustain life in  China  will be rewarded, lives will be changes and those who are  helped will be thankful.

Big Tree International	218908	3	/users/profile/282509	joyfulmummy	General Member of the Public	5	10/01/2014	It is has been awesome receiving the in-person and consistent progress updates sharing how BTI is serving people in China, particularly families and their babies with medical needs.  The organization is respectful of the unique Chinese cultural values, providing services, as they are desired.  I think, what I value the most, is the tremendous sensitivity to the unique challenges facing the Chinese people and other people groups around the world and serving them according to their needs.  The BTI leadership focuses on training the people on how to efficiently discover solutions for their situations, rather than just providing supplies needed, thus, equipping them in independence and support.

Big Tree International	218856		/users/profile/282458	mwstonehaven	General Member of the Public	5	10/01/2014	My husband and I have had the privilege of being acquainted with members of the staff of Big Tree International -- namely Matt and Hallie Ziebart -- and have found them to be totally dedicated to the humanitarian efforts of the organization, serving orphans and families in crisis in China, as well as networking with churches around the world. What has impressed us most about the Big Tree International staff is their self-sacrificing, whole-hearted dedication in the face of tremendous hardship. We look forward to their timely e-mail updates which keep us informed, and have found their public presentation (i.e., e-mails, website, etc.) to be highly professional yet personal in communicating the heart of the humanitarian efforts of the organization and accessing involvement of the public. Having recently visited mainland China, we have found this particular non-profit organization to be among the most effective, not only at the grassroots community level, but also in involving awareness and involvement globally. We highly value, recommend, and endorse Big Tree International in their humanitarian vision and action. ~Respectfully, Richard & Marilyn Wheeler

They have set up an organization that is efficient, effective and very open in it's accounting of how money and energy are spent.  Most of all one day there will be young men and women who grew up knowing they were seen as valuable and worth someone's effort because of Big Tree and all the people who work with them.

Big Tree International	218833		/users/profile/282432	jhiramine	Donor	5	10/01/2014	Big Tree International does amazing work in China.  In a nation where value for each and every individual is absent, Big Tree has opened the eyes of everyone they work with to the deep worth of every person, especially those who are yet to be born.  They also have done a wonderful job communicating the value of every child or those children who have been disregarded by society.  They not only communicate their value and importance but they are actively making a difference in this nation.  They are making a difference in the lives of each of these children and changing their future from hopelessness to promise.

I received prompt, gracious replies throughout the process. Not only does Big Tree International do wonderful charity work, they brighten the lives of their donors by choosing excellent support staff.

Big Tree International	218804		/users/profile/282397	Mark_	Donor	4	10/01/2014	To grasp the type of uplifting change that BTI brings to Chinese orphans and families, one needs only to take a look at its founders.  Matt and Hallie are perfect at the helm of BTI, as a passionate, joy-filled pair, whose infectious zest for life is only surpassed by their love for others. It's no wonder that this love extends throughout all they do and has been so effective in bringing true hope to those most desperate.
Big Tree International	218803		/users/profile/282396	mtotheray	General Member of the Public	5	10/01/2014	Big Tree International's commitment to the people they serve goes beyond normal business--they strive to make an impacting difference in lives every single day.

I have been to China and visited an orphenage and I can full appreciate the sacrifical ministry the Ziebarts carry on by the grace of God.

They are doing a lot of good work in China helping a lot of people in need. I always enjoy receiving newsletters and hearing about all the good they do. But they just don't care about the people they are helping but they truly care about the people who are helping them. I gave to one of there needs once and received an email thanking me the next day. I have given to a lot of different organizations before but I have never received a thank you that quick and that personnel. This is truly a great organization and I look forward to going to China and helping them one day.

We enjoy supporting this organization every year, and are glad that we get to help change the lives of children and families around the world who are in need!  The work BTI does and the difference they are making in real peoples' lives is truly phenomenal.  With a small office and many volunteer staff, their overhead expenses are low even though they are helping so many people. My husband and I like that they always make their financial details available so we can see exactly what they are doing. They are committed to transparency, have an experienced board of directors, and send us clear communications/donation receipts. (Unlike some other non-profits that we have experienced.) This is an nonprofit worth supporting!

Their work empowering voices of the immigrant and refugee community is especially important today considering the divided times we live in. Through volunteer advocacy and campaign work at UO I felt like I really made a difference in the community.  As an ally I still consider myself as "outsider"  to immigrant communities but at unite Oregon I felt unequivocally welcomed and appreciated.
Unite Oregon	314285	1	/users/profile/405650	dpacheco	Volunteer	5	10/25/2016	I'm an undergraduate university student completing my senior practicum with Unite Oregon. As my practicum/internship has progressed, I have come to have a better understanding of the importance of the work that Unite Oregon does -- and the amazing, dedicated group of people behind it. Unite Oregon is committed to the communities it works with and for, and highlights intersectionality especially where race, ethnicity, culture, migration story, gender, sexual orientation, and language are concerned. In a time and place where social and political rhetoric perpetuate hate, racial stereotypes, and vilify immigrants and refugees, Unite Oregon has and is carving out an inclusive space where people from many different backgrounds are comfortable coming to and connecting with others, whether that is through established programs like PILOT and BUILD, teach-ins and community events, or simply through stopping by the space. Unite Oregon consists of an inclusive space, staff, volunteer and community base that I feel comfortable engaging with as a queer woman of color navigating academia and the world around me. I have been able to engage in supportive and informative dialogue about the ways that people exist and resist in the personal and political spheres as well as ways to engage in the community/social activism that Unite Oregon supports.

UO understands that when some of us are oppressed, all of us are oppressed; so it works statewide toward dismantling barriers to access for immigrants, refugees, people of color, women, low-income families, rural populations, and other groups that have been pushed aside and disenfranchised for way too long. I am proud and honored to be counted among its members.

Unite Oregon brings together immigrants, refugees, people of color of all nationalities, low-income folks, and rural communities in a way which breaks down barriers and builds power in communities. And they leverage that power to effect systemic change - that's the dream for so many organizations, and Unite Oregon is one of the few living it.

Unite Oregon	267543	1	/users/profile/356275	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/27/2015	I started working at CIO in July as an intern for my graduate program.  I instantly felt welcomed and like a valuable member of their team.  CIO is a an amazing social justice organization, and this is evident in the work they do and their methods for doing the work.   CIO's commitment to social justice is reflected in their relationships with one another, their community members, and their community partners.  They are quick to help each other with whatever is needed, even when it is not their project.  They have authentic relationships with their community partners, and because of these relationships, they are able to advocate for a broad range of issues that impact communities outside of the immigrant and refugee communities, without over stretching their capacity.   I have met a dozen or more graduates of CIO'S leadership development program, PILOT, who are still actively engaged with the organization in meaningful ways.  Some are now staff  and members of their Board of Directors. I have worked at CIO for four months, and it is a rich  and supportive learning environment.  I am already incorporating what I have learned into my work outside of this internship.    
Unite Oregon	266299	2	/users/profile/355071	Writer	Client Served	5	10/22/2015	Hello everyone, I was a participant in the  PILOT Program  with the Center for Intercultural Organizing (CIO). I enjoyed every moment spent participating in the PILOT Program. It was interesting how participants came from diverse backgrounds to learn and share experiences. Taking part in this program gave me an opportunity to be among a diverse group since I immigrated to the United States. It is amazing to learn about different cultures and to find out that though we come from different backgrounds, we all have something in common. I enjoyed the blend of the activities during our PILOT Retreat; learning , playing and resting. I learn about my community - Oregon from the questions and answers. I was able to demonstrate my talents and share my experiences in life. We also had amazing CIO staff  and one more thing was the great powerhouse provided to us.  Indeed, it was an awesome experience.
Unite Oregon	265270	1	/users/profile/354020	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/19/2015	We have worked with the Center for Intercultural Organizing on many projects over the last two years.  In our work together, CIO has helped us to strengthen our community work by giving us an avenue to involve our members in work that is a priority for the union and CIO.  Such projects have included community forums, joint legislative work, and coalitions to pressure employers to hire more people of color in our union represented positions.  
Unite Oregon	264716	1	/users/profile/353438	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	10/16/2015	My name is Felicia Bechtoldt and I am from Moldova. When I moved to the U.S. in 2014, I was looking for leadership programs where I could apply as a non-U.S. citizen. When I found out about Pan-Immigrant Leadership Training  and Organizing Program (PILOT) organized by the Center for Intercultural Organizing and its eligibility criteria, I immediately applied. PILOT is one of the fewest programs in the state, which focuses on enhancing leadership and advocacy skills of migrants, refugees and asylees. My PILOT and CIO experience has been great so far and recommend anyone to join the organization and apply for the program.

Unite Oregon	263545	1	/users/profile/352250	Darlene31	General Member of the Public	5	10/13/2015	The mission statement of CIO is a profound, visionary statement that speaks to the heart of the work they do:  "Led by people of color, immigrants and refugees, rural communities, and people experiencing poverty, we work across Oregon to build a unified intercultural movement for justice."  CIO organizes and empowers people who are traditionally excluded from power--immigrants and refugees, people of color, rural and working poor Oregonians--through leadership development, advocacy training, policy work at the local, state, and federal level.  CIO believes in creating welcoming, inclusive spaces that make room for all people to be their full, authentic selves and you only have to walk through the door of one of their local offices in Portland, Beaverton or Rogue Valley to see that they put that belief into action.  Every person is treated with dignity and respect and as a valuable contributor to the community and to society.  CIO gives me the opportunity to live out my values in a meaningful way and I am grateful for the intercultural movement they are building in Oregon.
Unite Oregon	263438	1	/users/profile/352142	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/13/2015	As a refugee, I came to Portland on August 2012 knowing nothing about the city that I suppose to be my new home. One time I went with a friend to a meeting for refugees in Beaverton and I first heard the word CIO. I asked what does CIO stand for and after I knew it, I became familiar with it. I attended several meetings representing the Iraqi Society which I volunteered to work with refugees. Then I got the lit to light the candle that brightened me and led me to get the CIO Pilot Training. Then I got promoted in my society as a community leader. I learned how the institutions work and how bills can be done, what are our rights, Portland and its Counties.etc.  The trainees form a diverse society whom became my friends. We had spent joyful days that I still remember. So I am grateful to CIO. Muwafaq Alkattan

Unite Oregon	262626		/users/profile/289365	ambitiousX	Volunteer	5	10/09/2015	CIO is one of, if not, the best organization of its kind I have participated in. I was at some of the retreats and workshops they organized, and what I learned during these programs was immense, and whose relevance could not be overemphasized. Numerous times during these, and other programs, I found myself feeling amazed, pleasantly surprised,  and sometimes struck with outright astonishment at the information I was absorbing, all of which laid just how ignorant I was regarding things that really matter to me and the community at large. I came out of these programs greatly informed, empowered, equipped with great motivation to better myself,  and to be actively involved in improving the conditions in my community. Thank you CIO, and I hope you long remain within the community and continue doing what you are doing.
Unite Oregon	225597		/users/profile/289365	ambitiousX	Volunteer	5	10/23/2014	Going into the PILOT program, I did not quite know what to expect. However, I can confidently and enthusiastically say that I am extremely glad I was allowed to join. It was very eye-opening indeed, and I learned things that I had never known before. The program made me feel a lot more confident than I ever was before, it made me feel empowered with information I never knew before, which in turn further helped enhance my understanding of why things are the way they are, and gave me tools and advice on how I can  actively participate and contribute in effecting the positive and needful changes in our social system that it advocates. If I had ever entertained the desire to be a human rights activist, a social justice advocate, or the desire to to follow and engage in the political discourse, but that such desire had become dormant and on the brink of lapsing into passivity due to inactivity, participation in the CIO PILOT program has certainly reawakened it. The staff was remarkable, with an infectious sense of enthusiasm and commitment to what matters to all of us the most. I came out of the program feeling invigorated, and I wish these programs would be conducted more often and made more accessible to larger audiences.

Their breadth is very wide across communities of color, especially immigrant and refugee communities and is evident at any of the events they host. The relevancy and urgency of their mission is strong and their ability to bring communities together impressive. This is a truly unique organization, one that is a consistent leader and stands in solidarity with others on priority issues for the community.

For the CIO, its not about services, although they do advocate for individuals. The goal is to help New Americans fully participate in their new country. CIO helps people become citizens but also trains them in how to become fully active in their community, learning how to volunteer on citizen advisory committees, on political campaigns and with other local community organizations. Well run, respectful. I joined the Board so I could learn from their smart and thoughtful approach.

Resilient Connections is one of CIO's newest programs that serves as a support group for Queer/Trans Refugees and Immigrants. CIO is modeling for other refugee organizations of the NW and even some of its immigrant rights organizations with beginning stages of Queer Liberation. The Center, including Staff, Board and family- is genuinely contributing to the empowerment and leadership development of its constituents with a post-modern multicultural lens. 
Unite Oregon	225651		/users/profile/289416	AvilaKarina	Volunteer	5	10/23/2014	The Center for Intercultural Organizing (CIO) is an important nonprofit program for the City of Portland.

It gives the tools for the voiceless to be heard and bring important issues that goes on within our community that at times our local, state, and federal government may not know. The staff is amazing and passionate about the community. And I cannot wait to see how CIO transforms the City of Portland in the future. 
Unite Oregon	225563	1	/users/profile/289330	darlenehuntress	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/23/2014	CIO is one of the most important social justice organizations in Oregon, and the only one that serves the immigrant and refugee communities well beyond the city limits of Portland.  Their commitment to creating an organization that empowers and develops the communties they serve plays a critical role in our state.  Their PILOT program alone should be replicated across the country.  CIO continues to be a leader in Oregon through their civic engagement, leadership development, public policy advocacy and grassroots organizing.  Whether the issue is to end profiling, address health disparities,  ensure fair housing, or the myriad of other great social justice advocacy work they do, CIO is advancing a platform that every day makes Oregon a more equitable and just state.

Unite Oregon	177533	1	/users/profile/234097	digitideva	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/14/2013	I have been watching and witnessing the birth, growth and important anchoring leadership of Center for Intercultural Organizing (CIO), not only in specific immigrant communities, but in the larger communities of Portland and Oregon.  The organization's careful and deliberate work has ensured that the voices of immigrants were heard at all levels of government, within social services settings, and in the places that policy and procedures are developed.  They bring a strong, unified and powerful voice for immigrant communities and, as a result, we are all better informed and able to understand the plight of immigrants from all countries.  CIO does not stop with only raising the issues of inequality, lack of cultural competence among providers, or what's lacking, they bring trained and skilled constituents with skills, abilities, talents and dreams, as newly-arrived residents of our city, counties, and state, who have much to contribute to the larger community. CIO has made its compelling presence known through the state, has been particularly adept at moving their leadership effectively in a number of circles, local government, at the city and county level, and in working collaboratively to achieve major successes in our Legislature.   CIO has also ensure that its membership is diverse and representative of immigrant communities in ways that heretofore have not proven successful.   The organization's model encourages members to come together regularly, to develop their strengths, and cultivates diverse leadership that pushes other organizations to recognize the power and benefit of more diverse representation on issues that affect all of us - whether housing affordability and quality, school improvements and teacher humility and cultural competence. CIO doesn't preach, it shows the stories of individual lives before us, and allows communities within its organization to hold their uniqueness whiile working for collective benefit. CIO is a strategic, well focused organization that has strong leadership connections and credible relationships throughout the larger community, starting with its constituentis.  This is an effective and important point to ensure effective organizing and mobilizing among members and to engage supporters in solidarity ith them - on immigration reform, school reform and quality education for all, housing, health issues, economic opportunity and equity, among others. It has been my pleasure to watch them grow while staying rooted to their original principles of equal access, justice, diversity and equity to the immigrant voices that emerge in their own organization as well as with those they interact with.   CIO is one of the best examples of a grassroots organization that has not forgotten its roots, but has built the core components needed for long-term success: bringing leadership up from within, setting a vision and mission and not wavering, having enviable results that bring real return on investment, and increasing the diversity of voices that speak in Oregon, and for all of us. It has been and continues to be my pleasure, as a funder, a community resident and as a social justice leader to wholeheartedly support CIO; one of the best at doing what they do and delivering real change for their communities and mine.

Unite Oregon	174892		/users/profile/231191	irinakarin	General Member of the Public	5	10/07/2013	I witnessed the development of the Center for Intercultural Organizing from seed to the thriving organization it is today. I myself am an immigrant and the challenges facing this population are close to my heart. The sense of loneliness, isolation and discouragement are real. There are very few venues for the immigrant and refugee to deal with the confusion and anxiety created by the clash with a foreign culture. CIO offers a space where multilingual and multicultural people are learning and engaging in their communal challenges. CIO believes that the people most affected by an issue should be the individuals and communities leading and advocating for solutions. CIO is the catalyst of changes for these individuals from helplessness and confusion to integration and leadership in the struggle for social economic justice.

Unite Oregon	173782		/users/profile/229932	Karin8	Donor	5	10/04/2013	Review by Tom Potter:The Center for Intercultural Organizing has been providing services to Oregon's refugees, immigrants and communities of color for the last ten years. Their strength lies in bringing together different communities and providing them with the tools to expand their internal leadership, build community capacity, and influence public policies that effect their communities.As Mayor of Portland from 2005-2009,  I had the opportunity to work with the CIO and watch them interact with Portland's various communities to empower and engage them in making government work for them. Their efforts have made the Portland Metro area and our state of Oregon a better place for everyone, especially our recent arrivals and the communities of color. These groups have not always been part of the governance process and it is heart-warming to see the transition with individuals who were formerly afraid of government to come forward and work with government to improve the lives of their families and communities.  
Unite Oregon	173775		/users/profile/229925	Amalia d.	Donor	5	10/04/2013	The Center for Intercultural Organizing (CIO) builds capacity within immigrant and refugee communities so that they may begin to get involved in the civic life of our City.  This involvement connects the new-comer to her/his new home and helps to create a feeling of belonging, reducing isolation.  It also brings new, creative voices to local government processes resulting in sounder investments and better outcomes for all.  CIO does a fantastic job of this with very limited resources.  Portland is a much better City for the work of CIO and the involvement of the community leaders it supports!
Unite Oregon	173606		/users/profile/229751	Cristina Palacios	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/04/2013	CIO president and staff go beyond just meeting people; they learn their story, connect and support them in anyway they can.  As an organizer I try to net work with as many organizations as I can to make sure people are getting help when they needed. Net working with CIO is one of the best rewards I have as an organizer. CIO made me realized that when you see and treat people as your own family member regardless their immigration status, religion or the Country they come from is when you really start building real communities.  CIO really believes and works to make sure Justice is for all! 
Unite Oregon	173603		/users/profile/229748	olimpiatrusty	General Member of the Public	5	10/04/2013	CIO is an organization filled with people who wear hearts on their sleeves. Everyone I had a pleasure to meet, is commited to serve and help where the help is needed most, actively looking for creative ways and programs to make the most impact. CIO provides immigrants and refugees with necessary tools to make significant changes in their lives but it also emphasizes the great role we play in receiving them in our communities.
Unite Oregon	173589		/users/profile/229735	diana50	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/04/2013	The Center for Intercultural Organizing is among the leading edge of organizations in Portland, Oregon, doing multiracial, multiethnic, multilingual organizing that incorporates cultural work and creative expression with the hard-nosed strategic thinking to raise the power of immigrant and refugee voices for racial and economic justice. I LOVE CIO!
Unite Oregon	173557		/users/profile/229704	Patrick35	Volunteer	4	10/04/2013	CIO is an amazing Non-profit. They make leaders out of everyone; people of different races, sexual orientation, beliefs, backgrounds and many others. These communities are the ones that I can call Centre for Intercultural Organizing because power is so completely handed over to the people. I have communities standing up and working with the Counties, City Councils and others just to see to it there is human dignity in development around Oregon. Their members are all-over working hard to bring change to society and thanks to their capacity building approach which exposes communities to leadership and advocating. My organisation will implement their leadership approach in my country, Malawi (in Southern Africa) when I return in December this year.

Unite Oregon	118228		/users/profile/160813	Reyna L.	General Member of the Public	5	07/12/2012	CIO is one of the most awesome organization in the NW. The mission is about intercultural organizing. Something that is unique within itself. They bring together immigrant and refugee communities to empower them, give them a voice in their community, and develop as leaders. On top of that, they have the most dedicated staff. 
Unite Oregon	118490		/users/profile/161152	reedguarnero2	Board Member	5	07/16/2012	The Center for Intercultural Organizing (CIO) is an amazing organization that touches the lives of immigrants and refugees. The close-knit intercultural relationships created and fostered through this organization by bringing together so many different cultures (many with long-time historical conflicts) are creating long-term change locally and state-wide; creating a positive ripple effect for American born residents, and maybe even worldwide. According to the National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy, every dollar invested in CIO's advocacy, organizing and civic engagement garnered $150 in benefits for their communities.

CIO had reached out to all the IR communities to invite them to the Beaverton CIty Hall, in order to build a strong representation for IR and people of color in civic life in the City. Now in Beaverton there are IR leaders that are parts of boards and commissions because of the training and the advocacy work that CIO had done to engage the IR leaders . I'm honored that to be a part of such and organization that not only work with the communities for building capacity. But the policy work on state, Counties and Cities level to review and recommend inclusive policies for all Oregonians in Oregon.
Unite Oregon	118402		/users/profile/161045	Kayse	Advisor	5	07/14/2012	As an original co-founder of the Center for Intercultural Organizing in 2003, I can attest to its ability to make a significant contribution to the lives of immigrants, refugees, people of color, and Oregonians over time. Its leadership development program, policy advocacy campaigns, educational forums, and community organizing and mobilization efforts have increased the visibility of newcomers to the Northwest and made real strides toward equity for newcomer communities. I invite all immigrants, refugees, people of color and allies to join this important movement for justice.

I have been apart of so many projects and feel like I've really done good. I have helped raise money and awareness for projects that are important, I have done bill research, I have registered voters, and I have organized events. All of it was a pleasure to do, and I felt that I was making a real difference. It doesn't take long to see how hard everyone there works, and how much they all care. Everyone who is there genuinely wants to be there. The whole environnent is one of productivity, creativity, and friendship.

I am amazed at CIO's connectivity to the immigrant and refugee population in Portland, as well as its connections to other social justice organizations in the area.

Unite Oregon	118197		/users/profile/160772	Sara38	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/12/2012	Since August 2008, I have been committed to working for the Latino community in Multnomah County. I feel that I am a professional advocate for my clients and I am able to understand their needs and struggles as they try to raise their children well. I often empathize with their young daughters as we share in feelings of vulnerability often experienced by young women, particularly during puberty, adolescence, and youth. I believe it is very important to help create connections between parents and their children so that parents can understand and help their sons and daughters. For me, the most important part of my work is supporting parents as they help their children achieve success despite the many obstacles they face. 	I also identify as a student, and I always will because I believe that knowledge is what makes us who we are and what helps us succeed in the workplace. Through continued education and professional research, we can help one another reach our goals and objectives. I believe it is very important to share my knowledge when clients ask me something because it is never too late to learn. I invite them to share their knowledge with me as classmates. 	I also identify as a teacher, particularly when teaching my clients new life skills. I love my work because my clients not only receive information, but learn different ways to use educational tools. Over time, these skills will help them in various situations so that they are able to take advantage of opportunities and be successful academically and professionally in our competitive society. It is important for me to remember the importance of education, which helps us achieve our goals. 	As a parent and social worker, my goal is to help, advocate for, and educate our Latino community; in addition, I offer them a number of tools that they can use as they navigate the American education system. Working toward improvement for my clients and engaging our community is of the utmost importance to me in my career. We search for and find leaders that actively work to be present in our schools as volunteers, doing whatever is requested of them to better serve our community.My work is greatly enriched by the simple fact that I work with the Latino community. I work hard to make a big impact within our society and offer intellectual, emotional, and psychological support in the workshops I lead. It is important that parents and students truly grasp the concepts we discuss so they can practice them in their daily interactions. One of my favorite phrases is Querer es Poder, which means desire is power. I have implemented this philosophy into my everyday life and I believe that if you want something, you can look for ways to achieve your goals in ways that are not harmful but rather build up others. I am on a mission to seek paths of success for my clients. I trust myself and my internal compass, express my feelings, and continue to seek help and knowledge to realize my own goals. I continue to desire and fight for the success of myself and others.  Sara V. Garcia Gonzalez

The Center for Intercultural Organizing is a place where people who have left their home country feel at home. This organization puts every dollar it gets to help the community it represents and its partners. It has been in the forefront in getting the immigrant and refugee community visible and involved in the greater community. Unlike most organization in this field CIO doesn't represent one ethnic group, it represents every immigrant/refugee. It helps those who comes in and who need it. CIO also doesn't pay a whole lot to overhead like some other organizations. So a donation to them really goes to help the community that often goes unrepresented and silenced. 
Unite Oregon	93974		/users/profile/108452	Ann C.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/17/2011	CIO advocates powerfully and effectively for communities of color in Oregon. It has been very effective in bringing the needs of people forward in Beaverton - which has continued a discourse of tokenistic and paternal responses to issues of institutional racis. A powerful, accountable and poignant voice for a wide array of community members.
Unite Oregon	93912		/users/profile/108344	People-Places-Things	Professional with expertise in this field	4	07/15/2011	The Center for Intercultural Organizing is the only group I know that is consciously working for the integration of all ethnic diversity in the community. It provides a model of what an inclusive society looks like when diversity takes the lead.   There are many organizations that seek to "help" various groups assimilate and integrate on the terms of the mainstream society - and there are organizations who help newcomers, whatever their background, to get settled in their new home.  But CIO is the one that's trying to actually break down the civic barriers that exist so we can all be in the same room together - without diluting our identities. I've been trying to work with CIO since the director and his wife founded the Community Language and Culture Bank in the early part of this century. Their multicultural festival in the park to reframe the dialogue after Sept 11 was a major achievement.  Over the years, we have had cause to come together, and I anticipate, with my organization People-Places-Things to work with them by doing direct service organizing.
Unite Oregon	93882		/users/profile/108284	StevieS	Donor	5	07/14/2011	This nonprofit started with an idea after 9/11.  How do immigrants integrate into our community for the positive.   I have watched CIO mature into a wonderful organization for immigrants, helping them to become confident, needed, and understood.   It gives them a place where they can feel welcomed, helped, and gives them the confidence and training to go out into their communities to serve others.   It is quite a unique organization.  It is one that I can totally support.

In the CIO, I found the training that has helped me not only help my community but connect to leaders of other immigrant and refugee communities and also people of color in the United States. The skills I learned are so valuable, but the relationships are even more. Thank you, CIO!
Unite Oregon	82597		/users/profile/91153	Rachel	Volunteer	5	03/18/2011	As a person who believes in a multicultural society that benefits and includes all, I have found the Center for Intercultural Organizing to be a place where I can act on that belief. As a US-born American, I feel it is my job to help welcome the newcomers to the United States by ensuring our laws, policies and community are fair and just. The CIO gives allies like me ways in which we can be effective in advocating for justice. Through trainings like Refugee and Immigrant Solidarity Education (RISE), I learned the issues and challenges immigrants face and was able to put this information into change through activites at CIO. I recommend everyone in Oregon who cares about racial equity and immigrant rights to join this organization!
Unite Oregon	80361		/users/profile/87726	Alfred D.	Volunteer	5	02/28/2011	I love this place , the CIO.

People who volunteer for CIO are sincerely trying to make the world a better place.
Unite Oregon	80317		/users/profile/87677	Goldann	Volunteer	5	02/28/2011	I have been looking for a place like CIO for a long time. Having grown up in Portland, and attending a predominantly White, Middle Class college in Portland, as a person of color, I began to feel a bit isolated. This is the first time that I have felt comfortable with my ethnicity in my work environment. CIO does a great job at including and appreciating all of its volunteers, I truly feel like this is a second home. CIO works hard to represent and advocate for immigrant and refugees, who are often taken advantage of marginalized in our society. Each and every member of CIO is welcomed as extended family!
Unite Oregon	80197		/users/profile/87557	Grassia M.

I greatly believe in the work that CIO does and I know how hard the staff and volunteers work to ensure community progress. CIO empowers people and creates future leaders.
Unite Oregon	80127		/users/profile/87487	Anna G.	Board Member	5	02/28/2011	My name is Anna, and I have been involved with the Center for Intercultural Organizing for 10 year.  I arrived to Portland, OR over 10 years ago from Poland to participate in an exchange program.  I always had a strong desire to help immigrants and refugees.  I was very fortunate to meet two community organizers Kayse Jama and Stephanie Stephens.  At that time, I offered to help them at the small office in Portland.  I was amazed to find a circle of new friends who became my new family.  I was glad to help them to organize the 1st Global Portland Festival, which happened on the first anniversary of September 11th.  Our mission was to bring people together and support each other in this hard time.  After the first few years of their work, CIO changed their focus towards building power in immigrant and refugee communities through many different fields: education, civic engagement, leadership, and so on.  It was a pleasure to see them grow.  I attended Portland State University and received a degree in International Studies.  Then I participated in the short faculty led program to Cyprus where I learned about the history of Cyprus.  That experience allowed me to realize that I should pursue my master's degree in International Conflict Resolution and help others.  Even though, I had a lot of going on, I always new that CIO advocates for the rights of innocent people, and I always found my way back to CIO.  If you are an immigrant or refugee, you need to have a place like CIO that always has it's door open for people, for an advise, for comfort.  They represent all people no matter what their socio-economical status is.  They build bridges between communities by educating young community leaders through the program called Portland Immigrant and Refugee Leadership Program (PILOT).  I never had an experience such as this.  I met a lot of wonderful young people with a lot of potential who are, in the future, going to make a difference.  We went through the leadership training that allowed us to learn about basics of city government, introduction of community organizing, politics of oppression, issue and campaign planning, cross-cultural community movement building, conflict resolution, and media strategy.  The trainers encouraged us to go back to our respected communities and become engaged, to have an impact, to make a difference.  This leadership program gave us "wings."  It allows us to connect and learn about other communities.  CIO organizes a lot of wonderful events that empower men and women from difference cultural, ethnic, and religious backgrounds.  They provide many workshops.  They have a Media Project that trains community members on how to use media to serve the community.  There are many goals that CIO has that focus on supporting people by educating them, providing civic engagement, community organizing, mobilization, leadership, and help with immigration issues.  At this moment, I am on the board of directors, and I am really proud to be part of their mission.  I am amazed by their ability to stand for ALL.  It is the only non profit that serves in such a huge capacity.  And, we all have to work together to build one safe community for our children and for the future.

Unite Oregon	78979		/users/profile/86278	Marj	Volunteer	5	02/27/2011	The breadth of their work, from legislative action to leadership training to education to building social movements to fun community events, illustrates the organization's stragegic, cooperative approach to creating change. I don't know of another group that is able to organize a variety of communities so effectively on a range of fronts, both local and far-reaching. While many immigrant and refugee organizations focus on advocacy and serve primarily one population, C.I.O.'s diversity speaks to its focus on real unity and empowerment.
Unite Oregon	78722		/users/profile/86007	afifa.as	Board Member	5	02/27/2011	As the first person born in my family to immigrants from India, my experience in the United States has always had the feel of being an outsider.  Watching my parents and all of my relatives navigate a new culture, political system, educational system - a place where our skin color, accent, religion was not always welcome and where our voices did not count as much as the rest.  CIO has been a homecoming - a place where we reclaim our dignity by having our voices heard, by working for our rights, and by coming together as a community of people from all over the world, yet with similar challenges, we find that we are stronger together.

Unite Oregon	77630		/users/profile/84882	baher	Board Member	5	02/26/2011	 If one came to America as a refugee in 2007, when, how, and why can he become a member of Board of Directors in the Center for Intercultural Organizing (CIO)? The minimum time, I guess, would take 3 years as it happened with me, and for how, it is as simple as one is invited to apply for the Board membership, and he is there in the Board.  But it is all about the (why). Why one would become a member of CIO in three months after his arrival to America? Why three years to join the Board? Why is it CIO in the first place? The answers are simple, once you get to meet Kayse who will come instantly to meet you when Lisa tells him about the active newcomer, you will be embraced with warm hearted welcoming, unconditional acceptance and recognition, and your heart and mind will recognize this sincerity. Then Kayse, Stephanie, and Lisa (leaders of CIO) will show you the way to community activism, and as a new comer to America (AKA refugees and immigrants) who wants to be equal to other citizens of America and did his own research, you will choose to join the organization that has a holistic vision and approach, sincere to its mission to defend the rights of all newcomers.   CIO will teach you the lesson of American Democracy (People can decide their future) through involvement with allies, community activists and organizations, and that is year one. Then CIO will give you the training of (PILOT) to be a community leader and how to engage in the Democratic system. In Pilot you will meet other CIO leaders, CIO staff, and community activists who share with you your values and enthusiasm, and you all become one family, so you get the warm human relations, share the experiences with each other, and that is year two. And once you are in the community, doing your homework with all the seriousness that reflect how serious you were trained, and practicing what you learn, receiving the continued unconditional support and backup of CIO leaders and staff, I guess the time comes when you are invited in year three to join the Board.   In CIO I restored the status that I lost when I left my country, I was recognized again and I restarted my new life as a member in my new home. Immigration is an American experience, America now is moving to a multicultural community in the global world of the 21st century, and this is exactly what we do at CIO, bridging between old and new immigrants, and building the new multicultural America.
Unite Oregon	72157		/users/profile/78898	antoshik2030	Volunteer	5	02/21/2011	As I near graduation from CIO's Pan-Immigrant Leadership and Organizing Training , I can see how much work the Center of Intercultural Organizing is putting in its effort to better our multicultural community by spreading the awareness of cultural diversity and different obstacles that the immigrants and refugees face in this country, but, more importantly, in educating and empowering immigrants to be active community  leaders and understanding their roles as equally valued community members. The PILOT program is one example of CIO's long-term vision of identifying and developing future immigrant leaders who can organize and increase community participation on the issues that affect them.I would highly recommend the CIO to anyone who wants to be support and  build a better community for everyone.
Unite Oregon	70789		/users/profile/77385	Nqobile	Volunteer	5	02/18/2011	As an immigrant myself, I have always thought when you come from another country, it is ok to be "othered" since this is not your land of birth. Through the Leadership training provided to me by CIO, I have learned that not only is not ok to accept this, but I also have to speak out against it. For every time I accept it, there's many, many immigrants out there who experience it and won't ever be able to speak out.Although CIO is made up of being who come from different parts of the world, we have a common thread of having experienced social injustice ourselves or through family and friends. CIO has helped me realize that I need to be the change I wish to see around me. I may be just a tiny spark, but it takes a spark to get a fire going and pretty soon, all those around us can warm up in its glowing as we used to sing in Africa!!
Unite Oregon	68563		/users/profile/74897	Jane A.	Client Served	5	02/15/2011	in the years I worked as a policy director and education strategy coordinator for then  Portland City Commissioner and now Mayor, our work with CIO not only helped inform us on an array of concerns, we worked together to solve community problems. We turned to CIO to bring together representatives from many communities too often not "at the table" to make decisions and develop policies to ensure we all work  together.  They are a very effective organization with strong and wise leadership.  I greatly respect the work of CIO.  They are continuing to build relationships which ensure that including underrepresented communities becomes the norm.  The issues I worked most directly with CIO on regarded public safety and planning issues.  Their participation and contributions were invaluable. 
Unite Oregon	68546		/users/profile/74887	Aphisith V.	Volunteer	3	02/15/2011	As a CIO volunteer, I participated to help bring the people of refugee's together because when I was there I felt that no one had a sense of working together and to be leaders..., there was a question given to everyone individually and everyone seem to have a desire to help their own ethnic background or for their own needs and I was the only one that thought that everyone needs to work as a team and help each other because that is what I learn during my childhood days and in school!!! Also my brother (SV) and I also worked with people from a diverse background to using the camera production equipment for CIO members to learn from the studio time.  I had a fun time working with people from all types; in-order to do a project it takes a lot of time and a group of people to get things done!!! I also enjoy what other cultures had to share whether it was food or stories from their cultures to jokes!!! I would encourage people from all walks of life to join or participate because they will have the tools ready to help you especially if you are a refugee or immigrant that just arrived here in the United States.  This is a place where you can learn about other ethnic backgrounds and get information for any question one might have or needs help with in life and support.  CIO can be a place to help make dreams or visions to come alive!

Having participated in other immigrant organizations before, CIO engaged me in community work in a different way. Most organizations I had participated with before have a reactive approach to meet their goals; CIO,in turn, has a proactive approach to making systemic change in favor of a more just and equitable society from the bottom up... 
Unite Oregon	67214		/users/profile/73461	reedguarnero	Board Member	5	02/12/2011	This organization literally changed my life. Before my involvement with The Center for Intercultural Organizing (CIO), I had been in the United States for almost 50 years and never felt like I belonged here. My previous attempts to get involved in civic life were met with being shut down, feeling isolated and ignored; no matter what I tried, I essentially came away with either no influence, or feeling invisible. So I stopped trying and continued to feel like I had no voice in this city or state, let alone America.  But then I was fortunate in being chosen to participate in the leadership program for first generation immigrants & refugees (Pan-Immigrant Leadership & Organizing Training or PILOT). Through this program, I learned the basics of how our city government worked, skills for effective public speaking and organizing, and so, so much more! Through this program, I found my voice and learned how to affect change. Before my year of PILOT training ended, I finally started growing roots in this country and was empowered to create change for the better in my community. Now I am board member for this incredible organization that has touched so many lives in a very positive way.
Unite Oregon	65785		/users/profile/71910	bazara	Volunteer	5	02/09/2011	I started volunteering with CIO in 2004 because I was impressed by the passion and intellect of the director and his small but committed staff. I am so proud to say I have been such a long-time volunteer and have had the privilege to watch this member-driven organization blossom from a heartfelt set of ideas to a widely and highly respected and influential organization in Portland. City leaders have been wise to take notice of the effective grassroots organizing accomplished by CIO, and the accolades various members have received for their community leadership and have been well-earned. Many thanks to CIO for helping to nurture and create leaders among the many ethnic groups in Portland, and most especially for empowering the everyday people to believe in themselves and take action for the causes they believe in. Thank you so much CIO!!

Unite Oregon	65264		/users/profile/71338	HJSW	Volunteer	5	02/08/2011	I've been involved with CIO for about three years as a volunteer. One thing I love about CIO is that is brings together immigrants from various communities to work for their common interests.  It also educates the wider community on the realities of immigrant life and struggles.   CIO is a place where people can feel comfortable sharing their stories and work together to create a civic environment that is inclusive and empowering.

Unite Oregon	65072		/users/profile/71135	grammarphile	Volunteer	5	02/08/2011	As a proud member of the Center for Intercultural Organizing, I can attest to the many ways in which this organization not only empowers immigrants and refugees but also allies in the struggle for social justice. As a member-run organization, CIO is composed of and powered by ordinary folks. CIO members come from diverse cultural, ethnic, economic, and religious backgrounds. They are immigrants, refugees, U.S.-born citizens, workers, students, asylees, moms, dads, grandparents and, most importantly, allies in the struggle for social justice. Our members share a common belief in a multi-racial, multicultural democracy inclusive of alland the passion to put their beliefs into action. As an ally member, I have learned in depth about the struggles immigrants and refugees face, and how to put that knowledge to work. I have attended leadership trainings, advocacy days at the municipal and state level, and really feel my participation has made a difference.
Unite Oregon	63922		/users/profile/69880	anya valsamakis	Board Member	5	02/06/2011	Hi, I'm Anya Valsamakis, CIO board member for five plus years. Why do I volunteer? My parents were very newly  emmigrated  from Russia to the US, when I was born. Though you would never know it if you met me (probably),  finding my between-cultures identity was painful. I became a social worker and for years worked with refugee and immigrant families, developing programs and helping find jobs.  Though social services are very important in the early resettlement years, what immigrants need for the long term is civic education, a voice here, and to have their very great contibutions seen and counted. CIO is a vibrant, flexible organization, driven by values of equity and social justice.  We believe that a, " diverse, grassroots, multiracial, multicul;tural movement of immigrants and refugees"can help make Portland a better place to live and  serve as a model of unity for the rest of the country. I love being part of CIO, find my community service gives back over and over. One example why I find it meaningful: at our last board meeting about 40 Somali youth came to CIO for their own organizing meeting, to launch their own youth centered non-profit. Seeing their faces and hearing their excited voices, switching between Somali and English, I felt tremendous pride that CIO empowers   people to engage in this great country that belongs to all of us.

It was first introduced to me by my CF Center and Ive been a subscriber ever since. Each issue is eagerly anticipated.  Upon its receipt, it is immediately skimmed.  Then, during the next two weeks it is read in detail.    While almost all of each issue is of interest, I especially like the regular Ask The Attorney, Speeding Past 50, and Information From The Internet articles.   As a 73 year old with CF, seeing the increasing ages of people in the "Milestones" section has been very encouraging.

Even before she started writing for the CF Roundtable, I was reading all the great articles these courageous people write.  This publication is not only good for people with the disease, but it is good for caretakers and others who would like to learn more about what a CF patient goes through each and every day.  Hearing these stories are very heartwarming often funny and great to hear from these brave people.  My daughter and the rest of the writers express themselves with such courage and wit.  If you have never read any of these stories, I thoroughly recommend getting the issues to see what these CF'ers have to say.  It nice to know that these stories of their life is so very helpful to others.  I can't wait to hear more stories with happy endings!

Client Served	5	10/14/2014	My son has Cystic Fibrosis and the CF Round table newsletter keeps us informed on anything new happening with all research and any new medications. It also has many articles about people living with CF and how they deal with many issues from insurance,mental health,hospitalization just to name a few. I highly recommend this non profit.
USACFA, publishers of CF Roundtable	221605	1	/users/profile/285294	Paul142	Board Member	5	10/10/2014	I have been a USACFA board member since 2001, and have written at least a dozen articles from 1997 through last year in CF Roundtable. The reason this organization was formed was for support of adults with CF. When it first started, only about 30 percent of CF patients were considered adults(over 18), and now the number is closer to 51%. This certainly cannot be contributed to CF Roundtable, but it is great to know that over half the CF population has this newsletter as a resource for them. I have personally learned much from this newsletter, and found many new faces and friends in the national CF community. They continue to be resources for me, and I will continue to support USACFA for as long as I am able.
USACFA, publishers of CF Roundtable	219042	1	/users/profile/207679	Andreaeyes	Volunteer	5	10/01/2014	CF Roundtable has always been a strong support mechanism for me. It allows me to see what others in the CF community experience in good times and bad. I usually read the newsletter cover to cover and learn new things from what others do. CF Roundtable is also a good resource for new therapies in the pipeline as well as ideas in dealing with CF.
USACFA, publishers of CF Roundtable	156577		/users/profile/207679	Andreaeyes	Volunteer	5	04/28/2013	When I first heard about this newsletter 20 years ago, I had been looking for support and finding none. When I got my first issue of Cf Roundtable, I felt connected and less isolated. I usually read the newsletter cover to cover and sometimes a couple of times while waiting for the next issue. It gave me hope to read of others who were living longer and healthier lives with CF. It also allowed me to see how others with the same disease coped with their various trials and tribulations. I could relate to these people who wrote articles and became familiar with those who wrote often.It is 20 years later and I find myself volunteering for the newsletter and still enjoy the articles from those who share their stories to offer support to alert others to a certain situation that can occur, for instance, after lung transplant or with CF-related diabetes or chronic prednisone use.  I still find this newsletter and organization a useful in living with CF.This year has been exceptional for the USACFA as they are now offering the newsletter for free to everyone and people are respondng very positively by subscribing in large numbers. It is an honor to be part of this organization and hopefully to be part of it for many more years.

USACFA, publishers of CF Roundtable	197988		/users/profile/258675	Laurierussellw	General Member of the Public	5	04/16/2014	I am an avid reader and follower of the CF Roundtable publication. My cousin's wife (in spirit she is my sister) has been active member of this organization for almost 25 years.. I have been reading this newsletter for many,many years. I am often humbled by the stories, poems, and pictures of people dealing with CF every day. What I especially have appreciated is how my knowledge has increased over the years. I sit right down when roundtable arrives and read it all the way through. Sometimes the medical or legal aspects are way over my head, but I can imagine the value of this information to the subscribers who benefit the most. I am a most grateful and loyal supporter.LaurieW

The publication, CF Roundtable, is a wealth of information for those living with the disease and their loved ones.   The topics are always current and relevant to readers.  Great organization!
USACFA, publishers of CF Roundtable	161957		/users/profile/214839	Lisa249	Board Member	5	07/02/2013	I have been reading CF Roundtable for many years. This is a great way to read what other adults with CF deal with on a day-to-day basis and know you are not alone in your fight. The stories are inspiring and the articles are very informative. It is the best newsletter publication out there today! As a newly elected board member, I look forward to writing articles, getting to know other CF patients, and sharing my personal stories about the disease.
USACFA, publishers of CF Roundtable	161326	1	/users/profile/213944	cflawyer	Board Member	5	06/24/2013	I have been a Board member of this organization for many years.  Before I served on the Board I was an avid reader of the CF Roundtable.  For the past 20 years when the CF Roundtable arrives I stop what I am doing and read it from cover to cover.  The articles give me information, support and encouragement in my own fight against the effects of CF.  I recommend the CF Roundtable to anyone who has CF, loves someone who has CF or works in the healthcare field.  The articles are informative and touching.  You will learn a lot about CF if you read just one issue.

USACFA, publishers of CF Roundtable	160403		/users/profile/212686	56male	Volunteer	5	06/12/2013	USACFA has been in business for 22 years, and the organization continues to grow and contribute to the adult CF community. I have volunteered for them since 2001, and it is made up solely of people who devote their time and energy to education and support of adults with CF. While the organization collects donations and grants, people can be comforted in knowing that 100% of their donation is used to support USACFA and it's mission, as the organization has no paid employees. CFRoundtable, a quarterly newsletter authored solely by CF adults, is the foundation of this organization, and every effort is made to make the newsletter the leader in the CF adult community. I am continually amazed by the positive feedback from readers on the stories written, and the milestones achieved. It gives me a wonderful sense of accomplishment knowing I have a small part to play in this wonderful nonprofit that brings reality to words so beautifully crafted by people who have first-hand experience dealing with cystic fibrosis.                 
USACFA, publishers of CF Roundtable	159718		/users/profile/211890	HeyLevine	Board Member	5	06/05/2013	The CF Roundtable is a fantastic publication. As an adult with CF, I look forward to receiving my free quarterly issue by US mail and by email. It's rare to find a newsletter that connects on so many levels but the CF Roundtable consistently does just that. It addresses issues that I have dealt with or most likely need to plan on dealing with in the future. Every page provides insights and perspectives from a CF adult, family member or caregiver. It's inspirational, educational and sometimes funny. And the best part is that when I find it appropriate, I can share my story with the greater CF community, get published and feel like I'm really making a difference. The CF Roundtable has also been a valuable tool for my wife to learn about aspects of CF that she might not normally be exposed to. Thank you Roundtable for bringing the CF family together.

I have been reading CF Roundtable for approximately 13 years. In the last several months this wonderful newsletter has become free to all those interested in the publication via PDF downloads and mail.

I have been an avid fan of this publication since my daughter was a young child.  The articles are wonderfully written by CF patients and have provided much insight and information to me throughout the years.  From "Ask The Attorney" to "Information from the Internet", to the special topics highlighted each quarter, there is not a publication out there like this for CF patients and caregivers.  Thank you USACFA!

I thought it was a very valuable resource and was impressed by the professionalism of the publication.  CF Roundtable is an excellent source of information - including legal, social, educational, as well as many other topics affecting the CF community.  It is a vital source of communication among those with CF.
USACFA, publishers of CF Roundtable	156979		/users/profile/208189	TonyaH	General Member of the Public	5	05/02/2013	Through CF Roundtable, USACFA provides an amazing service not only to CF patients, but to their caregivers.  I am the parent of a child with CF.  Since his birth, education has become my best defense in fighting this disease.  Information gained from CF Roundtable enables patients and caregivers to become strong advocates for themselves.   We feel this in turn creates better health-care provider relationships, disease self-management, and improved outcome.  Our family values this resource very much!
USACFA, publishers of CF Roundtable	156777		/users/profile/207949	BenRrrrrrr	Volunteer	5	04/30/2013	Cf Roundtable is a fantastic resource and supportive portal for people with CF. As a childhood friend of someone with CF, I have been awestruck by the amount of courage and dedication it takes to cope with this debilitating condition. I can only imagine the difference this site makes not only for its visitors, but for those with CF who run it.

For years now I have been receiving the CF Newsletter.  I browse through and always find several articles of interest.  I love the theme idea off each issue.  I love the photos, validation of life.  Having a chronic health issues myself , i can relate to many of the people in the newsletter.  Living with life threatening diseases of any kind have much in common.

USACFA, publishers of CF Roundtable	156578		/users/profile/207683	luvablemb	Board Member	5	04/28/2013	I learned and joined CF Roundtable one year ago. It has been a pleasure to work and meet so many inspiring CF patients on the Board and thru patient stories! I am a fellow writer as well so I have enjoyed sharing my story and hope to inspire others with CF to keep positive! The CF Roundtable took a new direction this year that many are excited about, the CF Roundtable is now FREE! I hope that many are as inspired and are willing to share their stories with us as well. I have felt very welcomed and "normal" since I joined the CF Roundtable. Its a great working support group and I hope others see our willingness to be the Greatest Non-Profit Organization that gives and recieves.

I have seen this organization grow tremendously in terms of how they serve the adult community by providing insights from adults with CF.  As more and more people with CF grow into adulthood, publications like CF Roundtable and organizations like USACFA become more and more valuable.  CF adults realize they are not alone in their struggles, because CF Roundtable is always chock full of articles that people with CF can relate to.  Now that CF Roundtable is FREE, I hope more and more people start reading it and benefiting from it!

USACFA, publishers of CF Roundtable	155183		/users/profile/206059	Georgia Parsons	General Member of the Public	5	04/17/2013	I am new to CF Roundtable only because I never knew anyone with CF before. That is until my husband and I moved into a new townhome complex a few months ago and met Jennifer Hale and her husband, Mark. They are our next door neighbors and both such kind and caring people and we feel very fortunate to have them in our lives. I had no idea Jennifer was living with CF when I first met her. She is so bubbly and cute and our conversations are always lively.  She has the most positive, upbeat personality and I never would have known that she was living with such devastating health challenges. After reading CF Roundtable I realized what an asset it is to others with CF. It is full of real-life stories and medical information that would be helpful to all. It is an amazing resource and service to anyone with CF. Keep up the good work! 
USACFA, publishers of CF Roundtable	154575		/users/profile/205420	Beth Butters	General Member of the Public	5	04/13/2013	I started reading CF Roundtable after my friend, Jennifer Hale introduced it to me a few years back. I am an adult CF'er, and so inspired by all the stories. Their is always new things and ideas to be learned about this disease, and one of the best ways is to hear it straight from the people that are living it. I think its so great that nonprofits groups like USACFA can make the CF Roundtable available to everyone. Thanks so much!
USACFA, publishers of CF Roundtable	154450		/users/profile/205281	CF Coordinator	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/12/2013	I love the CF Roundtable.  As a healthcare worker, I find it very helpful to be able to see things from a client's perspective.  I sometimes get caught up in the need for adherence without focusing on the whole person.  Jennifer Hale is especially inspiring.
USACFA, publishers of CF Roundtable	154421		/users/profile/205256	alipman2001	Client Served	5	04/12/2013	I love the Roundtable.

USACFA, publishers of CF Roundtable	154401		/users/profile/205236	friend4cure	General Member of the Public	5	04/12/2013	CF Roundtable is an outstanding newsletter. It provides a lot of very useful information both for people who have CF and for people who are trying to understand the experience of someone they know who has CF. The articles are full of heart, because writers like Jennifer Hale are willing to open up and share personal stories, thoughts, emotions, and insights. CF Roundtable serves as a reminder to everyone that it is possible to be an extremely strong person without a strong body.  I enjoy reading all of the articles in this newsletter, not just to learn about CF but also to learn about the art of perseverance, which is a life lesson we all can benefit from.
USACFA, publishers of CF Roundtable	154330		/users/profile/205160	Cure CF	General Member of the Public	5	04/11/2013	Jennifer Hale's articles are candid, sincere and inspiring.

I have learned many things about CF and the amazing people who live with this disease through the articles in the Roundtable.  They cover a variety of topics with a variety of people which gives excellent insight into different ways of living with and battling the effects of CF. I highly encourage everyone who knows someone with this disease or an interest in learning about it to subscribe and read the magazined-especially Coughing with a Smile-an award winning column!

The publication is very informative yet it will make you laugh and cry in the matter of seconds. Being involved behind the scenes with USACFA has been really great seeing how the clock ticks. The publication helps those with CF and those who are caregivers along with those who just might know someone who has CF. The stories are really inspiring and I have been a reader of the publication long before I became a board member.. 
USACFA, publishers of CF Roundtable	154226		/users/profile/205053	julibuli	General Member of the Public	5	04/11/2013	I have enjoyed reading the articles posted to the CF Roundtable. Jennifer Hale is the best writer because she lives with it every day and can help  readers understand what life is like living with CF day in and day out. It's not pretty and she doesn't pull any punches...but she will make you laugh, cry and yearn for a cure.

USACFA, publishers of CF Roundtable	153311		/users/profile/204134	kevinizon	General Member of the Public	4	04/08/2013	I've read several CF Roundtables, and have found them to be be a great outlet for persons with CF. Additionally, for a lay person just reading it from "the outside", it gives a great insight into so many issues that people with CF experience. THe people who contribute tend to explain their unique-but-shared situations, in a true forum format.  I am inspired by USACFA and the CF Roundtable.  I hope more and more people check it out.
Operation Nightwatch Portland	182761	4	/users/profile/239638	Sean13	Volunteer	5	10/27/2013	I'm a fairly new volunteer with ONW at the downtown location. I was drawn to offer my time as a retired RN at the Sat foot clinic which was just a few hours a month but I wanted to give more time. I was able to offer my RN skills in the evenings as well since  they lost their MA volunteer. Because I'm a trained Massage Therapist I offered that  as well. This is a truly non-judgemental and caring non-profit community that  sees hospitality as a right and gift for all involved. I try to offer 5-6 chair  massages Thurs and Fri while giving basic first-aide and assessments when needed. After a month the feedback has been good by our clients. A true place of hospitality.

NIGHTWATCH COMES TO OUR CHURCH WITH THEIR RV MOBILE UNIT AND WORKS WITH OUR COMMUNITY OF NEEDY AND HOMELESS. IT HAS BEEN VERY BENEFICIAL, TO NOT ONLY THOSE SERVED, BUT ALSO ALL VOLUNTEERS WORKING WITH THEM. I PERSONALLY HAVE FOUND THE VERY FRIENDLY REPRESENTATIVE TO BE HELPFUL TO ME. THE RULES WE ALL LIVE BY ARE HELPFUL IN MY OWN LIFE AND RELATIONSHIPS AND HAVE HELPED ME OUT OF SOME PROBLEMS AND AVOID HEARTACHES. I FEEL THE NIGHTWATCH ORGANIZATION IS SERVING A VERY NEEDFUL AREAS OF HUMAN NEED AND IS VERY EFFECTIVE IN HOW THEY CONDUCT THAT SERVICE. 
Operation Nightwatch Portland	170049	3	/users/profile/225344	mack12	Volunteer	5	09/17/2013	Nightwatch is a wonderful place not only for the guest, but also for the volunteer. It gives a space that allows for the breakdown of  the barrier between homeless people and those more fortunate. It provided an opportunity for me to learn more about the realities of living on the street, and gave me tools to help understand all people with more grace and dignity. 
Operation Nightwatch Portland	165044	4	/users/profile/219376	Pigeonfriendly	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/14/2013	Operation Nightwatch provides such a valuable resource for the community. If you have never been there, I encourage you to go. You will not regret it. I had the good fortune to walk in there a few years ago. Talk about a lifelong impact. As a professional and a advocate for the homeless, I am in awe of all that Nightwatch is and provides. Do yourself a favor, volunteer, donate, refer someone you see on the streets to take advantage of this amazing nonprofit.
Operation Nightwatch Portland	163122	2	/users/profile/216552	byron9	Donor	5	07/19/2013	My sister volunteered at Operation Nightwatch for years, before she died a few years ago.   She came to know them all by name and  recognize their worth as human beings.  This is a unique safe place for the homeless to find companionship along with food and socks, etc.  It's a place of warmth, comfort, coffee, games and actually being recognized as a person and not just another homeless person.   Operation Nightwatch is on my list for monthly donations.  Betty Riley
Operation Nightwatch Portland	160381	1	/users/profile/72351	Clarob	Board Member	5	06/12/2013	I applied to be on the board so I could futher the mission of this program to we've the marginalized.  I have volunteered for about 20 years.  The premise is simple, treat people as you would want to be treated if life kicked your feet out from under you and left you flat on the sidewalk.  We don't try to change people but we create spaces where they can choose to change and support them in their journey. 
Operation Nightwatch Portland	126236	2	/users/profile/72351	Clarob	Donor	5	10/16/2012	I attended an Operation Nightwatch Breakfast last Saturday and learned some amazing things.  Operation Nightwatch does not prosletize at their hospitality centers but also do not hide that this is an ecumenical ministry program that seeks to address peoples physical needs with food, clothing, bedding and access to bathroom facilities.  They also address social needs by offering a full range of programs including movie nights, monthly outings, Christmas parties and a monthly birthday party.  They are concerned about people's intellectural needs and provides a free book cart and stimulating conversations at the hospitality centers.  They also seek to address people's spiritual needs through a weekly Bible study which has also become a support group and a weekly worship service that averages 25-30 attendees per week.  At this service, they take an offering which is then donated to other programs that serve the low-income and homeless in Portlan.  In ten years of faithful giving by these people who most view as having nothing to give, have raised $9900.  The most important service Operation Nightwatch provides, is that opportunity for marginalized people to be part of our community in very normal ways.  This raises self esteem and opens the door of HOPE.
Operation Nightwatch Portland	100881	1	/users/profile/72351	Clarob	Volunteer	5	11/21/2011	I have been a volunteer with Operation Nightwatch for over 15 years.  I started with one night a month at the hospitality center which is open in the evenings for homeless and low income people to come have a cup of coffee, a sandwich, read a magazine, play a game and take a break from the daily stress of their lives.  The center also offers special events to help our guests have some normal life experiences like going to a baseball game, or decorating a Christmas tree with hand made ornaments.  We also have an annual memorial service during Holy Week for all of our "friends" who have passed away during the past year.  It is more than  a handout, it is a community. Operation Nightwatch continues to expand to meet the needs of low income and homeless people in Portland, Oregon.  They now have a new SE center and are looking for a church to partner with who has opened their parking lot to people living in their cars.  The mobile center  would provide bathrooms, showers and some basic cooking options for these families.
Operation Nightwatch Portland	66189		/users/profile/72351	Clarob	Volunteer	5	02/10/2011	Operation Nightwatch in Portland, Oregon provides services to some of our most marginalized residents including the homeless, low income seniors, those who are chronically mentally ill, alcoholic and drug addicts and disabled people.  They provide a hospitality center 3 nights a week where people come to socialize, drink free coffee and lemonade, have a snack and seek advice.   While there they can play board and card games, read, rest, visit.  There are bathroom facilities they can use to clean up.  There is also a mobile unit that goes out to an area known to have a large population of low income folks to provide simular services.  There are also monthly outings to the beach, the mountains, a baseball game or other activity.  Those events provide opportunities for recreation that are beyond the means of most or our guests.  This program has been a stable resource in Portland for over 20 years.  There is only one paid staff and over 100 volunteers Our motto is Keep the Light On!

I have been and continue to be impressed with the way low-income and homeless people are treated with dignity and respect.  No one is looked down on who comes to the center or the mobile hospitality center.  All are welcome.  We offer coffee, tea, water, sandwiches, comedy movie night, birthday night, and bible study times.  The number of participants has increased each year that Operation Nightwatch-Portland has been in existance.
Operation Nightwatch Portland	152575	1	/users/profile/203540	John155	Volunteer	5	04/05/2013	Operation Nightwatch is a vital part of the community providing a meal, clean socks and blankets to the lesser fortunate of the community. The RV has had the room in the back turned into a medical exam room which has been a need for those that don't have insurance and can't afford a Dr. visit. Cost of living has increased, property taxes rise as the value goes down. Non-profits like this are vital to the needs of the community just like showers and housing. Every little bit helps when huge cuts are being made. 
Operation Nightwatch Portland	152422		/users/profile/203424	nido	Client Served	5	04/05/2013	I used to live in my car with my dog Kosmo in Portland. Nightwatch was a place for me to get a little hope and a little less fear. Now I'm thinking about volunteering.
Operation Nightwatch Portland	127114		/users/profile/172155	Velderi	Volunteer	5	10/18/2012	I used to pass homeless people on the street and walk faster, turn the other cheek and pretend not to notice, I now realize how wrong I was in doing so. Operation Nightwatch is a beautiful organization that works to fight social isolation among Portland's homeless population. We offer basic services for health, nutrition and hygiene, but most of all we offer our time. A majority of people living on the street have no one to talk to, no one to listen to problems and stories, and  no one to just carry a decent conversation with. Nightwatch offers a safe and hospitable environment for those in need. I have been a volunteer for about six months and in this time I have learned so much about the power of kindness, hospitality, and a simple smile. 
Operation Nightwatch Portland	126283		/users/profile/122261	Alex F.	Volunteer	5	10/17/2012	I have volunteered at Operation Nightwatch on and off for about two years. Operation Nightwatch offers something much more than simply food, coffee, socks, blankets, hygiene products, etc; they offer a warm, safe environment where people can meet, talk, play games, and rest. For most people living outside, this chance to feel warm and safe, seen and heard, is incredibly valuable. Operation Nightwatch is an amazing organization, and the friendships I have made there are deep and long-lasting.
Operation Nightwatch Portland	100406		/users/profile/122261	Alex F.	Volunteer	5	11/08/2011	I volunteered with Operation Nightwatch for some months while I was attending University in Portland. I became so close with the individuals that we hosted, that I am still in contact with many of them today, even though I am now living in Sweden. The people that I met at Operation Nightwatch have affected my life in many deep and profound ways, and I am eternally grateful and honored to know them. Operation Nightwatch is a wonderful organization that has a beautiful balance of service and friendship. 
Operation Nightwatch Portland	126062		/users/profile/81937	dslocum72	Volunteer	5	10/16/2012	This is a warm caring place for people to come.  We go on Sunday afternoon for the service and bring a meal to share afterward.

Operation Nightwatch Portland	124851		/users/profile/169909	Anti-Rape	General Member of the Public	1	10/09/2012	This is a naive group that is unintentionally causing harm in the community.  They have not addressed the design flaw whereby they attract both dangerous men and naive volunteers who are told that all they need is a smile.  Their volunteer Nikki Powell was raped and murdered by a ON client   and lay decomposing in her apartment for three full weeks with no family or fellow volunteers to check on her disappearance.   The same homeless men who knew that sex offender Mark Beebout had moved on Nikki are at ON- you can meet them yourself.  This group's extreme "turn the other cheek" approach puts volunteers at risk- along with lax security. 
Operation Nightwatch Portland	124481		/users/profile/169348	Shane L.	Volunteer	5	10/03/2012	I had the opportunity to volunteer at Operation Nightwatch recently with my Mom, who is a volunteer homeless advocate in Los Angeles. We were both impressed with the idea behind Operation Nightwatch, as well as how it was carried out. We both visited a number of other agencies serving the homeless that same day & commented on how much interaction there was between volunteers & guests, how relaxed & calm guests were invited to be, the freedom they had to engage in different conversations and board games & come and go as they wished. There seemed to be an effortlessness in how the night's activities were run; while many other organizations passed out food, socks, toiletries & other goods, guests seemed to know they were there to be served & needn't hurry or be demanding in order to have their needs met. Operation Nightwatch does just that - attentively, respectfully & compassionately attend to eager guests. Nowhere else in the city did I see quite this level of welcome. 
Operation Nightwatch Portland	124405		/users/profile/169252	Cangeo	Volunteer	5	10/03/2012	My friend and I have volunteered for about 10 years @ Operation Nightwatch.  Through this organization we have socialized with people who are homeless @ holiday parties, picnics and Friday evening gatherings.  We enjoy every aspect of our time with the people served by Operation Nightwatch from serving sandwiches/snacks/coffee to providing toiletries/socks/blankets.  We get to know the people served better by playing games/cards with them as we visit.  The communication with the directors and coordinators has been outstanding via email and personal contacts!  Portland, Oregon is a better place because of Operation Nightwatch offering an opportunity for citizens to gather and gain a greater understanding of each other.  It goes without saying we would not have continued volunteering over the years if we did not believe in Operation Nightwatch.
Operation Nightwatch Portland	124328		/users/profile/169164	grateful2onw	Donor	5	10/02/2012	Operation Nightwatch meets a very real need for many people.  Their stories could belong to any one of us given different circumstances.  Through genuine caring and dedication, this organization offers a safe and welcoming environment for fellowship and a sense of belonging.  It provides clear rules and standards for guests and volunteers alike which, if followed, insure safety for all.  I have seen over many years the positive impact Operation Nightwatch has had on the folks who attend.  For some, this community has been life-changing.  A friend once observed as he offered help to a "homeless" man:  How can I be sure this isn't God himself.   Therefore, "even as you did to the least of these, you did also to me... (Matt. 25:40)
Operation Nightwatch Portland	124320		/users/profile/169150	Melissa81	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/02/2012	As a professional social worker and a volunteer, I am proud and very grateful that Operation Nightwatch exists. It provides so much more than a place for people to go for a couple of hours per night. It provides hope, compassion and conversation. For anyone who has not been to Nightwatch, you are missing out and owe yourself the opportunity to truly see the important work that this program provides. I am honored to be a part of Nightwatch and will always support this wonderful program!
Operation Nightwatch Portland	124296		/users/profile/169130	Bonnie and Larry	Volunteer	5	10/02/2012	My husband and I have volunteered at Operation Nightwatch for 15 years.  We have had wonderful conversations and experiences with our guests.  We have served sandwiches, cookies, coffee and offered the hospitality that ALL people deserve - no exceptions!  We have had a great experience which is why we continue to volunteer each month.  The rewards we feel far surpass the effort it takes to commit an evening for such important work.  We believe that love and respect for our neighbors makes a stronger caring community.  We practice radical hospitality, and it is an easy stretch!   With open hearts and minds, Bonnie and Larry
Operation Nightwatch Portland	124272		/users/profile/74318	Allyson F.	Volunteer	5	10/02/2012	As a 5 year volunteer at ONW, I can honestly say that I have been really blessed to serve as a hospitality minister to Portland's homeless.  The unique vision to offer a sense of belonging, a home so to speak, is amazing to be a part of, as I see positive change in the lives of people who many write of as garbage.  I feel absolutely safe and appreciated at ONW, but take very seriously our boundary rules not to form outside relationships with guests.  As with anywhere, in a world where evil exists, we all need to find balance with compassion and common sense regarding safety, and make wise choices.  As heart wrenching and tragic Niki's murder is, she acted unwisely and in clear violation of the boundaries set up to protect us.  I pray Mark will be held accountable and for comfort for her family, as well as for the other volunteers to make better boundary choices, myself included.  Nightwatch serves real need in our city in a very positive way; I highly recommend volunteering to experience it for yourself!!:)
Operation Nightwatch Portland	68006		/users/profile/74318	Allyson F.	Volunteer	5	02/14/2011	I have been volunteering at Operation Nightwatch, as a hspitality mininster, for 4 years now.  It is an amazing ministry to the homeless in Portland and serving has been hugely rewarding, a true blessing for me as well.  The unique vision of Nightwatch, focusing on community building, is wonderful.  The guests and volunteers have truly become family to one another, and i am amazed at the ways this has broken barriers and led to deepened sense of self worth and belonging.  The "gift" of acceptance and grace that we extend is a great complement to other focused rehab programs that some of our guests attend, and provides a safe space for those that are beyond realistic hope of reintegration.  In serving Jesus in this way, I have personally been stretched and enriched in beautiful ways.  I look forward to years of conintued involvement with nightwatch-and I can't say enough about our amazing director Gary Davis; his dedication is truly sacrificial, and all of our volunteers!
Operation Nightwatch Portland	124243		/users/profile/169068	jas1	Volunteer	5	10/02/2012	Operation Nightwatch is a wonderful organization.  My husband and I know the leaders, and have provided and served meals.  There is not enough good that we can say about the work that they do.  They form relationships with people:  like friends, like family, like what most of us take for granted.  The great majority of the people served are people just like us-less money, less possessions, and somewhere, somehow, their lives took a different turn, BUT as relationships are formed it is revealing to find how many are educated, wise, sensitive, with the same needs for human  connection that we all have.  A "bad" apple might be found in many bushels, but believe us that is the exception, not the rule. 
Operation Nightwatch Portland	124208		/users/profile/11578	karenz	Volunteer	5	10/02/2012	This group provides a safe setting for people who just need to get off the street for a bit. They provide food, a comfortable dry space and acceptance. The visitors can play games, chat, or even just sleep.They are very clear about not exchanging personal information between volunteers and clients and even require attendance at a training session to explain why this is important. The director works very hard to make this place comfortable and safe for both clients and volunteers.
Operation Nightwatch Portland	124190		/users/profile/169006	Everett1210	General Member of the Public	5	10/02/2012	I have had the opportunity to see operation nightwatch in action from an outsiders perspective. Operation nightwatch has an outreach vehicle that parks every Friday night at one of the local neighborhoods that has several homeless and low income families. They serve a meal and provide warm clothing when available. Even in the heart of winter, with the cold and rain, the volunteers set up the hospitality vehicle and put out canopies, tables and chairs (and heater) so that those less fortunate have something warm to eat. I started hanging out and meeting many of the people who come regularly. These folks really appreciate this weekly service. 
Operation Nightwatch Portland	124188		/users/profile/63329	Dan Vetter	Volunteer	5	10/02/2012	I discovered Operation Nightwatch about 10 years ago, shortly after moving to Portland from the Midwest.  Since then I've been a regular "first Friday" volunteer.  I was about to say that this is 'one of the truly unselfish things' that I do...but then I realized that I get so much back in return from serving the guests that come each evening, I can hardly make that claim.   Operation Nightwatch puts a face on homelessness.  Each evening I talk with guests whose lives have taken some awful turns.  Some I see every month; and they have become friends.  Volunteering here reveals an additional dimension of diversity that I would not experience any other way.  I support this ministry financially as well because I know it is run on a shoestring, and most of money goes to doing good for those we serve.  And, because I'm involved as a volunteer, I get to see those dollars doing good every day.  Some say this population of people needs to be pushed toward goals and specific outcomes, like getting a home or finding a job.  Nightwatch has different, yet very powerful focus:  Building Community and Self Respect!  As a student of psychology, I'd label what we offer as the "Carl Rogers approach" to emotional health.  When we listen to and affirm others, their inner strength grows.  How many of the guests who pass through our doors have moved on to better lives (and have been able to tackle the larger challenges in their lives) because of the self respect that grew from seeds planted and nurtured each evening playing a games, sipping coffee, and just being a part of a safe and caring community.   THANK YOU Operation Nightwatch for making a difference for so many in Portland, and for the chance to know and love people that I'd otherwise look away from.  
Operation Nightwatch Portland	124184		/users/profile/169001	AFRoger	Volunteer	5	10/02/2012	Operation Nightwatch became a part of my life nine years ago.  Since then, I have seen how important this ministry has become in the lives of people newly on the street or having spent a long time there.  I now provide a weekly worship and weekly bible study for our folks and find them to be some of the most caring and spiritual people I have ever met.  In addition to sharing with each other, they share their meager resources through a weekly offering that supports local food pantries as well as global charities that provide assistance after earthquake, tsunami and hurricane devastation.  The success stories of people who have turned away from addictions, who have stayed out of prison, who have gotten into housing and back into employment are too numerous to mention.  They mostly will not make the news, but we who volunteer know them very well.  It all begins with hospitality and relationship building.  No one does it better than Operation Nightwatch.  
Operation Nightwatch Portland	106488		/users/profile/143904	David70	Board Member	5	02/15/2012	I have regularly volunteered at Operation Nightwatch since 1993 and served on its Board of Directors since 2003.  Our focus at Nightwatch is on hospitality for persons experiencing poverty and homelessness.  We operate in the evening when most other social service agencies are closed.  For all who are involved in  Nightwatch, hospitality is both a means and an end.  It is a means insofar as basic respect and caring can help give the people we serve, our guests, renewed strength and self confidence without which they cannot hope to address the condition of their lives.  It is an end in itself because it affirms a sense of community and mutual caring that enriches human life.
Operation Nightwatch Portland	102134		/users/profile/132200	OHSU	Donor	5	12/09/2011	Operation Nightwatch has been wonderful to us at OHSU. We can call and ask them to come later or earlier than our usual time, and they always find a way to make it work. The people who pick up our donations are always wonderful as well. I am glad we chose them over 2 years ago. It has been great!
Operation Nightwatch Portland	102117		/users/profile/132152	ekatnasedkin	Donor	5	12/09/2011	A really great non-profit that focuses on the emotional (as well as physical) well-being of Portland's street population. I'm so happy that our cafe chose Operation Nightwatch for our weekly donations! Gary picks them up personally, and I always love to hear about all the fun activities they have planned for the upcoming weeks!
Operation Nightwatch Portland	102062		/users/profile/132010	mbensink	Professional with expertise in this field	5	12/09/2011	I first had that opportunity to volunteer at Nightwatch  three years ago as a student and I continue to volunteer to this day.  Nightwatch is so much to so many people.  What makes it so amazing is difficult to describe but easily seen if you have the opportunity to visit.  Rather it be the smiles on peoples faces, the chatter in the corner, the vision of groups of people playing scrabble or seeing a person be able to sit down and feel safe for the first time in the day.  As a social worker in the field,  Nightwatch is to me an inspiration, it gives me hope and reminds me why I got into this field in the first place. Nightwatch does what many nonprofits don't do, they let people be themselves and allow for a clean and safe place to socialize with other people. Very few if any places exist that just allow people to be themselves and to come as they are. If it wasn't for Nightwatch so many people would not have the opportunity to do what so many of us take for granted, the ability to  socialize other people and to be treated like a person instead of a nuisance. I honor Nightwatch and what they do, they run flawlessly and on a shoestring budget. Nightwatch is very well deserved of some assistance as they provide so much to so many.

Operation Nightwatch Portland	101396		/users/profile/129532	fineagain	Volunteer	4	11/30/2011	My name is Samantha. I volunteered Operation Nightwatch, It was an enjoyable time to spend with those less fortunate. Those that are homeless had a chance to sit and relax, enjoyed food and hot drinks. We had a great time playing games and  listening to others stories.  Operation Nightwatch also supplies those in need with personal hygiene items  Movie night seems to be  a hit with the guests. One gentlemen there played piano there that night and it is to bad he could not get a job playing in a restaurant setting. The music was wonderful. It was a memorable night and was blessed for the opportunity to be apart of Operation Nightwatch Samantha
Operation Nightwatch Portland	100713		/users/profile/124226	finlwjim	Volunteer	5	11/16/2011	Operation Nightwatch faithfully meets the needs of the lonely and needy to associate in a generally accepting environment. My experience within the 20+ years has seen related improvements in various clients from its sensitive approach.Operation Nightwatch volunteers attempt to reach an understanding of both all clients and individual clients needs to find acceptance. Operation Nightwatch has developed outstanding sensitivity traits of its volunteers and leadership over the life of Operation Nightwatch, through capitalizing on talents to develop better approaches, as these were determined. In some cases, incisive interest in various individuals has led to some of these men and women to send an emissary from their deathbed thanking the volunteers for making their lives tolerable. Some clients from learning they were ok but maybe with major life changes could improve their lives on this earth, and have made those choices and returned thanking various volunteers. Some clients have asked for spiritual assistance which has been available, and because of the ecumenical approach, volunteers approached the issue with a degree of sensitivity knowing anothers way to God, might not tie to their own, but another volunteer or agency could help.This organization has been successful meeting its goals through sensitivity to its clients and hard work, and though it does not itemize changes in clients, those changes occur, and though it does not itemize the success of treating each person as Gods own, those successes are there as well. 
Operation Nightwatch Portland	100416		/users/profile/122323	carmen Vetter	Volunteer	5	11/08/2011	I began volunteering with ONW about twelve years ago.  I have to say that it has been the most satisfying and fulfilling volunteer work I have ever done.  Recently I have started and art class on Thursday nights where we do various projects and just generally have a good time together.  ONW is a place that gives a sense of community, not just to the people we serve, but to us as volunteers as well.  I consider the men and women there more than people I am serving, they are my friends.  Living on the fringes of society can be extremely isolating, and what ONW does is to give folks a hand out of that isolation, a place to come and feel like family.  I should mention that I am also a board member at ONW, but I count it my greatest privelidge to spend time at the center volunteering and offering my friendship to those who most need a friend.  We hand out sanwhiches and provide coffee, do some light set-up and clean-up, but it is the conversations, discussion, card games, and scrabble that are the heart of what we do.  I go on Thursdays to offer my friendship, and receive the same.
Operation Nightwatch Portland	95174	1	/users/profile/110342	windmill	General Member of the Public	3	08/06/2011	The Night Watch helps prevent neighborhood crimes in evening and make downtown Portland attractive for nightlife and dining by helping remove homeless from sidewalks where there may be begging and accosting diners and shoppers, and instead control them in a carefully supervised environment.  From what I understand however there is no or little if any accountability there.  There is no case management, intake or any methods to keep the homeless accountable in their recovery from addiction and antisocial behaviors. It thus attracts a lot of chronic cases for years and years.  Nevertheless we as residents and business owners of downtown Portland are happy to know that there is Night Watch that keeps eyes on the worst of the worst bums so we do not have to deal with them.  It's kind of like having a babysitter.  Please support this charity as without Night Watch all hell will break loose.
Operation Nightwatch Portland	80840		/users/profile/88258	hfhf	Volunteer	5	03/01/2011	I've volunteered and attended Sunday evening service several Sundays a month for the past 3 years. I can tell you I've never felt so welcomed in a church/religious setting. It is a very special thing that's happened at operation nightwatch, and I hope it flourishes for years to come. 
Operation Nightwatch Portland	74903		/users/profile/81829	judenders	Volunteer	5	02/24/2011	My husband and I bring dinner on a Sunday night to the worship service for street folks that Chaplain Roger Fuchs conducts. Sometimes 30 or more people wander in to hear Roger's message and then eat dinner with one another and we volunteers. It is a warm, cozy service and seems well received by all. Without Operation Nighwatch, this service wouldn't be possible and people might not get the chance to worship and hear the good word weekly. 
Operation Nightwatch Portland	74873		/users/profile/81783	Aaron R.	Volunteer	5	02/24/2011	Operation Nightwatch is a wonderful place where people can meet and grow together in relationship. I am amazed at how this community of people can understand God's blessings so much more than wealthy communities near where I live. There were two men that I talked to at Operation Nightwatch. The first man's name was Michael and he had a broken leg. He was hit by a car when he was drunk one night. He went to the hospital and got his leg fixed, but couldn't afford any pain killers. So he has to just deal with the pain. A that time, he was living with a friend and knows that he needs to kick his alcohol addiction. He knows that his life sucks because of it. He's a smart guy. We talked about where he grew up, his opinions about stuff, etc. The second man's name was Leonard. He was a 40-something ex-Army staff sergeant with PTSD. He was telling me what it's like living on the street daily, where he gets food, and how much he wanted to go home to Montana. We talked about my job, kids, and how he should've listened to his mother better when he was younger. These are just two guys that have made mistakes. Everyone makes mistakes. I raise my voice at my wife, I belittle something my sister is excited about, or I forget to do something at work. But the mistakes that these guys made have cost them much more than mine have. Different consequences, but still mistakes nonetheless. I am no better than these guys. These aren't people that I talk to in my every day life. So, it is refreshing to go to a place like Operation Nightwatch, help out, and hear stories from people who seem to have quite a different perspective on life and a better understanding of how to be thankful.
Operation Nightwatch Portland	73931		/users/profile/80796	aimie.kristen	Volunteer	5	02/23/2011	I have been attending Operation Nightwatch since November 2010 to play music for their chapel services on Sunday afternoons.  This has been an amazing experience to watch people come in just for spiritual food and fellowship with others.  It is touching to hear their prayers, and to see their involvement in the music.  This is the only opportunity they have to attend a church and to really feel a part of things and like they belong.  The care, compassion, and love are so obvious there.
Operation Nightwatch Portland	73836		/users/profile/80689	arlene whitney	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/23/2011	I have worked many years in community services. I have a graduate degree in social work and have also participated as a chaplain. I came to Nightwatch as a friend of young musicians who Nightwatch welcomed to contribute to the program of the evening. They and I also participated in the food serving and mingling with the people who came.   Through the evening, I had the privilege of watching Roger and his associates as they led in the nightwatch program. Roger as the leader of this organization could not have a better approach. He treats each person with dignity and respect and each individual who comes are obviously encouraged by his kindness, warmth and family/fatherly mentoring. He is a beautiful role model for his staff and they all follow his example.  The homeless have come to feel that this is their family, that this is their home.  Many of them stay as long as possible, reluctant to leave.  The food is always home-made and they can have as many refills as they want. Roger leads a calm, beautiful spiritual service, giving it as much care and thought as if he was speaking to a crowd of the elite because that his how he perceives the people who come. He and his staff treat all the people they serve as "elite" and they obviously feel respected. I was amazed and awed by what I saw!!
Operation Nightwatch Portland	73690		/users/profile/80526	whitna	Volunteer	4	02/23/2011	I have been a volunteer and find the program meets a very important need in the Portland, OR area. during my time there I have seen many homeless individuals find a place to rest, feel safe, interact with other people in a supportive setting, and interact with non-homeless people in a non-judgmental atmosphere. this organization is an asset to those who use the services, and to the community as a whole. 
Operation Nightwatch Portland	73593		/users/profile/80424	AF Roger	Volunteer	5	02/23/2011	I first began volunteering with Operation Nightwatch Portland about nine years ago.  Going there made me nervous at first because I had not closely associated with people on the street before.  On my third night of  volunteering, the Director asked me to go outside and spend some time with a man who appeared to be too intoxicated to come in.  I did.  We talked.  He told me that he knew alcohol was destroying his life, destroying his wife's liver.  He knew he needed to quit but just couldn't.  I kept telling him he could when he was ready.  Then, we joined hands and prayed.  I told him he could come in later after the alcohol had worn off a bit.  He did.  He gave me a pleasant smile and we talked a bit.  We didn't see him for another three months.  But then he came back to say that one night had turned his life around.  He had checked himself into a treatment program the next day and had now been sober for over two months.  Since that time I have become involved in Operation Nightwatch on a weekly basis and lead a Sunday worship and meal (four years running) and weekly Bible study (nine months).  I have the best conversations with people, conversations that I wish I could have at church.  But then, this is church.  It is our church together.  
Operation Nightwatch Portland	72793		/users/profile/79568	julia lynn	Volunteer	5	02/22/2011	I have been a volunteer at Nightwatch for many years starting two locations back  but it is clear to me that the location is not the reason for the services working so well. It's about the community and the clients who have made Nightwatch such a viable non-profit. The volunteers, staff and clients really see it as THEIRS and support it whole heartedly. I have noticed that the spiritual services have been ever more beneficial to folks' lives and recovery and made fellowship a reality each night we are open. I look forward to seeing specific guests and feel part of the community myself. I volunteer in the evenings but also in the monthly outings,  bringing lunch for the guys.  My husband has helped with the Movie Nights for years. These thing continue to connect us to this wonderful non-profit.
Operation Nightwatch Portland	72766		/users/profile/79454	Ruthie M.	Volunteer	5	02/22/2011	I began volunteering for ONW about six months ago because I liked the idea of providing a community for people who may not have one elsewhere.  In the time that I have been going there I have made some real friends in the guests and other volunteers.  It seems obvious that people experiencing homelessness might want companionship, but I have never heard of any other organization providing this kind of service.  Going to ONW has also given me the opportunity to view the world from a perspective that I would never have thought about had I not gone.  It has helped to open my mind more and understand challenges that some people face.  It also gives me a new sense of gratitude for things I have taken for granted in my life.  I feel lucky to be able to help with this organization and I would encourage anyone else who is curious to participate as well. I was able to volunteer for the Christmas party this past year and it was so nice to be able to provide a beautiful party to our guests who we served plated meals as though they were in a restaurant.  Since most of them probably do not get to be pampered in that way very often it felt even more special than our weekly services which mostly include sandwiches, coffee and cookies.  There was also karaoke and a trivia contest which were fun for everyone.    The guests and other volunteers have really provided me with a community as well even though I didn't necessarily feel I was looking for one.  I love this organization and I value the time I get to spend there.
Operation Nightwatch Portland	72552		/users/profile/79312	lenabena77	Volunteer	5	02/22/2011	I volunteered at Operation Nightwatch for the first time not too long ago and let me just say I was blown away by the tremdous amount of people that came in for a safe place, even just for a couple of hours. This organization helps so many people with giving them food, clothing or supplies, coffee, and a place to learn social skills by playing games or just conversing. It was an honor to volunteer for them and I will for sure be going  back..and hopefully getting others to come along! 
Operation Nightwatch Portland	72547		/users/profile/79308	Faith	Volunteer	5	02/22/2011	Operation Nightwatcfh has been serving the city of Portland, Oregon for over 25yrs. They are my volunteer organization of choice. Unfortunately we live in a society that looks at people through status. Where do you stand? What do you do for a living? What neighborhood do you live in? What, what; who cares! How can we judge each other that way? Life throws some curve balls sometimes, & we can end up in a place we never thought we'd end up. Don't kick your fellow humans when they are down; reach out to them. That is what Operation Nightwatch does. They build community with the less fortunate. Sometimes you just need a little kindness. Don't we ALL just want to feel like we belong. If you're looking for a place to give back a little, try Nightwatch. You'll be hooked, you may smile! 
Operation Nightwatch Portland	72545		/users/profile/79306	mowe	Volunteer	4	02/22/2011	I have worked as a volunteer and board member for this organization.  It has struggled through hard times and a lot of financial surprises, and always managed to find a way.  I applaud Operation Nightwatch for the humanity it demonstrates in its respectful treatment of its guests, and the safe and peaceful space it provides in an otherwise chaotic street life.

I was so impressed by Cole's orientation to the program, its services, and what to do as a volunteer.  Then the doors opened and BOOM!  The place was filled!  I was so impressed by the homey atmosphere and the camaraderie.  I had a blast learning new games with the guests and talking with friends I hadn't seen in a few years.  What a beautiful place for people to relax and be with friends in a safe environment.  I'm thrilled that there's a place like Nightwatch in my city!

Operation Nightwatch Portland	68217		/users/profile/64112	Tim S	Volunteer	5	02/14/2011	I was blessed to volunteer in the past at NightWatch.  This is a program that does a fantastic job of treating people with respect, dignity and friendship.  When I began at NightWatch, it was the emphasis to get to know the names of the guests.  It is extremely important to treat these people well and to give them a place to socialize and to be treated with respect.  However, to actually get to know a person's name is a great opening to get to truly know the person and to see them as a brother or sister.  The people at NightWatch do a great job with that aspect of this program.  
Operation Nightwatch Portland	59391		/users/profile/64112	Tim S	Volunteer	5	01/03/2011	Operation Nightwatch is truly a hospitality ministry.  I had the honor and blessing of volunteering from September 2009 to June 2010 on Thursday nights.  Yes, Nightwatch provided some food and clothing to those people that asked but what was really important is that for the evening these people were our guests.  That is an important word because that is exactly how these people were treated.  An essential part of this ministry is that we learned the names of the guests so that they weren't a statistic or someone that we feel that we helped.  By knowing their names they became our brothers and sisters.  I witnessed numerous examples of how we should all treat our fellow men and women in the interactions between the guests.  I remember an instance when one of the young men was leaving for the night and I called out his name and told him good night.  He turned to me and said "you remembered my name!"  It really struck home that what this ministry provides is a chance for these people to be treated with respect and friendship - something many of us take for granted but for these people who are essentially invisible to the "normal(?)" world.  They become a person with a name and a story all their own.  They become a family to each other and to those of us that have the honor to volunteer at Nightwatch.  It was a fantastic experience for me and opened my eyes to those that deserve to be treated with respect, dignity and friendship - something we all want and hope for.
Operation Nightwatch Portland	68095		/users/profile/74411	David Groff Groff	Board Member	5	02/14/2011	I have been volunteering at Nightwatch since 1993 and been a board member since 2002. I value  Nightwatch because it is about building relationships with people who for one reason or another have become socially marginalized.  In an  intensely individualistic and competitive society like ours some people inevitably find themselves cast aside either because of their own mistakes and bad choices or because of circumstances beyond their control or because of some combination of the two .  Nightwatch accepts people as they are and invites them into a community in which they will be treated with respect so long as they respect others.  By providing hospitality and breaking down social isolation Nightwatch can help people gain the strength they need to begin a process of recovery from the indignities of homelessness.
Operation Nightwatch Portland	67997		/users/profile/74309	gombartz	Volunteer	5	02/14/2011	I haven't been volunteering long with Operation Nightwatch, but I'm impressed with how organized it is.

Operation Nightwatch Portland	67187		/users/profile/73430	info@operationnightwatch.org	Client Served	5	02/11/2011	Nightwatch is wonderful. I've been coming for three years now, and am an active member in the homeless community, both as a guest and as a volunteer. Nightwatch gives me a place to socialize with friends who sleep outside, as well as make new ones who do not. I enjoy the fact that I can come here, be myself, and accepted as that person, even on my bad days. I can talk to people whose concerns are not 'where shall I sleep tonight?' or 'Which line will I stand in to eat?' Gary is a wonderful organizer, and has the interests of the guests of Nightwatch in mind with every decision he makes. The volunteers are wonderful, and many have been coming for far longer than I have.

Its thoughtful provisions for and respectful interactions with homeless and limited income populations are fantastic and do not impose any philosophical or religious participation on the clients. IT'S A PLEASURE TO VOLUNTEER HERE!
Operation Nightwatch Portland	66191		/users/profile/72353	kirafielding	Volunteer	5	02/10/2011	I enjoyed spending time with some amazing guests at Operation Nightwatch! We played an ongoing card game and just talked. I learned a bit about each of them and had a chance to just serve by being present and a listening ear. The environment at Nightwatch is welcoming and feels safe and supportive. Guests feel comfortable in this community space. I felt grateful to be a part of it for even one time and believe in the importance of this kind of ministry in so many ways! 
Operation Nightwatch Portland	59383		/users/profile/64102	Scott	Volunteer	5	01/03/2011	Operation Nightwatch is so close to the heart of authentic charity: just a safe, welcoming space for the guests and volunteers alike to receive the nourishing truth of our common spirituality and unique humanity.
Operation Nightwatch Portland	59382		/users/profile/64101	sue g	Volunteer	4	01/03/2011	I volunteered with Operation Nightwatch for 20 years, until I moved away from Portland.  It is an aspect of my life in Portland that I miss.  The relationships with folks living outside or in low-income hotels etc is the critical part of this ministry.  It is not always easy, but it is human-to-human connection that is mutually transformative.
Operation Nightwatch Portland	59323		/users/profile/63953	Stan	Volunteer	4	12/31/2010	I have known of Operation  Nightwatch through our United Methodist Church's Outreach Committee.  We have supported it with money and volunteers because it gives homeless people  a place to be inside, to have fellowship in a safe place, and to receive food, clothing and even care for their feet (done weekly by a nurse from  our church. It does, I think, what Jesus would be doing in this time!
Operation Nightwatch Portland	59306		/users/profile/63930	revdennisj	Professional with expertise in this field	5	12/31/2010	I had heard of Operation Nightwatch (ONW) when I first was called as Priest-in-charge of a Downtown Episcopal Parish in Portland.  Members of our community have been making sandwiches every Wednesday to give them to Operation Nightwatch for their hospitality center guests.  Just a few months ago, this fine organization had the rug pulled out from under them when the space they had be renting for their ministry was discontinued.  St. Stephen's has always had a connection with ministry to those in our city who find themselves without a roof over their heads. ONW was offered office and hospitality space in our facility and  it has been a wonderful experince of us; and I hope for them.  Our building is bustleing with a ministry of hospitality and the good news of God's presence in all of our lives when we do what God has asked us to do; to feed the hungry, clothe the naked and provide shelter  to those without.  I am deeply impressed with the folks who run this organization as well as those who serve as volunteers and those who come looking for a hand of friendship in an otherwise friendless world.  Well Done ONW!
Operation Nightwatch Portland	59299		/users/profile/63919	Cole Merkel	Volunteer	5	12/30/2010	I have served as Operation Nightwatch's Program Coordinator for the last half a year. As much as I believe I have made a positive influence on the lives of the hundreds guests that have walked through our doors in that time period, no one has been more positively changed than me. In working to provide a safe, community space for one of Portland's most vulnerable populations, I have become more grounded in my own experiences and more compassionate about the lives of those I serve. I have also had the incredible opportunity to build solid friendships with so many of the guests who have come to call Nightwatch their own.One of Operation Nightwatch's most incredible attributes is the ability our ministry has to transform: both our guests and our volunteers. Through an open ear, a cup of hot coffee or a game of Scrabble, our guests are treated with the dignity and respect we all deserve as human beings. Simultaneously, whether they come only once, or once a week, our volunteers have the opportunity to build relationships with those on the margins of society, transforming their view of homelessness from a statistical to humanitarian perspective.  
Operation Nightwatch Portland	59287		/users/profile/63904	Lindsey W.	Volunteer	5	12/30/2010	Operation Nightwatch is a haven providing food, shelter, and community for its customers. The thing I love most about Nightwatch is that it accepts all its visitors as they are without any expectations in return. The focus is on ameliorating the social isolation that so often goes hand-in-hand with homelessness. The clients at Operation Nightwatch know that it's a safe place for them to go, build community, and create valuable relationships.
Operation Nightwatch Portland	59203		/users/profile/63775	Corene R.	Volunteer	5	12/28/2010	Operation Nightwatch is an amazing organization. I recently started volunteering and am amazed at what I have experienced. They provide a place for guests to have community and feel support. We enjoy playing games and socializing. It has changed my views on Portland's homeless population and I have met truely great people. The homeless population is very thankful for the coffee and warm place to come and relax late at night. Cole and Gary have genuine hearts that seek to do God's will and it is awe inspiring and refreshing. 
Operation Nightwatch Portland	59178		/users/profile/63734	jbarbee	Volunteer	5	12/28/2010	Operation Nightwatch is an amazing ministry, and unusual in its vision to provide hospitality to those without means, instead of handing them provisions and sending them away. The fact that they have been able to stay afloat in this economy is a blessing, and especially as they lost their building recently.  I have loved dreaming about how God will provide them a way to bring value and community to those on the streets, and the vision of the people in charge is really inspiring. I have contributed to their ministry and plan to continue.
Operation Nightwatch Portland	59146		/users/profile/63704	jeremyrmarks	Volunteer	5	12/27/2010	I served as the full time Program Coordinator at Operation Nightwatch for one year and have since returned as a guest and volunteer.  The kinship that is developed among people from so many walks of life through this organization and community is truly special.  The community of Nightwatch, guest, volunteer, and staff alike, recognizes the need for acceptance and relationship, especially for folks on the margins of our society, to reach a place of healing.  And organizationally, Nightwatch is run quite well, with great volunteer support.  
Operation Nightwatch Portland	59144		/users/profile/63703	laurablum	Volunteer	5	12/27/2010	I volunteered several times with Nightwatch this past fall, and I have to say it was an incredible experience. Living in Portland, one sees the effects of homelessness every day, but it's easy to just walk on by a person panhandling in the street and just pretend like you didn't see anything. Nightwatch has given me the opportunity to meet Portland's homeless and street population, have coffee with them, enjoy a game of Scrabble, and just hang out in a relaxed atmosphere. It's truly opened my eyes to the reality of homelessness and the simple truth that people without homes are human beings, just like you and me, struggling to make it through each day. The people who run Nightwatch are dedicated, organized, and truly passionate about their cause. It's a wonderful organization that deserves more recognition and a lot more funding. I've had a great time volunteering with Nightwatch, and I hope to continue volunteering there.

Operation Nightwatch Portland	58849		/users/profile/62999	Faith	Volunteer	5	12/16/2010	Operation Nightwatch has been helping people for over 25 yrs. They help to show the homeless of Portland that they are accepted. What we do is make them feel really welcome when they come in for a few hours to get out of the cold. Where else do they get to feel welcome? Usually they are unwelcome by  society. I know how much the people appreciate Nightwatch. I have been involved for several yrs. off, & on.  I always enjoy myself when I go. 
Operation Nightwatch Portland	58835		/users/profile/62972	Maddy G.	Volunteer	5	12/15/2010	I have been volunteering with Nightwatch in some capacity since I was in the 4th grade, then as a Girl Scout, involved in making the stockings that have become a staple of the annual Holiday Party, and now as a volunteer at the center.Over the past 17 years I have come to truly love and appreciate the work that is being done at Nightwatch.  Although recently, I have not been as regular a volunteer as I would have liked I still feel as though my time and input are valued when I do make it down to the center.  I have also come to understand how much hard work and dedication it takes to make Nightwatch happen, from organizing and encouraging volunteer attendance to moving sites, to caring for each and every guest.When people ask me about Nigthwatch it's always a challenge to explain to them what exactly "it" is, we're so much more than just a hospitality center.  Beyond offering coffee and sandwiches to our guests Nightwatch serves as a solid and consistent part of many of our guests' lives, something many of them would not otherwise have.  This consistency comes in the form of caring volunteers and regular staff members that are always there to lend an ear, share a story or just play a game of Pictionary.And, although we have always been affiliated with a church, most recently St. Stephen's, I have really appreciated the fact that we are not a religious organization, nor do we attempt to "preach" to our guests.  I believe that Nightwatch, as an organization, has become a pillar of downtown Portland; giving guests the opportunity to get a warm cup of coffee, get out of the weather and volunteers the opportunity to meet members of a community that are too often dismissed as less than worthy of our attention.  
Operation Nightwatch Portland	58834		/users/profile/62968	John Hardy	Volunteer	5	12/15/2010	I have been a Night Watch volunteer for about three years.  I am amazed at just how popular and well-supported this homeless ministry has been.  The Executive Director, Gary Davis, has done an outstanding job of taking this program to the next level in terms of different services offered.  Not only does Night Watch offer "in-house" hospitality at a well-established church facility, the program also offers mobile services reaching out to those well outside the city's core.  I am excidted to be a part of this program, and I look forward to the continued growth of Night Watch services in the future.

Lead Safe America is a perfect example of this. In just a couple of clicks, I was able to identify a local OSHA contact who is able to be a resource to me and my wife regarding an imminent lead exposure event in our neighborhood, resulting from a proposed demolition.

Lead Safe America's Foundation, not only guided me through how to apply for testing through my county program. But also sent out 50 Lead Safe Buttons and kits for me to pass out to neighbors and friends in our early 1900s neighborhood suburb of Cleveland, Ohio. We were able to stop the lead poisoning and slowly working on recovering our baby. And were able to help 10 other families discover lead paint on their porches, windows and trim that prevented other children and families from being poisoned in our neighborhood...Tamara's website and facebook group have been such an amazing source of information and resources. I've been able to share what we've learned over the past year with hundreds of families on our local parents facebook group, Cleveland Parenting Network, Ohio Crunchy Mamas, reaching over 3,500 families in Cleveland alone. We recently relocated to Denver, Colorado and along with that I'm continuing my outreach to get more information out for families with small children to be aware of lead dangers and how to deal with them once identified.

We were completely unaware how dangerous lead was, especially to toddlers.  Luckily we found Lead Safe America. Tamara was nice enough to have a conversation with me about abatement options and testing my children. She also invited me to join a lead paint parents group and it was extremely helpful to connect with others in the same situation. As we navigated the challenges with lead, I often turned to the resources provided by the Lead Safe Foundation. We just moved back into our house after a several month long abatement project.  Because of the knowledge I gained from the foundation and Tamara, my kids have never tested positive for lead. I'm forever grateful. Thanks Tamara and all who work at the foundation!

She found us through the internet and even though they're states away from each other, she finally felt like she was being helped. Every day people contact Tamara Rubin, executive director, for help just like this woman. It is unfortunate that lead is still an issue but maybe with LSAF providing unbiased, knowledgeable information learned through first hand experience then the tides for change will start to turn. LSAF offers support for families, free screening tools, educational resources, XRF analysis, and has been working on a documentary film in order to further their reach. This a mostly volunteer run organization, and for six years Tamara has been tireless and relentless in her efforts in making this possible. Go Lead Safe America!
Lead Safe America Foundation	281750	1	/users/profile/371811	Writer	Client Served	5	03/05/2016	This organization has been invaluable as I've waded through removing lead from my home. My daughter was lead poisoned, and I heard back from Tamara Rubin before I heard back from my pediatrician. She helped me assess my source points, gave advice on removing contamination sources, suggested local organizations and companies that could help, and connected me with a support group of other families experiencing the same issue. She is so passionate about preventing this from happening to more children. It is a silent epidemic, as lead is invisible to the naked eye, and it is hiding in so many places. She has compiled the most thorough research on her website and assists people navigate their local regulations and resources. Her documentary, mislead, is a great educational tool to broaden awareness of this issue. I'm so thankful for Tamara, and the leadsafe america foundation.

She is tirelessly accessible, rooted in science, and easy to understand. No concern is too small (a suspect dish?) or too large (renovations on antique homes). Think you know your lead? She will point out potential areas of concern in a home you maybe hadn't thought about, and she'll walk you through a clearance wipe like no other.

It's been about 17 mos now and he lost everything almost the ability to walk. He was at 38. We had NO long term education.no short term. We found somewhere. That upping his calcium, iron, veggies , fruits and lots of exercise would help lower it. Well, we have done these things and every two mos we have had the blood work done. As of 2 weeks ago it was 10! Yay. He's been in school since he turned 3 and he's 3 yrs 7 mos and you would never had known he had/has lead poisoning. We rented the old farm and never thought of it. This is a great foundation. I wish we knew about it durning our darkest times but, I will spread the word to help others!  Iwe will become a donators. Thank you for what you do.

One phone call in December 2014 changed my life. It was on this day that I discovered that my daughter's neurological and physical symptoms were due to lead poisoning. There are no other agencies or organizations (state or private) that are as well prepared to provide immediate support, crisis intervention and  assistance. The organization helped to point me in the correct direction in order to find the source of our lead as well as ways to help support my daughter medically and nutritionally to reduce her blood lead level. The level of personal attention, scientifically sound advice and genuine concern is unparalleled. I have referred other parents to Lead Safe America. They truly are helping to save lives. I have become a monthly donor as I believe in the organization and feel strongly that the services that they provide (and upcoming documentary) should be available to all.

I became a monthly donor to give back to them what I can & show my appreciation for them. I also became an advocate for LSAF as preventing this epidemic of childhood lead poisoning is something I feel very strongly about.  Lead make parents crazy & we need support that our local county cannot provide for us. Its also extremely benificial to be able to talk to other families across the country to hear their stories, what their doctors are saying and doing & to just simply learn from one another in anyway possible. Thank you LSAF for your commitment to our children. Its amazing to me how humans who do not know one another can be so kind & helpful!!!  Please help us to...

Her presentation was so impactful and heartfelt that I began following her crusade right there. When she invited me to join her on a emergency project in New Orleans to help a family with lead poisoned kids, I didnt hesitate to bring my tools and sleeping bag and fly across the country to work with the other 2 companies she recruited to make the home lead safe. The story of Lead Safe America Foundations growth is like the childrens story of Stone Soup; from such a sparsely-funded operation comes professional services spreading from international education to direct support for US families in desperate need.

I thought we were well-informed! I was so wrong! The LSAF has the most up-to-date information available and Tamara's dedication to the families she serves is to be commended.  The LSAF sent us a few new test kits for places I grew suspicious about and we learned that despite going through the state lead hazard reduction program, we still had significant lead hazards in our home and are learning how to deal with those until we are able to move.  This is an organization bringing much needed awareness to America, that lead poisoning is real, it is on-going, it has profound effects on development even at low levels, it is not just found in low-income families, it is still in our schools and playgrounds and it is effecting the potential of all the future generations of America.

They were the only people that would help me through the long step by step process of making our home safe.  We didn't qualify for the federal grant so the people who normally help in these situations wouldn't help us.  Our doctor was at a loss on how to help us and the city refused to do anything more than give us pamphlets on how to make our house safe if we wish to remodel.  Our daughter was poisoned by simply opening and closing the windows in our home.  We were not renovating.  LSAF directed us on how to find qualified contractors and how to go about the remodel that we ended up having to do since her levels only continued to rise in our home.  
Lead Safe America Foundation	250842		/users/profile/338739	abermouse68	General Member of the Public	5	07/31/2015	     My daughter had a lead level that was over the level of concern for two and a half to three years of her life due to the lack of information and help we had been getting from our then pediatricians . The continued exposure was of great concern to us, but moving seemed impossible, so we tried to find someone, anyone who could help us get her lead level down and know if moving was really necessary. I was introduced to Tamara and Lead Safe America by a local lead prevention product manufacturer.  Lead Safe America turned our lives around, providing the sound opinion that moving to a new house would be best, and Tamara Rubin even came to the new home we rented and tested it from top to tail for us before we moved in, pointing out the hazards and helping us remove anything toxic. This included our bath tub, which is chalking lead and needs to be re-done. We keep our daughter out of there until it will be fixed. Our child no longer has a lead level detectable by a Lead Care test, meaning its below a three at the least now. A blood draw test will be done soon to see where it is now. We owe so much to Lead Safe America and Tamara for the safety of our daughter, and have gotten the education and resources we desperately needed to get her lead level down. I feel that we would not have gotten the help we needed anywhere else, our local agencies were useless when we tried to get help from them. This organization is essential to America, helps hundreds of people like us each year. One day i would like to see it go global.

Lead Safe America Foundation	248616	3	/users/profile/336368	JinSF	Client Served	5	07/16/2015	When I was pregnant and slowly realizing my 1906 home had lead paint and what that really meant, I turned to the internet for information. There was shockingly little detail to be found. But I found Lead Safe America and Tamara Rubin, the delightful and fierce powerhouse who is single-handedly helping thousands of families every year with education, resources, testing, support, even fundraising -- to take action when they have learned that their child or their home tested positive for lead. There is so much misinformation out there, and so much downplaying of the problem, especially when it is more convenient and cheaper for contractors to brush off the problem. And the government programs have inadequate funding to be of any real help, much of the time. Tamara somehow manages to be this resource on a shoestring - struggling for funding and putting her own needs aside to help others. Tamara has done the research, has the network of experts, and is THE definitive resource for reliable information on things like: what blood lead level is really a concern (since different states and different doctors give a variety of answers)? what do lead-safe practices really look like and what should I be insisting upon with my contractor? what is clearance testing and why do it? what interim measures can I take NOW before I can either get my kids out of my lead-positive home, or get the lead abated? what kind of lead hazards should I be aware of for my kids other than the lead paint in my home? how do I use a lead test kit? will water and vinegar work to wash my floors with lead dust? ... and the list goes on! Thanks to Tamara I have managed to PREVENT lead poisoning in my son, first despite living in a home with lead paint, then despite renovating that home, moving back in after the renovation, and even despite more than one incident with nearby neighbors having their (lead paint) exteriors repainted and creating a lead hazard on my property. I truly believe I would not have known how to keep my son safe if Tamara had not been there to talk me through it (over the phone, text, Facebook messages, etc). The information just is not out there in the detail and clarity she has to offer. Lead Safe America is an absolute gem. Thank you Tamara!

I took it for granted since so many of my students in Milwaukee were lead poisoned.  Giving out pamphlets wasn't enough and over the years I increased my advocacy against lead but always felt there needs to be more.  When I met Tamara Rubin and Lead Safe America a few years ago I was thrilled that there finally was someone who was doing more!  Her documentary sums it up so well and her website and organization is an excellent reference when I try to tell others about the dangers of lead.  Three years retired I am still a vocal advocate and I am so lucky to have Tamara to go the extra mile with added information!  I hope her documentary is finished and released soon for all to see.  Her stories and pictures make it so easy to warn others about this danger that needs to end.  Knowledge is power.  Thank you Tamara for sharing this powerful message!
Lead Safe America Foundation	248517	6	/users/profile/336249	LeslieKung	Client Served	5	07/15/2015	I got in contact with Tamara and Lead Safe America years ago when I was looking for resources for my lead poisoned son. She helped us from far away, giving us ideas and resources for years as we struggled to manage the lead hazard in our home. Our second child was born and grew to be a toddler as we renovated, applied for grants and were turned down, and tried to create safe zones in our house and remediate lead with our low income and high-stress life. When our third child tested high for lead, I knew we had failed. Every step we had taken just wasn't enough. It was then that Tamara saw my distress and offered to fly out to inspect our home, toys, dishes, and more for lead content, build a plan with us, help us raise funds, and help us on a very practical note. We appealed to friends to cover her costs, and she flew across the country to come give us the best, most practical, most evidenced-based advice in terms of how to proceed. I cannot thank Tamara and LSAF enough for the encouragement over the years, and for the visit during which she gave us specific knowledge and strategies. She is on the front lines, helping people prevent lead poisoning and helping families who have been harmed by lead.

Lead Safe America Foundation	248213	8	/users/profile/335912	Reghan W.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/13/2015	I have been fighting lead poisoning as a professional since 1997! I am a public health educator with the Wisconsin Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program and as such, work with local coalitions and individuals who raise awareness or provide services to families with young children to prevent or reduce exposure to lead and lead-based paint hazards. In my work we reach out to families but we can only understand the issue from an outsiders point of view. No one understands the tragedy of lead poisoning like a family experiencing it with their own children.  The Lead-Safe America Foundation has filled a much-needed niche, a parent educating other parents about what to expect, lending a compassionate ear and problem-solving to bring about a better future for them and their children. Tamara Rubin is a force to be reckoned with and has led this fight almost single-handedly and against much opposition. She has helped so many families, giving them a voice in their own struggle. For the last few years she has been filming a documentary on those families struggles and her own quest for answers on why this disease is still so prevalent in the U.S., and largely ignored or thought to be solved. In 2011, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lost funding to fight lead poisoning and thus many states had to abandon their, up til then, successful efforts to reduce the numbers of children affected by lead. At the same time that CDC lowered its definition of lead poisoning from a blood lead level of 10 micrograms per deciliter (mcg/dL)  to 5 mcg/dL, Congress voted to eliminate funding to states. One lead advocate, Jerome Paulson, professor at George Washington State University and chair of the environmental health committee of the America Academy of Pediatrics, described it this way, Its as though they are declaring victory in a war that has not been won!  There were so many things I still wanted to accomplish in the lead poisoning prevention arena as I faced the potential of my position ending. One day I made a bucket list to keep my spirits up. On my list was to see someone make a documentary on childhood lead poisoning. Tamara Rubin must have read my mind! As she travels across the country sharing the movie, testing products for lead with her XRF machine and moderating panel discussions with experts and parents affected by lead, she has had the most profound effect on raising awareness than all of our state and local programs combined! And the families are so grateful--to have her expertise and empathy.

When she saw the high lead levels in my kids AND my husband, she came to our home to locate the root of the problem. The problem was an extremely toxic front porch. She could have stopped that point, but she found experts who properly encapsulated the lead and she worked with them for a week while my family moved out for the duration. My family is so grateful she helped us lower our blood lead levels before more serious permanent brain damage occurred.  To make things sweet, our new baby has not tested high for lead. 
Lead Safe America Foundation	248151	8	/users/profile/335839	hwmielke	Board Member	5	07/12/2015	 I am writing this review because I have worked with and seen Tamara in action, putting a documentary film together, extending her hand to families and complete strangers to provide them with information and more importantly take safe actions to reduce lead and make homes and neighborhoods safer for children. Read the other reviews and you will gain an understanding about Tamara as a tour de force for improving the world for children.  She does this with a song and a prayer and a few donations. It is shameful that U.S. children do not have a government that is helpful in providing resources needed to prevent exposure to the lead dust that the same government allowed to accumulate in the environment. Children are paying the price with their brain development and long term health. But we do have Tamara and Lead Safe America and they need commitment of ongoing donations to continue with their helping hands and support for the children of the nation.   For full disclosure I am a member of the Board of the Lead Safe America Foundation. I am also on the faculty of the Tulane University School of Medicine and I have been an active participant in lead research since the mid-1970's. I urge you to join me in giving recurring donations to Lead Safe America Foundation, non-profit. It is important. If a large number of people would give just a few dollars a month, Tamara could continue, uninterrupted, with her lead prevention mission for children. 
Lead Safe America Foundation	248136	6	/users/profile/335820	Avis_hill	Client Served	5	07/12/2015	This non-profit has been a life changer to our family...and I mean that in a literal sense! They have shown us nothing but love and understanding. We have been able to get more support through LeadSafe America than other resources offered to us from the State and County. The best part about this non-profit is the personal dedication from the team at LeadSafe America. My family and I live in a lil Ole town in Texas and they have reached out to us all they way from Oregon. Tamara and her team are phenomenal and we would be in absolute chaos in without their guidance to a LeadSafe home and lifestyle. We are so grateful.
Lead Safe America Foundation	248127	6	/users/profile/335811	PortlandJess	Client Served	5	07/11/2015	I heard about Lead Safe America Foundation through a friend and decided to have a testing party at my house. I invited several friends over and they all brought bins of household items, toys, jewelry, etc to be tested for lead. Tamara came to my house with her XRF instrument and tested all of our items.  We were shocked to find out how many of the things we used daily were high in lead!  She left some lead check swabs at my house and I continued to test items around my house. I then found out that our clawfoot tub that my daughter takes baths in daily was leaching lead!  Without Lead Safe America Foundation, I never would have been aware of these hazards to our family. Our home is much safer now that we have been educated and removed these lead hazards. I love Lead Safe America Foundation!

Volunteer	5	07/11/2015	I had been following Tamara and the Lead Safe Foundation for about a year when we discovered that out then 15 month old had been lead poisoned. Because of them we were able to quickly determine many lead hazards in our home, and work swiftly to remove him from the home, and any other objects from his reach. Keys, toys, pottery, old furniture. Tamara and Lead Safe America have provided continuous support and education to us and others, and we are eternally grateful. Jon and Briar Fishman

Now I know to take precautions with my home and young children.  I also know to clean thoroughly after doing any kind of work on the place (a 1971 condo). Thank you for the knowledge and inspiration! I hope to share this info with many and help prevent lead poisoning! 
Lead Safe America Foundation	244933	7	/users/profile/331991	Beth138	Board Member	5	06/09/2015	Anywhere in the U.S, Canada or planet earth, you can contact LSAF with lead problems, at no cost.  LSAF runs edge-cutting programs to educate the public about lead.  With very very little funding, LSAF has increased programs, raised funds for lead poisoned families to move to lead safe housing and moved the line in the lead poisoned sand to make changes in people's everyday lives to make them lead safe.   Please do support LSAF with a donation so the organization can mail free lead testing kits to families, to keep the phones on for the response team and to continue moving the line until we prevent the poisoning and damage to children everywhere.  Thank you.
Lead Safe America Foundation	244881	6	/users/profile/331920	SSIG	Client Served	5	06/09/2015	When my daughter was poisoned by our home and my family (Husband, toddler, 2 exchange students, 3 dogs, 2 cats and myself) became homeless in an attempt to lower my daughters levels, The Lead Safe America Foundation was there.  They gave us advice on the steps to take to remediate the problem with our house when local authorities refused to help.  They have provided undying and still ongoing support for all the medical and behavioral issues that have followed after the poisoning even when the medical personnel where we live didnt want to be bothered.  I honestly dont know what my family would have done without the support and information that was given to us by LSAF.  In turn I now volunteer in my community on behalf of the foundation, educating families in an area because older homes and lead poisoning is prevalent but ignored by city officials and professionals.  Through my business I have been able to provide support for families and help them save their children from extended exposure and repeated poisoning by using what the foundation taught me and passing that information and list of resources on to them.  I know many of the families that I have met online through the support group also do what I do and help others in their community with the knowledge and resources that they have gained from the LSAF.  This foundation is such an amazing resource for parents in a very terrifying and frightening time in their lives I can only hope that all parents in this situation are able to find them in their hour of need.

Oregon Environmental Council	314059		/users/profile/405417	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/24/2016	Oregon Environmental Council is a wonderful organization.  They do amazing work to ensure Oregon is a healthy place for every single person.  I have volunteered with OEC for nearly two years, and it has been a great experience.  The staff were very welcoming when I reached out to them two years ago to offer my time.  They have offered me a range of ways that I could contribute my time, and I jumped at the opportunities on many occasions.  It is so fulfilling to be able to take an active part in making this state great. I appreciate OEC, not only for their willingness and trust to let volunteers help in so many different ways, but also for making us volunteers feel a part of the OEC family.
Oregon Environmental Council	313629		/users/profile/404983	MTDonor	Donor	5	10/23/2016	I have supported OEC for over 10 years now. They consistently and effectively bring together Oregonians, who often have differing political perspectives, to find solutions to our most pressing environmental issues. The staff and board are smart, committed, and incredibly passionate about protecting this place that I love.
Oregon Environmental Council	313015		/users/profile/404386	crall	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/21/2016	My organization collaborates with OEC on state transportation policy. In my experience, OEC staff are knowledgeable, pragmatic, and hardworking. This combination of qualities enables OEC to be extremely effective at improving policies in ways that will improve the environment and improve Oregonians' lives.
Oregon Environmental Council	312196		/users/profile/403555	Jennifer599	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/19/2016	OEC has a long track record of driving big changes in Oregon, and it continues to be innovative and assertive in taking on emerging issues. I've been very impressed with its work to get toxins out of kids' products and create healthier daycares, protect clean water, and fight climate change. They are very smart and politically adept, and also exceptionally fair and balanced in the way they approach issues and create solutions that benefit Oregonians--from underresourced communities to businesses/employers. Their team is 100% committed. The updates they send are great summaries of what's happening in the environmental movement in Oregon.
Oregon Environmental Council	309907		/users/profile/401256	Writer	Board Member	5	10/12/2016	OEC's ability to talk across industries and aisles is impressive! Conversations surrounding climate policy are seen through the lens of equity, diversity and inclusion - which is encouraging when we continue to see underprivileged communities disproportionally affected by climate change. From the Bottle Bill to the Clean Fuels Act, OEC is working towards a better Oregon for all!
Oregon Environmental Council	309240		/users/profile/400604	Gixta10	General Member of the Public	5	10/09/2016	I had the opportunity to intern at OEC this year and I loved it. I learned so much about environmental justice and the work being done by OEC. Throughout my experience there, I felt loved and supported. I appreciated the staff's honesty and desire to learn and grow. They were very flexible with my work schedule and always made sure that I felt supported. I am greatful for the opportunity I had this summer as an intern at OEC.

They do a particularly great job making policy to find ways to better the quality of life of all Oregonians, and their work usually achieves what it aims for, or at least puts up a fight to try and do so.   The people I was working with was very resourceful and helpful, they took the time to get to know me and involve me in interesting projects.  They are growing and trying to expand their cultural competency, supporting the conversation around diversity, equity and inclusion, which I think is great.  
Oregon Environmental Council	308894		/users/profile/400269	momoerlins	Volunteer	5	10/07/2016	OEC works to protect the quality of life of all Oregonians on all fronts.

Oregon Environmental Council	308879		/users/profile/400255	Writer	Board Member	5	10/07/2016	I was first introduced to Oregon Environmental Council when I was serving in the Oregon legislature. OEC impressed me then as a thoughtful leader among Oregon's environmental community, with a balanced approach to environmental issues. As an OEC board member now, I am proud of OEC's commitment to the environment, to environmental equity and its record of achievement in the Capitol and across the state.  OEC is a small organization that "punches above its weight" on account of the dedication and commitment of its staff and the strong network of volunteers who support it.

I am excited to now be a board member, and in this position I have a very clear line of sight to the workings of the organization.  The management and staff of OEC are among the smartest and most dedicated non-profit teams I have ever seen. OEC's on-going successes in the areas of climate, toxics and water speak for themselves. Oregonians can rely on OEC to continue the forward momentum in these key areas of environmental concern.

Their execution and results should speak for themselves. Oregonians may not realize how much work it takes to keep our state beautiful and our families safe. OEC is doing that work: from championing clean air policy to safe water and consumer products free from toxic chemicals, we're lucky to have a champion like this in our state. I've worked with several staff members on projects, and to a person, they are hardworking, passionate and smart. Keep up the great work!
Oregon Environmental Council	254979	1	/users/profile/343338	DavidMichaelSmith	Volunteer	5	09/04/2015	The Oregon Environmental Council has changed the landscape in our state, in terms of raising awareness about the urgency of dealing with climate change. Perhaps more importantly, they engage citizen participation in the legislative process, and were instrumental during the last session of the state legislature in getting a comprehensive clean fuels bill passed. I was able to participate in some of their demonstrations in our state capital of Salem, and it was uplifting to join with people in a wide range of ages who are deeply concerned about and committed to leaving the planet in good enough shape for future generations to be able to survive and thrive.  I highly recommend the OEC without reservation!David Michael Smith

Oregon Environmental Council	252912		/users/profile/341046	Ranch_Hands	Board Member	5	08/13/2015	OEC is arguably the most influential environmental organization in Oregon state, and is leading numerous policy and advocacy initiatives to clean up Oregon's air, land, and water. Their policy victories in Salem speak for themselves, but they are also an engaged and collaborative community member. OEC is also taking great strides to draw a wider swath of Oregonians into environmental and social justice dialogues, ensuring that healthier environments also lead to healthier communities and citizens. I am privileged to be a member of OEC's Emerging Leaders Board, and it is clear that OEC's vision is also gaining major traction with millenials, not to mention the state's business community. Expect to see OEC at the front of the environmental pack for years to come.

Oregon Environmental Council	241501	1	/users/profile/328071	cbmd	General Member of the Public	5	04/21/2015	I love OEC.  I discovered OEC as a physician.  OEC was dealing with health and environmental threats outside of the mainstream, separating out the real problems backed by good research from the flakey, before these real issues were acknowledged by mainstream health and science professionals. As  long as I have been involved, I have not seen them compromise their principles.  The conferences are great, great speakers and topics, and they practice what they preach about health and environment in the delicious lunches that go with them.  For me, one of the most important things about OEC, is I feel comfortable referring to information from OEC when discussing issues with my medical colleagues ie I trust OEC to only put forth legitimate information, based in good science.

I knew little about the organization at the time but have learned a great deal since. OEC has made a difference for the people of Oregon by helping the state become a model for effective environmental policies that enrich the lives of all citizens. OEC helps get things done. It accomplishes its goals not only by making persuasive arguments but also by helping to empower people to achieve results that positively impact their lives. And it does all of this within a work environment that promotes initiative, collaboration and fun. OEC is a great asset to Oregon and an exemplary organization that others can learn from.

This small group of individuals has a large impact on any campaign they set their sights on. We are in the fourth year of a campaign where OEC has provided the strategy, coordination, technical expertise and outreach that is all needed to move the needle on an issue. When my organization is talking about other campaigns, I frequently find myself referencing the successful models I've seen implemented by OEC.

The team effort here is no small item: OEC is at the forefront of coalition building for positive environmental change across the entire state of Oregon.  Their efforts may not  be of the flashy type so often hyped by some members of the environmental community, but they are real; backed by good science and built to last. I call this good work and I applaud OEC for tackling tough issues and designing programs that really work.  Thanks guys!!

What attracted me to the organization was its fact-based collaborative approach.  Over the years I have volunteered, served on the Board of Directors, and since my retirement from the board have worked with its staff on a wide range of issues that involve agriculture and Oregon's continued sustainable development.  With nearly 30 years of experience working with the organization, I have come to rely on OEC as both authoritative and flexible in seeking long term solutions to the challenges facing both urban and rural Oregonians. Jock Mills
Oregon Environmental Council	219817		/users/profile/283445	JeanneLawson	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/03/2014	I manage civic engagement processes on major public policy issues. OEC has consistently been one of the most important participants in these processes because they are so effective and respected. Whether sitting on an advisory committee, bringing issues before agencies and decision makers, working one-on-one with peers and/or those who would be seen as "opponents," OEC staff and board members have always been among the most productive at achieving real progress in public policy. This is not only because they are effective at articulating and advocating for their positions, but because they know how to work in collaborative processes to seek and find solutions that are genuinely viable in the short term, while making sure decision-makers and other parties don't lose sight of the long-term goals.

Their focus on identifying critical problems and thinking through innovative and practical solutions makes them an obvious leader in the Northwest. One of OEC's most admirable qualities is the skill with which the organization builds statewide and regional coalitionsbringing together stakeholders from diverse backgrounds and with often diverging intereststo successfully address pressing environmental challenges.

Oregon Environmental Council	201316		/users/profile/262783	Nathan Howard	Volunteer	5	05/29/2014	The OEC is an incredibly effective and welcoming organization. For 46 years they have pushed Oregon to be national leader on environmental policies and they have succeeded. I have seen firsthand the work they do on the frontlines to advance groundbreaking legislation ranging from disclosing toxic chemicals that are in everyday products to developing statewide carbon pricing policies to help tackle climate change.  And the OECs work environment and staff arent too shabby either  the organization has twice been named the best nonprofit to work for in Oregon.

The issues OEC tackles intertwine in the fact that they are all environmental issues that have a tangible impact on the every day lives of Oregonians.

I was particularly impressed by their initiatives in this recent legislative session to introduce and advocate for important new policies and laws related to toxic chemicals in children's toys. Their deliberate, thoughtful work to secure a cleaner, safer future for Oregon is greatly needed in the hyper-partisan, gridlocked world of local politics, and they are an excellent organization to endow to ensure Oregon continues to lead the nation in prudent stewardship of a healthy environment.

Does this organization have a realistic and measurable strategic plan to guide them and help them achieve their goals?2. What measurable results has the organization achieved in the past? What is their track record?3.

Oregon Environmental Council	151926		/users/profile/202912	sebrody	Volunteer	5	04/02/2013	I have worked with the Oregon Environmental Council for more than 30 years as a volunteer.  I also served on the board for 6+ years. This is a great organization with dedicated and talented staff, strong leadership and innovative approaches to difficult environmental issues.  I have been especially impressed with the initiatives OEC has undertaken to limit exposure to toxics and to protect water quality in Oregon's rivers.  The organization works in a very collaborative way with a variety of organizations--business, industry and other nonprofits-- to promote solutions that are good for both the environment and the economy of Oregon.  OEC is active at the state policy level in advocating for laws that protect the environment, while, at the same time, educating  citizens about specific actions that can be taken on a daily basis to achieve positive environmental outcomes. 
Oregon Environmental Council	241624		/users/profile/328222	boutaa84,	Volunteer	5	04/23/2015	OEC is the first nonprofit I've been a long-time volunteer for (2 years!), and I plan on continuing my involvement as long as I am a resident of Oregon. In addition to giving my time, I also choose to donate to OEC on a monthly basis. Not only is OEC a driving force to preserve the health of the Oregon we love, but also a great organization to be an advocate for. I can't say enough wonderful things about the positive changes OEC is making, and also the genuine staff that personify the values of the organization.
Oregon Environmental Council	148777		/users/profile/198156	HappyOregonian	Volunteer	5	01/31/2013	I have been a volunteer with OEC for three months. Staffs are very warm, helpful and always appreciate efforts made by their interns and volunteers. I started with researching on water related projects and later, the event planning team graciously brought me on board for assistance with their annual event. They have great volunteer/intern coordination to ensure the interests of volunteer/intern are met. It is amazing how OEC, as a tight organization, is capable of working on a variety of environmental issues, reaching out to the public/community, and moving environmental agenda forward in the legislature/policy side. I have learned a lot on water policy issues, as well as operation of non-profit organization. It has been a very rewarding experience for me to volunteer for OEC.
Oregon Environmental Council	147018		/users/profile/194135	andrea.sharpstrategies	Advisor	5	12/19/2012	OEC has an extraordinary model for moving the environmental agenda forward in Oregon. I'm so impressed with their structure and their depth of expertise by their program directors. They understand the crossroads between policy and politics and always shoot for that next horizon. I loved working for them when I was their legislative director for four years and enjoy the continued relationship as their contract lobbyist.
Oregon Environmental Council	124424		/users/profile/169269	warren.fish	Client Served	5	10/03/2012	I recently worked with the Oregon Environmental Council to help Multnomah County move ahead on a hazardous chemical reduction strategy we call our Healthy Purchasing Initiative.  Support from OEC's outstanding staff--including policy research and stakeholder coordination--was instrumental in moving the project forward.  It has been great for me and for the county to have their help over the last several years on a whole range of issues.  OEC is a partner we know we can count on and I highly recommend them.  
Oregon Environmental Council	112160		/users/profile/152619	Woodstock	Volunteer	5	05/16/2012	As an event planning and development intern at Oregon Environmental Council, I had a chance to interact with all of the staff. The staff culture and work culture are the best I have ever seen. The quality of the work they produce is top-notch, and I believe it is a reflection of that organizational culture. OEC's program priorities will truly protect the state I love for my grandchildren's grandchildren. OEC is one of the most impressive non-profits I've ever come across, and I'll continue to support them as long as I am an Oregon resident. Volunteers will have a wonderful experience with OEC and volunteering is a great way to contribute to this magnificent organization.

They fill an important niche that other environmental and health groups do not.  They take complicated subjects and make them accessible so that people can understand them and take action.  I appreciate the leadership role that they've taken especially on the topic of green chemistry.  OEC staff have been a great resource and sounding board for me.
Oregon Environmental Council	110723		/users/profile/150713	LocalOrganicNW	Volunteer	5	04/25/2012	I had the opportunity to volunteer with the Oregon Environmental Council for 8 months on a project-by-project basis (i.e. anti-idling campaign report and municipal sustainability progress report), and it truly was an honor and privilege to do so. This is a group of dedicated and passionate sustainability professionals both inside and outside the office, and I highly recommend collaboration with the OEC whether as a volunteer or via partnership. Their work makes a difference, volunteers are involved in hands-on projects relative to their interests, and the learning potential is seemingly endless.
Oregon Environmental Council	110591	1	/users/profile/150537	Sarah Thomas	Donor	5	04/23/2012	Oregon Environmental Council works to create a healthy environment for all Oregonians, whether it's lobbying to get rid of BPA in baby bottles, working to clean up Oregon's rivers, educating citizens about the importance of buying food grown locally and working to help people reduce their effect on Climate Change. These are just a few of the things OEC does for Oregon and Oregonians.
Oregon Environmental Council	110450	1	/users/profile/150363	Joan10	Volunteer	5	04/21/2012	I am a long time member of the Oregon Environmental Council, as well as a financial supporter, because of the valuable work this organization does.  OEC retains a dedicated and skilled staff, experts in their individual fields, while at the same time skillful management keeps operating costs low.  They have an excellent record with both programs and policy work.  I have tracked their success' over the years and I've noticed that their particular skill is bringing people together to make things happen.  The everchanging environmental agenda, along with a fluid political scene requires skill, tact, commitment and long hours of work all of which they seem to do gladly and efficiently.  Oregon is well rewarded by their record of success.                           P.S.

Oregon Environmental Council	110030		/users/profile/149861	ebarnhardt	Volunteer	5	04/17/2012	I volunteered as a design intern at OEC last summer. From the first day on, I was so inspired by the staff's passion for their work. They are dedicated, intelligent, kind, funny, and creative, among other things. I couldn't have asked for better people to work with. I didn't want to leave when the summer ended and I had to return to classes. I learned so much, not only about design, but also about important environmental issues in Oregon. Thank you OEC for such a fantastic experience!
Oregon Environmental Council	110000	1	/users/profile/149823	cpthomas	Donor	5	04/17/2012	We became members of Oregon Environmental Council in the early 1970s, when it first was created.  I worked in the Oregon Legislature in 1971, when Oregon passed its initial "bottle bill" with OEC as the prime sponsor.  Over the years, OEC consistently has been at the forefront of those working to protect and enhance the environment, advocating its positions strongly while retaining credibility as a sophisticated "non-fringe" organization.

Her presentations are fantastic and inspirational, and give us the 'cold hard truth' a in straightforward and easy to understand way. These presentations are spreading a very important message into the hands of the community.

It shows that all of OEC is intelligent and in the loop about all the current topics. Its great getting to know the team!  With such interesting research ideas, I'll continue to contact OEC for the educational  opportunity in working with my community....sustainably!
Oregon Environmental Council	109966		/users/profile/149777	westcoastcrafty	General Member of the Public	5	04/16/2012	I first found out about OEC in 2010, when I was concerned about bisphenol-A in children's products and food, and found out that Oregon was considering a ban on BPA. I connected with OEC when I wanted to testify as a citizen at the Legislature in Salem in February 2010, as well as writing letters to the editor and calling representatives. After that bill failed, I testified again in 2011, again with helpful support and resources from OEC. After that statewide bill failed narrowly, a similar one was considered in Multnomah County. I was able to testify as a citizen and this ban passed unanimously and has now gone into effect as law. OEC has shared resources and studies that illustrate the concerns of chemicals in consumer products, let citizens know when crucial hearings or votes take place, and worked tirelessly to make our community and environment safer. I'm so grateful for their studies and focus on dangerous chemicals. Not all of us are scientists or legislators but everyone deserves safe products and to participate in our political system. Thank you to OEC for everything they do.

Oregon Environmental Council	108951		/users/profile/148262	NeilS1	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/04/2012	Oregon Environmental Council is one of the leading conservation nonprofits in Oregon, and has a long history of being effective.  They do a good job bringing together the diverse aspects of the field:  human health, clean water, healthy food--and are affective at bringing policy change about.  A recent example is the Multnomah County ban on Bisphenol-A in child bottles and cups.  They're strategic thinkers, effective advocates, and good partners.
Oregon Environmental Council	108788		/users/profile/148066	hesterpaul	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/02/2012	I was an employee of OEC for 2.5 years, as the National Program Manager for the Eco-Healthy Child Care (EHCC) program. Created by OEC in 2005, EHCC helps early childhood learning environments be as healthy, safe and green as possible by reducing childrens exposure to toxic chemicals. I was hired in early 2008 to pilot this program in other states to confirm that the program model would succeed on a national scale. The EHCC program has proven to be highly effective in supporting child care professionals in making eco-healthy changes within child care settings. EHCC has received EPAs 2006 Childrens Environmental Health Excellence Award and the IPM Institute of North America, Inc. 2009-2010 Childcare and School IPM Recognition Award for its innovative and effective approach. In October of 2010, EHCC was transferred to Children's Environmental Health Network (CEHN), a national non-profit organization. OEC is a strong organization, with a clear mission and motivated and effective employees. The EHCC program is only one of their many successful efforts; a model which is now practiced and celebrated nationally.
Oregon Environmental Council	106486		/users/profile/143899	MattE	Board Member	5	02/15/2012	I began my time at OEC as an intern for a carbon reduction program and I was soon hired on part time after my internship was complete. I have since moved on from OEC but only after spending time on OEC's Emerging Leaders Board. I cannot speak highly enough of the value of that internship and board experience to both my professional and personal development.  While many friend's internships at other organizations resulted in boring administrative tasks and paperwork, I was given significant responsibility and creative freedom to work on the project.  It opened up so many doors, more than I could have ever imagined and I am lucky to have chosen a non-profit that does such important work for Oregon's environmental causes. OEC enacts real change in Oregon and truly safeguards what I care about most in the state. I highly recommend contacting and talking with the staff at OEC, regardless of whether you are interested in volunteering, interning or become a full time staff member.

Oregon Environmental Council	106073		/users/profile/142685	mgavin	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/06/2012	The Oregon Environmental Council sets the bar for state-level environmental advocacy.  A national leader on environmental policy at the state level, their work on protecting children and adults from the harmful effects of toxic chemicals in our everyday lives has been a model for other states, as has been their Eco-Healthy Child Care program.  For over 40 years they have worked tenaciously to protect Oregons environment and people.  But the importance of their work goes beyond the borders of the state.  Through their collaborative efforts, OECs innovative policies and programs and practices have helped states all over the country.  We are proud to work with the Oregon Environmental Council and appreciate how their work helps not only the people and environment in Oregon but contributes to good policy across the country, as well.

OEC has a bevy of interesting initiatives and programs that I found interesting, so I inquired about volunteering.  I was grateful that OEC made an effort to bring me on board and up to speed quickly, and I was impressed that staff brought a list of projects I could work on during my first meeting.

This agency contributes a wealth of knowledge to the community, as well as changing lives for the better - and the staff is incredible.  Working on the Media and Communications database I see many legislative successes and hope for the future.  Most of all - attention is focused on areas that are critical  - climate, water, food, air, energy alternatives, and so many other areas - that are so important for future generations, and they've been accomplishing this for 40 years with great positive effect.
Oregon Environmental Council	72864	1	/users/profile/79656	joeldippold	Volunteer	5	02/22/2011	As a graduate student in nonprofit management, I wanted to intern with an organization whose operations were of the highest caliber of professionalism, and I haven't been disappointed in any way with my experience at OEC.  A key element of professionalism, I think, is a focus on impact. It's easy--and dangerous--for staff to concentrate instead on internal operational efficiency and to lose sight of the bigger picture. But, maybe because it has such a passionate leadership team, staff at OEC do a pretty good job of keeping their daily activities aligned with the production of real-world results.  I'm involved with OEC's strategic planning effort right now, and it's inspiring to see the board in action--a great group of smart, passionate, and connected people. I'm looking forward to seeing the course they chart in the final plan, but I've already learned a lot from the process itself, and it's confirmed my sense that this really is a great nonprofit.
Oregon Environmental Council	37734	6	/users/profile/38429	gogreen1	Former Volunteer	5	04/30/2010	After my first year in college studying Environmental Engineering, I came back in the summer and interned with OEC for about three months.  I interned with the Development Team at OEC and did mainly prospect research along with various other tasks including help with events, grant proposals, and reports. The first thing that struck me most about OEC was how friendly and approachable everyone at the office was.  Everyone, amidst their very hectic schedules, was willing to take time out and help me with any of my questions.  Along with an excellent work environment, everyone there is so enthusiastic about their work and ultimately, saving the environment!  It was inspiring to intern with such passionate people who always came to work excited and ready for the day.  OEC has done and is working on many productive environmental projects that have pushed Oregon, and especially Portland, to the forefront of successful environmental action.  All in all, my experience with interning at OEC was unforgettable--the people and the work environment made interning their a lot of fun and really rewarding!

My first volunteer experience was at a home and garden expo providing information on the environmental benefits of rain gardens.

Our goals were to sign people up on the OEC email list, ask people to take a Love Your River survey to help OEC develop an educational outreach program for residents of nearby watersheds, and get people to sign a document encouraging reform of the Toxic Substances Control Act.  It was a fun and rewarding day, and it was great to learn about how active OEC is in environmental projects and reform in Oregon.  I hope to work with them again soon!

The Dreaming Zebra Foundation	299397	2	/users/profile/390302	Writer	Client Served	5	08/05/2016	WOW! Dreaming Zebra has been an incredible partner for Children's Healing Art Project (CHAP). They have made it possible for us to live our mission of bringing the healing power of art to children and families facing medical challenges by providing incredibly generous donations of brand-new art supplies, securing a huge gift card to our favorite art supply store and negotiating amazing prices with certain vendors of the items we need most.  In 2015 we provided over 11,000 healing art experiences; with their help, we think we can exceed that number for 2016. Because we deal with so many immune-suppressed children, having brand-new and wrapped supplies is a must. Dreaming Zebra has worked with us to be clear on what works well and doesn't work for our programming and has always come through with exactly what we need. We are so, SO grateful for this partnership!

Bradley Angle is  a local nonprofit that provides resources to survivors of domestic violence. Here at Bradley Angle, we believe that adults are not the only survivors of domestic violence, children are as well. Our Youth & Family Support Services helps child survivors and their parents through education, counseling, childcare and structured group activities including art therapy. We heard about The Dreaming Zebra Foundation and how great they were through a staff member. We were excited to reach out to partner with The Dreaming Zebra Foundation to see if they would supply art supplies to help the children that we serve. They were happy to do so. The staff and those that we were in communication with were helpful when applying for the support and coordinating the delivery. We provide youth groups and classes to over 400 child survivors in the age range of 5 to 13. They will all benefit from these great supplies. Thank you so much Dreaming Zebra for partnering with Bradley Angle as we continue our efforts in creating a community free of domestic violence. We look forward to continued partnership!

With their support and their ability to "make connections," we were delighted to engage in conversation that lead us to receiving the needed funds that will support our "2016 City School District of Albany Elementary Art Show" (3rd Annual). The show will be held from May 6-8, 2016 at our local art museum, the Albany Institute of History & Art. Last year's show had over 1,000 people walk through the exhibit! Our opening reception will continue to spotlight student artwork from all 12 elementary schools and will showcase student musical and dance performances during the opening reception. Albany Mayor Sheehan and City School District of Albany Interim Superintendent Wilkins will begin our opening with a warm welcome. All our students and their families are invited to come to the art show all weekend long to see the Institute's galleries and art exhibition, with free admission. Our students and their families will have the ability to walk through the galleries and see their artwork hang alongside famous artworks, rich in local history from the Hudson River School paintings to viewing Ancient Egyptian mummies. Not only are we appreciative of the Albany Institute for partnering with our Art and Music Dept., but we are thrilled to have the needed support of proceeds from Price Chopper supermarkets through the assistance of The Dreaming Zebra Foundation and D. Camera. We hope to grow this relationship in the years to come. We look forward to a wonderful event this year - thank you Dreaming Zebra for helping us make your acquaintance to form connections to serve and benefit our culturally diverse elementary children and their Fine Arts program in such a special and significant way. Sincerely, K. Wright, Art Dept. Chairperson, City School District of Albany, NY, https://www.albanyschools.com, https://www.facebook.com/albanyartscommittee/

I am writing this on behalf of the Forestville Boys and Girls Club, in Prince George's County Maryland. The Dreaming Zebra Foundation and its staff (who would rather not be mentioned, Hi Dawne!!!) have revitalized our Touch of Art community art program. With the generous donation of art supplies and consultation on how to sustain the program, we were able to start back offering art classes after a 16 month hiatus because of having a lack of resources. Upon receiving the donation from Dreaming Zebra, our membership voted to designate an operating budget for the Touch of Art community art program. Without the Dreaming Zebra Foundation's support, our kids would still continue to miss out on the much needed cultural and social development this program offers. Thank you Dreaming Zebra for your support.

Our son plays In the local band and we have been paying fees for him to participate in the band along with high rental fees for the instrument rental. Playing music is our son's greatest passion and we have not been in a financial position where we could afford for him to continue in the band. Due to the compassion and care of the Dreaming Zebra foundation our son has been able to remain in the band and focus on improving his skills.  He has been going through major medical issues with his heart and being able to remain in music lessons has given him some thing bright in his life to focus on.  The staff at Dreaming Zebra have helped us financially but have also been an amazing emotional support to us during this time.  Dreaming Zebra made an investment towards my son's future that will last throughout his lifetime.  Thank you for supporting this organization and helping to provide music and art education to the youth of this generation!

My annual buget for art supplies was $178, which I have yet to see.  I have aggressively been searching for support for my program. Of all the kids, in the country, alternative kids needs the arts the most. The arts help my students find inner confidence to reinvent themselves and find real success. This has been made possible through Dawne and the awesome support of the Dreaming Zebra Foundation--I am passionately searching for supplies and she is passionately searching for programs like mine. She is so great to work with, she asks so many great questions to help me prioritize my needs and she has been so kind, excited about the work and professional! THANK YOU DREAMING ZEBRA!

The  Resource Center of Somerset provides emergency shelter to families who are leaving a dangerous living situations.  To address the needs of the children in the safe house, a Residential Youth Program was started.   This program will be providing crisis-based counseling services for children of all ages, which includes art-based counseling activities. The primary goal of these services is to assist children in healing from the impact domestic violence has had on their families. As such, art supplies are greatly needed. All of these items donated by the Dreaming Zebra Foundation will be used during both individual and group counseling sessions with the children.  In addition to the therapeutic benefits of the materials, the art supplies will enable the children in shelter to engage in creative, everyday play. This play will provide a sense of normalcy to children who are experiencing an exceptionally tumultuous point in their lives.   Such a wonderful gift that will help so many lives!

They supported me when I was younger, and going through some really hard times. The supplies they donated allowed me to express myself with art, which really helped. This is important for everyone, especially kids who feel alone or misunderstood. Now I volunteer for them when I can. The work they do helps a lot of the poorest kids you can imagine who really need it, and and I would give them 10 stars if I could. If you donate to Dreaming Zebra you will know you're helping to change the lives of many kids who really need you.  -Jocelyn
The Dreaming Zebra Foundation	255732	2	/users/profile/344114	jolana	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/10/2015	I've run or helped run a number of non-profits in my day. Unfortunately I can no longer physically handle the work. That doesn't stop me from giving what I can to those non-profit organizations that can carry the work on for me. Dreaming Zebra Foundation is one of those rare gems that while hard to find sometimes, do extraordinary work in meeting their mission. The work done is all voluntary even Dawn (the Director) works voluntarily to get art supplies to children who otherwise go with nothing. Fostering a love of art, and building the ability to create in children's lives, that from the outside seem hopeless, fosters two very important things: the joy in creating something of beauty that can be shared with others, and the knowledge that if I can create something that came from my own mind, I can do more. It's that spark of knowing that allows children to believe that they can do more with their lives and are not trapped in a hopeless situation. Dreaming Zebra does that every day and with virtually every penny spent on children, not administration and salary expenses. Mind you, these folks deserve to be paid for what they do, and so I gladly give to them what I can to aid in their work. Bravo Dawn!

I was impressed with the depth of the foundation's role - finding art supplies to donate, finding great nonprofits who needed the art supplies all across the country, and working in Haiti with orphanages. Dreaming Zebra was my dream charity come true! Now that I've known and worked with founder Dawne for two years, I am even more impressed. Dawne works hard every day to make sure no art supply goes unused and that as many recipients as possible are matched with donors. I was very fortunate to be one got to deliver a donation - it was like playing Santa Claus! The entire process of matching the donor and recipient, the delivery set up, the follow through with the recipient and the donor - Dawne is very professional and wonderful to work with. Dawne's hard work is only matched by her passion for Dreaming Zebra's mission.

Dreaming Zebra has been an incredible ally in helping us realize our vision to deeply mentor and support these youth during their journeys off the streets. Specifically, Dreaming Zebra has been so responsive to our requests by providing much needed materials for the art workshops we use to create fun and engaging projects for these youths' positive artistic expressions. From mask-making materials used in our "p:ear Zombie Action Preparedness" program (PZAP) to paints and brushes for our "2160 Wood-Block Mural" Project (2160 refers to the number of 3"x3" wood panels used for this 9'x15' pixelated mural of a Van Gogh painting!) to glitter and feathers and beads to for everything else we do, they have been a model community partner and have made the difficult work of connecting with homeless youth that much easier.

Our organization provides art therapy to grieving children, and we are used to making do and stretching limited resources. She asked us for a wish list and then surprised us by fulfilling it in its entirety . . . . and more! Dawne is truly caring and responsive, and asked questions to make sure we got exactly what we need. Seeing the smiles of the teens when we hand them their very own softcover journal and brand new markers - and tell them they can keep both - is a  joy. Being able to provide a child with stretched canvas - rather than a piece of paper - conveys the importance of their creation and the difficult emotions they are expressing through art. Our funding - like that of most healthcare institutions - becomes more limited each year. Nevertheless, our partnership with Dreaming Zebra makes it possible to provide an even higher level of care to the families we serve. Bravo, Dreaming Zebra!

From the moment I first worked with DZF and Dawne it was evident her program provided the most efficacious distribution of arts materials to children that I had ever seen.  Many months later I am still in awe of what they accomplish - and it's no surprise: Dawne is a fount of energy.

Our goal is to offer instrumental music to any 4th or 5th grade student who wishes to participate.  Unfortunately, most of our students do not have the means to purchase or rent an instrument.  It is a challenge to provide instruments for our students.  Many of the instruments in our inventory are old, in need of repair or both.  Although I want students to participate in music, I will not have them participate with sub-par instruments that will cause more harm than good.  So far this year Dreaming Zebra has provided a clarinet and a cello with a trumpet on the way.  Thanks to their generosity and persistence, additional students at Weinland Park will have an opportunity to participate for years to come.  Thank you Dreaming Zebra!

The art supplies also allowed us to invite volunteers into the classroom to lead weekly special projects. Without the art supplies we would not have been able to have art as such a strong part of our classroom curricula. We received glue guns, oil pastels, and paper. Dreaming Zebra was very generous with their donation. They gave us a ton of paper and oil pastels. It seemed fairly easy to work with Dreaming Zebra. Parent volunteers from my class contacted and coordinated with the Dreaming Zebra staff. From a teacher's perspective it was great because of how easy it was to access special resources. I know that there are many opportunities to access resources for schools within our community, but sometimes it is difficult to deal with the logistics. I was so happy that my classroom parents were able to contact Dreaming Zebra directly and help facilitate the process.

I was put in touch with the Dreaming Zebra Foundation through a district-wide email where they suggested we contact the foundation. So I did. I was pleasantly surprised when I was contacted by Dawne, who wanted to help out my situation. We have many aspects of our theatre that haven't been updated since the school opened in the late 1960s. The lighting is archaic and the sound system is almost non-existant. We have been working very hard to fix some of this, but it's just not a priority in a district where sometimes it's hard to find enough money to buy paper! But Dawne has been working hard to figure out a way to help us with the lighting safety. While she is working on the lighting, Dawne also sent us a huge box full of craft goodies which we immediately put to good use in our musical that opens next week. I literally jumped for joy when our secretary came down carrying the box of glitter, pipe cleaners, pom-poms, etc. It was awesome!Many people who aren't teachers don't understand how hard it is to get the supplies you need for your classes. And often times, it is so frustrating that teachers just go out and buy them with their own money. And teachers shouldn't have to do that. Do office workers have to go out and buy the paper for their printers? Pencils? Tape? As a teacher, I do. Or else my students won't have any. So thanks to Dawne and the Dreaming Zebra Foundation, some of the weight of buying supplies have been lifted off my shoulders. And honestly it's really nice to just know that there is someone out there working on your behalf.

Dawne and the Dreaming Zebra Foundation has been and continues to be an integral part of our success in providing community art opportunites for artists with disdabilities of all ages and the community in general!In our third year, we have grown and have initiated participating in other community events, providing space for artistic expression for children of all ages, as well as providing volunteer opportunities for artists with disabilities. We could not do this without The Dreaming Zebra Foundation and its generous donors!

The Dreaming Zebra Foundation	12591	7	/users/profile/14613	Juice	Volunteer	5	10/08/2009	As a child growing up with music, the arts have been a cornerstone of my existence as not only a creative outlet, but a means of development and rudimentary training skills.  The Dreaming Zebra Foundation makes sure that children get the opportunity to explore their creativity and realize that learning can be more then textbooks and testing.  Every child learns and explores their world differently, and we need to make sure our schools and institutions provide a diverse and well rounded education.I have known Dawne for over 10 years now and she has found a way to channel her passion for artistic growth into such an amazing and giving foundation.  She is an unbelievable selfless person, and that has inspired volunteers and other organizations around her to stay true and honest about delivering the arts to people in need.There may be many different charities in this world, but few are as simple and efficient as the Dreaming Zebra Foundation.
The Dreaming Zebra Foundation	12392	6	/users/profile/14426	cafwo	Volunteer	5	10/07/2009	I work full-time.  I am a single mother to two energetic kids and human-companion to 3 dogs and 2 cats!  And my "spare time" I try like heck to get my pottery studio in working condition so I can actually create!  But when I heard about Dreaming Zebra and what they are doing to nuture the arts in the lives of children, you bet I made the time to get involved.  Living in Ohio meant I had to be creative about the ways I could help Dreaming Zebra help kids - I've picked up paints from people willing to donate; I appealed to my own friends and family and collected needed supplies; I've even served as a resource when DZF receieved requests from organizations here in Columbus.  I am busy and in my personal quest for simplicity I don't take on many new projects, but Dreaming Zebra's mission spoke to my own creative soul.  Kids and art - bringing the two together is a masterpiece in and of itself.  How could I not contribute?  Dreaming Zebra needn't thank me for anything I may have done; I thank Dreaming Zebra for giving me the oppotunity to give in such a magical way!
The Dreaming Zebra Foundation	11494	10	/users/profile/13433	Lark	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/30/2009	I am an artist, supporter and fan of Dreaming Zebra Foundation (DZF). I am amazed how much can do one person - the founder of DZF - Dawne Camera, who really put all her heart and life to help children to have happy childhood and grow up kind people themselves. Dawne was not just dreaming of helping kids to experience the positive influence of art, she appealed to other people to donate the art supply and musical instruments - so children will not feel deprive of opportunity to get art or music lessons. I also really honor Dawne's ability not to ask anything for herself, as many non profit organizations do, but put all her hard work and financial resources to help low income people.
The Dreaming Zebra Foundation	10388	21	/users/profile/12272	combi	Volunteer	5	09/16/2009	As one of the original volunteers of this wonderful foundation I continue to offer what assistance I can provide from 3000 miles away here in Florida.  I believe that helping children develop their talents is the best way to keep them out of trouble and give them a start in life.  The positive experience I've had with the Dreaming Zebra Foundation has shown me what 1 extremely dedicated person can accomplish when they make up their mind to..."just do it"!
The Dreaming Zebra Foundation	10322	13	/users/profile/12191	sdelgardo	Volunteer	5	09/14/2009	This organization has helped many children realize their hidden talents. Seeing their smiles when they receive art and music supplies is priceless. Every child has a dream, Every child has a great imagination, so lets give them the tools to explore. The Dreaming Zebra Foundation is a blessing to all children.
The Dreaming Zebra Foundation	10310	13	/users/profile/12178	DZVol77	Volunteer	5	09/14/2009	The foundation was born from an altruistic dream that is shared by all who volunteer and donate. From the time I picked up art and music supplies to the point of dropping them off to the different organizations in need, people would catch the synergistic and positive vibe that is at the base of this foundation. One of the most moving experiences I had was when a woman called and wanted to donate an incredible set of oil paints that she received from a dear friend of hers who died. She was relieved to tears to hear that her friends spirit would be living on at an art center for homeless teens. This is Dreaming Zebra and it is so much more.
The Dreaming Zebra Foundation	10296	15	/users/profile/12166	Jaffefilms	Volunteer	5	09/13/2009	More than the idea behind the organization are the hearts and souls of the people that lead it. This organization and Foundation has a story much like the kids it serves of being pure in heart and hopeful and spirit yet undying in determination to get lifted off the ground and fly into the sky. I cannot express to you enough the beauty behind the idea in helping kids with art supplies but the genuine and caring and selfless soul of the person who runs it... all for helping better humanity! Please give to the Foundation that cares.
The Dreaming Zebra Foundation	10254	13	/users/profile/12123	rocky	General Member of the Public	5	09/12/2009	This foundation is run by talented inspired people and it is doing great work for kids in need. They helped get a tutor for prestigious art school here in town for a high school student I work with who attends a lower-income school and has tremendous potential in the art field.
The Dreaming Zebra Foundation	10236	9	/users/profile/11822	Dreaming Zebra	Volunteer	5	09/11/2009	As a volunteer for Dreaming Zebra I have seen firsthand the positive impact this nonprofit has for schools, teachers, and youth everywhere in need of art and music supplies. The community recycling aspect is a badly needed and novel concept that works for everyone involved, and helps to bring creative programs to life for those in need.  Keep up the great work Zebra and I am proud to be a part of your team.!

The Dreaming Zebra Foundation	10174	10	/users/profile/12034	mmulkey	Client Served	5	09/10/2009	The Dreaming Zebra Foundation is an amazing organization!  I began my AmeriCorps term serving at a local non-profit in June and I needed arts supplies as soon as possible.  I serve low-income families at a transitional housing location where we do not have a budget to purchase supplies for the families.  I posted an add on Craigslist for arts supplies and heard within hours of a local non-profit, The Dreaming Zebra Foundation.  I contacted them and emailed an application for art supplies.  My extension had not yet been set-up but The Dreaming Zebra Foundation employees were extremely persistent and they were able to contact me via my supervisor.I talked with two employees of The Dreaming Zebra and they drove out 5 boxes of amazing art supplies within 30 minutes!  These art supplies allowed us to begin art classes with the kids of Richmond Place which have been amazing!  We are also able to bring in mentors to work with kids one on one using the supplies to create awesome crafts.The Dreaming Zebra Foundation is amazing!  They are extremely efficient and are able to provide their services in a timely manner and have an amazing staff.  I definitely intend to support The Dreaming Zebra Foundation in any way possible and hopefully to receive future donations when needed.
The Dreaming Zebra Foundation	10150	9	/users/profile/12011	BJS	Client Served	5	09/10/2009	My granddaughters are in schools in a tiny, dusty, west Texas town, one elementary, the other middle.  Both have active interests in art; programs in both schools are needful of supplies due to shrunken budgets and shifted priorities.  I contacted Dreaming Zebra Foundation and was requested to ask the schools, one through an art teacher and the other through the assistant principal, for "wish lists."  I was told Dreaming Zebra Foundation would go down the wish lists as far as possible.  Not long afterward I was copied with letters of enthusiastic thanks from both schools.  I have no doubt whatsoever that the intervention of Dreaming Zebra Foundation provided my granddaughters and all their classmates with a very significant benefit they could not have gotten otherwise.  I believe my experience to be an accurate illustration of the care, responsiveness, and positive effect Dreaming Zebra Foundation is having on the lives of children all across America.

Our insurance places limits on the number of speech therapy sessions per calendar year.  Without the foundation's help, our child would not have been able to continue receiving speech therapy as it would have been too costly for us to pay out-of-pocket as our insurance benefits maxed out.  Because of the grant, we have been able to see continued progress with our child's speech.  We consider ourselves blessed to have such a wonderful foundation.  Thanks Wheel to Walk Foundation for the medical grant!  We certainly would recommend the organization to others.

When she was younger she was able to ride a bike with training wheels. As she grew older though the training wheels were not strong enough to support her, and the other kids made comments about the fact that she used them. So sadly the last few summers she hasn't been able to ride. But thanks to Wheel to Walk she now has an adult tricycle! And even though it's winter she has been out riding up and down the street on it. We look forward to riding as a family this summer and watching her ride with the neighbor kids. Thank you Wheel to Walk for making this possible!

When she was younger she road a bike with training wheels with a lot of assistance. Our family enjoys riding bikes and would like for Lillie to join us. The Wheel to Walk Foundation has assisted us with getting Lillie a 3 wheeled adult bike. Lillie gets very excited to see it before and after she gets on it. When sitting on it, you can see how serious she is about learning to ride it. It is quite funny. This opportunity we have been given to teach her to ride this bike is a huge step for Lillie. We are so thankful for this opportunity for Lillie to be a part of the family in another way and to help her with some of her life challenges.

I just couldn't afford to get him one with all the other expenses we have related to his therapies etc. That's where the Wheel to Walk Foundation came in. I was lucky enough to hear about them. It is nearly impossible to get sensory items coveted by insurance. The Wheel to Walk Foundation processed our request immediately once I submitted the required paperwork and a Power Pumper arrived for my son. He was overjoyed and wants to ride it all the time. It is the kindness and generosity of such organizations that really touches me as a parent of a child with special needs.

Now, at four years old, our little miracle survivor is thriving and advancing way beyond expectations.  He is even trying to walk!  He can walk all the way across the living room on his own!Since he is so big, it's tough to get him around now, and the little push car that we have been using to get him around is now too small for him.The dilemma we have been facing is trying to decide if we need a wheelchair or not.  With Little Roy's determination, and with upcoming extensive therapy, we are certain Little Roy will be soon walking on his own.  We decided a stroller would work best at this point in time to help Roy get from one place to another if it is too far for him to walk.Thanks to WHEEL TO WALK, we now have a beautiful new stroller to push Roy around in and we all LOVE it, especially Little Roy.We can now take Roy on walks and hikes so he can enjoy the outdoors more, and being outside is one of his most favorite things!Working with Wheels to Walk was extremely easy, as they are helpful and kind.  They are compassionate to our story and helped us really quickly.Thank you Wheels to Walk, we will think of you everyday as our boy enjoys his stroller!You're the best!  God bless you!

My daughter Corrine was born with CP and has always been on the sidelines watching everyone else walk, run and ride bikes. Her physical therapist JoAnne started her riding the trike at school  At the age of 16, JoAnne connected us with Wheel to Walk Foundation.  The staff at Wheel to Walk was wonderful.  The application process was the easiest we have seen when it comes to trying to obtain any equipment.  We can't say enough good things.   We received the trike mid June and she has been on it daily.  She is getting stronger everyday and going further than we could have imagined.    Corrine is now  able to feel like she is part of world.  We can't say Thank you enough for the Trike.

This charitable organization has been helping families for over 25 years, and it has been an honor to serve on this Board and support the work of Wheel to Walk. Its philanthropic goal centers on enhancing the quality of life of the disabled youth in our communities by providing medical equipment or services that would typically be denied by insurance companies. Wheel to Walk provides an avenue for disabled youth to improve their communication and motor skills through the provision of therapy trikes, gait trainers, communication devices, speech therapy services, and so much more. The tireless and selfless work of the Founding Board Members to help families is life-changing not just for the disabled member, but also for the entire family. It is truly an outstanding organization, making a difference in the community. I thank God for Wheel to Walk!

Rachel has cerebral palsy and walks with a walker & leg braces.  The only bike she could use was a Rifton special needs bike, but those cost around $2,000.  There was just no way for our family of five to dedicate that kind of financial resource to a bike.  Our physical therapist team told us about the Wheel to Walk foundation, but I didn't didn't think such a pricey item would ever be awarded.  We were delighted when we heard we had been awarded, and just in time for Rachel to get her bike for Christmas, just like other kids who get bikes for Christmas.    It used to be hard for Rachel to get exercise with her disability, now she can ride her bike to maintain cardiovascular health and achieve a healthy weight.  Wheel to Walk has made Rachel's dream come true.  Way to go Wheel to Walk! A Million Thanks!
Wheel To Walk Foundation	271194	1	/users/profile/359982	Writer	Client Served	4	11/05/2015	Such a wonderful foundation!  They quickly responded to my request for an application and also were quick to respond when ever I had a question. I was able to complete the application in maybe an hour then obtained the needed letters ect required. The only negative thing I can think to say is that it took quite a bit longer for them to review our application than expected simply because they had so many applications. Because of this foundation, our disabled son has a trike that fits him and that he can independently ride around our driveway. He is getting exercise and has the opportunity to play with his typically developing family members in a way that was previously impossible. Such a specialized trike is surprisingly expensive and was not something that was within our means.  Our insurance, like most, will not help with this type of purchase.  Finding Wheels to Walk opened a door for our son that allows him to feel like every other kid out in the driveway riding his "bike" . His pride and joy shine as he rides. Thank you Wheels to Walk. 4 1/2 stars.

We completed the application and received a prompt response and willingness to support our efforts. Because the bike was nearly $5,000, this was a team approach for fundraising and other grants. This foundation worked with our family during that process and allowed the funds to "be on hold" while we raised the entire amount for my son's dream bike. This organization helped make our family dream come true and we are now enjoying family outings and bike trips together when we never had that chance before. My son is exploring his new freedom and independence while riding his new bike. Thank you all- this is a wonderful foundation and has been a pleasure to work with. Thank you for changing our lives!

She could achieve self-mobility through the motion of her own legs.  She could join her cousins and no longer be 'on the outside, looking in'.    If you could only see the sense of accomplishment, pride and happiness lighting up her face as she rides her tricycle, you would understand what an impact The Wheel to Walk Foundation has made in the life of this child.  Their gift of a beautiful tricycle to Na'sirah has not only given her the physical benefits of balance and leg muscle  exercise and strengthening, but has afforded her an activity that empowers her and one she absolutely enjoys!  May Almighty Allah reward you for this wonderful gift.  Thank you!

We have a trail-behind bike for each grandchild, but Brandon was just getting too big and could not hold his balance, so grandpa was struggling to ride with him.  So we reached out to Wheel to Walk Foundation to see if they could help.   Wheel to Walk Foundation was excellent to work with from beginning to end (special thanks to Sandy).  I was just trying to get adaptive training wheels for Brandon's bike, but Sandy made a point to say that Brandon needs his own special needs tricycle.  Sandy gave me a wonderful website to review and select a tricycle that best fit Brandon... and thanks to Sandy and Wheel to Walk Foundation, Brandon has a wonderful tricycle that he loves to ride and can now keep up with the family on our weekly rides along the Springwater Trail. We think Wheel to Walk Foundation is absolutely wonderful and truly appreciate their assistance in getting this new tricycle for Brandon.  It has provided Brandon with his own independence in riding with the family and will provide him joy for many years. Thanks again... the Agnew extended family !!

He is a paraplegic, but has full use of his upper body. Since he was 5 weeks old, Brantley has had weekly intense physical therapy that has benefited him in many ways. While I was pregnant I came across the ZipZac chair through an online forum for people with Spina Bifida. It was something that was giving babies and children that are at the age to be able to walk/crawl but can't, the ability to move. Unfortunately, being a single mother with a very low income, the chances of being able to provide my precious boy with this chair seemed impossible. Not only was it expensive, but insurance does not cover items that aren't a necessity. A couple of people mentioned Wheel to Walk and suggested I try applying for the ZipZac chair, so I did!It was such an easy process and within a few weeks the ZipZac was on our doorstep. I can't begin to describe how incredibly thankful I am to this foundation for giving Brantley such an amazing gift! Happy tears have been cried, and this is just the beginning of his Spina-beautiful adventure! Thank you, THANK YOU!  Nicole Brown

She is so proud of her new found independence,  with the adult stabilizers on the bike she is able to ride it all by herself , she is getting the much needed exercise and having great fun at the same time. Wheel to walk foundation has given my family a far greater gift than just a bike. They have given my child the feeling of normalcy. When she gets on her bike and squeals with joy , look mommy I can ride a bike all by myself now . That is truly priceless. Thank you for your generosity. Johara Buntin

Every week at physical therapy, my son would love to ride the bike around the hospital and down the hallways. He really wanted a bike of his own, but finding a bike with training wheels at his age was difficult and not very safe. This bike he received from Wheel to walk foundation is perfect for him. It has so many adjustments and safety features. My son will be able to use this bike up until his teens and/or young adulthood. We are so over joyed. All I can say is, "Thank You!" The world needs more of these wonderful foundations to support people in need.

She has disabilities that keep her from balancing and coordinating in space. Now she can ride and have a more active lifestyle to stay healthy and happy. She is so pleased to be riding a "big" bike. This bike can improve her confidence and overall cognitive development. Thank you so much for helping her attain these skills!

The application process was really easy and turnaround was very quick. For parents of special needs children, this is so helpful because our lives are spent filling out countless forms, medical procedures, and therapies that to have something go smoothly is like a dream! Plus he got the bike at the beginning of bike-riding season, so he'll be able to get a lot of use out of it this year.

We went through the process and jumped through the hoops to obtain our chair, doing what was asked along the way. When it finally came time for our representative to take all of her measurements and present the package for approval, she told me at that time - "they are not going to approve the lift portion of our order - I have never seen that approved" She suggested I contact Wheel to Walk to see if they would fund that small portion of our overall order. I looked them up online and saw a contact email address. I wanted to be certain that they would be willing to fund just a small portion of our order. Jill responded - yes, that was definitely something they would be willing to do. I had our application filled out and gathered what I needed to submit our application once the denial for the lift was actually reality. I had some questions for Jill because I wanted to be sure to submit what was needed in the correct manner the first time around. She even took the time to look at what I had to show them as the denial on the chair. She was kind and professional and told me to state that she said for me to submit what I had.  I felt very encouraged by our contact. In what seemed like no time at all I was contacted and received the final word through our medical equipment specialist. We were finally ready to actually place our order!!! Thank you so much to the Wheel to Walk Foundation for providing an important addition to our power wheelchair package! It allows her access to the counters in the kitchen, the cupboards, the freezer compartment and anything else that would be beyond her ability to reach without this wonderful addition to her Chair!

Our daughter cannot yet walk unassisted and requires to be either carried or pushed in a stroller. The stroller we had for her was not meeting her needs. It was not supportive or comfortable for her. Our daughter loves the outdoors and we want her to be able to experience all that life has to offer. Wheel To Walk blessed us with a new jogging stroller for our daughter. It is comfortable/supportive and is a wonderful new addition to our family. Words cannot express how grateful we are as a family. Thank You Wheel To Walk for your kindness.

Wheel To Walk Foundation	238301	1	/users/profile/323480	SamsMom	Client Served	5	02/20/2015	When I adopted my son I knew that he had many strikes against him including, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, Conductive and Neurosensory Hearing losses, fine and gross motor issues, global delays and much more.  He is now a very fun-loving, happy eight year old.   Samuel has always had balance problems that have made it impossible for him to balance and pedal a bike.  He has a brother who rides his bike like the wind and Samuel always felt left-out.  When it was recommended that I contact the Wheels to Walk Foundation in the Portland, Oregon area I immediately did so.  Within approximately eight weeks Samuel had a new, adaptive bike that was outfitted with outriggers that enable him to ride just like his brother.  He has a new helmet that fits him and just the other day we were able, for the first time in my boys' lives to go on a family bike ride.  The boys wanted to keep going and we ended up riding 4.7 miles. It is with joy that I thank everyone involved with Wheels to Walk for their part in giving my son a very special bike that allows him to feel like the rest of the kids.  Without this special foundation Samuel would not have known that joy as there is no way that I could afford to purchase one for him as a single mother who has to stay home with my children due to their issues.

The ease of the application and the whole process was amazing.  Due to the expense of this car seat,  we reached out to this Nonprofit and asked for help with funding.The whole experience was wonderful!  This nonprofit was also very quick with the decision to help our son. Our son needed this Special needs car seat because he has Ataxic Cerebral Palsy.  Our insurance would not cover this Special Needs Car Seat.  We could not have provided this for our son if it had not been for the Wheel To Walk Foundation.  It is foundations like this that mean the world to parents with Special Needs Children.  Most medical equipment is either not covered by insurance, or if they do cover any of the equipment, it is very little!  I would highly recommend this foundation!  It means the world to us that you helped us provide our son with this Special Needs Car Seat that he so desperately needed to keep him safe while riding in our van. Thank you again so much!

David is a client of mine who did not like physical activity, though his doctor recommended exercise for health reasons.  Due to the cost, his family had not been able to purchase an adaptive adult tricycle for him.  We completed an application with Wheel to Walk, requesting funding for such a trike for David.  Within a few weeks of finishing the process, Sandy from Wheel to Walk notified us that he had been approved for funding and referred us to a local bike shop.  David went into the shop and the manager welcomed him and showed him the beautiful blue adaptive trike that he had in stock.  David was very serious and looked skeptical, and when the owner adjusted the seat and had David ride around the store, he burst into a big smile.  Wheel to Walk worked with that shop and David was able to pick up his bike within a week.  David has begun riding his bike around his neighborhood and looks forward to going on outing with his family, as he now has his own way of being active and engaging in the community.  He's still not sure about wearing a helmet, but he obliges so that he can go out and ride!  :)

My grandson has a form of muscular dystrophy that leaves his legs weak after very little exercise. A normal trike is too difficult for him to peddle, and he is unable to balance on a bike. This trike has given him the mobility that he has desired for so long. He is now able to go on walks and bike rides with the family. Before the trike he would only be able to go a short distance, and we would have to carry him back. He collapses to his knees several times a day. With this trike he is able to ride for a long time, and we can pull him when he gets tired and weak. This has meant a great deal to my family. We would have never been able to afford this and his insurance would not have covered such a item. We are so grateful to the Wheel to Walk foundation for their generosity. We can not thank you enough. You have given him so many opportunities to be active. We are now able to go places we could only hope to see with him. This makes him so happy we have to fight him to get him off it. lol. I would defiantly recommend this organization to everyone I know. Thank you, Charlie and Family

I have been paying for all of his medical expenses out of pocket, and there was no way I could afford the therapy bike that Wheel To Walk purchased for him. I had tried 3 other tricycles for my son and he was incapable of riding any of them. It was hard seeing other kids whiz by him, while he was unable to make the pedals move. The therapy bike that we were able to have customized just for him is the only bike he has ever been able to ride, and he loves it!!! It is such a gift to be able to watch him full of glee as he rides his very own bike now. His new-found confidence beams from his face. Thank you, Wheel To Walk, for this priceless gift!

Wheel To Walk Foundation	187514	1	/users/profile/244533	Anastasia B.	Client Served	5	11/01/2013	Wheels to Walk purchased a Power Pumper therapy device for my 8 year old son.  He has autism and had become obese due low muscle tone and other issues that are related to his disability.  After receiving his exercise tool through a grant from the foundation he lost 4 pounds right away. Since then he has grown a few inches taller without gaining any weight.  I applied for grants at multiple organizations to purchase this equipment for my son.  Wheels to Walk is the only agency that responded to my request for help. My son does not take part in the usual social activities that children his age typically take part in, and he is unable to ride a bike.  I was becoming increasingly concerned about his constant weight gain and lack of physical activity.   I am extremely grateful to Wheels to Walk for the help they gave my son.  In my opinion having an exercise tool that fits his level of ability enables my son to participate in exercise that is similar to the activities of his peers, and being able to build core strength and get a cardiovascular workout means that my son can lead a healthy, happy life, similar to that of other children in his age group.  Thank you Wheels to Walk.

Medical and adaptive equipment is extremely expensive and often under-covered or not covered by insurance companies.   In our particular situation, we have medical insurance but it is an individual policy that we have to pay for ourselves.  It is extremely expensive, has very high deductibles, and the premiums have increased over 600% in the last 11 years.  Moreover, there are many needs that are specifically excluded in the policy.  Our daughter uses a manual wheelchair for her daily needs, but was struggling to keep up with friends and family over longer distances like going to the mall or to a museum.   We wanted to get her a scooter to help, especially with middle school coming up.  Unfortunately, our insurance specifically excluded any motorized mobility equipment.  In 2012, we applied to Wheel to Walk for help and they covered the entire cost of the scooter.  We would not have been able to buy this equipment for her ourselves.

We needed help in purchasing an electric lift for our disabled daughter.  Even used, the purchase price was almost $1,000.  We had some money available for the purchase, but we didn't have that much.   Yet, we desperately needed the equipment.  With the help of Wheel To Walk Foundation, we were able to make the purchase and now have a piece of equipment that will serve us for many years to come.   I would highly recommend Wheel To Walk Foundation to anyone who is looking to make a charitable contribution and wants to make sure that their dollars are really helping families in need.  They provide such a valuable service  because the kind of equipment they help fund is very expensive and beyond the reach of most of us -- even working families!  Disabilities strike all kinds of families, and some of us don't qualify for any government assistance.  Wheel to Walk is a lifesaver for the "working poor." When you make a donation to this great organization you can be sure that your dollars are going to make a meaningful difference in the life of a child or family.  We need organizations like this, and every contribution helps.
WildCat Haven, Inc.	103047	6	/users/profile/136706	KMMA,	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/08/2012	As a photographer focused on animals and wildlife, my introduction to WildCat Haven was several years ago, for a story I was doing for a national magazine.  Due to the nature of my work, I've photographed at many places that call themselves sanctuaries, and I've seen it all--the good, and the horribly, abusively bad. WildCat Haven is one of the very few, TRUE sanctuaries:  sanctuary defined as a place of refuge and protection. But, WildCat Haven exceeds just 'refuge and protection.'  I've had the unique opportunity to be able to spend time getting to know WCH--the place, the cats, and the people--and there is no question that this place exists for no other reason than to give these cats a comfortable place to live out the rest of their lives.  Wildcat Haven residents do not have to put up with hoardes of general public gawking and jeering at them.  WCH residents are not overcrowded, or crammed into 10x20 stalls of stone and fencing.  The cats do not pace back and forth in their enclosures.  The residents at WildCat Haven live on grass (not concrete slabs), surrounded by natural forest. Their bellies are full, and they have the best daily care that any captive cat could ask for.  Cheryl and Mike Tuller, and Renee (the head keeper) dedicate their lives to these animals.  The place is immaculately clean (feces and dirty bedding is nonexistent and water buckets are always full), and enclosures cleaned out daily.  The enclosures are larger than required by law.  These cats are as happy as a captive cats can get.  Owning and running a sanctuary is a selfless job--a job that is a result of the selfish human act of desiring to own and control a wild animal.  There are no 'thank you's' in the life of an exotic animal sanctuary,  and It takes hundreds and thousands of dollars to keep these places functional.  The money raised by WCH, goes straight back into the well being of the cats--larger enclosures, vet care, food. Cheryl Tuller's dream is for each of her cats to have more space.  Space takes dollars.  Dollars don't grow on trees.  So, if you are looking for a place to support, WildCat Haven is one of the very few true havens for captive wildcats-and if you get the unique chance to visit, it will impress you as a sanctuary, and it's residents will steal your heart.  Thank you Mike, Cheryl and Renee; for doing the job you do.

Founders - Cheryl Tuller and her husband Mike - are two of the hardest working people I have ever met.

WildCat Haven, Inc.	103513	3	/users/profile/137336	eekat	Volunteer	5	01/16/2012	2 of the best people I know are Mike and Cheryl. I have always wanted to start a sanctuary for wildlife (especially cats) but have been afraid to fail, not raise enough money, not take care of the animals in the best way and on and on and on. So I have high expectations of any non-profit I get involved with, thus why I choose WCH. The most passionate people with unsurpassed dedication. I have know them for over 10 years and can recall them taking a night off for themselves a couple of times in all of those years. They live modestly and do not have "frills"  like most people must have to survive these days. That is why I never laughed so hard when I read the "review" saying they keep the money for themselves....hilarious if it wasn't written out of anger, bitterness, resentment or whatever other problem this person has. If people want to volunteer that is awesome and they can use the help, especially with fundraising. It is a great organization and well deserves praise, appreciation and help. Its a fun group and Mike and Cheryl are kind, fun but mostly dedicated to giving abused, mistreated and unwanted animals a good, well deserved retirement.
WildCat Haven, Inc.	103047	6	/users/profile/136706	KMMA,	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/08/2012	As a photographer focused on animals and wildlife, my introduction to WildCat Haven was several years ago, for a story I was doing for a national magazine.  Due to the nature of my work, I've photographed at many places that call themselves sanctuaries, and I've seen it all--the good, and the horribly, abusively bad. WildCat Haven is one of the very few, TRUE sanctuaries:  sanctuary defined as a place of refuge and protection. But, WildCat Haven exceeds just 'refuge and protection.'  I've had the unique opportunity to be able to spend time getting to know WCH--the place, the cats, and the people--and there is no question that this place exists for no other reason than to give these cats a comfortable place to live out the rest of their lives.  Wildcat Haven residents do not have to put up with hoardes of general public gawking and jeering at them.  WCH residents are not overcrowded, or crammed into 10x20 stalls of stone and fencing.  The cats do not pace back and forth in their enclosures.  The residents at WildCat Haven live on grass (not concrete slabs), surrounded by natural forest. Their bellies are full, and they have the best daily care that any captive cat could ask for.  Cheryl and Mike Tuller, and Renee (the head keeper) dedicate their lives to these animals.  The place is immaculately clean (feces and dirty bedding is nonexistent and water buckets are always full), and enclosures cleaned out daily.  The enclosures are larger than required by law.  These cats are as happy as a captive cats can get.  Owning and running a sanctuary is a selfless job--a job that is a result of the selfish human act of desiring to own and control a wild animal.  There are no 'thank you's' in the life of an exotic animal sanctuary,  and It takes hundreds and thousands of dollars to keep these places functional.  The money raised by WCH, goes straight back into the well being of the cats--larger enclosures, vet care, food. Cheryl Tuller's dream is for each of her cats to have more space.  Space takes dollars.  Dollars don't grow on trees.  So, if you are looking for a place to support, WildCat Haven is one of the very few true havens for captive wildcats-and if you get the unique chance to visit, it will impress you as a sanctuary, and it's residents will steal your heart.  Thank you Mike, Cheryl and Renee; for doing the job you do.
WildCat Haven, Inc.	103414		/users/profile/102937	Jeanie S.	Volunteer	5	01/13/2012	I have been involved with Wildcat Haven for several years now and am very proud to be associated with their organization. As a true sanctuary Wildcat Haven always does what is in the best interest of the cats in their care, which includes not being open to the public which would be stressful for the cats. The cats live in large, comfortable enclosures and are given the best in care. Wildcat Haven is a model for how to do a sanctuary right and always puts the cats first and I am honored to be involved in their organization. 
WildCat Haven, Inc.	90297		/users/profile/102937	Jeanie S.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/09/2011	Wild Cat Haven is a wonderful sanctuary for captive born wildcats. I had the immense pleasure of volunteering at Wild Cat Haven for three years and gladly tip my hat off to the wonderful facility they operate for the cats. Mike and Cheryl dedicate their lives to the cats and at much sacrifice for their own wants and needs. I am very proud to be associated with Mike and Cheryl and call them friends and they are my heroes for sacrificing so much of themselves for the benefit of the cats.

WildCat Haven, Inc.	103124		/users/profile/101737	LesBir	Board Member	5	01/10/2012	I have had the privilege of being involved with WildCat Haven for several years in different capacities--onsite work, events, fundraising, working with the public. It continues to be an honor to promote the good work being performed by this sanctuary. And they are a TRUE sanctuary in that they do not buy, breed, sell or exhibit their rescues--and they are NOT open to the public. The well being of the cats is the first priority. The rescues receive the best care possible--veterinary care, shelter and food. Unlike so many sanctuaries and shelters, your donations go directly toward the care of the cats. WCH has only ONE paid staff--an animal care technician.  I encourage everyone to support the good work of WildCat Haven!

The only consequence is what we do." What we do. Walking the talk...and that is what Mike and Cheryl Tuller of Wildcat haven have been doing since I met them 8 years ago. These two speak little and act a lot. Their passion has always been about the cats, and what they can do to help these animals, unable to be released due to their life in captivity, live a healthy, unecumbered and peaceful existence.  Every decision I have seen them make, bar none, has had a question in front of it. The question is "what is truly best for the cats?" These people and this sanctuary sets a standard for kindness and unselfishness toward animals that we all can learn from. It's an honor to be affiliated with this sanctuary.
WildCat Haven, Inc.	103034	1	/users/profile/136620	dslussersmith	Donor	5	01/07/2012	Cheryl and Mike at Wild Cat Haven are THE most dedicated and passionate pair when it comes to loving and caring for these magnificent cats. They have sacrificed everything they have for the love and well being of these animals. They have significantly bettered the lives of all of their residents that wouldn't have a chance otherwise. They always make space for those in need; as well as fight for the rights of these wonderful animals outside their facility. When donations are made, I am 100% confident in the wisdom in which the funds will be used. Every penny donated goes to the betterment of the lives of these cats. This facility has grown leaps and bounds over the years with the help of a fabulous volunteer staff, medical providers, donors and donating contractors. Every time I've visited the facility, the improvements are impressive. Overall, a first class rate facility with first class rate people running the operation.
WildCat Haven, Inc.	103021	1	/users/profile/136568	Donna20	Professional with expertise in this field	4	01/07/2012	I've known Cheryl for years and she truly cares about the animals not about making a name for herself but about caring for the ones in need. She is there to be a voice for those who can not speak to give a safe home for those who have been uprooted and lost their homes. She does all she can to keep them safe and provide a stable enviorment for the uprooted and abused.  She is an honest caring person and the needs of the animals are her main concerns, not just the ones she has taken in but any in need that she can help if possible. 
WildCat Haven, Inc.	102986	1	/users/profile/136458	alice4me	General Member of the Public	5	01/06/2012	Mike and Cheryl Tuller at Wild Cat Haven have always been there to help cats in need.  Theyve given their lives for the safety and security of animals that cannot take care of themselves, providing them a home for the rest of their lives. Wild Cat Havens Generous behavior for the well being of the animals include toys to keep the cats entertained, clean spacious habitats on Gods earthen ground, medical care, proper nutrition, trained volunteers, and round the clock protection with love.Wild cat havens monthly E-News Letters provides status on recent changes in the Haven and upcoming celebrations and news.Financial support through sponsorship of WildCat Haven Adoption, donors, and Successful fund raising events like the WildCat Mas-grr-ade Big Cat Bash and Silent Auctions, and Sherwood Art in the Park Benefits keep Wild Cat Haven funded and moving forward with compassionate care to rescued cats.

WildCat Haven, Inc.	102980	1	/users/profile/136450	Jenn M	General Member of the Public	5	01/06/2012	I helped to move Cheryl, Mike, and the first few rescued cats into the facility when the location was purchased; from day 1 the needs of the cats came first. As WCHs animal population grew so did the need for full time involvement; Cheryl now dedicates nearly every waking moment to fulfill the mission of rescue, care, and education for the benefit of those amazing animals treated so poorly and unfairly by people. A huge amount of personal sacrifice on the part of the founders is how the sanctuary has become capable of helping so many animals cast-away by their misguided owners or taken by authorities due to abusive neglect. The level of dedication by the sanctuary, its volunteers, and supporters to the animals so lucky to reside at WildCat Haven cannot be surpassed.

No matter where the cats have come from  a neglected home or arrive as a last-chance stop  these animals thrive under the enriching care and of the Tullers.  Darlene Alexander, Winston, Oregon
WildCat Haven, Inc.	102949	1	/users/profile/136341	susieschwalge	Donor	5	01/05/2012	I have known Mike and Cheryl since the beginning of WCH.  They have sacrificed their lives for these precious animals.  They provide an incredible habitat, medical care and nutrition based on the need of each animal.  They have incredible volunteers and staff who provide the best care.  The Tullers are extreme advocates for wildcats and they know they cannot do it alone - - they have built an organization with volunteers and staff that puts many organizations to shame.   They should write a book for the benefit of non-profits - - whether it benefits animals or people.  They know their stuff and its out of pure love.  We will always make WCH a top priority in our charitable giving each year.

WildCat Haven, Inc.	102936	1	/users/profile/136315	Brooke6	Donor	5	01/05/2012	Wildcat Haven is just that ......a Haven. They have taken in animals who were breed and sold for someones own selfish pleasure and given them a life as close to their natural habitat as possible. I have been personally involved with them for many years now and can say that everything they do is first and foremost for the welfare of these rescues, for others to imply otherwise is gross negligence. Not being open to the public gives these animals peace of mind as most of them spent their early years being abused by humans. What they do is offer some dignity to these beautiful cats to live out the rest of their lives free from abuse. 
WildCat Haven, Inc.	102928	2	/users/profile/136293	Shadow Dog	General Member of the Public	5	01/05/2012	Most people in the general public don't know what a rescue does. There are back-breaking hours with care, phone calls, e-mails. Always searching for how things can be made better for the residents in your care. Always looking for financing to keep things better. WildCat Haven works with other rescues for their own charges as well as others in the rescue community. As a rescue in another state WildCat Haven has our highest regard. They are COMMITTED. They CARE. That's what it takes to be a rescue.
WildCat Haven, Inc.	102922	1	/users/profile/136284	lovebigcats	General Member of the Public	5	01/05/2012	WildCat Haven provides much needed sanctuary for captive bred exotic cats who, through no fault of their own, were born into existence for the express purpose of entertaining a human then discarded.  If not Mike and Cheryl Tuller, then who would take these cats and care for them as the Tullers' have?  I have visited the sanctuary and will attest to the amazing care and more than impressive quarters provided for these animals given the growing numbers of cats requiring sanctuary.  Wild cats should stay wild.  The exotic animal trade has created the need for this sanctuary and WildCat Haven needs and deserves whatever we can send their way.

Wildcat haven is a wonderful place i wish everybody could experience.

Part of my job description is to work with  rescue organizations and I can tell you there is no one more deserving and more thankful that Wildcat rescue.  They are also the only rescue I donate my personal money to.     My family knows that Birthday & (some) Christmas gifts go here.

There isn't enough room to share the wonderful work that Cheryl does with these animals. The thing I admire most is these beautiful cats are given a forever home once the come to WCH. And, they couldn't have a better forever home. It takes special people to run a sanctuary like this.

WildCat Haven, Inc.	90546		/users/profile/103302	NWNEWS	Volunteer	5	06/12/2011	I met Cheryl Tuller who co-founded WildCat Haven when I attended a volunteer meeting in 2005.  Cheryl and her husband Mike are the hardest working people I have ever met and have poured their time, money, and hearts into providing a good home for wildcats that are unwanted by the people who bought them thinking they would make a "great pet".     After I found out that WildCat Haven was not open to the public because many of the cats living there had been abused just increased my admiration for the Tullers.   It would have been VERY easy for them to buy an accessible piece of property and make lots of money by charging admission to view the cats.  Instead they kept it private which makes fundraising much more difficult because you are asking people to donate to something they can't see.  However when people understand why  WildCat Haven is private they always say that it should be this way. As a 501C3 nonprofit organization all donation and grant money spending is overseen and approved by a board of directors.   I think the world of Mike and Cheryl and all the volunteers at WildCat Haven. They are selfless, work hard, and are dedicated to providing these "thow away" cats the home they always should have had but didn't get the first time around.
WildCat Haven, Inc.	90399	1	/users/profile/103083	A Chapman	Volunteer	5	06/10/2011	If a sanctuary's worth was measured by compassion & selflessness, Wildcat Haven would be the wealthiest sanctuary in the country.  Everyone associated with WCH constantly strive to make the residents lives better every day. Whether it's enrichment, nutrition, upgrading of enclosures, or veterinarian care, everything provided is above and beyond "standard" In a perfect world, places such as WCH wouldnt be necessary. Until that happens, it's reassuring to know that legitimate sanctuaries such as WCH exist. 
WildCat Haven, Inc.	90266		/users/profile/102898	LynxLady	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/09/2011	I met Mike and Cheryl Tuller almost 15 years ago, when Cheryl contacted me asking for advice on how to handle living in a house with a teenaged bobcat.  Instead of dumping him at my sanctuary, she volunteered, and while she was helping me, she learned what she needed to know to adapt to life with a bobcat. They fenced in their entire back yard and a huge covered porch to create a wonderful living area for him.  Most sanctuaries start out as private owners who eventually see the need to rescue unwanted cats, and Wildcat Haven is only different in that they openly admit it as a caution to ther would-be private owners.   Before WCH, the Tullers had a large, very nice, home in a new, upscale neighborhood in Tigard. When they sold it to purchase the land to build Wildcat Haven, their living conditions were downgraded considerably in every way, and from that point on, their lives and all the income from both of them working full-time jobs was channeled directly to building the sanctuary and caring for the cats.  They are still living in the same house that was on the property, except now it also serves as a quarantine area for new cats, a hospital room for those needing close medical observation and attention, and until recently a food prep area.  Wildcat Haven operated as a USDA licensed facility for a number of years before receiving ASA accreditation, which does not allow buying selling, or breeding.  Over the life of a sanctuary, changes must be made to accommodate growth, financing to be able to accept the continuous stream of rescues, and added veterinary costs of an ageing population of animals. While it is sad that this one part of the ASA accreditation requirement limits the ability to rescue some animals, Wildcat Haven has adhered to the policy.  Occasionally when a sanctuary accepts a cat, it is discovered that a female is pregnant.  This was the case many years ago with one of the servals donated along with several other cats, by a private owner who had to move out of state. Now when new cats are accepted they are taken to the vet for an examination, any treatment necessary, and they are spayed or neutered.   From the beginning, the decision was made to not display the cats to the public. It would have been a much easier and more financially lucrative decision for fundraising to open the facility to the public, if that is what their goal had been, but it was in the cats best interest to limit public contact.  In fact, every decision along the way has been for the benefit and welfare of the cats.  I know there are times when the Tullers couldnt pay their own personal bills, but their focus was always on the cats, and the cats never went without anything they needed.  The cages are all more than adequate in size, exceeding USDA requirements, built securely, kept incredibly clean, and filled with all types of enrichment for the cats.  Tree houses, platforms, raised walkways, ramps, hammocks, pools, trees, logs, rocks, and toys are provided.  The tigers area is huge and the caging, which exceeds both federal and state requirements for construction, is in the planning stages for even more expansion.  Wildcat Haven is a work in progress.  It is ever changing with the needs of the residents.  Wildcat Haven has surpassed anything I ever imagined at its humble beginning.  It has been built on love, compassion, hard work, self-sacrifice, and a relentless drive to give these cats a safe, secure, comfortable lifetime home.  I am so very proud of Mike and Cheryl for what they have done, and for what Wildcat Haven has become to so many cats in need. 
WildCat Haven, Inc.	90189		/users/profile/102797	Shoshana E.	Donor	5	06/09/2011	I am shocked at some of the comments I see here.  The Tullers have sacrificed everything for the well being of the wild cats they care for.  We have been to the facility one time, as a result of being donors. Otherwise NO ONE visits this sanctuary which is closed to the public and serves only to benefit the wild cat residents. Cheryl and Mike Tuller are wonderful people who who very very hard at providing veterinary care, proper nutrition and psychological/social enrichment for their furry residents.  All funds donated to the sanctuary go to the cats. Mike works full time to provide for himself and Cheryl so that the donations can be used on the sanctuary and to pay their ONE salaried employee.
WildCat Haven, Inc.	90179		/users/profile/102782	LesBir	Donor	5	06/09/2011	For those who say anything negative about WildCat Haven, or Mike and Cheryl Tuller, take your criticisms elsewhere--they do not belong here.  And please educate yourself before making false accusations. It's public knowledge--because Mike and Cheryl have been honest from the beginning--they bought ONE bobcat kitten and that was before WCH was ever a thought.  They made a mistake, admitted it, fixed the situation, giving BoBo all the love and care they knew he needed and deserved.   Then the Tuller's proceeded to educate themselves about the exotic pet crisis, mentored with another sanctuary to further educate themselves, and for the past 10 years they, as a result of starting WildCat Haven, have sacrificed their lives, worked tirelessly and spent every dime they had to end the suffering of over 60 wildcats.  I have never known anyone who works harder or who is more committed to making a difference for animals in need than Mike and Cheryl Tuller. If you view WCH (and the Tuller's) as anything other than the professional, accredited, committed, hard working sanctuary that it is -- I feel sorry for you. 
WildCat Haven, Inc.	90156		/users/profile/102752	flyfish1	Volunteer	5	06/09/2011	I don't know is making the negative comments, but clearly you have never been to the facility!  First and foremost, tours are not given just because a check is written.  I am an animal rights activist and would never support an organization that I didn't truly believe is helping animals. The Tuller's have dedicated their lives to these animals.  They feed, care, clean and love these animals more than others I have known.  The facility is large and the enclosures are very large....the cats have plenty of room to run, play, hide, etc.  I know, I've cleaned out the enclosures and it's a full day job to do just a couple.  The Tuller's home is tiny and minimalistic which is a clear indication that funds go directly to the animals.  This couple does not vacation and seldom leaves the sanctuary which is what impressed me the most, their sacrifice to be with these rescues day in and day out.  This couple and their facility are a blessing to these abused and neglected animals and I truly believe they are angels of mercy. 
WildCat Haven, Inc.	90099		/users/profile/35291	sandusky78	Volunteer	5	06/09/2011	Seeing some of the negative comments on here makes me sick to my stomach.  I have known the Tullers for five years now, and there is nothing more important to them than the well-being of the cats at their facility.  I have been to a number of other facilities, and nobody else comes close to offering the love and devotion that they do towards their rescues. These negative comments are from people who obviously hold a personal grudge against Mike and Cheryl.  It's no secret that they had purchased BoBo in 2001.  They readily admit it on their website.  Like thousands of other people, they were duped into believing that he would be just like any other house cat.  The difference between them and the thousands of other people is that they actually decided to do something about it.  Over the past ten years they have devoted their lives to these cats.  Yes, they made a mistake in purchasing BoBo ten years ago.  But they have taken that one mistake and turned it into saving the lives of dozens upon dozens of cats who desperately needed them. I volunteer a few times a year at the sanctuary, and I go home every night absolutely exhausted.  They do that same work 365 days a year.  And, to top it off, Mike holds a full time job just to help make ends meet at home.  More than 50 cats who would otherwise be living horrible lives (if they would still be alive at all) are now thriving at WildCat Haven.  Please read some of the stories of their rescues on their website.  The stories will touch your heart.
WildCat Haven, Inc.	34443	7	/users/profile/35291	sandusky78	Volunteer	5	04/01/2010	You'll never find anyone as devoted as Mike and Cheryl at WildCat Haven.  Their lives are the cats, and the cats are their lives.When Cheryl found out about my artwork over the internet, she approached me about possibly putting together a logo for one of their fundraisers.  Being a lover of big cats, I was more than happy to help out in whatever way I could.  We quickly struck up a friendship, which eventually led to me making a visit to the sanctuary, even though I live more than 1300 miles away.  I still do my best to make it up there a couple of times every year to do anything I can to help out in person.  And I'm always happy to fulfill any artwork needs they may have.What WildCat Haven does for these rescues is beyond incredible.  Each and every volunteer at the sanctuary is devoted to providing a better life for the cats.  The energy and enthusiasm that Mike and Cheryl provide is contagious, and the amount of work that gets done both on a daily basis and from year to year is simply amazing.  It's hard to believe that I've only known them for a little over three years, because the improvements to the sanctuary over that time have been nothing short of incredible.The background stories of the residents at WildCat Haven may very well break your heart, but the stories of those same cats since their arrival at the sanctuary will warm your heart even more.  The fact that WildCat Haven has been able to so completely transform the lives of their residents is only magnified when you consider the tight budget with which they have to work.Unfortunately, the cost of providing the care these cats deserve does not come cheap, and, for every heartwarming story at WildCat Haven, there are many other heartbreaking stories out there.  Every single donation, large or small, will help to transform the lives of these cats and help those heartbreaking stories become heartwarming ones.
WildCat Haven, Inc.	90087		/users/profile/102666	Tammy Thies	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/08/2011	As an accredited sanctuary Director and former American Sanctuary Association Board member I stand behind the work of Wildcat Haven.  Their income is a fraction of that of rescues around the country and their 990 and other tax records confirm that donated funds go direclty to the care of the cats.  The Directors of Wildcat Haven live quite modestly and one Director has a full-time job to provide for the Sanctuary. But please don't take my word for it, please do your own homework with any organiztion you give to. Please review their 990 here and contact Wildcat Haven directly to ask all and any questions you have.  I know they will be happy to answer them. If you compare Wildcat Haven to other wild cat rescues, you will see their budget is much smaller and more of their money goes to program costs.
WildCat Haven, Inc.	90086		/users/profile/102665	Ian F.	Volunteer	5	06/08/2011	I'm sick to my stomach reading some of the slander that's being said here.  I know how much Mike and Cheryl have sacrificed since making the common error of purchasing one of these animals from a breeder way back when.  I've witnessed their dedication first-hand and have personally contributed my sweat and hours to helping construct a new enclosure for some of their residents.  Don't try and tell me lies because I'm there; I see what goes on and I see how much effort, time and energy goes into providing the best possible situation for these cats. Nothing is built until the funds for the project are available.  Mike alone puts in a full 40+ hours of employment at a "day" job, then spends all his waking hours working on the sanctuary.  The guy barely ever sleeps.  We're out working 8 hours in the pouring rain if that's what needs to be done because the cats can't go without any of their necessities.  The allegations of donations going to line their pockets is not only absurd, it's factually inaccurate and borders on a legal repercussion to the person making such statements.  The facility is closed to the public because that's what is best for the cats.  They could pimp them out to rake in the dough but that's NOT WHY THEY DO WHAT THEY DO. Whoever is behind these attacks on these people who have given their very existence up to care for these animals is both misinformed and frankly, pathetic. 
WildCat Haven, Inc.	89519	1	/users/profile/101743	JBSJETT	General Member of the Public	5	06/02/2011	Wow Zait.  You sound more like someone with a personal vendetta than someone giving a legitimate review (A breeder perhaps? Toes getting stepped on? Don't like the truth coming out about breeders?).   I suggest you get your facts straight before you attempt that kind of  character assasination.  Had you truly done any research you would have discovered the two most important facts about Wildcat Haven: 1)  WCH is one of only seven such facilities in the entire US that is American Sancuary Association certified.  To receive this certification every phase of the operation was scrutinized--living space, vet care, safety, management, financial, etc.  ASA knows the only objective of WCH is to provide these abused, confiscated, and discarded cats with a safe, happy and loving home for the rest of their lives.  Mission accomplished!! 2)  WCH exists because the founders fell prey to the typical breeder line of garbage that a wild animal will make a "great pet".  They found out quickly how much of a lie that is.  However, instead of contributing to the problem by dumping their bobcat onto someone else, they chose to become a part of the solution.  Hence, Wildcat Haven was born. Those who question the mission of WCH or the dedication of those who operate it truly have no clue about this facility and the labor of love that it is.   The most important point is that the cats ARE happy, healty, and safe-for the rest of their lives.  And believe me, considering the fact that most of them came from pretty horrible situations, they are some of the lucky few.
WildCat Haven, Inc.	103047	6	/users/profile/136706	KMMA,	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/08/2012	As a photographer focused on animals and wildlife, my introduction to WildCat Haven was several years ago, for a story I was doing for a national magazine.  Due to the nature of my work, I've photographed at many places that call themselves sanctuaries, and I've seen it all--the good, and the horribly, abusively bad. WildCat Haven is one of the very few, TRUE sanctuaries:  sanctuary defined as a place of refuge and protection. But, WildCat Haven exceeds just 'refuge and protection.'  I've had the unique opportunity to be able to spend time getting to know WCH--the place, the cats, and the people--and there is no question that this place exists for no other reason than to give these cats a comfortable place to live out the rest of their lives.  Wildcat Haven residents do not have to put up with hoardes of general public gawking and jeering at them.  WCH residents are not overcrowded, or crammed into 10x20 stalls of stone and fencing.  The cats do not pace back and forth in their enclosures.  The residents at WildCat Haven live on grass (not concrete slabs), surrounded by natural forest. Their bellies are full, and they have the best daily care that any captive cat could ask for.  Cheryl and Mike Tuller, and Renee (the head keeper) dedicate their lives to these animals.  The place is immaculately clean (feces and dirty bedding is nonexistent and water buckets are always full), and enclosures cleaned out daily.  The enclosures are larger than required by law.  These cats are as happy as a captive cats can get.  Owning and running a sanctuary is a selfless job--a job that is a result of the selfish human act of desiring to own and control a wild animal.  There are no 'thank you's' in the life of an exotic animal sanctuary,  and It takes hundreds and thousands of dollars to keep these places functional.  The money raised by WCH, goes straight back into the well being of the cats--larger enclosures, vet care, food. Cheryl Tuller's dream is for each of her cats to have more space.  Space takes dollars.  Dollars don't grow on trees.  So, if you are looking for a place to support, WildCat Haven is one of the very few true havens for captive wildcats-and if you get the unique chance to visit, it will impress you as a sanctuary, and it's residents will steal your heart.  Thank you Mike, Cheryl and Renee; for doing the job you do.
WildCat Haven, Inc.	89503		/users/profile/101752	Cat Donor	Donor	5	06/02/2011	We all learn from our mistakes and Wildcat Haven has been nothing but honest.  It is why I give to them again and again vs. many other organizations that hide behind their past.  I know where my dollars are going and am so impressed with what they do on a small budget. I also refer others to the organization as well as animals in need of a safe haven.
WildCat Haven, Inc.	89374	3	/users/profile/101542	zait	General Member of the Public	1	06/01/2011	For someone who has "purchased" animals, and then goes on to say they are a "sanctuary" :S you should be ashamed of yourself. You seem to think you are some voice for the animals, here through out the community. I simply cant help but laugh at you. You are getting your money just l ike anyone else.  I have done alot of research on you and your facility...shame on you!!!!
WildCat Haven, Inc.	59876		/users/profile/64925	catluvr	Donor	5	01/12/2011	As a donor I have seen first hand this wonderful facility. There are so few true sanctuaries that put the needs of the animals first. The staff works tirelessly to give the animals everything they need, from good food, warm dens, and lots of enrichment. They all have huge areas to live in, more room than any other place I've seen. The cats look healthy, happy and content. The staff was more than happy to answer all my questions and knew each and every cat's personalities and shared stories about them. Kudos to WildCat Haven and their staff. It's great to see a place that does so much for the animals. 
WildCat Haven, Inc.	59818	2	/users/profile/64834	dragonfly	General Member of the Public	2	01/11/2011	So I thought this was supposed to be an SMALL cat sanctuary? when did cougars and tigers become part of the small cat family. Doesn't it make sense that the small cats would be terrified? Whos interest is being served here? Also, did this breeder not sell servals to a hybid breeder in Nevada? Why is she being a hypocrit and critizing cat breeding when she did it herself?Frankly i must say, this seems like a way to support a personal addiction to cat ownership and present a holier than thou attitude. It is ok for her but no one else! Who died and made her God?
WildCat Haven, Inc.	47947	3	/users/profile/48792	bella1	General Member of the Public	5	07/09/2010	My husband and I sponsored a wildcat and had a private tour of WildCat Haven. It was a wonderful place, quiet, secluded, lots of trees and the most noise we heard were the birds chirping. The cats were in huge pens with trees and things to jump on and get under. They all seemed very relaxed, we didn't see any of them pacing. The people there spent over two hours with us, answering questions and telling how the sanctuary started and how they got to where they are today. We will continue to support this place and feel good about how our donations are helping.
WildCat Haven, Inc.	47667	5	/users/profile/48382	aford	Volunteer	5	07/02/2010	WildCat Haven has grown from humble beginning to a wonderful place for the rescues that they have. All of the folks involved love what they do and put their heart & soul into the mission. Wish sanctuaries weren't necessary but until breeding and selling wildcats is stopped true sanctuaries are needed for abused wildcats.
WildCat Haven, Inc.	47662	5	/users/profile/35315	catwch	General Member of the Public	5	07/02/2010	WildCat Haven has grown over the years to be a premier wildcat sanctuary. As with most sanctuaries they started out the wrong way, purchasing a wildcat as a pet. Things change and growth comes out of knowledge. They have always been honest about their beginnings, using it as an example of how foolish it is to want to make a wildcat a pet. Now, as an accredited sanctuary they are making a difference in the lives of wildcats who need a safe, lifetime home. Over the years they have (obviously) made some people unhappy by no longer supporting private ownership, but I for one am glad that they learned and now do all they can to support legislation to stop the breeding and selling of exotic cats. They don't have to defend their past record, what they do as a sanctuary is important and much needed.
WildCat Haven, Inc.	47625	2	/users/profile/48340	gl	Professional with expertise in this field	1	07/01/2010	I personally knew Cheryl Tuller before she started her non profit organization. To quote her directly she told me "she had to do this to support her habit". If one looks into USDA records you will clearly see she was a Breeder for a number of years prior to changing to exhibitor(at my suggestion). In fact she was a breeder while a non profit in the early years.In my opinion, due to lack of support and obvious contradiction she switched categories. At one point she even offered to sell me an ocelot which was born on her premises. To my surprise she actually ended up turning on the owner of the ocelots, similar to how she turned on our friendship. I also believe she also bred and sold Serval kittens while a Non profit to a breeder in Nevada.I believe in doing good for the benefit of the animals no matter what. Cheryl has showed me that she is judge and jury, and holds the animals welfare second.I am disappointed and sadden by my loss of her friendship but glad to have found out, better late than never.
WildCat Haven, Inc.	34705	4	/users/profile/35581	seg1	Donor	4	04/05/2010	I was lucky enough to find out about WildCat Haven, Inc about 3 years ago.  I received a donation solicitation in the mail.  I support a variety of animal welfare organizations locally and internationally so I assumed they purchased my name/address from one of those lists.The organization got my attention because it was helping wildlife that had been completed abused by humans and because it was local.   I had never heard of the organization and it was supposedly only 75 miles from my home.  I called the Oregon Humane Society in Portland, Oregon and they had nothing but praise for the organization.  I was also pleased to hear that they were not "open to the public", but was quite open to allowing other non-profits to see their good work.  This means they care more about the animals welfare than the opportunity to benefit from them.There aren't many "real" facilities like this in the country. Some organizations "claim" to be operating for the welfare of the animals when in fact they are really personal zoos.Because the organization was local and I could keep tabs on their progress, they earned my long time support and donations.  I would encourage others to be a part of their good work.
WildCat Haven, Inc.	34567	4	/users/profile/35426	cougarlover	Donor	5	04/03/2010	WCH is an amazing place for wildcats that have been bought for personal enjoyment and can no longer be kept as pets. WCH takes in these amazing animals and gives them a home for life. WCH is not used as amsusment for tourists, these big cats are safe from people that dont understand what they have gone though. WCH loves and cares for all of these cats with every inch of their heart..

WildCat Haven, Inc.	34455	6	/users/profile/35305	laura13	Donor	5	04/01/2010	I can't say enough praise for WildCat Haven in Sherwood, Oregon.   I am so inspired by the incredible life these cats have in their sanctuary, that I am a dedicated, long-time supporter.  I have been honored to be allowed to visit a few times and come away from the experience feeling so happy for those cats.Because they are not open to the public, it's hard for them to get donations because it's not well known.  However, it is most worthy of support of any kind.
WildCat Haven, Inc.	34436	7	/users/profile/35283	leah62	Donor	5	04/01/2010	WCH came into my life over a year ago when attending a fundraiser for the local feline society.  Cats have always been special to me and to find a haven for the Big Cats was a wonderful surprise.  I have since become more involved with WCH thru donations and will be a volunteer to assist in any way possible to benefit the sanctuary.  That there exists a home for cats treated with such cruelty and pain by the people that "owned" them is a huge thing to find.  The privacy for the cats is so important and I applaud them for not being tempted to "show" them for the purpose of raising funds.  The cats are glowing with love and care yet respected for the wild animals they truly are.  With wholehearted support of WCH I hope you will view the website and see the wonderful work they have accomplished with only donated funds.  They are the only hope for many wild cats and hybrids currently being abused.  Please find it in your heart to care.
WildCat Haven, Inc.	34435	4	/users/profile/35280	leslie7	Volunteer	5	04/01/2010	WildCat Haven is to be commended for their amazing work.  They are the only sanctuary in the Pacific Northwest that focuses their rescue work on smaller breed wildcats.  They have over 50 rescues on site, representing 5 different species:  cougar, bobcat, lynx, serval, caracal, and hybrids as well.It's heartbreaking work.  The rescues--who were either purchased as pets or lived at fur farms--arrive at the sanctuary frightened, malnourished, some have broken bones, and by the look in their eyes--most have lost hope.The founders and volunteers work very hard to restore their health, trust, and mental and emotional wellbeing.  They are fed high quality food, loved and nurtured, and provided natural surroundings in which to live.Food alone--for one month--costs $3,000.  Materials for a single enclosure can cost up to $16,000.  Funds are always desperately needed to ensure these precious cats can continue to receive the best care possible.Through  no fault of their own, these cats have endured neglect, abuse and abandonment.  At WildCat Haven these cats have been given a second chance.  Please help us help them and donate today--you can make a difference for the wild at heart!  Thank you!

In every capacity, it is an organization I have been proud to work with. The importance of the work done by this organization is evident in the changed lives of its clients.  The hand-up Transition Projects is able to provide is invaluable to our society.  I can't individually help all those who cross my path, but by partnering with Transition projects, I make a difference.  It is a fiscally responsible organization too which makes me comfortable that my donations are used to help people transition from homelessness or avoid it altogether.

You cook and serve a dinner to men (or woman if you are at the woman's shelter) and are able to see the impact your work has immediately.  The shelters are always very organized and well maintained.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  The mission of this organization, to help individuals transition from homeless to housing means you are part of a positive change in many lives.  I recommend volunteering at Transition Projects for adults, families or groups seeking a positive, impactful experience.

They continually find ways to reach people, exploring ways to help their lives move in a positive direction. This is a great organization providing support and connection.
Transition Projects	137391		/users/profile/183372	Alan_Shoebridge	Board Member	5	11/12/2012	Although I am new to Transition Projects, Ive been greatly impressed by the dedicated individuals who are working and volunteering here to help end homelessness in Portland. I encourage anyone looking for volunteer or donation opportunities to consider this outstanding organization. Transition Projects is truly making a difference in the lives of people who have few options and resources for secure housing, which is something that so many of us are blessed to enjoy.
Transition Projects	136504		/users/profile/182429	RussDanielson	Volunteer	5	11/09/2012	I've been a volunteer preparing and serving food in the men's shelter several times a year for 20 years.  The great work these folks do to help people who are victims of homelessness is truly remarkable. The respect, dignity and compassion of the staff and their commitment to help others is evident every day at TPI.  They work with thousands of people every year to help lift them up. They also work on advocacy at the State and City level to improve services and expand reach. 
Transition Projects	136478		/users/profile/182401	Becky M	Volunteer	5	11/09/2012	Through Hillsdale Community Church we have donated supper monthly, for 90 homeless men for 30 years.  I help with the cooking and sometimes with the shopping.  This is a fulfilling effort to help those who are in need and hungry.  Many times we get a standing ovations for an excellent delicious meal!
Transition Projects	136024		/users/profile/181925	Concerned Community Member	Volunteer	4	11/08/2012	The lengths that the staff and volunteers go to in order to help our homeless community members is amazing. Transition Projects engages the individuals that utilize their resources in a variety of ways. I was really impressed to see that they had client art work up for First Thursday(S) and invited the public to come in and take a look. I really enjoy the variety of volunteer opportunities they have as well, from coat drives, to sorting donations and cooking meals. I am very proud that my Partner works for such a great organization and comes home fulfilled each day. Keep up the good work everyone! PS: I just got back from volunteering today! :0)

They are key partners in effectively sheltering people, while providing the services to move people from the streets to permanent housing.  Beyond providing essential shelter and services, TPI breaks down barriers and connects the broader community of "housed" Portlanders with those experiencing homelessness through its outreach and volunteer opportunities.
Transition Projects	135396		/users/profile/181257	Victoria K.	Volunteer	5	11/08/2012	I volunteered at the Transition Projects through a school club and it was honestly one of the best volunteer experiences I've ever had. As a club, we've volunteered a lot for other food service charity organizations, but with the Transition Projects, having the ability to also cook and plan the meals we served added a whole new dimension. The Transition Projects provided me with a truly valuable experience! 
Transition Projects	135395		/users/profile/181255	Misha4	Volunteer	5	11/08/2012	This is a great organization!  I am president of a club at our school and we will have volunteered at Transition Projects 4 times by the end of this month.  Everyone has a great experience every time they volunteer with Transition Projects.  It encourages more volunteering and club activity and has been labeled as the most rewarding experience we provide by almost all of our members that have participated in this event.
Transition Projects	135382		/users/profile/181242	Phil S.	Volunteer	5	11/08/2012	Transition Projects is the best chance a homeless person has to getting their life back on track. These guys give housing, food, clothing and inspiration to homeless men so they may get back in the work force and make it on their own. They a responsible for many men who can say they were once homeless but found a way out. God Bless these guys.
Transition Projects	135355		/users/profile/181215	Cathy B	Volunteer	5	11/07/2012	The Transition Projects povides help for those that normally would not get help and are often ignored and looked down upon.  Their new facility The Bud Clark Commons is a clean and beautiful building.  Unlike other shelters I have visited that are dark and depressing, the Bud Clark Commons is so nice it looks like a new hotel. Their positive friendly staff is great and provides an uplifting environment for people who need to feel better about themselves. I volunteer for their annual Coat and Blanket Drive.  Every year many companies around the Portland Metro area take donations of Coats and Blankets, so that men, women, and children stay warm with coats and blankets throughout the winter months.  They also have other drives throughout the year the supply hygene products and other supplies to people in need. Their services include shelter, clothing, food, and job skills to people who could not get help otherwise. I cannot say enough about the Transition Projects and their help to the homeless.  They are the Best!!! Cathy B
Transition Projects	135140		/users/profile/181007	Lynn H.	Volunteer	5	11/07/2012	Transition Projects does amazing work with all homeless people regardless of age, gender, lenght of time on the street, etc..... I have been a volunteer team leader for 8 years and I love it. To see them mens smiling faces while serving dinner and to see the faces light up when you talk to them and treat them like the human beings they are is an awesome feeling. TPI has helped so many in so many ways, big and small. They offer people a place to take a shower, wash their laundry, a computer room with volunteers to help with resume's and job searches all the way up to helping people find permanent housing. I really appreciate how much they work with our Veterans too! Thank you TPI for all you do!
Transition Projects	135096		/users/profile/180962	Mark W	Volunteer	5	11/07/2012	Transition Projects is a non profit provider of homeless services.

Transition Projects	134895		/users/profile/180760	martorana8883	Volunteer	5	11/07/2012	Transition Projects, Inc., is an amazing resource for the homeless in the greater Portland area. Professional staff, incredible facility (Bud Clark Commons). TPI provides a variety of services to help people transition from homelessness to housing by providing basic needs (food, clothing, training, self-care, laundry facility, storage, mailboxes). It's an honor to be involved both as a volunteer and a freelance designer.
Transition Projects	134790		/users/profile/180660	leeanddick	Volunteer	5	11/07/2012	For twenty plus years I have volunteered at Transition Projects.  I have cooked and served meals, taught classes and served on the board.  I have seen the outstanding care and skill of a remarkable staff.  These folks truly do help people transition from homelessness to housing.  People are offered access to new skills, respect and opportunity.  The agency has grown from the basement of an urban church to three dignified, clean, safe and respectful buildings offering services and compassion to all.  Transition Projects, Inc. consistently changes lives for the better.

In a small, but significant, way we are able to help support this wonderful organization as we provide meals to clients at the Bud Clark Center, Jean's Place and the Clark Center.  Volunteers are eager to help as the reward of appreciation is outstanding.  The Staff is friendly, helpful and do an amazing job to support their clients as they prepare to move their lives in a positive direction.  Ginny Utti, volunteer
Transition Projects	134674		/users/profile/180550	Crystal sue	Volunteer	5	11/07/2012	Many years ago I was a resident at TPI's womens shelter. At that time I was working with  the A&D counselor to modify my behavior and to create a goal that I could be accountable for.  This has helped me to not only gain sobriety but it has enabled me to remain Clean& sober for more than six years now. I have been enrolled in college and remained consistant in my efforts to gain education and one day return to TPI and work with other women who are faceing life challenges. I am currently once again being assisted by TPI because they are letting me do my internship at the same facility that I used to live at. I hope to one day be employed  at TPI and I am at this time  a candidate for employment in several positions there. I will be working toward my masters degree and one day soon I will be able to say that through the programs and efforts offered at TPI once again I am able to live an independant life free of my past mistakes. As a student at Marylhurst University I am learning how faceing our past and accepting our mistakes we are able to help other to do the same. At TPI and the many branches of help they offer I believe that I will one day realize my dream.

Transition Projects	134649		/users/profile/180522	judyberck	Volunteer	5	11/07/2012	I volunteered to cook and serve meals once a month for the Clark Men's Center in Portland and got to know several of the staff very well.  The organization is very well run and the staff truly care about their clients.   They worked very hard to meet the needs of the men and to make the center a warm and comfortable place.   They also made it easy for groups to come in and cook meals in their kitchen, and helped us throughout that process. 
Transition Projects	134559		/users/profile/180400	EJCR	Volunteer	5	11/06/2012	As a middle school and high school teacher both in the secular and religious community, I have taken many groups to serve meals at each of the three Transition Projects' shelters: Clark Center, Jean's Place, and what used to be the Glisan Center.  Not only did the TP staff make it easy for us to arrange to volunteer by responding quickly to scheduling requests, but all the staff was welcoming once we arrived at the shelters.  The truly exceptional part of these experiences came from serving the residents.  Each time they were polite and appreciative and made our teens and preteens feel at ease.  The applause at the end always made our group feel special.  Often my students recount years later how meaningful the shelter feed experience was and how it transformed their views about volunteering and put a face to homelessness.  Often they approached the experience with trepidation, but by the end of the evening expressed surprise at how comfortable they felt while interacting with the residents and how motivated they were to continue helping in this way. There are so few opportunities for young people to directly serve people in need in our community; more often they are left to do fundraising or donation drives.  Taking students to Transition Projects is my "go to" when trying to teach the value of volunteering!
Transition Projects	134551		/users/profile/180392	Hren	Donor	5	11/06/2012	Every year my family sits down and determines how our charitable giving dollars will be allocated.  My wife, son and myself look at the many local options.  One such program that  has drawn us to support it for several years now is Transition Projects.  Their commitment to helping their clients succeed in the real world is amazing and refreshing.  Everyone is held accountable for their actions and expected to be an active part of their transition to real life.  The staff is very caring and committed.  The Leadership, both Board and Director are committed to their principles and they stand by them.  A truly excellent program worthy of financial support.
Transition Projects	134533		/users/profile/180374	trafcon	Volunteer	5	11/06/2012	Our youth group was looking for a way to help others.  As young people they felt helpless seeing needs around them and not being able to serve. We have been serving dinner for over a year, every month.  One 7th grader (who has not missed a single month of service) told me this is  the best things she does all month.  She loves it so much she changed her birthday party because we were serving on that date. Our kids cook everything from scratch (including dessert), take it down, serve it and then have dinner talking with the men.  It has put a face to helping others and given us ALL way more than we give in service!  We feel so blessed to have found not only a way to serve others, but a place where our youth are welcomed, encouraged and taught the joy of service to others!  What wonderful life lessons!   Jody J.
Transition Projects	134509		/users/profile/180350	Larry18	Volunteer	5	11/06/2012	There is absolutely nothing that compares with serving at Transition Projects. Our church youth group have been BLESSED to serve meals to many homeless men in the Portland area. In all circumstances the men have been so appreciative. Sam Haffey the volunteer coordinator is one of the kindest hardest working people I've ever met. This is a well run, highly gratifying place that makes you feel so fortunate to have what you have in life and so thankful that you've shared your time to help so many.
Transition Projects	134483		/users/profile/180323	Ric Drury	Volunteer	5	11/06/2012	I have been priviledged to volunteer at Transition Project's Bud Clark Commons since opening.  I walked by it everyday to work and home during construction, and knew it had potential to be Portland's most progessive programs and facilities for the less fortunate. Showers, restrooms, lockers, clothing, shoes, laundry, mail boxes, kitchen, hair shop and a computer lab are available to walk-ins.  And that's just the day center. There is also short term housing for 90 men on another floor, and 130 studio apartments on upper floors for the city's most vunerable and needy. I started out in the hygene center a few evenings a month handing out everything from towels to tampons.  I am now in the computer lab once a week and I might assist visitors filling out job or housing applicaptions on-line, to goggling area codes they need to complete submissions.  And last night I even helped with this kid's tie.  No, not an interview, but I wonder how his date went? 
Transition Projects	134481	1	/users/profile/180321	igotthehelpineeded	Client Served	5	11/06/2012	Hello I would like to stay anonymous because I'm not looking for a handout. I was homeless for over 15 years suffering from depression and drug addiction. I entered tpi and a young man name Tyrone Greeted me with a smile and told me that it did not matter what I've been through that whenever I needed any help that his hours were Monday thru Friday 11am to 7pm. That made me understand that somebody finally cared about me. At that time i was not ready to get my life right so i went back to the streets the place I only new about. I came back to tpi 7 months later looking for Tyrone for help but I could find him at all. I came for a whole week and never seen him. I finally ask a young lady name Kyla what happen to Tyrone she told me that he was a case manager. I called Tyrone and he was able to do goods thing for me. Tyrone got me into Hooper detox. when I got out of Hooper he had me set up with a bed at a treatment facility. from the treatment facility I was able to find work and get housing. I was also able to get my kids back in my life. I am not longer homeless, I do not use Drugs, and I feel good about life today. if tpi didn't have there doors open for me when i was ready I would probably be dead or in jail. thank you tpi  
Transition Projects	134455		/users/profile/180292	LNKehoe	Volunteer	5	11/06/2012	Transition Projects, Incorporated is a worthy and critical non profit that serves over 9000 Portlanders as they transition from homelessness to housing.  From shelter, meals, showers, phone message serve, computer access as well as couseling and training, they are an amazing support for their clients. For the last 8 years my family and I have volunteered at Transition Projects, Inc. in a variety of ways.Our church and soccer groups made and served meals.  Our sons conducted coat drives for their scout projects.   I served as a philanthropy liason for a mother daughter organization, National Charity League, and I adopted TPI as my focus.  My daughter and friends offered clients home made blankets, dontated silverware packets, made and served meals, conducted toiletry and coat drives, made and donated haunted gingerbread mansions and flower centerpieces and flower pots, and delivered homemade cards and stamps for their clients' use.  At the conclusion of their 6 year membership in NCL, over half the graduating class of 2012 listed Transition Projects, Inc as their favorite philanthropy.  I help organize a community work day for our local high school and TPI utilizes a group of highschoolers to help with organzing and support for the shelter.  The administration and staff is committed, caring and professional and deserves credit for their valued service to better the lives of so many worthy members of our community.
Transition Projects	134449		/users/profile/180287	Pete Bruns	Donor	5	11/06/2012	I was able to be part of the team that built Bud Clark Commons where Transition Projects operates. I have been going as often as time allows since their first dinner and seeing the expressions on the peoples faces as we help them have a better life. This is an amazing group and the work they do for people in need is priceless. The team that Doreen works with probably doesn't get all of the recognition they deserve. What a great program!

I thank the Lord every day for the services that have been offered to so many by TPI
Transition Projects	134440		/users/profile/180278	Maren Willette	Volunteer	5	11/06/2012	I have volunteered for Transition Projects Inc at their Bud Clark Commons and am always impressed by the commitment of their people, and especially their Executive Director Doreen Binder, which is a testament to her good works and leadership. They are truly an inspirational organization who provide quality services to a part of our community that often gets overlooked. We are very grateful  and lucky to have such a devoted non-profit making a difference in our community.

Transition Projects	134421		/users/profile/180257	lj123	Volunteer	5	11/06/2012	My church & I have been preparing & serving monthly meals at the Bud Clark Commons center for going on 2 years.  My work is also preparing & serving quarterly meals at Bud Clark Commons for 2 years.  What a great program Ttranition Project Inc (TPI) has for the men at the shelter.  The people who work at TPI are always upbeat and willing to help anyone.  It's not just the meals, but the help, support  and classes that are provided that makes TPI so important to all that need their services.  You can see how greatful the men are at the shelter for everything.  It has been a life change for me since I've started volunteering.  In these times, it's great to have a nonprofit like TPI in Portland.  
Transition Projects	134407		/users/profile/180242	Julie Livingston	Volunteer	5	11/06/2012	TPI provides a broad spectrum of social services to homeless citizens in our community that have a direct and positive impact on people's lives and longevity, from simple hygiene services like a shower and change of clothes to more complex case management like housing placement and addiction counseling. TPI is a great place to volunteer; experiences are hands-on and yield immediate, visible results. TP This is a well-managed organization that provides real leadership in our community and a unique opportunity for volunteers to give and give back.
Transition Projects	134402		/users/profile/180237	axim	Volunteer	4	11/06/2012	My co-workers and I have prepared and served meals to the men at Clark Center for the past six years. We've also been involved in their yearly coat drives and have donated food and much needed cooking utencils. It's the most popular volunteer event among my colleagues because we see the direct impact a hot meal has on the men who live there. From the moment we arrive, a few guys run out to our cars to to help carry in food, there's always someone asking if there is anything they can do to help, and after we finish serving they clean the kitchen and put dishes away. That's just one example of the unique community aspects and 'were in this together' feeling that keeps us coming back. 
Transition Projects	134392		/users/profile/180224	Melissa105	Volunteer	5	11/06/2012	I volunteer on a monthly basis for the Men's shelter at Clark Center.

This is a wonderful organization.

Transition Projects	134377		/users/profile/180206	Michelle102	Volunteer	5	11/06/2012	This nonprofit is a great asset to the city of Portland. I'm an active volunteer in the men's housing shelter located under the Hawthorne Bridge. The staff is always accessible and open to services that the community is willing/able to provide to the residents at the center. I definitely think that the individuals involved in the program are given great opportunities to better themselves and their lives. I enjoy working with them and supporting them the best way that I can. 
Senior Citizens Council of Clackamas County Inc	305686	3	/users/profile/243004	michael213,	Donor	5	09/20/2016	Senior Citizens Council of Clackamas County provides an invaluable service to the community.  They regularly step up to manage the care-giving and financial needs of vulnerable seniors and people with disabilities who have no family members or friends available to serve.  I have worked with SCC for years, and have admired their willingness and ability to jump into difficult situations to stabilize and improve the lives of vulnerable Oregonians.  They protect their clients from financial abuse/exploitation, connect them with necessary services, and ensure that their medical and care needs are met.  They do hard work that would otherwise go undone, and in the process, they avoid an untold  amount of human suffering.  Clackamas County is very fortunate to have them.

What a valuable service to the community.  I am pleased to associate with them and refer clients to them and their services.  I hear only good things.    thank you thank you thank you  Keep up the great cause.
Senior Citizens Council of Clackamas County Inc	305996	3	/users/profile/397264	aprilbundy	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/21/2016	The senior citizens council has helped so many of my clients, I can't even count the number. They are compassionate and hard working. They always work until the task is accomplished and they don't give up. I have no idea what Clackamas County would do without their important contribution to our community. Thank you so much! 
Senior Citizens Council of Clackamas County Inc	305281	2	/users/profile/109143	Tom Unger	Board Member	5	09/18/2016	I've volunteered on the board of this grassroots nonprofit organization for many years. There is no other nonprofit group in Oregon that provides similar services to senior citizens who are at risk of being financially and/or physically abused. Once the Senior Council accepts a client, they continue serving that person for the rest of their life. Many of its clients don't have the funds to pay for those services. In those cases, the Senior Council helps them for free. The Senior Council literally saves the lives of many, many Oregonians. The Senior Council staff is dedicated and passionate about helping others.
Senior Citizens Council of Clackamas County Inc	184255	3	/users/profile/109143	Tom Unger	Board Member	5	10/29/2013	I've volunteered as a board member of this organization for a few years. I joined after I learned about all the services it provides senior citizens who are at risk of losing their life savings and have no one else to protect or care for them. This nonprofit group is unique. The services it provides at little or no cost to seniors are not offered by any other local agency. That's why the court system (judges, lawyers) and social service agencies love it so much. They often turn to the Council as a place of last resort to help save a senior in need. I can't say enough good things about the Senior Citizens Council of Clackamas County. It is a grass roots agency that doesn't spend a lot on staff, rent or office equipment. The dedicated board and staff make sure to use as much of its budget as possible on helping our vulnerable senior citizens.
Senior Citizens Council of Clackamas County Inc	94391	2	/users/profile/109143	Tom Unger	Board Member	5	07/26/2011	I volunteer on the board of the Senior Citizens Council of Clackamas County. I first became aware of the organization just over a year ago when it chose two of my fellow Wells Fargo employees for its annual award. I discovered that this nonprofit group is providing vital services to seniors that are not available anywhere else. I also found out that many of its clients are not able to pay even the minimal fee for those services so the council provides them for free. I was so impressed with the council and its staff that I agreed to serve on its board and play a larger role in its efforts. I think this is a wonderful organization worthy of support.
Senior Citizens Council of Clackamas County Inc	218992	3	/users/profile/282607	ThankUvrymuch	General Member of the Public	5	10/01/2014	I first became aware of Senior Citizens Council of Clackamas County when they were appointed as Conservator for a neighbor of mine who was suffering financial abuse from a woman who was supposedly  "helping him". What she was doing was helping herself to his income and savings  to pay for her drug habit, and her own household bills.  The Senior Citizens Council was able to step in and protect this man from any further financial exploitation.  Unfortunately  the  Senior Council was not able to get Guardianship, and so was not able to advocate for appropriate medical care, which he needed. His health rapidly declined and he soon passed away. I was thankful for all the Senior Council did, and tried to do for this man. He was a die hard New Yorker, who moved to Oregon after loosing his son, and two son-in-laws on 9/11 in the Twin Towers. He could be a grouchy old man, but he had a heart of gold. He didn't deserve to be taken advantage of by someone he thought he could trust.
Senior Citizens Council of Clackamas County Inc	218835	1	/users/profile/282435	lhorns47	Volunteer	5	10/01/2014	I did not know that an organization like the Senior Citizens Council existed when we started helping out a disabled neighbor who was in need of some very basic services at the time.  When we were approached by Sue, we discovered that they were truly there to provide all the support and active service we could have asked for.  Our neighbor is in much better condition, physically, financially, and emotionally than he was before their involvement.  They have also been quick to respond to other referrals we have sent their way.  
Senior Citizens Council of Clackamas County Inc	218777	1	/users/profile/234317	earlyriser43us	Volunteer	5	10/01/2014	I was unaware of the SCC of CC when we reached out to a disabled neighbor who had been abandoned by what remaining family he had left for economic reasons. I was very defensive of our involvement with our neighbor when we were first approached by the SCC. Prior to the council's involvement, I was told our friend would have to hit bottom to receive proper care. When we received our first call from the Senior Citizens Council of Clackamas County, I was dumbfounded! I thought that such a group was only  a fantasy. They asked us to continue our support of our neighbor but, with their assistance and guidance. I cannot imagine the stress that this council goes though each and every day. The care and compassion that's administered to their clients along with finding the funding to continue another day gives a window of hope for the future of our society.

I can't imagine any organization in this field working harder on behalf of their clients.  I would not hesitate to recommend them to anybody who is looking for assistance in this area, and in fact, have recommended them many times.  The people that work at the Senior Council are extremely knowledgeable, not to mention friendly, supportive, caring and a lot of fun to work with.  No matter the situation, it always brightened my day when Christi B. or Sue would call or stop by the office.  I'm sure they have brightened many others' days as well just by doing what they do and being who they are.

Senior Citizens Council of Clackamas County Inc	212591	2	/users/profile/275633	Whitney5	Advisor	5	08/28/2014	I have had the pleasure of working with the Senior Citizens Council of Clackamas County (SCC) for the past several years. As an attorney with Oregon Elder Law, my experience with SCC has come from both sides - I have referred clients and families to SCC for services and have also represented SCC in their guardianship and conservatorship program. SCC staff is professional in working with clients and colleagues, and very compassionate about protecting vulnerable seniors in our community. For seniors who do not have family or friends who can step in and help, SCC provides a valuable service in directing the seniors medical care and managing the senior's finances. SCC is a tremendous resource for Clackamas County. SCC provides comprehensive services to ensure seniors are safe and maintain as high a level of independence as possible. SCC is a joy to work with and I appreciate the compassion they bring to their jobs and the services they provide to our community.

They regularly step up to manage the care-giving and financial needs of vulnerable seniors and people with disabilities who have no family members or friends available to serve.  I have worked with SCC for years, and have admired their willingness and ability to jump into difficult situations to stabilize and improve the lives of vulnerable Oregonians.  They protect their clients from financial abuse/exploitation, connect them with necessary services, and ensure that their medical and care needs are met.  They do hard work that would otherwise go undone, and in the process, they avoid an untold  amount of human suffering.  Clackamas County is very fortunate to have them.

I work within Social Services and have worked in partnership with the Senior Council as they assisted in the role of Guardianship/Rep Payee/etc for clients who have no other natural supports.  Everyone I have worked with puts the client first and advocates as needed to ensure their needs are met.  I have to admit it can be extremely challenging when having to network with other agencies (SSA/DHS/Etc) and I have observed professionalism from their end in supporting client needs along with the flexibility in meeting at short notice...much appreciated!  Kudos to the wonderful work everyone does at the Senior Council!

The Sr. Council staff has a unique talent and interest in working with the seniors in the community, protecting their interests and advocating for the best interests of their clients.  There really is not another organization in the state that attains the level of professionalism and excellence that the Sr. Council strives and maintains.  There is no question but that this organization is a great benefit to and for the community.  Their advocacy and protection of seniors interests is outstanding.  To the Sr. Council, their task is to assist and protect seniors to the best of their ability and, unfortunately, with available resources that are always limited.  Can't say enough about the dedication of the staff.

Our Family is extremely grateful to SCCCC for providing a secure framework to protect my Great Aunt from further abuse.  I joined the SCCCC board because of my concern for other vulnerable individuals and to support the honorable service SCCCC provides for what I now know is a vast problem in our country today!  Without the SCCCC program, many seniors would have no protection from financial abuse and neglect.  Donors need to be informed of the important work SCCCC provides for our community and donate with confidence to this great non-profit. 
Senior Citizens Council of Clackamas County Inc	186025	1	/users/profile/243007	medgel	Donor	5	10/30/2013	The Senior Citizens Council of Clackamas County is an invaluable resource for the seniors of Clackamas County and their family members.  They provide a whole array of services to seniors, but one area of service that's particularly impressive to our firm (Oregon Elder Law) is their fiduciary services.  SCC frequently steps up to serve as guardian, conservator, or trustee for seniors who have no suitable family members or friends to take on these roles.  Serving in these fiduciary roles is hard work, and SCC performs the work efficiently and with compassion.   SCC has a small staff and a small budget, yet they serve a large number of seniors and deliver an impressive amount of services.   We at Oregon Elder Law truly admire SCC and wish that all Oregon counties had the benefit of an organization like them.

Senior Citizens Council of Clackamas County Inc	119453	1	/users/profile/162423	Millergreens	General Member of the Public	5	07/28/2012	Senior Citizens Council of Clackamas County was there when I needed them at a time when my neighbor and friend showed serious signs of dementia.  She had lived alone for years following her husband's death.  One of her passions is dogs and she had a small number of friends and neighbors who asked her to babysit their dogs--a great fit for all.  As she began to forget dog-sitting appointments, dog names and owner names, it was evident something was wrong.  The last time she babysit my dog, when I paid her she said she needed to get some food.  She opened her refrigerator and it was almost empty except for some pickles and a few leftover scraps.  She told me of a letter from the IRS asking for more money.  I asked her if I could help her and she trusted me to do so.  As we worked together to file important papers and stock some food in her refrigerator, it appeared she was having difficulty writing checks, recording them or even taking checks to the bank.  She needed someone to help her on a long term basis.  You see, she had no relatives that she knew of and no close friends to step in and help her.  I contacted the County of Clackamas, however they were limited in the assistance they could give.  They mentioned the Senior Citizens Council of Clackamas County which perhaps could help me.  When I contacted the Senior Citizens Council and spoke with Louise Marsh, she quickly understood all the signals and behaviors that my friend was manifesting.  She gave me some excellent advise.  Louise was as concerned as I was about the safety and vulnerability of my friend and agreed to meet with me and my friend at her home.  We discussed the pros and cons of my friend remaining in her home and Louise was a compassionate listener and helpful advisor to us both.  After another meeting we had convinced my friend to relocate to an assisted care facility nearby.  At this point I knew that becoming a legal guardian for my friend was more than I could handle.  The Senior Citizens Council helped advise me about the need to contact an attorney to petition the courts for establishing a legal guardian/conservatorship for my friend.  When I went to an attorney specializing in senior issues, I was told that I must assign a trustee in my petition.  I was elated to find out that Senior Citizens Council of Clackamas County could be named my friend's trustee.  At that point, I phoned them to see if they would consider it.  Since Louise Marsh had already interviewed my friend, they would discuss it further and bring it before their board for consideration.  How lucky my friend was when they accepted her in their trusteeship as her guardian and conservator.  The help and guidance of the Senior Citizens Council of Clackamas County, Louise Marsh and Christi Bird made it possible to get safety and asset protection for my friend and neighbor.  My dog and I visit our friend often at the living center where she has found a safe and caring home.  Her new friends from the Council drop by on a regular basis to see her also and make sure she is happy.

I have worked with SCC for years, and have admired their willingness and ability to jump into difficult situations to stabilize and improve the lives of vulnerable Oregonians.  They protect their clients from financial abuse/exploitation, connect them with necessary services, and ensure that their medical and care needs are met.  They do hard work that would otherwise go undone, and in the process, they avoid an untold  amount of human suffering.  Clackamas County is very fortunate to have them.

Ive been involved in a number of cases where neglect and or abuse was involved before our intervention. Was most satisfying to be part of the solution. The organization is clearly run in a fiscally sound manner. 
Senior Citizens Council of Clackamas County Inc	94761	1	/users/profile/109687	Rehab Plus	Donor	5	07/31/2011	Over the past several years I have had the priviledge to assist the Senior Citizens Council with monetary as well as time donations.  They assist seniors and disabled adults whom have been abused in one way or another.  I have enjoyed volunteering for them at their annual fund raising event.
Senior Citizens Council of Clackamas County Inc	94757	1	/users/profile/109681	Mary D	Advisor	5	07/31/2011	I have served as a part time Fund Development Consultant for Senior Citizens Council for the last 4 years.  In my 30 years in this profession, I have worked with many non-profits and have interacted with many types of Board and Staff.  Ive seen the good, bad and those I want to forget. Senior Citizens Councils staff and board members are one of the best non-profits for which I have worked, both in their mission of service, dedication of staff and board, as well as commitment to improve and grow.  They continue to impress me with their strong dedication to and support of their mission, services and their clients.  In the last couple of years, we have been able to upgrade the profile of the Board, adding members who can outreach and spread the word about Senior Council to the community.   In the process of preparing their direct mail appeal letters, I have talked with several of Senior Citizen clients or their family members.  Their gratitude and praise of Senior Citizens Council services is unbounded, and they are truly appreciative of the services received.  As the Sister of one client said, My Brother would have been out on the street and probably dead long ago if it wasnt for Senior Councils care and help with his finances and living arrangements. I encourage anyone seeking a very worthwhile Investment of your donated funds or other types of help, I ask you to seriously consider Senior Citizens Council of Clackamas County.  Your Investment will literally save and change lives, each and every day!
Senior Citizens Council of Clackamas County Inc	94702	1	/users/profile/109604	VSP1	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/30/2011	I have had the good fortune of working with Senior Council since 1974.  As a case manager for seniors, I was delighted to find their services for my client.  When assigned to Adult Protective Services, I started working closely with their guardianship/conservatorship program, and later became a member of their advisory board.  I continue to serve on the board after my retirement from government service because of the dedication of staff, and quality service from the organization.  They fill many of the gaps in social services in Clackamas County, while operating with the very limited funds that is the pligt of many non-profits.  
Senior Citizens Council of Clackamas County Inc	94578	1	/users/profile/109413	darceybone	Board Member	5	07/28/2011	I am constantly impressed with the dedicaton and determination of the staff of Senior Council.  The mission fills a much needed gap in services to seniors in Clackamas County.  The organization accomplishes so much on a limited budget.  Each day in our community lives are touched by the work of this organization.  I have been on the board for almost two years.  In that time I have seen first-hand the hard work put forth to provide services to this vurnerable population.  I am proud to be affiliated with this group and proud for my business to be affilated as a sponsor.  
Senior Citizens Council of Clackamas County Inc	94571	1	/users/profile/109401	pleeper	Client Served	5	07/28/2011	I found Senior Citizens Council of Clackamas County by pure luck.   My mother had  suffered a series of small stroaks which involved several health complications.  After becoming widowed, she was on a very limited income and had no skills of managing her money or monthly bills.  The health issues combined with the unmagability of her finances were too much for me to handle alone.   The Senior Citizen Coucil has helped get my mom back on track while allowing her to keep her home.  They have worked long and hard to get her monthly payments lowered, additional assistance in areas needed and they communicated with me every step of the way.  They truly have my mothers best interest at heart and I feel blessed to have her in their program.  
Senior Citizens Council of Clackamas County Inc	94549	1	/users/profile/109369	marci	General Member of the Public	5	07/28/2011	I have had the most wonderful experiences working with Senior Citizens Council.  I have been fortunate to be asked to be a part of the advisory committee, work for an agency that can contact SCC when needing  assistance with a person who may need guardianship/conservatorship, and a citizen of the county in which they serve.  The staff are the most kind, caring, compassionate advocates and go beyond their scopes of the program to insure safety, health, and well-being for each of the most vulneralbe individuals they serve.  I can call anytime with questions and get immediate response.  I cannot express enough gratitude to this group of people/program who make this a wonderful option/resource available for someone who may not have any safe, caring people in their lives.

I am so proud to be a part of this organization.   We help meet the needs of so many seniors in Clackamas county and strive to help them stay in their homes whenever possible.  The staff is extremely skilled and selfless.  Ialso  turned to this organization for help when my mother moved in with us and needed extra care and attention when I was at work.  They provided me with several excellent care providers .
Senior Citizens Council of Clackamas County Inc	94352	1	/users/profile/109084	andydaniel	Advisor	5	07/25/2011	I sit on the advisory committee for the Sr. Citizens Council and primarily deal with the guardianship/conservatorship aspect of the program.  I have been a member of the advisory committee for over 15 years.  This is a volunteer position. Although a few of the program clients are capable of private pay, the vast majority of interventions deal with poor, non-private paying individuals who  are unable to care for themselves either financially, physically, emotionally or mentally.  These are seniors who have been subjected to abuse from family, care-providers or strangers.  Many times, they have no other support in the community or from family.  Social services, law enforcement, and the judicial system has in many cases become involved.  And we are not talking about our youth or the mainstream of society.  We are dealing with the most vulnerable, the elderly of society, our parents and grand-parents.     I have seen many of those who would otherwise have died an early death or been cheated from their remaining assets, protected and placed in a proper setting where they can be assisted both medically and financially.  Many have made tremendous recoveries and have been able to live a life in peace and good health.  This would never have happened without this program and the tremendously hard work of Christie and Lousie, and all others who work in the program.    I see the staff working beyond call.  I see this essential work being performed on a shoe string budget.   Funding of the program is always a stressor.  Fund raising is a time consuming and distracting mechanism which effectively distracts from the underlying work that needs to be performed.     I have enjoyed my work with the committee and am hoping to continue to volunteer for as long as needed.   I get a great deal of satisfaction from helping those seniors who need our help the most.  It is a great program and deserves the accolades that it receives and a proper source of funding that it deserves.

Any time I have a question or I am curious about something related to 1p36,  I have been able to bring it to the group and they have provided insight,  love,  and support.

This is extremly important because our kids can be misdiagnosed with illnesses that stem from the disability.

It is a great place to get advice and to get input in decision making.  As a single parent I don't have anyone to throw ideas around with so I go to this group.  I am never alone.  There is much information that people in this group know about the syndrome that is not in any publications yet so in my opinion this group is made up of the experts .

Hearing that something is wrong with your child and that they will not lead a normal life is not something any parent wants to hear. I remember being completly devasted and had never heard of this syndrome. Our genetics doctor was able to shed some light on it but able to give us any detailed information. My husband went online and was researching it when he came upon information about a 1P36 Deletion Conference, we knew we had to go. We went there and met amazing people and families. To hear the stories of some of the things they had went through, I realized they were strong people and I had a lot to learn from them. There is now a 1P36 FaceBook group and it is wonderful, the word about 1P36 is getting out there and new people are joining our family it seems like daily. We have families from not just all over the USA but all over the world and evern though we have never met many of them face to face and may not live in the same country we are all still family. We all learn from each other, help each other, and cry with each other. That is what family is all about. This family makes dealing with a 1P36 Deletion child bearable and I couldn't imagine going through this journey without them. The people who take care of the things of this organization are amazing wonderful and are doing a great job!

But they become a family from the moment you join to the moment you are able to start meeting some face to face. You go to conference and come home with some of the best friends and new family members. When one family is in pain we all come together as a group for each other. If a child gains their wings we all feel it. This is a group I gladly call my family.

What does this mean for the child?  What does this mean to me?  What will my kid be able to do?  Not do?  Will my kid die an early death. Our fear gripped us, but this group, 1p36 DSA, calmed our fears.  Through the group, we were able to understand our daughter's condition and what care she needed to have a high quality life.  Through the group, we were also introduced to a number of other families, friends, and children who also have the condition.  Their warmth, openness, and caring has made all the difference in the world to our family and, especially, our child.

Our daughter Kaylee was diagnosed with a rare genetic disorder known as 1p36 deletion syndrome at 6 months of age. We wanted to learn everything we could about 1p36 deletion but at the time there was nowhere to turn. There was little information on the internet and no families we could connect with at the time.  We felt so alone and isolated. Can you imagine going to your child's pediatrician and he/she doesn't know anything about your child's diagnosis? This was what we had to face every time we encountered a doctor. We had to educate the medical community in our city. It was very frustrating and scary as parents. You can only imagine our excitement when 1p36 DSA came into existence. 1p36 DSA has made a big difference in our lives. We were able to connect with other families and share life experiences. The support group offered us wonderful resources, valuable information, and beautiful memories. Thanks 1p36 DSA for your love, support, and dedication!
1p36 Deletion Support & Awareness	135015	2	/users/profile/180882	OMsweetOM	Client Served	5	11/07/2012	This is an excellent support group that also sources/provides useful info and promotes awareness of the rare disorder 1p36 Deletion Syndrome.  The love and sympathy from the members is a positive factor to what is otherwise an unraveling situation.  Research surveys and professional papers are shared among the group, an annual conference is held to provide more exposure to experts on the disorder and to enable families to meet each other and share valuable memories.  Fundraising is a big part of the group's intention to raise awareness, fund part of the annual conference and to help less fortunate members attend the conference.

Generally every doctor we saw just started using the term " developmentally delayed " and we had no real diagnosis or prognosis . One genetic test and the long guessing game was now over . 1p36.33p36.32 . Estimated size 2.6 megabases .                                                                                             The 1p36 Deletion Support & Awareness has given our family a way to touch base with other families all over the world who have children with this rare and often devastating syndrome . So few doctors other than geneticists even know about what it is and how it may relate to their specialty . 
1p36 Deletion Support & Awareness	102379		/users/profile/133309	effin	Client Served	5	12/16/2011	My 3 year old daughter has 1p36 deletion syndrome.  This syndrome has many devastating effects for your child including mental retardation, inability to walk or talk, hearing loss, heart problems, and seizures.  The technology to identify the syndrome has really only been around in the past 10 years or so and used regularly in the past 5 years.  So more and more children are getting diagnosed with this each year.   The 1p36 Deletion Support and Awareness group has been a wonderful place to turn for information.  Not much has been studied about this syndrome yet and there are no other children with it who live anywhere near us.  The 1p36 Deletion Support and Awareness Group has provided me with a lifeline of support and information that I could not get anywhere else.

Client Served	5	11/27/2011	I am a member of a very special group named 1P36 Deletion Support and Awareness because my daughter has the deletion. She was not diagnosed until 8 years of age. I'm hoping that increased awareness will get children diagnosed sooner and more accurately. Although my child is considered mildly affected this group has been there to understand our daily challenges. This group has given us a wealth of knowledge and support. We feel we are finally understood and completely accepted.

Participation in their conferences and events has encouraged my family to be compassionate in life in general and to never lose hope because of others inabilities to be accepting. They have provided us with ideas, information, inspiration-on those rough days, and support that uplifts one's very being.
1p36 Deletion Support & Awareness	82110		/users/profile/90112	Carmen R.	General Member of the Public	5	03/13/2011	I am a member of the 1p36 Deletion Support & Awareness group.  This is an excellent source of information.  As many doctors are not familiar with this diagnosis.  I am grandma of Alisha Rassi who is 8 yrs old with 1p36.3.  She was diagnoise at exactly 14 months.  As far as I am concern and per doctors info she is the only case (till date) in Puerto Rico with this medical condition.  I have found that many of the parents in this group are more family with this condition than medical doctors.  I count it a blessing to belong to this group.  We are more than friends but a family.
1p36 Deletion Support & Awareness	46509	1	/users/profile/47345	carriedaggett	Board Member	5	06/29/2010	Being a parent to a 1p36 child brings a multitude of challenges that the parent of a typical child never has to consider.  It can mean lengthy hospital stays, surgeries for heart, digestive or orthopedic complications, specialist appointments and more specialist appointments, a variety of medicines mulitple times a day, pediatric therapists to visit or that that visit you, education plans and meetings, specialized equipment for seating, mobility and sleeping, 24/7 seizure watch, oxygen monitors, feeding tubes, and diapers for a child well beyond potty training age. A parent of a 1p36 child experiences all or some of these things.  The hardship is compounded when parents can't find support or the resources they need or simply connect with another person who relates with what they are going through.My daughter Kate, now 7, was diagnosed with 1p36 Deletion Syndrome at 18 months of age.  Even before getting the diagnosis, we knew that she had some sort of genetic disorder due to her significant health and development issues but the doctors could not put their finger on it. Once we finally did have the diagnosis, we found that there was no-where to turn for support and guidence regarding 1p36 Deletion Syndrome  Six months after getting the diagnosis, I finally happened upon a Yahoo! message board for 1p36 parents and I was so relieved to finally find someone who shared the same experiences as my family.  It was because of the parents who started that message board (and others who organized our first conference or designed special 1p36 web sites) that 1p36 Deletion Syndrome Support & Awareness exists. It is essential that parents and caregivers of 1p36 children are able to connect with others and that the most recent and relevent information regarding the syndrome is available to them and to medical providers.  Early diagnosis means that doctors and parents have new insight into a child's health issues.  That insight can mean better outcomes to the most dangerous of 1p36 Deletion Syndrome's health complications. I believe strongly in the mission of this organization and know that with your help, we can make sure that all children with 1p36 Deletion Syndrome are diagnosed early and that their families get the help they need.

This network not only provides support and education..but more importantly provides HOPE. This is especially important for newly diagnosed families. The annual conference, quarterly newsletters and yahoo support group are wonderful tools to help families with their journey of having a child with special needs.

1p36 Deletion Support & Awareness	45175	10	/users/profile/46079	donna14	Volunteer	5	06/23/2010	My granddaughter has 1p36 Deletion Syndrome. When we first found out, we were devastated, she was one of very few children at the time diagnosed with this chromosomal disorder, and information was limited. They told use she may or may not progress. Today through 1p36 Deletion Support and Awareness Group, we communicate experiences about daily life with our little and some not so little Angels. Learning that we are not alone and that each child/individual with this disorder is different helped us to better understand our little one. We learn through the exchange of information and support we provide to each other. We have an annual conference and invite speakers that are knowledgeable on the latest developments on the research front, teaching tools, for example, this year we will have a speaker that will present information about signing and a workshops for the siblings of children with 1p36. Although 1p36 Deletion Awareness and Support recently received its non-profit status, we have families from around the world that have been communicating with each other for some time. Posting our joys, sorrows, frustrations, and even anger at times, has been a tremendous help to all of our families. We learn from each other, not sure of why your child is behaving in a certain manner, post it and you will get information from a parent with a child that has experienced a similar situation. Concerned about, for example your child going through puberty, someone with knowledge will answer your questions and give you suggestions. As a volunteer, education is essential to understanding our children, each child is different, each child learns in a different manner and the ability to share personal experiences has enriched our family beyond words. Going forward, I would like to see this organization continue to provide education and support for families as well as communities and to learn more about research advances for this genetic disorder.
1p36 Deletion Support & Awareness	44724	11	/users/profile/45638	nate3	Board Member	5	06/21/2010	Patients affected by 1p36 Deletions and their families are rare enough that personal interaction and support is limited.  To remedy this, I've been able to work with support group members to host annual conferences for families. At these conferences patients and families can interact, support each other, learn from doctors and therapists. The conferences have become an essential part of many group member's summer plans.
1p36 Deletion Support & Awareness	44685	10	/users/profile/45598	phoenix1	Board Member	5	06/21/2010	I am so very proud to be a member of such a loving group. With the help of other members in this close knit community I have learned to provide the best care possible for my daughter, whom is bestowed with a 1p36 deletion. I have learned invaluable "tricks of the trade" in helping my disabled daughter live to her fullest potential. 1p36 Deletion Support & Awareness has provided me with information in the latest technologies; in physical, occupational, speech, & behavioral therapies, communication devices, nutritional needs, information about varies medical procedures ranging from surgeries dealing with tubes in ears to spinal fusion, reviews on medical equipment,  &  genetic testing. If there was ever a handbook to be printed on how to care for a child/loved one with a disability, 1p36 Deletion Support & Awareness would be able to provide brilliant input.

1p36 Deletion Support & Awareness	44653	11	/users/profile/45120	karen27	Board Member	5	06/20/2010	1p36 Deletion Syndrome is a chromosome disorder that is characterized by moderate to severe intellectual disability, delayed growth, limited speech ability and distinct facial features. It is estimated that 1p36 Deletion Syndrome occurs in one in every 5,000 to 10,000 births though many individuals still go undiagnosed. 1p36 Deletion Syndrome is the most common chromosome deletion.Many parents when given their child's diagnosis do not receive more than the location of the deletion and a lesson on chromosomes & genetics.  Parents feel alone and overwhelmed.  In 2009, I created the 1p36 Deletion Support & Awareness website so parents, caregivers and the medical community could seek information about 1p36 Deletion Syndrome.  What I did not know was the personal reward I would receive from answering the website emails.  It is an amazing experience to be able to communicate with others who are going through the same experiences and introduce them to a welcoming group of people who support each other through the accomplishments and the difficult times.

Does not follow their own rules.  Adopts dogs out from under you even though they knew you filled out an application and your drive was 45min away.  Needs a overhaul on their staff!
Greenhill Humane Society	254596	1	/users/profile/342957	hbenu	General Member of the Public	1	09/01/2015	Greenhill just killed another dog.  Described by those that found him as happy it took little time in a small kennel with no exercise to give Sidney kennel stress.  Like so many before he was put to death.  Jaclyn Semple again indicated that no rescue had come forward.  This was totally false. With adopters and rescues coming forth for many of the animals they put to death they use false information and secrecy to continue their ways.  They often put themselves out as NO Kill.  Their board of directors is unavailable and has no desire to check into information given them.

I would not recommend spending one dime at this location or ever taking an animal there. If your pet is scared and "aggressive". ( which is subject to interpretation by God knows who) they will kill it even if a qualified rescue begs them to allow a proper assessment and placement. Also please note they have removed the option of putting this on their Facebook page. There are many people appropriately offering to take Sydney but they ignored all offers and killed him anyway. We will not forget you Sydney! You were wanted and loved and had a safe place to go. Rest in peace beautiful boy.  So sorry they failed you.  It wasn't right and wasn't fair.  We are all so heartsick.

Greenhill Humane Society	206012	1	/users/profile/268303	KathrynPenn	Professional with expertise in this field	2	07/14/2014	Greenhill Humane Society is not what is generally thought of as a humane society. They do a very good job with the animals that they accept and find homes for. I have never found an instance of mistreatment or any of the other complaints people voiced here.  But it's important to know that Green Hill is an animal exchange program, not a Humane Society. Whether or not an animal can be received there depends on many factors, and it is more in fact like an exclusive school or a country club.  I was that the shelter one day when a man came in you had a pitbull in the car. The man explain to the front receptionist that he had to surrender the dog has his wife was quite ill and they could not take care of it anymore. This man had been waiting on baby pitbull wait list for a green hill and there were two people in front of him. The staff refused to take the dog to the only had five dogs total in the shelter!The man's wife was sick and it was imperative that he find a place to take this pitbull. First Avenue shelter would not take the dog as they only takes trays, Greenhill would not take it as it wasn't his turn on your list. I wonder what did happen to the dog. If you adopt from Green Hill that's great. They deserve support and help. But the sad fact is Eugene Oregon has no Humane Society, forget to use the nation tissue, there is no where that an animal needing protection can go. It is time that we in Eugene address this need and created a shelter that indeed will respond to the needs of animals, and not to the needs of people who potentially will adopty only accept animals that are owned, and only if the animals is proved to be a doctor, if they have room, and if the animal passes various tests. Green Hill is an animal Country Club, and is great at what it does. It is not a humane society in the sense of open the accepting animals in need. While I was there at one point a man brought in a pitbull that had been on there waiting list for some time. I understand that pitbulls are a problem for all shelters, and there must be included on the number of pitbulls and pitbull mixes that any shelters can accept. However at this particular time the shelter only had 5 dogs! Most of the cages were empty. The man's wife was
Greenhill Humane Society	194852	1	/users/profile/30607	matilda	Client Served	1	02/25/2014	I went to Greenhill before I knew about local rescues, in the hopes that I would find a dog.  I went to the shelter and found a young male what looked like Rottie-mix - he had that classic, big blockhead although he was mostly black. I thought he was beautiful.  I took him to one of the yards to see how he was outside of his pen and we spent a long time together.  I was interested in knowing more about his personality than what I could gather from just watching him run around so went to ask a staff person about him.  She said they knew very little about him, that he'd come from a town about 50 miles away, and that he was not a Rottie-mix but rather a pitbull.  I asked how he was with cats and other dogs and she told me they had no idea.  The woman's attitude was rather negative;  she seemed unhappy at having to talk to me.  I became irritated because I felt that if she'd really wanted to help him be adopted, she'd be less negative and do more to answer my questions.  I voiced my displeasure at the goings-on on my way out and someone must have called somebody because I was intercepted by a woman who called herself a Supervisor.  She offered to "cat-test" the dog in her office with a stuffed animal.  I didn't think that made any sense at all so thanked her but left. I took to Craigslist to vent, funnily enough, in the PETS section later that day and to my surprise, the dog's former owner contacted me.  She knew his name - it was an odd name - and told me his history, including that he was half Rottweiler (she'd met his parents).  She told me he'd run away too many times for them to want to keep him any longer.   She told me he'd never seen a cat he hadn't chased.  When I told her how he'd been billed at Greenhill, she was unhappy.  I encouraged her to contact them to give them this history;  she said she already had when she had surrendered him. I contacted Greenhill's Director to lodge my complaint later that week and he emailed me back and wanted to know everything.  He also told me that he would love it if I could become involved with them in improving the shelter.  I said I'd be delighted.  I never heard from him again.
Greenhill Humane Society	29596	7	/users/profile/30607	matilda	Client Served	1	02/21/2010	I tried to adopt a dog from Greenhill and met w/ terrible customer service and an overall negative reaction to any of my questions about the dog.  I was dismissed and disregarded.  Upon leaving the premises, I registered my disapproval with how I was treated and suddenly a supervisor arrived and tried to placate me.  My concerns were on several levels - they knew next to nothing about the dog and did not offer to cat-test him (the supervisor eventually did after my complaint,) and were generally rude and unhelpful.  I asked questions about the dog's intake paperwork and was essentially dismissed with a "We don't know anything."  They had the dog down as a pitbull mix but he looked more Rottie; I mentioned this and once again was dismissed.  That's when I left.  I posted my concerns on Craiglist and, funnily enough, the former owner of the dog contacted me through that forum.  She told me she'd surrendered him to Greenhill because she didn't have a fenced yard & he kept getting out, and confirmed that he was no more a Pitbull mix than a poodle.  She expressed both concern & frustration when I told her what his intake papers said and remarked that she knew both his mother & father and had told Greenhill staff what his genetic make-up was.  She expressed concern that he had been labeled a pitbull mix, as they can be harder to adopt out.  I ended up emailing the new (at the time) director, Cary, who expressed concern and apologized for the staff's behavior, and asked me if I'd like to become involved with helping Greenhill evolve. I said I would;  he was going to contact me later on once he'd been in the position for a while.  I never heard from him again. This wasn't the first negative experience I had w/ Greenhill, but it was my last - I have never been back.
Greenhill Humane Society	194768	1	/users/profile/254541	annonymouspetlover	Volunteer	1	02/24/2014	I volunteer at one of Greenhill's shelters. The are the most crooked group of workers I've ever met. They kill adoptable and treatable dogs and cats. They like to make up lies about why they killed them. They don't like the public to know about the killings. When dogs develop kennel stress behaviors and/or are going kennel crazy (but not dangerous) they put them on a "behavior hold" so that they cannot be adopted so that they continue to deteriorate further until the uncertified "trainer" Sandy decides to have them killed. Sandy is like Hitler in my mind. Her "behavior assessments" are highly flawed and they stress the dogs out. They test dogs for dog and cat aggression by putting a stuffed cat or dog infront of them to see what they do to it. Usually if dogs are" mouthy" but don't bite, the dog won't make it out of the shelter alive. One dog was going to be killed for body slamming someone one time. The president of Greenhill lies more than any human being I've ever known. Greenhill puts an ENORMOUS amount of effort to try to hide all their dirty secrets. They go to such great lengths to try to keep a clean public image. How about if they just did the right thing, then they would have nothing to hide. They won't even release their records yet they are a public agency. How fishy is that. I personally don't even believe their euthenasia rate they claim... that can be tweaked. Greenhil doesn't like rescue groups to take their dogs, because whenever a rescue group gets the dog they then state how the dog is nothing like what Sandy said they were like, making Greenhill look incompetent, which they are. It is documented that the vet Dr. Schroder has neglected suffering animals. Including a cat with a damaged eye who sat in the back room for weeks without treatment or medication before getting rescued. There is documented proof of them lieing to potential adopters of a dog in order to scare them away.Staff at Greenhill shelters use emotional blackmail on their volunteers: If dirty secrets are let out by volunteers there are consequences and it affects the dogs.
Greenhill Humane Society	194757	1	/users/profile/254522	Robyn15	Volunteer	1	02/24/2014	First off Greenhill is under contract with Lane county to run First Ave. County shelter. They have totally ignored the rules..almost all of them especially transparency!   They're unreasonable to ask volunteers to do all that they do, but they're to cheap to hire people. Employees are nasty to customers, probably due to their Director asking them to lie and they're blackmailed.  Training volunteers how to handle dogs is ridiculous.  They require you to take 5 hours of training on how to walk a dog but volunteers are constantly rewarding dogs for bad behavior.  They fire and ban anyone that tries to save an adoptable animal.  Rescues refuse to work with them. Volunteers leave because they're depressed seeing so many adoptable pets being killed. ..And they have the nerve to blame all this on a group that spends hours rescuing and cleaning up their mess.I could go on for days but I get depressed.
Greenhill Humane Society	194687	4	/users/profile/254433	RustysMom	Volunteer	5	02/21/2014	I have volunteered with 3 animal welfare organizations in Eugene, and Greenhill far exceeds my expectations. I have found the staff and volunteers to all care deeply about the animals in their care. I also have had the pleasure of adopting an animal from Greenhill, and was impressed with the thoroughness of the process. This is another way they insure the best outcomes for their animals. It is unfortunate that some people use their time by trying to discredit Greenhill by using half-truths and incomplete, subjective statements. If they truly cared about animals, why not use their time and resources to make the whole animal welfare system better in a positive way?
Greenhill Humane Society	194671	4	/users/profile/254407	Veryprettywoman	Volunteer	1	02/21/2014	Organization is very concerned about information getting out to the public.   I felt like I had a gag order.  Also was micromanaged in regards to statements.  Was asked to run everything by management before I said anything publicly.  To me that was a red flag.   Believe there's no clear lines of Business protocol between the nonprofit shelter, Greenhill, and the public shelter, First Avenue, they began to manage in July 2012.    Not able to find reports on exactly where the $500,000 tax payer money is spent.  As a former business manager and bookeeper, this type of reports are simple and I'm not sure why it's so difficult to sort through the mishmash.  Witnesses told me that the Greenhill will take resources from the First Avenue Public Shelter and use them up at the private (main Greenhill shelter).   I know the donation button, that appears to be for the stray:neglected animals at the public actually goes to Greenhill general fund. Donations for First Ave may go to Greenhill unless you clearly specify that you want the funds to go to the public animal shelter First Avenue only.  And even then there is no assurance the Public Shelter will get the funding.  The stray, neglected, confiscated animals receive less care and behavior modification training then do the animals up at the main Greenhill site which are mostly owner surrendered animals.  There's not enough transparency and they continue to violate the contract for the public shelter on many levels including not notifying the public of animals that are Redalert or on the euthanasia list.  Secretly Euthanizing animals who appeared to be suffering from Kennel stress, or animals who have been at the public shelter along time and don't appear to be have adoption option vs truly dangerous of which there have been a few. In addition, reputable animal rescue groups are repeatedly turned away.  Many groups locally still try to work to save the dogs, but dread having to go through all the hoops that Greenhillreq requires.  Policy, procedure and rules for adoption a rescue seem to change on a daily basis.  Just depends on who's in charge.  Sadly my great hope for Greenhill managers to treat our public animal shelter (formerly No Kill Shelter) is been extremely disappointing. Transition for their takeover was very rough animals were neglected and not treated for medical conditions.  Seems as though animals at public shelter are still being euthanized for medical issues when simple medical treatment would suffice...including things like ear infections if the animal is harder to manage when being treated with medication.   Greenhill will NOT commit to the No Kill Philosopy despite it being shown, time and time again, that is an extremely cost-effective way to run a shelter.  It's a win for the shelter, and win for the animals.  Appears to be advisarial relationship between Greenhill, first Avenue shelter and the no kill community. I watch both sides and the energy that they put forth against each other, I wonder why that energy can't be put towards saving more animals and cooperating.  I know many volunteers have dropped off the roster in favor of no kill And that just means there is less people to care for the animals.  Seems to me that Shelter management should be doing things to keep volunteers instead of chase them away.  I don't know what the solution is is currently Greenhill is under contract and that won't expire until July 2014.   I am not aware of another group or organization willing to take over the plight of the public animal shelter First Avenue.    I certainly think that First Avenue Shelter, the public dog pound, could be run much more effectively and much more humanely It is a very sad situation for all of Lane county and their stray, neglected, or confiscated animals. In the end it seems the animals are paying a very heavy price. 
Greenhill Humane Society	194663	2	/users/profile/254396	TKDyer	General Member of the Public	1	02/21/2014	I am so sick over all the stories I see on Facebook about the INhumane treatment of animals at Greenhill.  Not just INhumane treatment but actual mistreatment or lack of needed treatment.  Greenhill looks for reasons to kill the dogs in their care, they even test dog/cat and dog/human compatibility and safety by giving dogs stuffed animals. Greenhill turns down rescue groups that want to save a dog then if the rescue complains at all Greenhill just bans them completely by revoking their pulling privileges. What a disgraceful organization that is entrusted by the public to take care of the animals. Taxpayer dollars going to waste and used for killing.  Furthermore, contrary to claims in some reviews, there is NO proof of a 90% live release rate because Greenhill is NOT transparent and they have no accountability. They refuse to release any information to back their claim of 90%
Greenhill Humane Society	194659	2	/users/profile/254392	Lori94	Client Served	1	02/21/2014	I tried to get help for a stray cat that was harassing my cat and the only help the could off was ask me if the cat ate any of my cats food. I said yes it came into my house & hurt my cat & ate her food. They said well it's your problem now. I was appalled & asked what I can do. They told me I have to keep it or I need to find a home for it. Really?! They where no help at all. I felt brushed off. I did find a home but it took awhile. My cat was traumatized & afraid to go anywhere in our home. 
Greenhill Humane Society	194657	4	/users/profile/254390	Tamara B.	General Member of the Public	1	02/21/2014	If I could give this "shelter" less than one star I would.  Greenhill tests dogs for "aggression" by throwing keys in their kennel and "testing" by seeing if the dog tears up either a dog or cat shaped stuffed animal.  If the dog acts like a normal dog and plays with or tears up the cat shaped stuffed animal, Greenhill says that dog is cat aggressive.  This is pure nonsense and many dogs have been labeled using this ridiculous method, that is not supported by any sane professional.  Since being called on this asinine practice, Greenhill denies they do this.  However, we have community members who are willing to testify this is what they were told.  Volunteers know this as well.  It is bizarre, unprofessional and downright deadly for the animals in Greenhill's "care" Greenhill has stated that if the community that supports them calls in concerned about an animal, they deem that harassment.  They want your money, but do not want to be bothered by questions, or be transparent or accountable.   No doubt there will be posts on here by Greenhill claiming that those who support No Kill Lane County are crazy, but we aren't the ones testing for aggression by seeing if a dog plays with a stuffed animal, are we?  There are heinous abuses that go on behind the scenes at Greenhill and we can prove it. Greenhill's Executive Director and his girlfriend the Ops Manager have been caught in lie after lie after lie, and we can prove that too!

Greenhill Humane Society	190469	3	/users/profile/248697	Bryt	Professional with expertise in this field	5	12/12/2013	Greenhill Humane Society and 1st Avenue Shelter are life-saving shelters. Over the past five years they have saved more than 90% of the animals in their care. The animals they could not save were irredeemably suffering or dangerous to humans with poor prognosis of rehabilitation.  Animals are never euthanized due to lack of space or time limitation. Per the no-kill movement, success within a community is measured by achieving a 90% live-release rate. Greenhill has surpassed that goal.  Animals at both shelters are well cared for, and staff and volunteers are friendly and knowledgeable.  
Greenhill Humane Society	154026	4	/users/profile/204853	Bonniezmom	General Member of the Public	1	04/10/2013	Greenhill records indicate that treatment is withheld from some animals by their veterinarian.  When this information with documentation went to the Director, and the Board, it was ignored.  This is a serious breach of their own policies, and a violation of Oregon Statute.  See this documentation and other issues at www.NoKillLaneCounty.org.
Greenhill Humane Society	48988	3	/users/profile/50222	joy9	Volunteer	5	07/30/2010	I am honored to say that I have been a foster parent for cats at the Greenhill Humane Society for a little more than 2 years.  During that time, I have gotten to know many members of the Greenhill staff.  I have also had the pleasure of caring for several cats that have been exposed to Feline Leukemia.  Normally, these cats would have to be "put down", even though they test negetive for this disease.  However, Greenhill finds these cats foster homes for a 3 month quarantine period.  During this time, the cats are given a monthly blood test and other care.  If the cats test negative for the Feline Leukemia at the end of the quarantine period, they are then put up for adoption.  In my case, all of my foster cats have passed their quarantine period and have been quickly and successfully adopted.  I can testify that all of the staff members at the Greenhill Humane Society always put the best interests of their animal charges ahead of all else.  I can honestly say that "at the Greenhill Humane Society, ...... WE CARE!"
Greenhill Humane Society	48953	2	/users/profile/50181	djkramer	Volunteer	5	07/30/2010	I am so impressed with the absolute dedication by all the people involved with Greenhill Humane Society, both staff and volunteers, toward bettering the welfare of homeless dogs, cats and small animals.  As for my personal experience as a volunteer at Greenhill, I have always been treated with great warmth and appreciation for my help.
Greenhill Humane Society	48896	2	/users/profile/50107	halo	Volunteer	5	07/29/2010	The staff is a wonderful, caring group that is determined to help people find the perfect pet for them. They won't stop until every pet that comes in through the door has a loving home.  They helped me find my two fantastic cats.
Greenhill Humane Society	48871	2	/users/profile/50080	michaelbehuniak	Volunteer	5	07/28/2010	Greenhill Humane Society, in Eugene, Oregon, is great non-profit humane organization providing shelter, fostering, adoption, and neuter-spaying services. We have had the great pleasure with working with the highly committed staff of both employees and volunteers when we foster kittens until they are ready to be put up for adoption. We can not overstate our appreciation and admiration for the kind, humane, and compassionate services Greenhill provides for our local community and the animals they rescue and provide loving homes for.
Greenhill Humane Society	48813	2	/users/profile/50015	luther1	Donor	4	07/28/2010	Greenhill does so much with so little.  The website is easy to navigate, so lots of people get engaged and stay connected.Their events are fun for 4-leggeds and their 2-leggeds.
Greenhill Humane Society	48760	2	/users/profile/49950	gadoozle	Volunteer	5	07/27/2010	Upon first volunteering at Greenhill Humane Society, I was suprised by the love of animals that drove each employee and volunteer.  Everyone was filled with this intense care for the lives of the animals that was really inspiring.  Greenhill is a great place, and it leaves a great impression on me every time I leave it!
Greenhill Humane Society	48759	2	/users/profile/49947	animallover1	Volunteer	5	07/27/2010	Greenhill Humane Society is a wonderful nonprofit organization.  They help many animals find good homes.  They also help to stop animal overpopulation by spaying and neutering all of their animals.  What I have said about Greenhill may sound like any ordinary humane society, but Greenhill is no ordinary humane society.  All of the animals there are very happy.  Greenhill's staff and volunteers are very friendly and helpful.  I think Greenhill is a great humane society.  If you are looking for a new pet, come to Greenhill and see why it is a truly wonderful organization.
Greenhill Humane Society	48702	2	/users/profile/49867	md2	Volunteer	5	07/25/2010	I was so surprised by how much Greenhill does.  In addition to people who come to adopt pets, there are so many phone calls and people with questions about how to help their animals.  Everyone at the shelter really cares about the animals and the people who call or come in with questions.
Greenhill Humane Society	48690	2	/users/profile/49847	he1	Board Member	5	07/25/2010	I have always been an animal lover but couldn't always donate as much financially as I would've liked.  I see being a Board Member as another way to contribute.  While I've always heard great things about Greenhill, never could I have imagined how wonderfully managed this facility would be.  Everyone involved (staff, volunteers, board members, etc.) is top notch.  I couldn't imagine a better non-profit to be a part of.  Greenhill provides such a valuable community service and they do it incredibly.  Kudos to Greenhill!
Greenhill Humane Society	48446	2	/users/profile/49481	theadora1	Volunteer	5	07/20/2010	I began fostering for Greenhill in 2004.  The goal is to save lives and to match animal to adopting parent or parents. I have had extensive contact with the category staff and somewhat less contact with the veterinarian.  Everyone is knowledgeable and committed to the health and welfare of the animal, and staff are visibly upset at those infrequent times when the cat has to be euthanized because the cat tested positive for feline leukemia (for examples).  I fostered one cat that was in the late stages of kidney failure. The staff allowed me to continue fostering him as long as possible, and then provided a quick and peaceful end to his life when the time came. For the 6 or so months the cat was in my care, Greenhill provided veterinary services and medicines, even though they knew the cat would never be adopted and that he would eventually be euthanized.  I have also cared for an amputee (who was happily adopted) plus a cat that was so afraid of humans that he hid from me for the first 4 weeks he was in my care (and has since been adopted!).  In both cases, Greenhill provided all of the medical care and provided all of the medical supplies required.  I only had to provide the housing and food (although Greenhill will provide special foods as needed). Recently I have begun fostering cats that come from domestic-violence homes.  This is an invaluable service to the community, one I very much like participating in. Foster parents are encouraged to observe and report any problems the animal seems to have as soon as possible, and are given 24/7 access to staff, including the staff veterinarian.  The back-up provided to a foster parent is tremendous.  Greenhill is 100 percent supported by community donations.  This alone makes it clear how much the community values its contributions.  It has been in operation since 1944, and, during the time I have been working with Greenhill, it has continued to look for ways to enhance its services and to do as much as it can for the animals that come into its care.
Greenhill Humane Society	48443	1	/users/profile/49477	liz14	Volunteer	5	07/19/2010	Nine years ago, we adopted a kitten from Greenhill. The adoption process was straightforward and easy.Since that time, we have fostered about 40 cats and kittens for them and have been consistently impressed with the professional, caring manner that they have with the animals. We have cared for many ill animals who required various levels of medical care, including a cat who required a hind leg amputation when he was brought in after a car accident, kittens with respiratory illnesses, and shy cats that need extra socialization. People often bring in animals that have not been well cared for. My experience is that they go out of their way to care for and eventually adopt out the animals who come their way.To the end of saving as many animals as possible they even have programs that take care of animals belonging to victims of domestic violence until the person can take their animal back and have exchange programs that take in animals from other shelters who may be in danger of being put down due to the length of time they have been at the facility.I would never hesitate adopting from them, knowing they've done everything in their power to put animals onto the adoption floor that are healthy and socialized, ready to be loving (and beloved) members of a new family.
Greenhill Humane Society	37886	1	/users/profile/38614	lisab1	General Member of the Public	5	05/03/2010	Three months ago, our family dog of 14 years passed away.  We came to Greenhill to find another dog.  The people that we met there were so understanding and spent a lot of time with us and answered all of our questions.  We found a perfect dog - just a few years old, that was given up because the family that he lived with had to move to find work. We are so happy to have him in our family, and thank Greenhill for being there.
Greenhill Humane Society	37402	1	/users/profile/38119	kathy13	Volunteer	5	04/29/2010	Greenhill is a great place for homeless animals and the people do so much to help from medical treatment to spending time with shy animals.  They have so many volunteers.  It's great to see people helping animals.
Greenhill Humane Society	33289	6	/users/profile/34100	dolly2	Volunteer	1	03/16/2010	This organization's so-called adoption percentages are totally bogus because they are a very limited intake facility.  High adoption percentages are very easy when a facility is limited intake.  I don't doubt that the animals that are there and make it to the adoption floor are well cared for.  However, atrocities continue to happen "behind the scenes" - they of course, do not want the public to know about this aspect.They are decidedly NOT No-Kill, although they say they are.  No Kill shelters don't kill healthy animals.
Greenhill Humane Society	32754	1	/users/profile/33575	ldk	Volunteer	5	03/09/2010	I have adopted both a cat, and a dog from Greenhill Humane. Both animals were well cared for during their stay at the shelter, and came home to me healthy and well adjusted. This is due to the caring and well trained staff and volunteers.Greenhill has over 200 volunteers who come because they care. The environment is friendly, warm, and open. I have fostered kittens through Greenhill. My training was thorough and the screening program carefully executed. Greenhill does a tremendous job of getting the word out to the community that we need to adopt, not breed. I think they are a leader within our community.
Greenhill Humane Society	32736	1	/users/profile/33561	fairydogmother	Volunteer	5	03/08/2010	I've ben a volunteer with Greenhill for four years now and have adopted a dog from them. They have done many things in the past few years to improve adoption experiences for both the animals and their humans, including hiring a full-time shelter medicine veterinarian, creating quiet rooms for both adopting and surrendering animals, expanding the foster program and increasing the amount of training and therapy for animals with mild to moderate behavior issues. They now have the Mend-A-Friend program to treat animals with more extensive medical needs. The staff and volunteers at GH work very hard at jobs that are sometimes difficult and are so deserving of our community's support, both emotional and financial.
Greenhill Humane Society	32630	1	/users/profile/33457	heidis	Board Member	5	03/06/2010	As a member of the community I dream of a world where all companion animals have a loving, safe home and where pet over-population is prevented through spay/neuter. As an individual I used to wonder - how can I contribute to making this a reality? I adopted from Greenhill and became a volunteer board member because I saw that Greenhill staff, volunteers, and supporters are  a collective group working to achieve this vision.  I continue to support Greenhill because I believe they are succeeding in making a difference!
Greenhill Humane Society	32602	1	/users/profile/33426	animallover	Board Member	5	03/06/2010	Greenhill Humane Society is a fantastic organization that works tirelessly to improve the lives of animals in Lane County. On noting but dedication and effort, Greenhill has been able to put animals first and improve the lives of many cats, dogs, and other small animals in the area. Even when the economy is down, Greenhill has found a way to keep its adoption rate high and provide great on-site care for the shelter animals still looking for their forever home.
Greenhill Humane Society	32549	1	/users/profile/33365	jeff5	Board Member	5	03/05/2010	Greenhill Humane is an organization that has quietly lead a change in our community to improve the welfare of our companion and outdoor animals. It is all about the animals, whether in Greenhill's care or elsewhere, for the staff at GHS. Keep up the good work!
Greenhill Humane Society	32545	1	/users/profile/33356	raychel	Board Member	5	03/05/2010	Greenhill is a fantastic organization, which is why I adopted my dog, Simon, from the shelter nearly 4 years ago. Since that time, I've joined the board and volunteer LOTS of my time to this wonderful organization. They are dedicated to increasing spay/neuter rates in the area, helping to reduce animal overpopulation in the area. They have hired a full-time staff vet, who serves as an invaluable resource to Greenhill shelter animals as well as the animal welfare community in general. They have incredibly high "live release rates," meaning nearly all of the animals who come through the shelter find homes. They are organized and always striving to improve. I am proud to serve on the board of this fantastic organization.
Greenhill Humane Society	32538	1	/users/profile/33348	rescue-dogs	Board Member	5	03/05/2010	As a board member and volunteer with Greenhill for the last several years, I have seen first hand the committment Greenhill's staff and its voluteers have to serving this community and its animals.  Greenhill is constantly striving to improve itself and have a greater positive impact on animal welfare in the community.
Greenhill Humane Society	32533	1	/users/profile/33344	colliemom	Board Member	5	03/05/2010	As a Board Member, I see the hard work that goes on behind the scenes to make the most of the budget and continue to improve the organization, and I have been continually impressed with the passion for animal welfare shown by everyone involved. The staff and volunteers at Greenhill are incredibly dedicated to making the lives of the animals in their care as pleasant as possible before they find their forever homes.  Greenhill's administration is committed to expanding and improving its services by improving medical care and updating their facilities when their budget allows to better serve the animals.  Greenhill's management works very hard to try to coordinate services with other animal care organizations in our region to care for the animal population as efficiently and effectively as possible. They also frequently take animals in from "high kill" shelters - even as far away as Los Angeles, to save the animals from being euthanized.  Greenhill is generally regarded as a fantastic asset to Lane County.  I am proud to represent Greenhill in our community and I love all the positive feedback I hear when I mention the shelter.  Unfortunately, there are some people with serious misconceptions about Greenhill, who are committed to trying to damage its reputation.  This negativity helps no one - least of all the animals we are trying to save.I encourage anyone interested in Greenhill to visit the shelter and see its great work firsthand!
Greenhill Humane Society	32435	1	/users/profile/33252	catlover2	Volunteer	5	03/04/2010	Greenhill is great!  I love helping the animals, and I love all of the people I meet at greenhill.  Sometimes the job of cleaning isn't the most fun, but it's a great cause!
Greenhill Humane Society	32428	1	/users/profile/33245	julie8	Volunteer	5	03/04/2010	I volunteer at Greenhill.  It's a great place with great people and wonderful animals. I moved here recently and started to volunteer with Greenhill about a year ago. They really do a lot for the animals in their care.  Everyone I've met there cares so much, and the volunteers are really involved in helping.  I feel so appreciated, and that I am making a difference.
Greenhill Humane Society	32240	6	/users/profile/33028	disenchanted	General Member of the Public	1	03/02/2010	Greenhill receives the majority of the support given to animal non-profits in Lane County.  However, as newer, smaller organizations are formed, GHS demonstrates their intent to maintain this dominance by co-opting the upstart, more progressive 501 (c)(3)'s. For instance, the Shelter Animal Resource Alliance (S.A.R.A.) was formed to rescue doomed dogs from the county animal control in 2001. After observing the success of this program for a few years, Greenhill saw it as a way to improve their own statistics and convinced LCAS to give the program to them.  For 30 years Greenhill was uninterested in spaying and neutering--they had to be persuaded by local advocates to even do their own animals before adoption.  Now, after noticing that there seems to be no backlash from the local vets concerning the Willamette Animal Guild's spay clinic, they have decided to open their own in-house clinic to the public.  Ironically, they recently received a sizable grant to TNR feral cats although they have an active feral kill program.  As the No-Kill movement progresses in Lane County, the front desk volunteers tell callers that Greenhill is a no-kill facility.  It is NOT.  Policy is dictated not by the charming and diverting new director, but by the ladies in the back with the blue needles.  Greenhill's latest tactic is to persuade the local PetSmart store to let them take over the cat adoption room there, displacing a program that has been run by West Coast Dog and Cat Rescue for at least 3 years, despite the fact that the room was conveniently empty and available way before WCDC took it on.  So often it's heard, "Why can't we all get along for the sake of the animals?"  Greenhill is not there for the sake of the animals.  Greenhill is there for the sake of Greenhill.  Why cooperate when they can co-opt? Then there's no need to share the glory OR the funding.
Greenhill Humane Society	30879	1	/users/profile/31819	geri1	General Member of the Public	5	02/25/2010	I came to Greenhill with a friend of mine to help her adopt a cat.  I had never been to the shelter before and really didn't know what to expect.  I was really impressed.  The cats have the most wonderful space with toys and things to climb on.  There were a number of people there to help us make a choice.  They knew all of the cats and their personalities, and everyone was so friendly and took the time to talk to us.
Greenhill Humane Society	30034	1	/users/profile/31023	nancy8	Client Served	5	02/23/2010	I just adopted a dog from Greenhill.  It was a great experience, thank you!  The staff spent a lot of time with me and answered all of my questions.  It seemed like the dogs were all very well taken care of, and the staff knew all about each one.
Greenhill Humane Society	29917	1	/users/profile/30909	johnb1	Volunteer	5	02/22/2010	I have been a volunteer at Greenhill for the past two years, and find it a really incredible organization.  I read the previous posts and really don't understand what those people are talking about - perhaps they should visit the organization again as it sounds as though it has been years since their negative experience.What I am really impressed about is how much they care about the animals and the volunteers.  The staff are friendly and really pay attention to the animals' needs.  As a volunteer, I really feel that I am part of the team making life better for homeless animals and helping to find them homes.  It is extremely rewarding.If I had one thing to change, I hope that someday they can build a new dog kennel.  The cats have a beautiful large open space in which they live, not in small cages like other shelters, but the dogs still have an old concrete brick kennel.  Perhaps someday they will be able to raise enough money to build a new kennel.
Greenhill Humane Society	29750	4	/users/profile/30745	emily4	Volunteer	1	02/22/2010	As a former volunteer at Greenhill, I would urge donors to look elsewhere when giving away money.  For too long, Greenhill (or Greenkill, as they are known is some of the local animal rescue circles) has skated on their so-called "good reputation".  Their reputation, in fact, was why I had chosen the shelter at which to volunteer in the first place.  What I found was that reputation was undeserved.  During the several months that I volunteered there, I was appalled at much of what I saw: there were dogs who, week after week, continued to lose weight due to the stress of being in the kennel.  Of course, I understand that kennel stress is a fact of life at a shelter, but the math is simple: more calories in will balance the higher calorie burn of a stressed dog.  It didn't seem that anyone there was doing the math, though.  Each week that I would show up to walk dogs, the dogs (and one in particular) were skinnier and skinnier.  I do not exaggerate when I say that the one was completely emaciated, to the point that each and every rib and vertebra could be counted, and his face was completely sunken in.  It got to the point where some of the volunteer dog walkers were sneaking extra food to these dogs in an effort to prevent them from starving to death.  Thankfully, both of those dogs were finally adopted before they perished.  I also often would come in to find a favorite dog euthanized for suspect reasons and can even recall four month old puppies being euthanized.  The reason?  Food aggression.  Guarding food is a natural survival tendency in a dog that young and is not generally difficult to correct.  All too often, it seemed (in my estimation)the first reaction to a dog with problems was to euthanize.  During my stint at GH, volunteers who expressed concern over the number of euthanasias and the reasons for the decision were placated, intimidated, or told outright that their services were no longer needed.  I was even threatened once by Katie Dyer when I expressed my own concerns to, essentially, keep my mouth shut if I know what's good for me.  Eventually, though I felt like I was abandoning the animals, I had to cease volunteering there in an effort to preserve my own sanity and self-respect.  Since then, I have been working with another local organization who makes every effort to rehabilitate dogs who have nowhere else to go, and we have been very successful and operate on a budget of about 1% of what Greenhill takes in.  Lastly, there is absolutely no reason at all why a very choosy and relatively well-funded closed admission shelter such as Greenhill should not be a no-kill organization.  With the resources they have and the ability to pick and choose amongst the most adoptable of animals, it's stunning that they have any euthanasias at all.
Americans Overseas Domestic Violence Crisis Center	273441	1	/users/profile/362668	drlynnas	Advisor	5	12/01/2015	As a long serving director of non-profit programs throughout the world, it has been  extremely gratifying to learn of  the absolutely amazing work of this organization.  AODVCC is composed of caring and committed persons who provide unique services to those in need of urgent help.  Americans abroad encompass a vast amount of people including students, tourists, students and military.  To cover this population, AODVCC has established an outreach program of professional services that are unique and meet the variety of emergency situations encountered by these mostly women and families.  Their services are delivered in a most professional and sensitive way by a most amazing staff.  Please continue to support their efforts.  
Americans Overseas Domestic Violence Crisis Center	271743	1	/users/profile/360634	LadyE	Volunteer	5	11/10/2015	I started volunteering with Americans Overseas Domestic Violence Crisis Center during the summer of 2015 through a serving learning requirement for school. Being a domestic violence/sexual assault survivor myself was the driving force behind me choosing this organization to fulfill my service learning requirement. Upon meeting with the ladies of this organization, I knew instantly that the Americans Overseas Domestic Violence Women's Crisis Center was an organization that I wanted to continue to volunteer with once I completed my service learning requirement.  Besides the Americans Overseas Domestic Violence Women's Crisis Center being a great cause and worthy of all the praises given, the level of love, dedication  and concern that the ladies provide to the clients is simply amazing. I couldn't have chosen a better organization to volunteer with.
Americans Overseas Domestic Violence Crisis Center	271480		/users/profile/360325	Writer	Donor	5	11/07/2015	I think that there is a great need for organizations like Americans Overseas Domestic Violence Crisis Center!  What with so many documented abuses going on right here in the US, I am so glad that there is an avenue for women (mostly) living in foreign countries, to contact should they be in such a terrible situation. Many of the Middle Eastern countries show little outward respect for women's rights as we enjoy in the US!  I can't help but believe that without anywhere for US female citizens to turn to while living in such situations in these countries, there would probably be more extreme abuse or even death! Thank goodness for this well-run organization helping so many literally escape such horrible situations. This organization has the blessing of many others in the community of crisis and aide to those caught in these conditions.  For several years, AODVCC has received the award for one of the best nonprofit organizations in Oregon.   When individuals see the value of such an organization, and then donate to it, it affirms it's mission.  It affirms the need for it's place in a world so distraught with many just trying to survive, let alone survive with an abuser!   World peace is, of course, a concept that many hope will happen in the future.  However, until and if that ever does happen, it is a blessing to have such a well-versed, finely-tuned outreach organization like AODVCC there for those who truly need it.  God bless this organization for it's mission of well-being and ability to reach out to those in need for their very own safety and possibly even their lives!

Americans Overseas Domestic Violence Crisis Center	271257		/users/profile/154201	lewis_karen	Board Member	5	11/05/2015	I started out with AODVC as a volunteer several years ago and am honored to now serve on the Board. The founder is a survivor with true grit and determination to help others in similar situations, and the staff are dedicated professionals who go above and beyond to help clients, who are usually overwhelmed by the challenges of dealing with domestic violence or sexual assault so far away from home.  This is the only organization offering these case management services!
Americans Overseas Domestic Violence Crisis Center	271250		/users/profile/360061	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	11/05/2015	As a victim of domestic violence, I summoned the courage to leave my home with my 2 year old child.  I had no job, little money, a car, some toys, and a very selfless female friend who sheltered us for months until I could get back on my feet.  AODVCC is  such a great organization, offering resources when  someone is at a very vulnerable and low point. I was in the U.S. when it happened to us.  I cannot imagine what it must be like for women and their families who are in a foreign country. A place where they may not speak the language, hold little or no currency, don't understand the  laws, and need papers to leave.  AODVCC is that resource.  I was lucky to have a friend who held a hand out to us.  AODVCC is that friendly place women can go for help.

Americans Overseas Domestic Violence Crisis Center	229783		/users/profile/293430	jabraham75	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/29/2014	This is truly an amazing organization that makes it possible for victims of domestic violence and sexual assault overseas to be heard and to receive help. These victims often fall through the cracks due to the lack of support and resources available while living abroad. For many of these victims, this organization is their only hope. I am proud to work for such a  passionate and dedicated team.
Americans Overseas Domestic Violence Crisis Center	226916		/users/profile/290643	TammyN	Client Served	5	10/26/2014	AODVC has been a God-send since my children and I first left to a domestic violence shelter in Europe.  They have provided support in finding help, contacts, and guidance overseas as well as in the USA.  AODVC has written letters and amicus briefs to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights for our case to help secure Interim Measures of protection.  We would not have survived this far if it had not been for the good people at AODVC who have been unwaveringly there for us when there is no one else to help Americans overseas but AODVC.  There are no words to describe these amazing people and how grateful I am for being there for us for services that were necessary for our life-threatening situation and were not provided anywhere else.

Americans Overseas Domestic Violence Crisis Center	224099		/users/profile/192532	Debbie69	Donor	5	10/18/2014	Since this is the ONLY organization on the planet that does what it does, it deserves recognition.  Americans who live overseas rarely have resources to leave a domestic violence situation - this organization gives them safety planning and other resources to get them to safety and sometimes are able to return them to the US. Many people believe the Embassy's take care of these issues but that is not necessarily the case.  AODVCC also educate people here about the risks of leaving American soil.  I certainly know what it is like to have a family member in a violent home thousands of miles from the US - there is a sense of helplessness and hopelessness - with AODVCC there is HOPE and HELP!  
Americans Overseas Domestic Violence Crisis Center	205183		/users/profile/192532	Debbie69	Donor	5	07/04/2014	When an American leaves America, she is basically on her own.  If this American lives with an American or foreign boyfriend or spouse, she is basically on her own.  If this American is being abused by her American or foreign boyfriend or spouse, she is basically on her own.  There are few resources to assist in foreign countries.  There is ONLY ONE organization that assists worldwide, and that is the Americans Overseas Domestic Violence Crisis Center.   There was NO assistance when the founder of this organization needed help.  There was no one to advise her of her options when the founder needed that advice - not even her family could help.  When she finally escaped a foreign country on her own, Paula decided to do something that had never been done before - help other American women and children who faced similar circumstances to her own.  This organization is a Godsend to Americans everywhere.  They inform the victim on many fronts and are sometimes able to get them home.  They do this with little funding and careful planning and budgeting.  Any financial help to this organization would be appreciated.  
Americans Overseas Domestic Violence Crisis Center	164710	1	/users/profile/192532	Debbie69	Donor	5	08/12/2013	I was abused by a former boyfriend many years ago - fortunately, I lived in the United States where there are services available in most cities.  The founder of AODVCC had NO resources in the foreign country where she lived, even after going to the US Embassy nearby.  She had to figure out a way to leave the country with three small boys and hope she could make it to safety before her then husband found out she was gone.  With just enough money to get her to a relatives home, it took three days for her to arrive safely with her children in tow.  Finding that she would have to fight in the court system to keep her children in the US, she decided to start the WORLD's ONLY organization that assists abused women and children (and men too) who live in foreign countries.  They assist with the vital information the abused person needs to try to survive until they can leave their abuser.   They assist with pro bono services once they arrive back in the US and sometimes temporary housing.  The ONLY place where someone can get ALL the services they need - like one-stop-shopping!  Kudos to this wonderful woman who has managed to provide vital, lifesaving services to Americans all over the world.
Americans Overseas Domestic Violence Crisis Center	145923		/users/profile/192532	Debbie69	Donor	5	12/04/2012	The founder of this organization tried to return to the US with 3 small children and was surprised to learn that her resources were non-existent.  On her own, she figured out how to leave their abuser and come home to the US.  Here, she also found that resources were limited, and for some services, non-existent.  So, she decided to change all that - starting with a laptop purchased by a family member for her, she started a web presence, and a few years later was able to start a toll free crisis line that would be available from 175 countries.  All this was done on a shoestring budget - today, with some government funding their services have increased, but at the same time, with outreach, their hopeful client base has increased almost exponentially.  Continuuing funding is required for this organization to assist those in need.

Americans Overseas Domestic Violence Crisis Center	223929		/users/profile/287682	liysa	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/17/2014	I am awed by the hard work, wealth of knowledge and generosity of spirit I see every day in my co-workers at AODVC. The diverse community we serve faces an array of challenges and our organization is often just about the only resource they can reach out to. We provide the kind of help that matters most to the survivors who contact us.  We listen without judgment, and we provide direct concrete help whenever possible.  Our director is a visionary and every individual employee adds a body of experience and perspective to create the most internationally DV/SA savvy staff in the world.
Americans Overseas Domestic Violence Crisis Center	223910		/users/profile/287662	Cocorobinson	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/17/2014	The staff at AODVC understands the range of issues affecting victims of Domestic Violence and survivors of sexual assaults abroad. They handle sensitive situations and often overwhelmed people, with respect, integrity and compassion. They help clients--male or female, American or spouse of an American-- who have been abused overseas, navigate complex situations in a way that is empathetic and empowering.  It can feel like a ray of hope in an otherwise hopeless situation. DV is challenging in any case, but when a victim is isolated from support, and under laws that differ from the ones they are familiar with, it can be completely overwhelming.  This agency is a Godsend.
Americans Overseas Domestic Violence Crisis Center	223897		/users/profile/287649	Captain	Volunteer	5	10/17/2014	      The necessity of a one-of-a-kind organization which navigates uncharted entanglements of national and international policy where meet the lives, safety and personhood of women was revealed to me through the inconceivable survivor experiences of an old friend. He detailed his emigration from the UAE in a series of heartbreaking secrets he held distant from the happiness and smiles he seemed to have been born wearing. The harrowing escape from the UAE- from abuse, from policy which would not protect him- was unlike any of us had ever heard amongst the circle of friends.      To the uninitiated, these stories may seem rare: far from the realities we live and our contingent expectations of the world. These survivor stories are real, important and much more common than I had ever expected. The phone rings here with new clients daily who fear for their lives, for their children's lives. AODVC provides a depth of services few other organization take to charge. A non-profit that seeks to establish care, education, reform, attention, movement in a world otherwise deplete of options for women; AODVC is an organization I am proud to work with.

This is the only resource for these women, some of whom live in countries where there is little or no support for them as foreigners.  The U.S. has laws protecting American women living in the U.S., and for non-U.S. nationals living in the States experiencing abuse - there is nothing that protects an American woman living outside of the U.S.  The AODVC is a critical resource that does amazing work for women and children who desperately need their continued support.

Americans Overseas Domestic Violence Crisis Center	138361		/users/profile/184425	DrHK	General Member of the Public	5	11/13/2012	Thank you for an opportunity to rate this wonderful and much needed non-profit!   There aren't any such organizations like this one oversees, that addresses the issues of verbal, physical, and emotional abuse, regarding US citizens living in foreign countries!  We need this kind of solid support for those finding themselves in such isolated situations while living overseas.  Paula Lucas, the founder of this organization, is a fantastic individual, who, after experiencing her own spousal abuse from her husband, while living in the Middle East, had to find her own way out of the situation--without help from any service or agency.  Fortunately, for those who find themselves in such scenerios today, it is because of Ms. Lucus' harrowing experience, that they can seek aid and assistance from this well-run organization.  Well-trained telephone counselors are on duty 24 hours a day!   An individual experiencing spousal abuse, whether that person is female or male, can call for counseling, or financial assistance if they are needing to leave the abusive situation.   Please support this non-profit organization!  If you find yourself in need of more information or assistance, please call 503-203-1444!  Dr. M. A. Humphrey-Keever
Americans Overseas Domestic Violence Crisis Center	138215	1	/users/profile/184264	jbrafkin	Board Member	5	11/13/2012	The founder, Paula Lucas, is an extraordinary person. Her story and her passion to assist other women and children that are going through what her family went through is very powerful and moving. AODVC serves a population that has no other national voice in this country, or around the world.  US women and children overseas who are the victims of domestic violence often have many barriers to support and escape from the violence that is tearing apart their lives. The staff and volunteers are committed and smart, and are a lifeline to women and children who would otherwise often be out there on their own. I spent many years as a prosecutor, worked on legal reform in former Soviet countries and worked for the National Center for Victims of Crime, where I trained on the national level to prevent stalking, intimate partner violence and sexual assault.  I am continually impressed and proud of the work that AODVC does supporting US women and children overseas in every way that they can.

Americans Overseas Domestic Violence Crisis Center	131598		/users/profile/177168	aodvcsupporter	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/31/2012	The Americans Overseas Domestic Violence Crisis Center is doing what no other organization is doing: helping citizens of it's own country, who are experiencing abuse abroad, find safety and sometimes, get home. Without this hotline, survivors of violence would have to try and seek services abroad, in a second language, or, call a shelter at home, where employees wouldn't understand the complex international laws around custody and protocols. American survivors of violence abroad have a "home" at AODVC and it's incredible that this life line exists. The staff at AODVC work tirelessly and with great expertise everyday to do survivor centered work that empowers all.

The families who they are serving have no other resource like this - a caring group of professionals who are available 24/7 to answer calls and provide support, resources, and assurance that they are not alone.  Domestic violence is a worldwide problem with very serious consequences, and this resource helps bring women and children to safety, saving lives and providing a path to a new life.

I have since been working to support their efforts through providing assistance to develop a supportive, sloutions-based program and executing marketing initiatives to expand company awareness. I commend the commitment and compassion exuded by the staff and volunteers toward helping those in need, since they all contribute more than what's expected of them to turn the efforts of a small non-profit into a global effort to end domestic violence. The amount of heart and passion exuded by the individuals in this organization is unimaginable. I hope they will continually be able to exceed their goals in saving lives, keeping families safe, and providing unwavering care.

Americans Overseas Domestic Violence Crisis Center	113218		/users/profile/154071	Debbie33	Client Served	5	05/29/2012	My daughters and I were stuck in Canada ( not overseas but still a foreign country).   Since they were born in Canada and we had lived there since their birth I could not bring them back to the states without their father's permission.  He refused because his mother wanted our oldest ( she was the one who assaulted me while i was holding the kids who were both under 2 yrs old).   I was illegal because they refused to allow me to get my papers and had kept me isolated until i managed to get the three of us out of the house and to a shelter.   I was stuck in Canada because of the Hague convention which is what makes taking a child from their natural residence to another country illegal.   I had to get the courts permission and yet the Canadian government would only give me services for the kids leaving me with less then 150 a month to pay for food, diapers, formula and utilities.  AODVCC were a life saver, they sent me money orders to buy food for the kids and when I finally won court approval they helped me get back to the states and since I choose to move to Oregon where they are located they were able to help me get started in being self sufficient.  for the past 5 years i have been taking care of my kids and keeping them safe by myself only due to the fact that I had help getting started.  They made a huge difference in my kids lives. They are both healthy and happy and safe.    Without their help, i would not be sitting here in a nice townhouse listening to my girls outside playing and laughing.

The beauty and work of On the Move and its active small groups' community activities' model is that staff and participants are out and about participating daily via public transportation in absolutely everything wonderful that Portland has to offer and in the best spirit of Portland - free & cheap public events, museums, parks, cultural activities, volunteer activities, tours; they are all over the place! Everywhere they go they interact fully with those lucky enough to cross their path. OTM staff and participants model how joyful & mutually respectful community integration and relationships work and I truly believe that all who come in contact learn by example and follow suit.  As a Portlander, I am so grateful to have On the Move here and, as a family member of an adult with developmental disabilities, I wish the On the Move model was everywhere helping people learn how to not just passively include but fully and joyfully integrate the ADD individuals living among us into our communities in an environment of safety and respect. We'd all be better for it if we could clone On the Move and its model was as common as the Starbucks in every neighborhood.

They do so much in the community students and their families have options to fit any need. The staff works well with young people emerging into adults. The fact that they travel the whole county is a major plus. Thank you

As a wheelchair user, I appreciate its emphasis on social justice and modeling healthy, caring relationships for people who may have limited experience with disability. On the Move has a personal approach to breaking down barriers to social inclusion that I really value.
On-The-Move Community Integration	270457		/users/profile/359174	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/31/2015	I grew up with a brother who has Down Syndrome, and our relationship has influenced so many parts of my life. I am so proud of his amazing talents, his spark, and the love that he shares with so many people. We always challenge each other to pursue our passions and to be the best people we can be- but as many others who have special needs,  he is constantly facing obstacles, and a new page of them going into adulthood. What first struck me when I learned about On-the-Move was the emphasis on how fundamental it is for our community to more greatly appreciate those who have differences, and I knew I wanted to be part of this. On-the-Move works to empower participants and to genuine relationships- and from the small group model to the morning group planning sessions, you can see this played out from day to day. And, On-the-Move is fun- it's definitely an inspiration to see everyone have genuine support for each other. I'm excited for OTM's future :)
On-The-Move Community Integration	270036		/users/profile/358760	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/30/2015	I have volunteered several times in the last year to help individual adults to learn to read.  The staff is positive and welcoming to both the learners and tutors.  I like that this is a local community based group and that they are flexible and encouraging, no matter what the experience level of the volunteer.   I also appreciate the time frames for classes, they are usually 6 weeks  per class.  This allows for me as a volunteer to make a commitment without having to tie down a long stretch of time.  The leaders of this group are warm and accepting and work hard to make sure everyone is included and heard.  I would encourage anyone who is looking for a volunteer opportunity to give them a try, it is easy and rewarding.

Getting out and about with people other than family is such a great chance for her.  She loves the staff and even gets some one-on-one time to assist her growth.  With On-The-Move she gets many experiences she would never get such as events at Pioneer Square, open  air markets at the park blocks, activities with friends at parks, hands on activities provided by businesses.  I am extremely grateful for the  On-The-Move organization.

On-The-Move Community Integration	258716		/users/profile/347243	LindseyE525	Volunteer	5	09/21/2015	What a special place On the Move Community Integration is. As a reading volunteer, I got to witness a passionate, joyful, wildly capable and patient team give their best week in and week out to their participants. They are constantly working to figure out new ways their group can get involved in meaningful activities and experiences all over the Portland. The heart of the staff - from the Executive Director, Leah, to the other volunteers and ultimately seeping into the hearts of the participants - is SERVICE. I would love to see this place grow into a new space, new programs, and more involvement in Portland and beyond because I have experienced first hand the true value this organization offers - to it's participants AND to the community. SO GREAT.

I love my friend and I love to paint faces so off we went. We were also joined by another friend. After the event the three of us had several conversations about how wonderful this group is. The energy and atmosphere was positive from start to finish.  We all had a wonderful time and felt blessed having spent time with this group.  However, what really  impressed us was the interaction between the staff and participants. There were no visible lines drawn. Everyone was treated as an equal with respect and dignity. All three of us came away feeling the same way about this group. This organization is a model for how all human beings need to behave with one another.  I would love to work with On-The-Move Community Integration again. 
On-The-Move Community Integration	254143		/users/profile/342454	missourigirl	Client Served	5	08/27/2015	My daughter was very hesitant and nervous her first day at On the Move.  She came home that afternoon with the biggest smile and could not wait to go back.  It has been about a year and she will soon be adding another day with the program. She has blossomed.  She has more confidence with in the community, she has developed new interests and has a real bond with the staff and participants of On the Move.

We love all the photos and updates from On The Move's Facebook page. This is a group that is  doing excellent work for the participants and the Portland community at large.  We hope this organization continues to receive the so  much needed financial support and community appreciation that is so richly deserves.

On-The-Move Community Integration	181141		/users/profile/237850	mwpdx13	Volunteer	5	10/22/2013	On the Move is simply an incredible organization. The staff and volunteers strive to enrich the lives of participants through community immersion activities;  while also  increasing community awareness  around issues that impact people diagnosed with developmental disabilities. As a volunteer I am inspired consistently by On the Move. In a society that often responds with judgement and cruelty to those that are impacted by a developmental disability diagnosis, On the Move serves as a safe haven that not only acknowledges the value of each participant, but also fights for their right to be respected and treated with dignity in all areas of their lives.

On-The-Move Community Integration	164071		/users/profile/217943	afranz	Advisor	5	08/01/2013	My experience with On-the-Move has been the most rewarding experience of my life. It is like a family to me.  I consider On-the-Move a "home" for participants and myself, it is an environment that welcomes and embraces different cultures, humor, talents, interests, and abilities. I cannot speak more highly about the staff and volunteers at On-the-Move; they are compassionate, competent, supportive and extremely fun.   On-the-Move is an incredible program where adults with developmental disabilities have the space and support to participate in activities that enhance their lives and the community. The Director of On-the-Move, Molly Mayo, envisioned a program that went beyond typical services offered to adults with developmental disabilities. On-the-Move was an innovative idea and social movement agency that has set the standard for many other day programs that have followed suit.  On-the-Move is a place where adults can go and spend time socializing, navigate the community and enjoy community activities while educating all parties involved.  Molly hired me as one of her first employees over six years ago, I then served on the board of directors, and now am an advisor to the organization.  I feel privileged to continue working with On-the-Move.
On-The-Move Community Integration	158859		/users/profile/210863	jensi	Board Member	5	05/28/2013	I have lived in Portland over 10 years and I've never found an organization quite like On-the-Move Community Integration.  It is a relief to finally find a place that has an outlook about integration of people with disabilities of any kind as a important part of our community with gifts to give and receive by taking part of everyday activities everywhere - no limitations.  I grew up in Maine in a family with a brother with developmental disabilities who gave equally to my world as much or more than he received from it.   I worked for years in agencies that provided housing and activity programs for folks like my brother.  I was fortunate to work under directors with very progressive and inclusive visions. Then I moved to Portland, Oregon and I worked in the bike industry and I found myself surrounded by a strange cross-section of community that didn't feel complete for me though I loved the bike world.  It didn't feel real to me.  It didn't feel complete. My world is not complete when I don't see people with disabilities daily - it starts to feel segregated and odd.  When I finally connected with On-the-Move Community Integration to volunteer as a reading tutor, I was so relieved to finally get a sense of the community around me being a real and complete community.  I notice this acutely because this is something I was aware of from my birth; however,  I think about people who don't realize what is missing in their world.  When we don't see people with Down's Syndrome, with mental retardation, with whatever disability, we don't realize that it makes our own world smaller and along with that, the possibilities less.  I love to know that I might come across someone I know from On-the-Move volunteering anywhere - planting trees, making waffles, packing food boxes at the Food Bank.  Or I might come across a group of folks on a hike, at the zoo, at a concert, or at a sporting event.  On-the-Move is aptly named as the idea is that integration is fluid and entails integrating  - being a part of what is going on all around us.  I know that I get ideas for activities that would be fun to do by seeing what On-the-Move is up to in Facebook photos, I think I may very well not be unique in that.  On-the-Move is a trendsetting, forward-thinking organization and it's fortunate for Portland that we have this organization in our midst.  I am grateful and appreciate being involved in this organization.

Their recipe is actually quite simple: get folks out in the community where they can volunteer and have fun! By volunteering in environmentally conscious and socially just activities, On-The-Move participants gain social skills and a source of real pride at making a worthwhile contribution to their community. But just as important, if not more so, the community comes to know and really appreciate a group of joyful souls that they may have overlooked. Diversity increases with every smile.

When you know everyone better you can socialize with them.  Some of my favorite things are walking on the water front, Tanner Springs park, the park blocks.  We care for the chickens, count their eggs and give them fresh hay when we volunteer at the Oregon Food Bank Learning gardens.  Sometimes we pet the chickens.  I volunteer in the solar waffle cart and help run the business and serve customers.  The snowshoe trip was fun.  I went on the men's camping trip, it was nice for everyone to come along, we made a nice fire.  I've been coming here for almost 4 years.

Thank goodness NAIA exists to help advocate for animal lovers who disagree! Purebred dogs are wonderful beings,  just like mixed breed dogs, and there should be no shame in striving to create purebred dogs or in owning purebred or mixed breed dogs.  NAIA works to protect the interests of many others who work with animals, be they elephants or horses or cattle. NAIA understands the bond between humans and animals and the intensity of this connection between the animals and those who devote themselves to animals.  NAIA is advocating for the love of and concern for animals.

They have tons of data they willingly share and are very easy to work with on issues relating to animal ownership.
National Animal Interest Alliance	273415	4	/users/profile/362638	drrne	Board Member	5	12/01/2015	More than any other broadly inclusive organization, NAIA, ably led by Patti Strand, has created a coalition of people and organizations willing to go to bat to preserve and defend the traditions and industries that together make up a big portion of human - animal interaction.NAIA tells the truth about animals and their care,  and in so doing stands up for animal owners and our society every day. Its diverse supporters make it clear this is no one issue, or one constituency organization, but rather NAIA is on the front lines for all of us. Make it a priority in your charitable giving!

They aren't in the business to euthanize a healthy animal and have empathy and understanding of pure-bred breeders (not the enemy!) as well as pet owners whose rights are being diminished every week.

National Animal Interest Alliance	273380	2	/users/profile/362597	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	12/01/2015	The National Animal Interest Alliance (NAIA) is a very good organization.  It brings together various groups who care about the actual welfare of animals, including pets, as well as the rights and responsibilities of human owners of animals.  I attended the group's annual conference the last two years and i was very impressed with the assemblage of leaders and thinkers who focus on animal welfare and law.  In 2015 the NAIA also funded a very important study of Animal Shelter data that showed that less than 10% of shelter dogs were marketed by shelters as purebred dogs.  
National Animal Interest Alliance	273378	2	/users/profile/362594	Nottingham	Professional with expertise in this field	5	12/01/2015	NAIA is an organization that goes above and beyond the typical service of an animal welfare organization. NAIA works hard for the rights of animal owners all over the country. Such an amazing organization run by a wonderful group of people. The amount of education and support they provide is very much appreciated.
National Animal Interest Alliance	273376	2	/users/profile/362592	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	12/01/2015	The NAIA is a true animal welfare organization and their money goes to support the human/animal bond and not for the big overpaid CEO's of other animal rights organization.  There is a big difference between animal welfare and animal rights. One works for the "welfare" of animals and the other works to take that "right"  away.

This is the charity that cares about fostering the human-animal bond and saving our beloved pets by promoting animal welfare.  Do right by the animals you love and support NAIA.
National Animal Interest Alliance	273343	3	/users/profile/362557	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	12/01/2015	If you want accurate information about animal welfare issues, this is the place to go.  If you want to help animals and strengthen the human-animal bond, this is the place to go.  Lastly, if you think animal rights is the same as animal welfare you really need to go there to get educated.

This organization also supports the rights of animal ownership and works to expose the animal rights agenda which is why extremist animal rights people have issues with the NAIA. The terms animal welfare and animal rights are not interchangeable.   
National Animal Interest Alliance	273335	3	/users/profile/29520	david2	General Member of the Public	5	12/01/2015	The NAIA gets 5 stars for being a true animal welfare organization. This organization promotes the humane treatment of all animals and opposes all abuse. This organization also supports the rights of animal ownership and works to expose the animal rights agenda as well as supporting the American mainstream human/animal relationship -- which is why extremist animal rights people have issues with the NAIA. The terms animal welfare and animal rights are not interchangeable and the fact that many animal rights people are trying to deceptively call themselves animal welfare doesnt make them such. The NAIA deserves the support of all animal loving mainstream America.
National Animal Interest Alliance	273324	3	/users/profile/362536	Writer	Donor	5	12/01/2015	NAIA is one of the FEW true animal welfare organizations rather than an animal rights group professing to care--but really seeking the end to animal ownership, the end of sensible farming techniques, the end of zoos, the end of circuses, the end of rodeos, the end of horse racing, and the end of purebred breeding of all species. Simply stated, the animal rights enthusiasts want to control your very being--and if successful in their advancement of ever more restrictive laws--they'll end animal ownership. If one researches the actual goals of Ingrid Newkirk and Wayne Pacelle, their dislike for animals is evident.  
National Animal Interest Alliance	273317	3	/users/profile/362526	MikeIsaac	General Member of the Public	5	12/01/2015	NAIA is a tremendous resource and wealth of information.  Thank for all that this group does for the entire pet industry!

It's "just the facts, ma'am."          Importantly, the donations it receives do not go into pensions or staff perks.

National Animal Interest Alliance	190406	5	/users/profile/248602	LookingToVolunteer	General Member of the Public	1	12/11/2013	This is the email I sent to Great Nonprofits after I saw they were standing behind NAIA. I found your website for the first time from Transition Project, which you awarded a great nonprofit status in 2013.  I am interested in volunteering working with animals and saw that you are standing behind the National Animal Interest Alliance (NAIA).   After a bit of research, it is very clear to me that NAIA has no interest in animal rights, and I wondered how you could promote them without research of your own.   Consider:  1)  NAIA was founded by breeders and biomedical researchers.  SourceWatch explains they have a nonprofit front, are funded by agribusiness to lobby for them, and lobby for human use of animals while remaining tax-exempt.  2)  Wikipedia simply copies the mission statement from NAIA's website, then goes on to say they were against CA Prop 2, which was strongly supported by the Humane Society.  Also, NAIA works to categorize animal and environmental activists as terrorists; the ACLU is against this because people have the right to protest.  Wikipedia goes on to say funding comes from people and trapping, hunting, rodeo, etc., interests.  3)  NAIA's website supports animal experimentation and supports circuses and private animal entertainers.  True animal lovers know that "care and treatment" rhetoric is inadequate--to get an animal to do human bidding requires removing him or her from a natural environment, caging and feeding an unnatural diet, and hurting the animal to force him or her to do unnatural things like walk on a ball or jump through fire, or get cosmetics in their eyes.  4)  All of NAIA's activities seem to come with a statement about good care and treatment that make them seem to be an animal welfare organization, but in reality they lobby FOR the USE of animals in ways that animal rights groups heartily disagree with.  They are deeply involved in legislation and write many letters.  See the Campaigns section under Issues on their website.  For example, they are against pet consumer protection and for breeders; they blame humane organizations for the problem.  On the internet, NAIA speaks of "reasonable solutions" and how "man is an integral part of the solution" much like vague political statements that poorly hide their true interests to anyone who takes a second glance. I would never volunteer for an animal organization that doesn't shelter, rescue, protect, preserve habitat, or otherwise promote the INTERESTS of animals.  The NAIA actively promotes their own interests and human interests, which directly counters animal interests.  And yes, all living things have self interest.  An animal welfare organization should support the interests of animals.  An organization that pretends to be while doing the opposite is worse than groups who openly support the use and abuse of animals.   Can you explain why you would find NAIA a great nonprofit?
National Animal Interest Alliance	156814	2	/users/profile/208000	ahimsamonkey	General Member of the Public	1	04/30/2013	Per their own website, they support "circuses, zoos, wild animal parks, aquariums, and private entertainers".  They support animals in research & using animals in schools "at all levels of education".  They clearly take umbrage with the term "animal rights" or using "guardian" instead of "owner".  (Because animals are our property to do with whatever we wish, right?!)  They are PRO- ear-cropping, tail-docking, debarking dogs, declawing cats.  They seemingly support treating animals any which way as long as humans benefit.  This is clearly a front-group whose main goal is the status-quo, limited (if any) protections for non-human animals, and opposing true animal welfare groups in any & all situations.  They should be investigated for fraud & misrepresentation!!
National Animal Interest Alliance	101876	2	/users/profile/131541	SallySleuth	General Member of the Public	1	12/07/2011	Strand/Naia should be investigated for fraud/misrepresentation for claiming to be an animal "welfare" organization in their monetary solitication campaigns. Animal "use" enterprises are NOT animal "welfare" organizations. That is why SourceWatch.org has Strand's Naia listed as a "Front Group" - i.e. they are not who they claim to be. - Seal hunt, fur ranchers, puppy mills, using animals for medical research, Iditirod, dog racing, horse racing, animal trappers....... are NOT animal "welfare" organizations.  They are animal USE and they are FOR PROFIT businesses.  This is fraud and should be reported to the IRS.  Ironically, it's Naia and their Akc followers who are the main pusher behind the Hsus/Peta/Aspca smear campaigns.  - Note: I wouldn't have given it ONE star but this platform forced me to choose at least "one". 
National Animal Interest Alliance	96776	8	/users/profile/112115	tanksr	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/28/2011	NAIA is an excellent organization who's aim is to truly protect animals. They tell the truth, the whole truth. Truth's that other "humane" organizations would rather they not tell.
National Animal Interest Alliance	96654	2	/users/profile/112864	horse trainer	Professional with expertise in this field	1	08/26/2011	Quite simply, this group is far more concerned with protecting the rights of those who make money from animal suffering. Take a look at their positions on puppy mills, for example. They pretend to be about animal welfare to lure in unsuspecting animal lovers. It's disgusting.
National Animal Interest Alliance	96602	8	/users/profile/112787	crazy4critters	General Member of the Public	5	08/25/2011	The NAIA is an organization the helps to educate people about the difference between animal welfare (the humane treatment of all animals) and animal rights (the radical groups that wish to abolish animals altogether).  They have presented facts about the animal rights groups such as the HSUS and PETA who dupe the public into giving them money thinking that they are helping to take care of animals when in fact a VERY small percentage of those funds goes to anything but lobbying politicians to take away our right to love a pet, eat meat or eggs, wear leather, hunt and so on.  They present facts without hype and I for one appreciate their unbiased information.
National Animal Interest Alliance	96443	3	/users/profile/104229	suzyelectracuted	General Member of the Public	1	08/23/2011	The NAIA is a lobbying organization for the animal industries.

National Animal Interest Alliance	96431	2	/users/profile/49512	amyk1980	Professional with expertise in this field	1	08/23/2011	NAIA speaks all the language of animal welfare and pretends to be an animal welfare organization, but its real purpose is to protect the rights of people to do anything they want to animals in their care.  NAIA actively lobbies against any sort of animal welfare legislation including laws against puppy mills.   They have spoken out against animal shelters on numerous occasions, going so far as to accuse them of importing dogs from other countries in order to sell them for a profit.  They pretend there is non such thing as pet overpopulation, and that there are plenty of homes for homeless pets, because they gives cover for the high-volume puppy mills that they serve to continue churning out puppies in horrible conditions to sell for vastly over-inflated prices over the internet and in pet stores. The misinformation and outright lies coming from NAIA are a disgrace, and this organization does harm to every true animal welfare organization in America as well as the animals themselves.
National Animal Interest Alliance	96416	8	/users/profile/112294	BorderT	General Member of the Public	5	08/23/2011	NAIA cares about animal welfare - all of us are responsible for the animals in our care. I appreciate the balanced approach NAIA takes in protecting the rights of animals, and defending animal lovers & caregivers from overbearing legislation.  There are many more people raising, breeding and caring for animals PROPERLY than those who are cruel and neglectful - but laws that purport to HELP animals by legislating new 'punishments' or fines for mistreatment of animals often have devastating results affecting law-abiding, caring, and responsible people.

National Animal Interest Alliance	96403	4	/users/profile/62870	John S.	General Member of the Public	1	08/23/2011	NAIA is NOT an animal welfare organization.   It is an industry front group defending animal cruelty for profit.  Look at its board of directors: circuses, horse slaughterers, factory farmers, rodeo organizers, puppy mill apologists, lab animal breeders and vivisectionists, fur farmers... it's a Who's Who of corporate animal abusers. This group exists for one purpose, and one purpose only: to defend the ability of corporate interests to profit from the abuse of animals.

National Animal Interest Alliance	96198	7	/users/profile/111975	Susquehanna	Volunteer	5	08/21/2011	NAIA celebrates the human-animal bond.   It supports animal welfare and counters the animal rights movement's lies and exaggerations with the truth.  The website is a source of valuable information in countering the animal rights agenda, providing model legislation, white papers,and thoroughly researched articles in its extensive library.  Additionally, it maintains a chronology of acts of animal rights extremism, and a large quote file of statements by animal rights leaders that clearly shows their intent to block the enjoyment and use of animals for human benefit. NAIA's annual conferences bring together a wide variety of experts dealing with all areas of animal welfare - pets, animal agriculture, entertainment, biomedical research and more.

National Animal Interest Alliance	96181	5	/users/profile/111954	Jayne Mackta	General Member of the Public	5	08/21/2011	I have been aware of the outstanding efforts of this organization for many years. Dedicated volunteers from across the spectrum of people who work with and depend upon animals devote countless hours to sharing information in support of animal welfare.

NAIA really does help animals to live safe, happy, fulfilling lives, AND THEIR OWNERS to take appropriate care of said animals.  One really great project NAIA has ongoing is to colect data from as many animal shelters as possible in all 50 states to determine what the intake, placement and kill rates really are.  No one else has does this data gathering, but without it intelligent animal policy cannot be determined.
National Animal Interest Alliance	96123	5	/users/profile/111878	Mary N.	Donor	5	08/20/2011	NAIA is a fantastic organization!  It is all about animal welfare.  It is also all about our rights and responsibilities as owners.  It is not an animal rights organization that elevates animals above humans.  NAIA uses common-sense approaches to today's issues of ownership and breeding of all animals.  NAIA recognizes the huge role animals play in our lives.   Few organizations today provide the balance between animal welfare and owner rights and responsibilites; NAIA does this exceptionally well.  There is a lot of helpful and eye-opening information at their website.  It is my go-to source for talking points when reviewing legislation., and deciding whether to oppose or support bills.  I hope this organization continues to grow!

It has become significant among all of the non-profit service providers in the community.  LCA has weathered the inevitable hard times by sticking to its central mission and by attracting committed, talented volunteers and supporters to its programs.
The Latino Community Association	233284	2	/users/profile/297015	Miriam7	Client Served	4	11/09/2014	The LCA is a wonderful organization that has helped many Hispanics families in Central Oregon. Among those families is my family that has benefit from many of the programs that LCA offers. Without the help and support that LCA offers to Latino families like mine, they wouldn't be able to afford services such as dental, chiropractic, or counselor services.  Thank you LCA for all the services you offer to the Latino population. Also, I want to thank you all the donors and volunteers who make possible that organizations  like LCA stay open and free of charge to low income families. Together, you are making the difference. 
The Latino Community Association	233175	3	/users/profile/296870	shiftingmatters	Donor	5	11/07/2014	The LCA labor of love towards the Latino population in Central Oregon is extraordinary.

Providing a liaison for our Latino community has never been more important, as the Latino community in Central Oregon is always growing. The less intimidating we can make the legal process, or any other process such as healthcare or education, the more people are likely to want to come forward and get their identification cards and/or passports, as well as work toward higher education and/or better health and healthcare.  Thanks to this very adept and generous organization, Central Oregon is ever-closer to achieving its goals of promoting diversity, welcoming newcomers, and creating more opportunities for all its citizens!

When I finally discovered the LCA and all the threads of their efforts to reach out and involve the various communities in all three of these neighboring towns, (Redmond, Bend and Sisters), I found sources for various needs right away. One example involved camping outings and hikes for kids who don't get those chances; another was legal advice for documentation issues; other thingsincluded resource teaching materials, medical locations and celebrations of Hispanic and Latino cultural events.  I am so thankful for the work of underpaid staff and volunteers for a huge population of underserved people.  The need is tremendous!
The Latino Community Association	228944	1	/users/profile/292620	ElyB	General Member of the Public	5	10/28/2014	LCA has been the resource portal for so many people & families within the community. It has been the connection between organizations and community members that may not have reached out without LCA's support, which has been a huge blessing for both sides.  Not only does LCA provide assistance and support for Latino people & families but it has brought amazing cultural experiences to everyone.  Thanks LCA- keep on!
The Latino Community Association	228919	1	/users/profile/292596	cpfun	General Member of the Public	5	10/28/2014	We are fortunate to have the Latino Community Association in Central Oregon and to have Brad Porterfield as the driving force of LCA.  Through LCA, Brad's passion has helped open minds to other cultures, while at the same time serving the Latino population with invaluable help.  This nonprofit is  a crucial resource for our growing community.  Thanks, LCA and Brad!
The Latino Community Association	228720	1	/users/profile/168503	Carol60	Volunteer	5	10/28/2014	I started work with the LCA almost 5 years ago through my volunteer work with the Festival of Cultures here in Redmond OR.  They were and still are a key role in the local Citizenship Ceremony held each year at the FOC in Redmond's Centennial Park.  Very important for the community and our political atmosphere here in Central Oregon.  I met tons of interesting people and learned about  how SO MANY things in our community are touched by the programs and people  brought to you by the LCA.  My eyes were opened as to how much our community needs the involvement of each and every culture to make it the best place to live and work.  I know I also made lifelong friends and was reminded many times how fortunate I am to be an American Citizen.... Thank You LCA -   now I just need to learn Spanish :)
The Latino Community Association	123776		/users/profile/168503	Carol60	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/28/2012	I am an event planner in the community and volunteer my time to work with LCA on the Festival of Cultures which is a yearly event celebrating the cultures in our area. Prior to this joint festival I did not know about LCA or what they worked on in the community.  Now I have experienced what they do for our community and the Latinos that have chosen to make our beautiful area their home.  The amount of information, the availability and knowledge of the staff, the available resources in the community ----everything seems to work together to help the Latinos settle into our community and allow them to be comfortable enough to give back.  The Festival of Cultures, now in its 7th year is one of the main events for our community and continues to grow and provide all cultures a chance to share their heritage with the people in our community.  LCA is the main backbone of the Festival - the staff, the volunteers and the board all work together to make it successful.  I have met many amazing people through our local LCA and have gained life long friends, they opened my eyes to so many things that I was naively unaware of, I am grateful and thankful.
The Latino Community Association	228641	1	/users/profile/292325	theartstation	Volunteer	5	10/28/2014	I was lucky enough to be part of an event put on by the Latino Community Association recently and was blown away by their leadership, enthusiasm and ambition. The LCA works tirelessly to help and provide resources for families within our community. They are truly an incredible organization and I look forward to working with them in the future! 
The Latino Community Association	228617	1	/users/profile/292305	Ruthie2	Volunteer	5	10/28/2014	I have been tutoring two Mexican women through Latino Community Association in Redmond, Oregon.  They are both advanced students and so I focus a lot on increasing their skills in reading, grammar and writing.  It has been a great experience for me as these two women have become dear friends.  I have been with them long enough to walk through  marriage, new babies and countless other situations.  I have enjoyed being under the umbrella of LCA.  They have always been very encouraging to me, letting me use their office for tutoring when I have needed a place, offering resources and teachig advice through group tutor sessions.  Ruthie Keller
The Latino Community Association	228616	1	/users/profile/292304	melon88	Volunteer	4	10/28/2014	Via my church I volunteer in a low income neighborhood that houses mostly Latino families.  Every once in a while a family hits a bump and needs some help.  I always suggest to them that they go and see the Latino Community Association (LCA).  There are so many ins and outs of our various government and non-profit systems that we as volunteers don't completely understand, that it is good to have an LCA in our community to back us up.  LCA puts my mind at ease, as I know that they will care for the people that I send their way.  
The Latino Community Association	228598	1	/users/profile/292286	Alex72	Client Served	3	10/28/2014	The Latino community association it's very helpful in Central Oregon.They help a lot sometimes more  that they can.
The Latino Community Association	228581	1	/users/profile/292268	jacquiemh17	Professional with expertise in this field	4	10/28/2014	The Latino Association is a great resource for Central Oregon Latinos and community members looking to serve and interact with local Latinos.  Working in the healthcare field, I understand that addressing the needs of the whole person can help create a  healthier community.  This organization helps break down many barriers for community members who work hard to be a part of our community, but struggle against the status quo that can at times veil all the resources available.  Helping some of our most productive community members thrive is a wonderful way for the Latino Community Association to contribute to society.  We are blessed by their services and exciting ways they celebrate diversity.
The Latino Community Association	228518		/users/profile/190602	Mark79	Donor	5	10/28/2014	As a past board member I have been supportive of LCA for many years.  Their staff works well to assess and meet the needs of the local Latino community.  Their services are invaluable to those that receive them.  They have not lost sight of their mission and I am pleased to be a monthly donor via United Way pass through.  Adelante!!
The Latino Community Association	144103		/users/profile/190602	Mark79	Donor	5	11/29/2012	The LCA has been around for years, quietly assisting the Latin community of Central Oregon.  Brad Porterfield is one of the hardest working people I know. He is under paid (sorry, BOD) for the time, energy, and commitment he provides for the LCA patrons. When I win the mega multi million powerball jackpot I'll set you up forever. Or I'll keep making a monthly donation through United Way.  Probably the latter. Keep u the good work and see you on the 5th. 
The Latino Community Association	228503		/users/profile/292194	amf509-j	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/28/2014	The Latino Community Association provides a variety of services and programs that help the Latino community in Central Oregon.  I have personally worked with them on projects such as visits to the area by the Mexican Consulate and after school programs they run at elementary schools.  However I know that there are many, many other ways that the LCA is involved in the community, from interpreting and translations, to tax help, to cultural celebrations.  LCA staff and board members have a presence at almost every event that serves the Latino community and are always willing to help other organizations with the same general mission.  
The Latino Community Association	228499	1	/users/profile/292176	Wunpinni	General Member of the Public	5	10/28/2014	    As with other parts of our country, Central Oregon finds itself in great need for many different communities the largest of which may be our latino community. This is a big job that has brought the cream of Central Oregonians to the top. Highly motivated and ethically clear, the staff and volunteers are relentless in their search for a voice and equality for the latino community through the Latino Comunity Association (LCA). No major or minor issue is "left unturned". LCA provides one-on-one English language learning, promotes citizenship, driver card, health services referral and much more. The contributors and vocal spokespeople for the organization are excited to be able to connect the latino community with the rest of the Central Oregon community thus allowing sharing and integration of cultures to emblazon not only hope but also true succeess. LCA un-imprisons lives that could have been lost to ancient injustices and hypocrisies. Brad Porterfield, Carolina Afre, Margie and George Greogory are just some of the hearts focussed on the success of latinos and cultural integration by carrying the banner for Central Oregon.
The Latino Community Association	228469		/users/profile/292156	mrspat	General Member of the Public	5	10/28/2014	I have had only positive experiences with the Latino Community Association.  LCA provides resources and help to Latino families in Central Oregon.  I know families that LCA has helped adjust to life in Central Oregon.  Their programs help connect the Spanish speaking communities to the Anglo/English speaking communities.  It is a very helpful and much-needed organization with quality services for the whole community.  
The Latino Community Association	228461		/users/profile/292149	scotl	Donor	5	10/28/2014	The Latino Community Association is a wonderful organization that strives for an all inclusive community where all segments are valued.   They do an excellent job of integrating the Latino population while at the same time celebrating their culture.   Though a direct benefit to the clients LCA serves this also serves as a great benefit to the whole greater Central Oregon Community where we can embrace cultural differences, value individuals, while enjoying a whole greater community. Thank you Brad and LCA
The Latino Community Association	228457		/users/profile/292146	ErinET	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/28/2014	The Latino Community Association is dedicated to helping improve the lives of Latinos in Central Oregon. I have personally witnessed them provide services such as dental care, immigration advice, translation, English classes, computer classes and many other services to the community.  The Association is a safe place for the Latino community to gather and to get support. The Latino Community Association fights for the rights of all people in Central Oregon and truly understands the needs of the community. 
The Latino Community Association	228435		/users/profile/292125	Sue Nell S.	Volunteer	4	10/28/2014	The Latino Community Association provides essential services and education to both the Latino and Anglo communities of Bend, Oregon. From employment referrals to interpretation at medical appointments, immigration seminars and consulate services, films, fairs, and Da de los Muertos celebrations-- the LCA is a unique and critical resource for our community. 
The Latino Community Association	228408		/users/profile/292098	Jose2014	Board Member	5	10/28/2014	The benefits of LCA go beyond the people they serve, they help the community in general by helping their clients be part ignite community and productive citizens and at the same time strengths families. 
The Latino Community Association	228364		/users/profile/292058	Patty45	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/28/2014	This wonderful organization has helped people I know learn how to speak English and get jobs!  I also admire the amount of legal assistance provided.  And they make it easy for volunteers to get involved and feel important.
The Latino Community Association	228333		/users/profile/292027	Elva	General Member of the Public	5	10/28/2014	The LCA are such a huge resource for members of our Central Oregon community.  They make our members feel they belong in our community and are here to support!!
The Latino Community Association	228309		/users/profile/292002	oldmule54	General Member of the Public	5	10/28/2014	Because of the work that I do, I have had occasion to see LCA and its staff at work up close on many occasions. From crisis intervention for Latino individuals and families struggling with language and cultural barriers to more broadly  building bridges between the Latino and Anglo communities, they provide vital services to our tri-county region. They maintain great relationships with civic, academic and business partners; they know how to get things done.
The Latino Community Association	149753		/users/profile/199701	Milagros A.	Volunteer	5	02/21/2013	LCA is a wonderful Association that servers not only Spanish speaking members of the community but also English speakers.  As it has interpretation services both English to Spanish and Spanish to English. (to mention one of their many services) Clearly Latino Community Association is making the difference in Central Oregon.  Way to Go L.C.A..!!!
The Latino Community Association	131325		/users/profile/176885	Abuelamargarita	Volunteer	5	10/30/2012	The Latino Community Association plays a unique role in providing the resources that enable Latino families to be successful in overcoming obstacles and achieving their goals.  LCA also sponsors numerous activities that introduce the community to the richness of Latino culture and to the many contributions that the members of this culture bring to us all.  I value the many and varied opportunities that LCA gives me to participate in these endeavors.
The Latino Community Association	128524		/users/profile/173696	quetzal66	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/24/2012	Being a professional with expertise in this field, as well as a volunteer for over five years with LCA, I am certain that this organization provides an invaluable service to a growing number of families living in our community.   In my opinion, The Latino Community Association is a vital and vibrant non-profit organization  and should most certainly be on the 2012 Top-Rated Nonprofits List!
The Latino Community Association	128449		/users/profile/173613	1jen	General Member of the Public	5	10/24/2012	The Latin Community Association provides such an important link to so many helpful resources for so many families in Central Oregon! It really is priceless.
The Latino Community Association	128349		/users/profile/173504	ajlfortuna	General Member of the Public	5	10/24/2012	The LCA is an organization where, with limited resources and a BIG HEART, a gamut of services are offered not only to the Latino community but to the public  in general. Friends of mine have been helped with invaluable legal advise, job searching, interpreting services and moral support in times of stress and despair. The LCA is a BIG asset in Central Oregon and one we should be proud of and keep supporting in its mission.
The Latino Community Association	128070		/users/profile/173197	chivas	Volunteer	4	10/23/2012	Its great to have a place to go to for help.  LCA its a great organization that  helps the community in various aspects.  The hispanic community its lucky to have a such a help.  thanks LCA for your wonderfull work!
The Latino Community Association	128050		/users/profile/173174	Kelly56	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/23/2012	Brad Porterfield, his staff and volunteers have done an amazing service for Central Oregon and people of all cultures with the Latino Community Association. As a bilingual businessperson, I have always wanted to do more to help the Latino Community thrive and find opportunity; I'm more than full up with pro bono work, but I'm glad we have someone like Brad and the LCA to take care of an area of need in our community. They have worked hard from humble beginnings, sometimes on little more than determination and resourcefulness, to build something lasting and far reaching in its impact. Andale, LCA! Kelly Walker, M.S.
The Latino Community Association	125077	1	/users/profile/170197	Robyn6	Professional with expertise in this field	4	10/10/2012	LCA fills a special niche in Central Oregon! They provide valuable services like English glasses, job search assistance and inerpreters. They do a lot with limited resources!
The Latino Community Association	125067	1	/users/profile/170187	Lani W.	Board Member	4	10/10/2012	LCA is a great Non Profit, that helps so many with so little.  English classes, translation, jobs lists, Consulate visits and so much more.  Please support this amazing group of people that are dedicated to serving those with language and cultural challenges.
The Latino Community Association	125053	1	/users/profile/170172	Deevy	Volunteer	5	10/10/2012	LCA is a shining star in Central Oregon. They cover not just the basics for people in need but long-term vision. They connect what's happening at state, national and local level and help people maneuver huge obstacles that would otherwise really compromise human and civil rights. They provide a wonderful public festival that celebrates diversity and inclusion, the only one of its kind throughout the year. 
The Latino Community Association	124025	2	/users/profile/168820	juniper	Donor	4	10/01/2012	LCA fills a unique and invaluable role in Central Oregon for the Latino community. They are THE hub of information, services and assistance for a population with complex needs and for many, very limited means and ability to access services due to immigration status and/or language barriers. I share a building with LCA and have the opportunity to see their clients being served daily by a tiny paid staff and dedicated volunteers. Services I've seen being delivered include dental and medical clinics, legal assitance, English language tutoring and more.  Oon a shoe-string budget, LCA serves one of the most hard-working. yet vulnerable populations in Central Oregon. 
The Latino Community Association	123973		/users/profile/168754	Kaitlin G.	Volunteer	4	10/01/2012	The Latino Community Association provides Central Oregon's Latino population with much needed resources and relationships. While this population continues to grow in the region, many barriers still exist that disadvantage Latino adults and youth. LCA not only provides relevant and up-to-date resources like the childhood deferment act but also creates numerous opportunities to engage in community development. Fundraising events that include meaningful ceremonies such as the nationalization ceremony in the fall and fun activities like making guacamole and tortillas help empower and educate all members of the Central Oregon community. I think that this effort to not only strengthen the Latino community but to build bridges among all Central Oregonians makes LCA an invaluable organization. In only a few weeks of volunteering with LCA, I was able to see their dedication to their cause and the great importance they hold for so many individuals. Volunteers and clients help support the organization the few LCA staff work tirelessly nonetheless to continue to compile job listings, process paperwork and build bonds with their members and beyond. 
The Latino Community Association	123941		/users/profile/168707	Sue_25	Donor	5	09/30/2012	LCA does so much to help the Latino community in Bend and I especially appreciate how they support families who need legal advice or medical assistance.  Though the staff is quite small, Brad and others do everything they can to work with each and every family who makes their needs known.
The Latino Community Association	123938		/users/profile/168704	rebecca64	Volunteer	5	09/30/2012	I am a busy working mother, but I always try to find some time occasionally to volunteer with the Latino Community Association. The work they do not only provides valuable services to families, but also contributes to the feelings of community, partnership, and commitment towards a better future which is so important in our society. The LCA values everyone equally and makes all participants (clients, volunteers, donors) feel that they have a voice and can contribute in a valuable way. They appreciate all participants, and understand that each person has a gift to give. I very much want to see this organization grow and develop. It is a unique part of the Central Oregon community.
The Latino Community Association	102681	2	/users/profile/135120	mimi_graves	Volunteer	5	12/28/2011	The Latino Community Association is a lifesaver for the minority, but ever-increasing Latino population. With a scavenger budget, LCA serves as a jobs resource, posting jobs from Craig's list in Spanish and creating specific resumes for clients in need of a job. We refer those needing immigration advice to an attorney who does the initial consult for free. We coordinate a on-on-one tutoring program that connects Spanish and English speakers as cultural and language partners.  We give cultural trainings for many area government and nonprofit groups. We served over 2,000 people last year. Our clients are among the neediest in our area.  Each September we host a Festival of Culture providing booths, music, dance and activities from over 50 countries. We strengthen families, celebrate culture and make connections with people.  
Sparrow Clubs USA	161481		/users/profile/214183	St Pete Susie	General Member of the Public	5	06/26/2013	We are the Great-Grandparents of a little Great-Granddaughter who was diagnosed with a rare childhood cancer at 11 months old.  Thanks to the love and support of the Sparrow Club and a wonderful family dynamic our little girl is now tumor-free and ready to turn 2 years old in early August.  Seeing all the events, fundraisers, etc. sponsored by the Sparrow Club from our home in Florida made us feel much more connected to the process happening in Oregon.  We'll be forever grateful for the spirit of the Sparrow Club.
Sparrow Clubs USA	161438		/users/profile/214100	cailey.kimball	General Member of the Public	5	06/25/2013	Sparrow Clubs USA has provided a wonderful support system for one of my best friends and her family in a time when they really needed it.  Cancer affects all of us at some point, but I never would have expected it to affect Olivia, especially not right before her first birthday.  The amount Rita, Olivia and Jakey & all their family have gone through this year is completely amazing, and not something you would ever wish on anyone.  But I have to say that in a time where things were bad, I felt comfort knowing that this family had been taken in, supported and lifted up by an amazing group of students whose focus was to help.   In our world today it's so easy to get caught up in all the negative, all the violence, all the mainstream news that is just so overly negative, but this organization and these students who choose to participate are real heroes, they should be the news stories we see, stories showing that compassion for one another is still around.  They give families in need a support system to lean on, and the monetary assistance they provide through their fundraisers is obviously a big help, but this is about so much more than money.  It's about seeing someone and wanting to make a difference, no matter how big or small.  Sparrow Clubs USA is a life changing organization and I hope that more schools around the country take on this program because it is truly amazing.  Thank you to the Aloha Warriors for taking Rita, O and Jake in...I don't think you all will ever be thanked enough or know exactly how much of a difference and how many lives you touch through your hard work and dedication, your efforts reach far beyond the individual families that you take in each year!
Sparrow Clubs USA	161424		/users/profile/214086	Maikekula	General Member of the Public	5	06/25/2013	Sparrow Club has given a family very close to me opportunities they did not have. It has been amazing to see just how above and beyond people with Sparrow Club have gone for Olivia and her family. This organization truly is a blessing. Many times the actions and kindness of others towards Olivia and her family have brought tears to my eyes. So glad they were able to give such a special family an amazing gift of love and generosity. 
Sparrow Clubs USA	161422		/users/profile/214085	JessicaLynn	General Member of the Public	5	06/25/2013	My niece, who was diagnosed with cancer at the age of 1, lives 2,500 miles away from me. Her father (my brother) is active duty army and stationed just as far away. She was adopted as a sparrow from Aloha High School and I can barely put into words how much that means to me and the rest of my family.  It is heart breaking to be so far away and be able to do so little for her and her mother through treatment. The sparrow program has been there for support financially and emotionally with things that we could not do so far away. They have included her older brother in all of their activities showering both kids with love and kindness through this horrible time. I am forever grateful to the sparrow club and all the kids that have volunteered for being a light to my family while there was so little I could do.
Sparrow Clubs USA	161417		/users/profile/214079	Rita16	Client Served	5	06/25/2013	As a single mother of two, one diagnosed with cancer before the age of 1, Sparrow Clubs USA has been beyond a life changing event for my family.  No mother ever thinks about or wants to hear the word cancer.  It is devastating.  But the one thing that lifted my two children and myself up during the longest year of our lives was the kindness, support and generosity that Sparrow Clubs brought into our lives.  I am now able to attend college, be a mom, work part-time, AND continue to be with my daughter for her medical because Sparrow and all involved are wonderful and terrific.  Sparrow Clubs USA is a fabulous way for communities, small or big, to come together for one selfless purpose.  It has made me a better person and has taught me that the good in the world prevails!  Thank you to Sparrow Clubs USA!
Sparrow Clubs USA	159742		/users/profile/211916	Nate A.	Volunteer	5	06/06/2013	Let me just start off by saying any person who is involved with Sparrow will be inspired and love every minute they spend with this organization. It's so cool to be able to spend time serving someone who is probably less fortunate then yourself. I go to Aloha High School and we have been adopting a Sparrow (child who is sick with a medical condition). The thing that's so unique about Sparrow is that it affects every type of student at our school. I've seen kids that don't have a passion for learning and don't like school decide to volunteer for Sparrow and become super passionate about it. I would suggest all schools to begin doing this program and for anyone to get involved by volunteering or getting a group you are a part of involved. You won't be let down by Sparrow!
Sparrow Clubs USA	159497		/users/profile/211669	cjeytel12	Volunteer	5	06/05/2013	CJ EytelSparrow Clubs USA has impacted me more than any other organization I have volunteered for. Watching a school and a community come together has motivated me to give back as much as possible. I would recommend this volunteer opportunity to anyone because it is one of the most humbling experience a person can go through. I have been involved with Sparrow for four years now and it is one thing that every year I look forward to starting. I am from a very blue collar community so being able to raise money through service and other student led events has been a blast. This year we tried out some new events like an online fundraiser and men's volleyball. We raised as an entire community over 18,000 dollars for a little girl and her family. To know that we were able to give them that large amount of money just shows that a little effort and some hard work can take a community a long way.
Sparrow Clubs USA	158372		/users/profile/210117	Jessie Price	Volunteer	5	05/21/2013	Sparrow Clubs is an awesome organizations where kids can come together within their school and community to raise money for a child whos been through a lot and whos family might need help. It really opens up everyones eye to all the blessings they have by realize there are some people out there that are not as fortunate. This year Aloha and the community had so many wonderful opportunities like "beautify aloha" a 5k run and even a sparrow dance. Helping out the community was easily the best part of all the involvement because I really got to feel like i was helping out this years sparrow but also betting the community. The dance was another great way to raise money by getting a group of friends together and bump some fun music. Working with sparrow clubs the last few years has been a great experience and so eye opening, i really love all that sparrow clubs do and how they simultaneously bring schools closer together. Im very proud of Aloha for raising ruffly 18,500 for Baby Olivia!
Sparrow Clubs USA	157798		/users/profile/209260	rachelle.youngs	Volunteer	5	05/13/2013	Sparrow is an opportunity to give back to someone within your community who is fighting for a chance. This year Aloha adopted a little girl named Olivia who has Rhabdomyosarcoma, a rare childhood cancer. As a school we put on a dance, race, run, and other fun activities to raise money. We were the most successful we have ever been, and raised of $18,000 for Olivia and her family. Sparrow has taught me how to give back and to be thankful. I have had the opportunity to work hands on with Sparrow for the past three years. I love this organization and I love having the opportunity to help. The most impacting moment was having the opportunity to sit down and talk to Olivia and her family. It was such a wonderful experience and I have forever been changed by it.  
Sparrow Clubs USA	157735		/users/profile/209184	jgarmondeh	Volunteer	5	05/13/2013	In the Sparrow Club at my high school we adopted a sparrow and raised 18,000 for her. It was amazing because we were suppose to be the school with less money compare with other schools but we have a really big heart. In our community we care bout each other, so when people heard the story about our sparrow they donated. It was a team effort and there were lots of people involved in raising money and volunteering time to make sparrow successful. It thought me that a little kindness can make a lot of difference in someone's life. It felt good helping out because I was part of something big and I would recommend this to any and everyone. 
Sparrow Clubs USA	156735		/users/profile/207870	alvaro.flores	Volunteer	5	04/30/2013	The Sparrow Club has significantly impacted me increasingly over the years as I have become more and more involved. It amazes me how much such a small act of kindness can go a long way. To believe that one kid started it all shows how much impact a person and the school community can make in people's lives. I really feel that Sparrow has brought people together as well as help the kids and families in need. Sparrow is a great organization and I personally believe that it should be expanded to other areas around the country and even in other nations. As strong and helpful as it is now, I know that if Sparrow were to become a bigger organization we would see more lives being impacted and changed forever, continuing the chain reaction that that one kid had once hoped to start.  
Sparrow Clubs USA	156513		/users/profile/207608	Mikayla.Stack17	Volunteer	5	04/27/2013	Sparrow Clubs USA is the mosst amazing organization i have ever been apart of! This organization helps people in need on a first hand basis. My high school adopted a sparrow and we raised over $14,000 for our sparrow! The whole school was doing all they could to raise money for her. From meetinf with the sparrow and their family, i can see howbig of an impact Sparrow Clubs USA on them. Helping families in need within my community is an amazing feeling and brings uncommon people together with one common goal. Working closely with Sparrow Clubs USA changed my life and my perspective:)
Sparrow Clubs USA	156122		/users/profile/207132	michelle.silva510	Volunteer	5	04/25/2013	Being introduced to the Sparrow Club has completely changed my outlook on volunteering.  It is a fantastic way to raise money for a good cause, and it also helps communities join together even more.  I have never seen my school be so excited to donate money and time for our adorable sparrow. The fact that it has spread to schools throughout the state has opened my eyes because I love witnessing students gather to help another person in need.  Sparrow has motivated me to always be involved in organizations that provide financial aid to anyone who needs it.  No matter rich or poor, if you want to find a way to support a person or a family, it can be done!  Sparrow has taught me that.

This was my first year in leadership and after truly understanding what the sparrow program was about I quickly made it my own personal goal to help raise money. I worked with Mrs. Livingston and we started a facebook page for our sparrow Olivia which quickly grew within our school and our community. I love sparrow and I have seen how helping others also helps you. After helping sparrow I would always have this sense of joy and accomplishment that I would not gain from doing anything else. It is a great organization that helps people realize the true importance of life which is charity and generosity.

The foundation has helped me become more compassionate towards little kids and made me appreciate and grateful for life. The organization impacts the whole school that the Sparrow is apart of, and many schools participate in this wonderful and amazing program. Lives are defeniltey changed.
Sparrow Clubs USA	155639		/users/profile/206577	andersbake	Volunteer	5	04/22/2013	When I was in 8th grade I was first introduced to sparrow clubs when Aloha High School's Sparrow Nakawana came to my school. I did not know very much about the sparrow program then but I was touched by the story of the first sparrow. I learned how Damion did not have much to give but his sacrifice started a reaction that has not stoped.  As I have become a student at Aloha and a member of the leadership class I have become more involved in the sparrow program and have learned how it works. I have come to realize that it takes a lot of hard work and planning to organize sparrow fundraisers by a lot of dedicated people. I also takes a caring community that is willing to put there whole hart into something. I believe that Aloha high school, is a great example of a caring community. Aloha High school is one of the poorest schools in it's area but we are one of the best at giving. I think that the students at Aloha do such a great job because they can better understand what it is like to be in a hard situation like the sparrow families. In many ways the Aloha community is much like Damion. they do not have a lot to give but they have big harts and are willing to do whatever they can.     This year I have had the opportunity to serve as the Aloha ASB Treasurer.  I really enjoy this job because I am able to count the money are school donates and keep a record of all the ways we get money. I believe Aloha is so successful because we have a variety of different service opportunities for all kinds of different people. We have many after school activities like letter writing, cleaning the school and a road clean up. This year we added on line donations and a 5k run put on by my friend Matthew. I helped out at the run and was amazed at how many people from the community came to the event to help Babe O. I really hope that this tradition continues and that we can continue to get more of the community involved. Sparrow clubs has touched me and has helped me realize that the world will always be a good place when there are passionate people that are willing to serve for a good cause.
Sparrow Clubs USA	155637		/users/profile/206574	Addisen Johnsen	Volunteer	5	04/22/2013	I have been involved in Sparrow for the past 5 years when it was started in 2009 at my middle school.  It has provided everyone in my community an opportunity to come together and unite in one cause.  Consequently, my community (Aloha, OR) has acquired a family feel and become a lot closer.  Sparrow has given me an opportunity to be apart of something bigger than myself and help young kids who truly need help and support.  If you are looking for a service opportunity to help someone in need, your search is over.  Join Sparrow Clubs and be apart of a world changing organization.
Sparrow Clubs USA	155636		/users/profile/206573	joelkram	Volunteer	5	04/22/2013	Sparrow club has greatly impacted my life. This year was my first as an Aloha high school leadership student and has really helped me connect with the Sparrow this year. It was amazing to see the number students that gave their time to help our sparrow Baby O out. Sparrow Club has given me a better perspective on life, it has shown me that when people work together for a good cause they can accomplish great things.  
Sparrow Clubs USA	155633		/users/profile/206571	Milligan	Volunteer	5	04/22/2013	At Aloha every year we adopt a Sparrow as a school. sparrow has made me more grateful for what I have and more willing to help others. Through the Sparrow program I have become more involved at school, met new people and have a better outlook on life. I love doing the work we do for Sparrow because it is for such a good cause. I hope that I have touched the Sparrow's heart as much as they have touched mine.
Sparrow Clubs USA	155627		/users/profile/206560	christina.budiselic	Volunteer	4	04/22/2013	The sparrow club has really impacted both myself and my school. this program has been touching students hearts for 5 years now at Aloha High School. it has been giving students the ability to reach out in ways they could not otherwise help. I'm so happy to have been a part of this program for four years now because it has taught me new things and let me help those in needs! Thank you to sparrow clubs for being a part of our school and helping our school strive to new heights and share the program in the future!
Sparrow Clubs USA	155607		/users/profile/206535	alecclandon	Volunteer	5	04/22/2013	I think this organization is one of the coolest and greatest organizations that really includes high school kids. Sparrow really bring the community and high school closer together. Speaking as a person who's family has been affected by cancer it is truly amazing the things a high school an accomplish.Sparrow also give the kids at a school who are not apart of leadership a way to giveback to a child in need witch is priceless.
Sparrow Clubs USA	155602		/users/profile/206526	Annalise Noel H.	Volunteer	5	04/22/2013	Sparrow  has impacted my life tremendously.  It's so amazing to be given the opportunity to personally help someone in need.  It has opened my eyes, as well as my school's, and my community's to the beauty and kindness in giving.  I'm thankful to be a part of such a neat organization as it inspires so many people to creatively help in any way they can.  Sparrow brings out the generosity and love in the hearts of so many, as has the power to touch thousands of lives. I hope that everyone will someday have an opportunity like this to give back to the community and help a child in need.    
Sparrow Clubs USA	155601		/users/profile/206524	martinezal	Volunteer	5	04/22/2013	Sparrow has impacted my life in so many ways. I am fortunate to have had the opportunity to get close to several sparrows at Aloha High School, which has been an amazing experience. Sparrow has impacted the way I look at my life and it has helped me gain a positive attitude. Not only does sparrow help the family in need, but it also helps teenagers to think less about themselves and more about others. Sparrow is amazing because not only does it help the family, but it beautifies the community and changes our outlook on life.
Sparrow Clubs USA	155599		/users/profile/206522	LLfamily	Volunteer	5	04/21/2013	I would give sparrow clubs a 5 because it is such an amazing program.  I love how it brought my whole community together to help a little girl and her family.  Being able to see how much our help affects a family is truly rewarding in itself. 
Sparrow Clubs USA	155595		/users/profile/206517	Roz Nicole S.	Volunteer	5	04/21/2013	I defiantly give Sparrow clubs a five, as it was a wonderful opportunity for me to grow and learn.  This month my school embraced our sparrow - baby Olivia through volunteer work.  Our school came together devoting time, money and love to this wonderful little girl.  I have personally had numerous opportunities to serve her through service including pulling ivy at Hyland Park, writing letters to people in need, and helping make cards for a suicide awareness video.  As a leader in student government at my high school, I was able to work with and fully appreciate our sparrows situation, as well as the effort our school has put into raising money to help.  From what I have heard these children use our support to find the strength to keep going. I love this program and everything it is doing.  
Sparrow Clubs USA	155576		/users/profile/206496	Grant3	Volunteer	5	04/21/2013	I helped sparrow in the past but didn't quite know exactly what I was doing to help. I entered the leadership class at my school this year and got to see what we do for our sparrow behind the scenes. I also got to meet our sparrow and find out how wonderful she is. Not only do be get the opportunity to help out a child in need but we also find out about ourselves along the way. I love Sparrow Clubs and all of the work that they do for children in need. 
Sparrow Clubs USA	155491		/users/profile/206414	Toti	Volunteer	5	04/20/2013	I was introduced to Sparrow through my leadership class this year. Through helping fund for Baby O, it has shown me how meaningful service is to others. During our Sparrow Assembly I saw vividly remember Baby O's mother(Rita) bawling during our slideshow. She was so thankful for all that we have done and continue to do for Baby O. I additionally learn the importance of leaders in the world. As leaders it is our duty to unite no matter our differences, and fight to make this place a better world for the next generation. 
Sparrow Clubs USA	155414		/users/profile/206320	kathrynnewton	Volunteer	5	04/19/2013	Sparrow has always been a success at my high school Aloha. We spend the entire month of April raising money for a child and their family that has many burdening medical bills. This non-profit always bring in a lot of money from my school of Aloha because everyone becomes attached to our Sparrow. This year our sparrows name is Olivia and she is the cutest little girl ever! This is the most successful non-profit that I have ever come in personal contact with. I would definitely recommend Sparrow to anyone that needs a purpose or a drive to raise money.
Sparrow Clubs USA	155395		/users/profile/206300	meganmcintyre97	Volunteer	5	04/19/2013	I am a student at AlohaHigh school and i have had a very wonderful experience with sparrow. The clubs and activities provide a great opportunity for kids (including me) to gte involved and help. I think it is a very fun experience as well as rewarding. Although the story is heart warming many tears are shed along the journey kids take supporting our sparrow. The sweaters and T-shirts are a nice bonus after donating money as they are very cute and let others know you support the cause.Overall my sparrow experience has been a great one and i look forward to the future years being involved in such a heart warming fundraiser.  
Sparrow Clubs USA	155237		/users/profile/206115	mtshala96	Volunteer	5	04/17/2013	I was introduced to Sparrow Clubs through student government this year and it has been a great experience! Through community service, fundraisers, and donations my school is able to help our sparrow "Baby O" who was diagnosed with cancer just before her first birthday. Our community has rallied around this lovely child and she has become a part of our family. It is eye opening to see how many people are willing to be involved.  Sparrow is a great organization with a great purpose and I'm so glad I have become involved with this program. 
Sparrow Clubs USA	154928		/users/profile/205792	ka.r.pope	Volunteer	5	04/15/2013	I am a student in Student Government at Aloha High School and we were the first in my school district to have a Sparrow.  Seeing the students in our school rally around our Sparrow and actually want to help was extremely impacting.  I was able to see the students begin to care about a child in need and become their extended family.  Sparrow has now spread to other schools in our district and everyone I meet from other schools always love it.
Sparrow Clubs USA	154853		/users/profile/205719	Kimberly40	Volunteer	5	04/15/2013	My children and I have been involved in Sparrow Clubs as volunteers for years in Portland.  It has taught my children  to give back to their community by helping others.  Sparrow Clubs has also taught my children that no matter how young you are, you can make a difference.  It is a wonderful organization that makes a huge difference to all Sparrow Children and their families.
Sparrow Clubs USA	154734		/users/profile/205577	OraliaFunez	Volunteer	5	04/14/2013	Being a part of the Sparrow Clubs USA organization has been something just wonderful. I found out about Sparrow Club when I was in Middle School but I didn't get involved much until i got into High School. Once I was a part of being involved, I realized it was so fun and just a beautiful thing to do! Not only that but seeing the whole school actually participating and getting involved in committing their time towards the sparrow child and family. It's just something rare to see the whole school be up for it. And that's what I love about the Sparrow Organization. It gets the people that you least expect to be involved in helping out someone who needs it. I Love it!
Sparrow Clubs USA	154092		/users/profile/204921	Sparrowfan	Volunteer	5	04/10/2013	The sparrow organization is absolutely fantastic. My school adopted it and we've done it for a few years now. It's amazing to see how much our school cares and how much we are united as one in service. We all work together towards one common goal to care for our sparrow. We meet our sparrow at  the sparrow assembly and everyone works really hard to pull everything together. it's great that we get to meet our sparrow because then we want to help her even more. Everyone buys the sparrow t-shirts and bracelets and donates money. A few people even raise money for sparrow through senior projects. Whats really cool is that we have the ability to turn service hours into money for our sparrow. So our whole community benefits in the service provided. This is a great program and I would reccomend it to anyone.
Sparrow Clubs USA	79272	1	/users/profile/86591	BendSparrowFan	Donor	4	02/28/2011	I first became aware of Sparrow Clubs via the Bend LaPine School District, as my child's elementary school adopted a "sparrow" and I began to hear inspirational stories about their interactive support and caring for this child and his family.  Later, the local office of my company became a corporate supporter of Sparrow, as well.  Finally, when the Sparrow Clubs launched a major fundraising campaign and solicited multi-year donor support to help ensure a more stable level of funding and help the organization provide a more predictable level of support to its "sparrows", my wife and I stepped up as inaugural members of the Sanctuary Giving Society.  I truly believe in the Sparrow Club USA's mission and the way that it empowers and helps not only the sparrows, but the young people who rally around the sparrow and their family, as well.   
Sparrow Clubs USA	68922		/users/profile/75312	tbristow	General Member of the Public	5	02/15/2011	My granddaughter became a recipient of the generosity of Sparrow Clubs. She was premature and so had a hole in my heart. They helped her and my daughter with the hospital bills and provided a wonderful Christmas for them through the company that adopted her. The assembly they held at Central Christian Schools was very professional and totally involved the children where I am the secretary. Children in Kindergarten through 12th grade were filling out their community service hours and so pleased to help their Sparrow. It is a win win situation for everyone involved. Thank you Sparrow Club!
Sparrow Clubs USA	68657		/users/profile/75019	Bebe	Client Served	5	02/15/2011	Sparrow has helped our family through a very difficult time in our lives.  We are so very grateful for all they have done.  Sparrow is such an amazing full circle charity that helps not only the families, but also the kids, businesses and communities that are involved.  It is truly a deserving charity.

Sparrow Clubs USA	67837		/users/profile/74147	maverickone	Client Served	5	02/14/2011	Attending fundraisers and contributing to the Sparrow Club in the past did not give me the insight into how important the organization was until 2010 when my son became the "sparrow" at Sisters High School.  Still reeling from the devastation the economy had made of our personal finances we learned our son had lymphoma at the start of that year. At a time when the world seemed to have turned against us, our spirits and hope was revived by the caring and compassion we received from the community,  special individuals and organizations and in particular the Sparrow Club.  The full measure of the help we received can not be adequately expressed. Surely that is the case for many of us who have been touched by these "angels".
Sparrow Clubs USA	67479		/users/profile/73757	Dina Weber	Advisor	5	02/13/2011	I have been blessed to partner with Sparrow clubs as a classroom teacher for a number of years and for the last two as our school's sparrow club advisor. Sparrow clubs provide a unique opportunity for children to develop compassion. It is rewarding to guide students through the process of identifying a need and developing a plan for serving others while earning money for a special family in need.  My Kindergarten students have adopted our school/church hallway as our service project.  Once each month the students wash the walls.  The students identified this need as our halls were "pretty messy."  The students decided if they washed the walls once each month it would help our custodian and it would make our school look nice in addition, our school is in a church so all of the people worshiping there would also have a clean hall to walk through.   I especially appreciate the vouchers.  Students fill out a voucher for each service project.  There is an area for the students to share how doing community service felt. For our youngest students we modified the voucher to include a box so the children could draw a special picture for our Sparrow friend.  One comment I recall from our most recent hall washing was, "Washing the walls was really hard.  I thought it would be fun and it was at first but then it was lots of work but it was worth it for Caroline and for everyone who walks in the halls." Sparrow clubs provide an opportunity for students to learn the value of hard work, the satisfaction of a job well done and the joy of helping others.
Sparrow Clubs USA	67207		/users/profile/73454	Pia Wennerth	Volunteer	5	02/12/2011	The Sparrow club is an amazing organization with a big heart.It helps children/young adults show compassion for other children in need and teaches  empathy that will last a lifetime. For the Sparrow child and his/her family at becomes a bridge to the community knowing that they are not alone in their struggle.
Sparrow Clubs USA	67058		/users/profile/73288	Erin Livingston	Advisor	5	02/11/2011	Sparrow Clubs has been an amazing program for my school, the students here, the family and Sparrow and our community.  It is beautiful to see high school students rally around a sick child and their family.  As an advisor, I am honored to see, firsthand how this organization touches a school, individual kids, the sick child and their family and the community that is served.  Once a Sparrow child becomes a part of your life, he or she is a part of you forever.  I love Sparrow Clubs and I love educating the heart and soul of high school students through this program.
Sparrow Clubs USA	66996		/users/profile/73227	vecaleigh	Client Served	5	02/11/2011	Sparrow Clubs USA has been a blessing in my life. I have been a member of my school's club since seventh grade, and i am now a senior in high school. Not only have i seen the amazing impact that the organization can have in others lives, I have experienced it first-hand, when i was a sparrow for my school in seventh grade. The work that the employees and volunteers of Sparrow Club is so vital, and keeps the organization running and growing. I have been blessed to have them as a part of my life, and have chosen to give back by being a member, and current leader, of the Summit High School Sparrow Club. Seeing the smiles on the faces of the Sparrow family when they know the work that we are doing, makes us want to do more. Sparrow Clubs USA is amazing.

Perhaps the sick do more for us than we could possibly offer them in return. 
Sparrow Clubs USA	66921		/users/profile/73142	Julie Hammond	Donor	4	02/11/2011	I have been involved with Sparrow since the beginning.  It is so heartwarming to see the difference that it makes in the lives of the Sparrows and their families. Just as importantly is the kids in the schools that raise the funds for their Sparrow.  It is a way for kids to get a glimpse of what a difference they can make in the life of another person.  They learn the power of not only what an individual can do but also power of their whole school working together.  It is a wonderful way to fully engage a community.
Sparrow Clubs USA	66892		/users/profile/73110	Colleen	Donor	4	02/11/2011	I have been a Donor to Sparrow Clubs over the years. It brings Businesses and Schools together to support families in need do to a medical issue. The Schools sponsor a child called a "Sparrow" and the kids in the school do community services and funds raisers to assist the family. It promotes people helping people and shows that you can make a difference in peoples lives by caring and giving.  Christmas 2010 a local business held a can food drive and called the local Sparrow office to donate the food to a family in need. I was fortunate to be in the right place at the right time and able to pick up the food from the local business and deliver it to the family. The local business was familiar with Sparrow and initiated the food drive on their own, in hopes to make a difference. The family was gracious in receiving the gift and having a good medical day.  The pantry was refilled on Christmas Eve, the mom was saved a trip to the store, the siblings were excited to see what was in the boxes, the baby having a good medical day was content to be home, to share Christmas with his family.  The spirit of Christmas was portrayed in the Giving and Gracious Receiving.  
Sparrow Clubs USA	66881		/users/profile/73098	Wendy FitzHenry	Volunteer	5	02/11/2011	I've been the advisor of Sparrow Clubs at my school for several years now. We took a few years off, and have one again this year. I had forgotten how great it makes everyone feel to be able to surround a child and family with love, blessings, prayers, and support. Despite the hard economic times, the families at my school are once again rising to the occasion and blessing our new Sparrow beyond my expectations.Sparrow is such an excellent organization, and I'm thankful that it has weathered the rough economic times. Despite working with a bare bones staff, it is still working hard to serve those children and their families.
Sparrow Clubs USA	66629		/users/profile/72825	Nancy Hanson	Client Served	5	02/11/2011	My daughter was a Sparrow 5 years ago.  By being a Sparrow, it allowed us to educate her immediate community (her class and school mates) about her medical issues to give them a better understanding about why she missed so much school and why she could not participate in many activities.  Many of the on campus Sparrow Club members stood beside her as other, less understanding children, "bullied" her as they had for so many years.  The on campus Sparrow Club stood up for my daughter and help give her a voice when she felt she did not have one.  My daughter felt she had friends for the first time in years.  Learning about my daughter's health issues allowed her class and school mates to understand that people are different and everyone has issues that may not be able to be seen - I saw acceptance of each other grow on campus. Now, 5 years later, I am proud to say that my daughter is actively involved in her high school Sparrow Club and although they may not know that she was once a Sparrow herself (she still misses much school but hides the pain she feels on a daily basis), she helps Sparrow Club members gain an understanding of patience and tolerance.  She is able to speak to the Sparrow family and help them understand why allowing their child to be a Sparrow is so beneficial to the kids on campus.  Sparrow Club is a unique organization that has a positive effect on the entire community.  Sparrow Club brings grace and dignity to those with medical issues while it teaches children that showing kindness and respect can make a big difference and help ease pain.  I have seen hearts grow and for that I will forever be grateful.  
Sparrow Clubs USA	66491		/users/profile/72674	jkendellen	Volunteer	5	02/10/2011	I served on the finance committee for Sparrow Clubs and was greatly touched by the story behind this non-profit.  This organization locates schools and businesses interested in helping local families which children in medical need. The school "adopts" a family with a child in medical need.  The business pledges money to the school.  The school children "earn" the pledged money for the family by performing a certain number of community service hours.  Once the community service hours are fulfilled, the pledged money is given to the family to help with household and medical expenses. The results of this system are amazing.  Obviously, the family gets much needed money.  But, in addition, the community as a whole benefits as do the children.  I've read some of the letters written by the school children where they talk about how raising money for this family made them feel better about themselves.  Removing the "culture of me" that is persistent in children today reduces bullying, as well. This is a great organization with a great cause.

The leaders took the worst kind of tragedy and created a vital and sustaining place and program where they offer positive and life-changing boosts to those families who are navigating the darkest hours of their lives.  Dying of cancer is not glamorous, but CCA allows families to make their memories, to help their sick kids, to hold their families together, and to ease pain (physical and mental and spiritual).  The leaders are real stewards of the resources they work with and THE MOST INNOVATIVE PEOPLE I have ever seen!  I'm not the best joiner in the world, but I love my connection to CCA.

Childrens Cancer Association	311219		/users/profile/193889	aaron.cooper	Board Member	5	10/17/2016	Over 20 years ago, Regina Ellis dared to imagine JOY in a place where it was previously never thought to be found....in a Portland Oregon hospital room, where her own daughter was battling a life threatening illness.Joy has been singing, dancing, playing, and smiling with seriously ill children in Portland Hospitals ever since and now across the country and soon around the world.  It is a scientifically proven fact that JOY can help heal.  CCA will not stop until JOY is part of the prescription for every child in physical need.  Every child deserves JOY.After being involved for many years through connections with friends and family, Regina asked if I would help make a more direct and impactful contribution.  As an Industrial Designer by education I love to develop ideas and create solutions that help make the world a better place.  I feel incredibly blessed and humbled to be a part of CCA to do what I can to help them grow into being the Brand of JOY in pediatric hospitals around the world.

What CCA does for children with serious illness and their families is both humbling and inspiring.  The world is, with out a doubt, a better place because of CCA.  i will always give my very best to CCA in hopes we help make a difference in the lives of the kids in this world who deserve a chance to grow.  My dream for CCA is for them to grow their reach across the globe, giving as many sick kids in the world the Joy CCA delivers and that they deserve.

CCA brings joy and music directly into the child's life; via the hospital room and the hallways. One of my favorite CCA programs is the ChemoPal program. An adult is matched with a seriously ill child. The adult visits the child at the hospital with a duffel bag full of toys specific to that child's interest. The ChemoPal is there to play and bring frivolity to an otherwise long and lonely stay at the hospital. I have been involved with CCA as a volunteer for 13 years. I have listened to many families tell their stories of the joy that their ChemoPal brought their child, and their family. For the child, the ChemoPal is not a parent, not a nurse with needles, and not a doctor delivering more news on the child's health. The ChemoPal is there to play, and focus on the child. Mom and Dad can step out of the room and get a break to grab a coffee, pay bills, make phone calls and just catch a breath. We have seen children continue their friendships with the ChemoPals, as well as the family. No one knows how much that relationship means, until they are stuck in the hospital. The MusicRx program is another outstanding program that uses music to provide a little joy during the trying times of a serious illness. Additionally, CCA treats its volunteers with respect, gratitude, professionalism and they provide great leadership and training for their volunteers. I am so passionate about CCA because they deliver on authenticity and huge hearts. Thank you!

Childrens Cancer Association	310711		/users/profile/402053	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/14/2016	CCA is an unbelievable and fantastic non-profit. Their goals and their mission of spreading joy to seriously ill kids and teens is a very unique approach that has an impact that cannot truly be measured. The experiences and memories that they are providing to the families allow people to just have a break from all the stress and struggle that come with fighting an illness and give them a moment to just enjoy life. They are a national leader with their JoyRx mentality that really makes them unique and different. CCA recently teamed up with Oregon State and Unitus Community Credit Union to connect families with the football team to provide the child a relationship with not only the football staff but the players as well. The opportunities that CCA gives these families is priceless. 4.Global organizations, families and individuals support CCA because this brand delivers JoyRx, impact and results.

I've never seen a more innovative, kind, & well run charity in all my years as a volunteer. From their in hospital programs to providing support for families beyond the hospital, this organization has filled a much needed gap in childhood cancer.  Talk about pioneers! They are involved with one of the first ever studies that is testing the healing power behind "music medicine". This Exponential Organization is truly expandable and has the ability to reach/help kiddos with cancer all over the world. Regina Ellis has developed an amazing leadership team that works diligently to provide much needed joy during a time when it's needed most. This organization is revolutionizing the way the world views children's hospitals.

I watch in awe the expressions, the glow of the kid's eyes and the animation of happiness when the CCA JoySquad is with an ill child.  There is no other organization opening this world to kids, I am grateful for all they do.

For children diagnosed with serious illness and their families, every moment is precious. CCAs goal is to transform as many of those moments as possible  with joy.The Childrens Cancer Association started over 20 years ago with a family who faced its own battle with serious pediatric illness in Portland, Oregon. From that experience came a passionate commitment and focus: To deliver the healing power of music, friendship, play and resources to families facing the same challenges. I am so grateful for the work that CCA does, and I am proud to serve on the Board of this impactful and extremely well run charity.  I consider the Childrens Cancer Association to be an outstanding non-profit organization.

Childrens Cancer Association	310502		/users/profile/401851	Writer	Board Member	5	10/13/2016	CCA is by far one of the most amazing organizations that you will ever come across.  Not only does CCA create joy to many seriously ill children locally where it was founded but now the joy is spreading across the entire nation to many other states.  This joy is gifted to these children and their families anywhere from bedside music while in the hospital to granting special activities and events for the children and their families to enjoy the gift of time together.  CCA is the most well respected organization for the amount of donated dollars going directly back to the programs year after year.  I wish all non-profits were as well thought of and respected as this one.  What and incredible organization!!!
Childrens Cancer Association	310499		/users/profile/401849	Writer	Board Member	5	10/13/2016	No other non-profit is as innovative and impactful as the Children's cancer Association.  Founded with the mission of bringing Joy to kids and families battling life threatening illness, their programs are deeply impactful and inspiring.  Imagine yourself in a place no one wants to be, a hospital room with a sick child, with all the associated fears and hopelessness, and then a knock on the door, and in walks a friendly face in a purple shirt, bringing smiles, music, toys and joy.  With the CCA, this happens every day, and as they continue to grow will reach more kiddos in need all across the country.

Childrens Cancer Association	310491		/users/profile/401841	Writer	Board Member	5	10/13/2016	CCA does something no other charity I know of does.  They simply create joy amongst those going through the worst time in their life.  They aren't there to find a cure...they are there to help get through the process.  Life is easier when you are happy.  For those going through these tough times,  CCA brings happiness and joy to families who probably couldn't imagine having that emotion during these times.  I love CCA and will forever support them in their mission.

CCA provides what is so essential to those struggling through difficult times - moments of joy.  CCA provides moments of joy to families and their children that are suffering from debilitating and life-threatening illnesses.  Regina, the CEO, lived through her beautiful daughter's cancer until she was taken early from our world - Regina brings so much  heart to the mission of CCA that it can't help but reach deep within and drive you to bring joy to those that are suffering.  The organization is so well organized, supported and driven to succeed that the growth I have witnessed is awe inspiring and it motivates all of us that are involved in its mission to continue to strive for further growth - to reach and bring joy to more and more children and families that are suffering - to give a moment...

Regina, her mother and the CEO, has captured our hearts with her story, and the CCA has become the place where giving my time, treasure, and talent releases something magical in my life.  And the story is so powerful, the hundreds of asks i've made to friends, co-workers and potential donors over the last 9 years i've been involved have been met with a resounding "YES!". The cause is pure, the company is run better than any i've ever experienced, and cancer remains a disease from which too many children suffer and need our help.  I wish i could give, in the words of my healthy 11 year old daughter, "infinity stars."

Childrens Cancer Association	146856		/users/profile/193874	SharronJean	Donor	5	12/17/2012	From the time the CCA was founded both my husband and I wanted to be supporters. The breadth of services and loving support to the children and families is exactly what is most healing. This is the literal HEART of care when a child is seriously ill. We have always been impressed with the innovations and expansions of helping children deal with chemo, losses, debilitations. Through bringing music, art and laughter to children these services both detract children (and parents) from the medical procedures, pain, and discomfort, and enhance the effects of such procedures. The Caring Cabin, is a marvelous offering to families needing a peaceful and joyous respite. (I write this as a retired teacher and child development therapist who specialized in chronic illness). We will always be supporters of this marvelous organization.

My son had an unexpected birthday spent in the hospital, and the CCA stepped up and contributed to ensure he had a happy one.  We spent months in the hospital and they supported us especially with their MusicRx program, with gifted music therapists who offered their amazing skills and music.  Music reaches to the soul, offering a gift of beauty to the moment.  The CCA is there, with JoyRx to give even in severe illness, in extreme moments of the loss of a child, across the gamut of the scene the CCA is there.  I've watched them stand in support of many, many families with their Life Enrichment program, their Caring Cabin, their Chemo Pal program as well as the MusicRx program.  This organization gets it - they are consistently authentic, respectful and supportive.

Childrens Cancer Association	90441		/users/profile/103151	Gwen Jarvis	Volunteer	5	06/10/2011	My daughter, Sue, has been a CCA volunteer for over 5 yrs.  4 yrs ago she suggested I volunteer at CCA as well.  So I did!  And, it has been the most rewarding thing I have done in a very long time.  I trained to be a Chemo Pal  but my husband became ill and I couldn't commit to 18 months. So I volunteered in the office most of the time. I have never been in such a caring, loving environment as CCA. All the employees individually thank each volunteer for what they are doing to help out. I recruited my son to come along and volunteer with me. We re-arranged the toy shelves, stuffed envelopes, stuffed gift bags, volunteered at the annual golf tournament for CCA in which my hubby and nephew participated. For 2 years I volunteered at the annual program hosted by CCA in Sept. in Downtown Portland. I especially enjoyed the one time my daughter and I volunteered at the Caring Cabin get-together.  Meeting the children and their families was so endearing. What a wonderful place for these families to just get away from their daily routines and just relax and enjoy themselves. My favorite happening was when my niece-in-law was at my home, started reading a CCA pamphlet showing a very sick child and talked about their families. She read it, cried, and said "I really need to do something for CCA."  And she did and she does what she can being a working mom of 2 and a wife.  Probably the most heartwarming thing, is the love, caring, and comraderie of the employees and their relationships with the volunteers. They show their appreciation and love to everyone and without their dedication and work, CCA would not be what it is today.  Thanks Regina and family for dedicating your life to the remembrance of your daughter by organizing CCA and made it what it is today, along with your employees and volunteers.  Often on Facebook I remind all my friends of the beautiful organization, love, and caring shown by your employees, patients/families, volunteers, etc. and how important it is for each of us to make a difference in our lives by helping out as volunteers.  Love you CCA!

I went to the first meeting I was instantly established as a friend and companion of all the CCA people.   They have these huge pictures of many of the kiddos on the walls of the meeting area and when I looked into thier eyes, I fell in love and just wanted to help all I could.  I believe they (CCA) have nothing more in mind and in their souls to help kids with horrible diseases.

The CCA is run by the nicest group of people you will ever meet.  They took our family in and offered us love, support and smiles during our darkest times.   Their programs are top notch and we benefited from almost all of them.  My son loved his chemopal (a volunteer who was screened, trained and assigned to him to attend his chemotherapy appointments and play with him so that I could focus on his care), the musicRx program (which is branching out nationwide), the Caring Cabin coastal retreat and bonus activities (professional hockey and basketball games, symphony tickets) and gifts (including Nike Shoes periodically for all my children). We moved away from the Portland metro area and have missed the CCA greatly.  I am hoping that someday soon they will expand and bring this wonderful organization to more families around the country.  How lucky the families in the Portland, OR metro area are to have the CCA!

While volunteering I learned that there is so much more to this company than I realized! Not only have I been educated on e-waste and ways to keep our earth healthier but I have been brought into a community of people who really care about what NextStep does and are proud to be a part of it. I am now an employee at NextStep and really have gained a "working family" as well as a job! NextStep gave me an opportunity to show them what I can do, and even prove to myself what I can do as well. Since starting as a volunteer I have been educated in e-waste, recycling, reuse options, and what other services NextStep provides to our community; I have completed enough volunteer hours to get a working knowledge of the dismantling and recycling process, and earn myself a computer of my own (built by a NextStep "techy"; I have been given the opportunity for a chance at full time employment with a growing company; and, last but not least, I have been given training and experience that will help me throughout the rest of my life in the "job world". NextStep has given me a chance to continue forward in my life, I hope that others get the chance to check this nonprofit out and see what NextStep can do for them as well!

There is nowhere to be found another place like Nextstep.My memories of my time volunteering are pleasant ones. Although the work was hard and challenging, I never met any other vocation that made me feel as happy as when in the build area refurbishing computers.I lived my dream and loved my work.

NextStep is one of a very few operations who do the work that most would not choose to do. It can be dirty, grimy work but it needs doing.

Each time we have donated the process has been very easy and their staff was both friendly and knowledgeable.Additionally, it is well known that NextStep gives back to our community in various ways.  I am so pleased that they are an important part of our community.
NextStep Recycling	26790	4	/users/profile/27806	Frederick	Client Served	5	02/01/2010	I work with youth that reside in treatment foster care.  The youth that we serve come from the juvenile justice system.  They are often deficient in social and employment skills.  NextStep has been an incredible tool for us over the last two years.  The workplace is dynamic, with an abundance of interesting opportunities for the youth we serve. We have had kids build computers, take apart computers, work in the store, paint, salvage materials, etc.  We had one youth start as a volunteer, he illustrated that he was a dedicated worker and they hired him on.  Many times I have come into the store or the warehoue to find my kids handling real responsibility, making them feel proud and accomplished.  The managers there are patient and work hard with the youth to help them be successful.  They also do a great job staying in touch with me about how my kids are doing.  They are open to giving kids another chance and often another chance after that.  I have had many meetings there to discuss a youths strengths and how best NextStep can help them attain there goals.  NextStep is an awesome, incredible resource that has improved the lives of many kids that have been in our program.
NextStep Recycling	26775	6	/users/profile/27782	rhandi	Volunteer	5	02/01/2010	I have been an intern with Nextstep and continue to benefit from my experience even though I am not actively working at this time. I learned how to greet customers with a smile even when I was uncomfortable. I was given flexibility to learn at my own pace yet encouraged to try new technology and retail tasks in the reuse store. I applied as a volunteer because I believe in basic concept of think global act local. Nextstep is the best example of helping a person discover how to give to their community while rediscovering themselves! The more I was taught to reuse and rethink the value of materials the same lessons applied to learning my persnal value.
NextStep Recycling	26767	8	/users/profile/27759	Jonah	Volunteer	5	02/01/2010	I came to volunteer at NextStep shortly after I took a tour of the facility given Lorraine Kerwood, the executive director. I was in a class of 'Master Recyclers' and the tour was a part of our course.I realized, people like Lorraine, and organizations like NextStep are what are going to help change the self-destructive path we're all on, and get the world sorted out to a point where everything WORKS, where efficiency, and sustainability save people money, and improve people's lives.
NextStep Recycling	26766	3	/users/profile/27769	Robin	Client Served	5	02/01/2010	NextStep rocks!I bought an HP printer/fax/scanner/copier there a few months back, and I'm really happy with it (and happy to get something used/keep something out of the wastestream/not contribute to something new being produced).I returned earlier this month to drop off a bunch of electronics--two laptops, copier, scanner, wifi cards, camera, calculator, etc.  So happy these items will be recycled/reused to the extent they can.  Bought a DVD/CD player on the same visit for $20.NextStep is a great and important community resource!
NextStep Recycling	26763	6	/users/profile/27768	Dick	Client Served	5	02/01/2010	Whenever we have items of electronic nature, we run over to NextStep and add them to the huge collection. Attendents are always prompt and courteous. We are in and out in a few minutes. I am very glad that we have such a fine recycling facility in our town.
NextStep Recycling	26762	4	/users/profile/27767	emmabear	Volunteer	5	02/01/2010	I volunteer at NextStep and love it. I get to talk to people about all the great things everyone does at the shop. I help out in the recycling room and I get to go to events. I like protecting our community from the bad stuff in electronics. NextStep doesn't throw anything out. If they can't fix it, it goes to a recycler a few hours away. NextStep makes sure everyone gets a chance.
NextStep Recycling	26760	3	/users/profile/27766	Cristian	Board Member	5	02/01/2010	When I was given a tour of NextStep recycling I was amazed. I was amazed because of the amount of work those great people were doing. They perform such an essential job for the community that goes unnoticed. I had no idea what NextStep was before the tour. I learned the history and also about all the great work they do beyond the borders of the United States. They provide jobs and job skill training to people that would not be given a chance at most organizations. I felt the need to get involved and I joined the Board of Directors.
NextStep Recycling	26759	3	/users/profile/27765	Mariea	Client Served	5	02/01/2010	Nextstep is an amazing contributor to our community and is doing a great job in making our world a greener place.

NextStep Recycling	26755	5	/users/profile/27761	Diani13	Client Served	4	02/01/2010	I have been visiting NextStep for little over a year now, and I simply love the people that work there and what they bring to our community. I often find myself with old or recently unneeded electronics and I bring it too them not only to avoid a fine. Or to keep it out of the garbage, but they end up using the parts! They dont just throw these things away, they reuse and help, to keep even thought to be outdated technology, alive. Oh and the people. They are so dedicated. Even though I'm sure they don't get paid nearly enough they really seem to love working there, from the recycling area, to the store, I see only dedicated workers.I found I cant help but continue to come back. I love to find new treasures there they most would only think to get rid of. I find nothing but smiling faces and helpful queries when I enter that place. I can never seem to stay away.They deserve all the praise I can give. Thank you. You not only help keep a constant cycle of new and interesting electronics running through my house, but you keep our children and our community going with open doors and open hearts.
NextStep Recycling	26751	7	/users/profile/27757	Vanessa	Client Served	5	02/01/2010	My son was the recipient of one of the recycled computers to use as part of his home program to assist with speech, language. cognitive skill acquisition and music. When my son was three year old, he had no expressive language, attending skills or ability to share information. Using the computer as a motivator and reinforcer, we discovered not only that he has an above average IQ, but also musical savant abilities. Next Step provides an invaluable resource to the Lane County Community, and gives so many of us hope in so many ways. A truly impressive business model and mission.

NextStep Recycling	26748	7	/users/profile/27754	Lorraine	General Member of the Public	5	02/01/2010	I bought a very old refurbished computer from their Reuse Store, avoiding wasting resources for a new computer.  It's worked great for 2 years after they fixed a minor problem at the beginning.  I donate metal and broken electronics monthly and their volunteers are always helpful and efficient.

This is fine, progressive organization based in Eugene that provides specialized job training opportunities in computers and electronics for low-income individuals.  NextStep provides an opportunity to upgrade job skills in a valued technical vocation as well as jobs and potential jobs in our community.  People who are part of the NextStep Recycling training program become empowered, able to provide a sustainable living and to contribute to the needs and demands of our community.Personally, I love NextStep Recycling, what it does and what it stands for.  I have been a satisfied customer who has spent hours in the store just looking.  And, I am privilaged to Lorraine, the director, as a peer and friend in the PSU Master in Social Work program.

NextStep Recycling	26745	6	/users/profile/27751	rtigger	Volunteer	5	02/01/2010	I've been a volunteer at NextStep since 2006 and enjoyed every minute of it.  Lorraine Kerwood is an inspiring presence and I've been infected by her enthusiasm.  My labors there satisfy my goal to give back to the community and reduce the tons going to the landfill.  I'm primarily a computer rebuilder, but I get many projects where I can invent solutions.  It's what I'd be doing in my garage except I get to work with many wonderful people and feel good about it.
NextStep Recycling	26744	11	/users/profile/27748	Josh	Former Volunteer	5	02/01/2010	I volunteered with NextStep's partner organization "Partners in Solidarity," which is located in Quetzaltenango, Guatemala. The organization builds computer labs in rural schools around the city, using computers provided by Next Step, and provides computer education and community organizing skills to the teachers at those schools. Though my work was not directly with Next Step, I saw first-hand the effects of their work.
NextStep Recycling	26743	4	/users/profile/27750	GracieBoo	Volunteer	5	02/01/2010	I love NextStep! They provide such a valuable service to the community and have fun doing it. Dropping off donations couldn't be easier, the staff is always friendly, plus no charge like at the landfills! The events that they do always turn out to be fun and informative. Volunteering there is a blast, so many fun people to work with. You also get discounts on computers when you volunteer for them, plus valuable job skills!
NextStep Recycling	26741	11	/users/profile/27747	Michele	Board Member	5	02/01/2010	I am a member of the board of directors and as such I see ALL of the good works of this organization.  Where do I begin? From putting people to work who would not otherwise have such an opportunity to keeping ALOT of really bad stuff out of our landfills to making technology available to those who have none, this organization is the bomb!
NextStep Recycling	26740	11	/users/profile/27745	Ken Neubeck	Client Served	5	02/01/2010	NextStep has contributed free computers for a Latino immigrant youth group, Juventud FACETA, that is overseen by a nonprofit with which I volunteer in Eugene.  This type of generosity is routine for the organization.  NextStep is also known throughout the area for its extensive recycling services, keeping toxic substances out of our landfills, which contributes immeasurably to the preservation of our environment.  NextStep is committed to protecting our human rights to life and health.  A key part of their program involves providing training and employment to those most in need in our community, and they do a wonderful job at this!  I am so pleased to be able to write in support of NextStep!!!
NextStep Recycling	26739	7	/users/profile/27744	Elaine	Board Member	5	02/01/2010	As a graduate student, I was given the opportunity to learn about being on a board by taking advantage of the opportunity NextStep offered to students.  After I finished my training position, I was so excited about our mission that I stayed on.  As a board member, I have worked side-by-side with job trainees and volunteers deconstructing electronics and sorting them for recycling. The people I worked with were excited to be learning about technology, and the importance of recycling.  They were also proud of contributing a solution to the problems of waste and pollution.  NextStep makes an amazing difference in people's lives economically, by raising consciousness and through lowering our carbon footprint.
NextStep Recycling	26737	8	/users/profile/27741	Erin	Client Served	5	02/01/2010	This is the best place in town for recycling your electronics.  They actively educate the community and reach out to make sure the information is there for people like me who want to do the right thing for our community and for the environment.The people who work and run the organization are extremely committed to their cause and they go the extra mile to be helpful.
NextStep Recycling	26734	10	/users/profile/27740	lilprintbigmessage	General Member of the Public	4	02/01/2010	I have met two employees at NextStep, including one that is participating in an internship at NextStep. The skills he received have truly been outstanding. The intern volunteered with a nonprofit that I work with and helped us to "wire-up" a benefit concert for the people of Haiti. He truly excelled in the role, and openly accredited the folks at NextStep for helping increase his skills and training. In my mind NextStep is providing this young intern with a key to a great professional future, something they do routinely in my community. I strongly recommend NextStep recycling, the people there are both inspiring and committed.
NextStep Recycling	26733	7	/users/profile/27738	Tina	Volunteer	5	02/01/2010	It's so great to have a place where I know my electronics will get a new lease on life or will at least be disposed of responsibly.  The volunteers are knowledgeable and passionate about their work; the staff is, too.And I love shopping there, too -- I can get items which will fulfill my need without breaking the bank and without filling up the landfill!
NextStep Recycling	26729	6	/users/profile/27735	klindquist	General Member of the Public	5	02/01/2010	I first heard about NextStep when they were collecting styrofoam after the holidays. After that first experience I found out just how much NextStep does. From providing a place where the community can recycle electronics and computers (which us Eugeneians are always looking for ways to recycle), to retrofitting old devices and reselling them. NextStep to a boon to our community. Such a simple and well executed idea.
NextStep Recycling	26728	6	/users/profile/27734	Dvendley	Board Member	5	02/01/2010	NextStep Recycling has positively impacted our community and even communities abroad, with their tireless work at keeping e-waste out of our landfills, refurbishing and then gifting technology to our children (who otherwise would not have access to this critical tool) and providing jobs and skills training to people once thought "unemployable". With Lorraine Kerwood at the helm, NextStep continues to be an amazing and vital organization in our community.
NextStep Recycling	26726	6	/users/profile/27732	xcs	Volunteer	5	02/01/2010	I have been volunteering for NextStep since 2003 and have watched it grow into a dynamic organization that uses the best skills of everyone who volunteers and works there. Many people of all skill and needs have been given work skills training and encouragement there. They also give computers to those who can't afford them to help them bridge the digital divide and become an integral part of the community. I don't have anything but praise for their people and their programs.
NextStep Recycling	26725	7	/users/profile/27731	OregonWoman	Volunteer	5	02/01/2010	As a Board member I have seenNextStep Recycling expand tremendously in the last several years. This organization, which receives donations of obsolete electronics, including computer hardware, (desktop computers, laptops, handheld games, cell phones, etc), household electronics (clocks, radios, lamps, etc), white (microwaves, stoves, dryers, etc.) and brown (stereos, VCRs, DVD players, etc.); also has a great training program.  Volunteers in the recycling warehouse receive education on the inner workings of computers and other electronic hardware as they participate in the dismantling program. Volunteers can also learn how to rebuild computers in the refurbishing program. After a certain period of training, volunteers receive a computer to complete their education process. NextStep gifts computers directly to: children and adults living in foster care, persons experiencing disabilities, family members leaving domestically violent relationships, migrant worker families, under-funded schools and nonprofits.
NextStep Recycling	26724	11	/users/profile/27730	WillieFan	Volunteer	5	02/01/2010	I participated in the job training program. I learned how to refurbish computers, test printers, and identify a variety of electronics hardware. I learned alot. All the staff are super friendly and respectful. I liked the training so much I am still volunteering.
NextStep Recycling	26723	8	/users/profile/27729	Deja	Donor	4	02/01/2010	I love NextStep. As a former employee of Goodwill I used to be appalled at the amount of T.V's  and other electronics that would go in the trash. NextStep provides a valuable resource to the community and our planet!Not only have I donated several car loads of electronics and monitors, but also bought a computer there over a year ago and it is still working great!!
NextStep Recycling	26722	10	/users/profile/27728	TechMom236	General Member of the Public	5	02/01/2010	Three things I love about NextStep Recycling:1. I can recycle "anything with a plug," out dated electronics, working or not. Keeping these out of a landfill is a good thing.2. I can find parts and even complete computer systems very cheaply. Why pay $15 for a simple power adapter when I can get one for $3 from NextStep.3. If you need a computer and can't afford one, you can volunteer there and earn one. Not only do you get a computer, you learn a lot about how they work.

Something getting ever harder to do as our society devalues medical research. We will all pay the price in the long run if we stop funding independent research. They are already doing great things, but are on the cusp of exploding on the crowd funding scene. Spread the word!
Consano	221862		/users/profile/285556	Jennifer387	General Member of the Public	5	10/10/2014	Consano not only brings awareness to the public but allows those who are choosing to make a difference, through donations, know and decide exactly where you would like your donations to be focused.

Consano	221434	1	/users/profile/285125	Julian5	Donor	5	10/09/2014	Donating was the easy part.  Consano's site is clear, easy to navigate and informative.  The difficult part on any 'giving site' is to feel comfortable sharing your 'story'.  Consano encouraged me to share my personal thoughts on how I have been able to cope with my cancers. I commend Molly Lindquist for her ability to drive this very important and innovative crowd funding platform.
Consano	221423		/users/profile/285117	Michelle261	General Member of the Public	5	10/09/2014	Consano was started by a fellow sister survivor of  mine that also had breast cancer.

Something that is sorely missing in many other non-profits. Consano is a genuine and worthy vehicle to drive your donation to where you want.  I don't know of a more passionate and compassionate group of people.  
Consano	221167		/users/profile/284878	Sarah141	Donor	5	10/09/2014	I am happy to donate to this groundbreaking organization.

Consano	183421		/users/profile/240334	jolifson	Donor	5	10/28/2013	What an amazing idea for a nonprofit. It's so great that I can donate to a specific research project and know exactly where my money is going, and that I can then get updates from the researchers on the projects I'm interested in. It makes me feel personally connected to the project, and I love that.
Consano	182622		/users/profile/239492	JennyV	Donor	5	10/26/2013	Consano makes it so easy to donate to medical research. Donors know exactly where their money is going.  If you're like me and wonder how, with so many talented and dedicated people in this world, that terrible and heart-breaking diseases still persist, Consano brings the heroes to light, and gives us all hope and confidence that there will be cures one day. I believe with Consano it will happen faster.

Consano	182250		/users/profile/239019	Carol124	Volunteer	5	10/24/2013	I have never shared my story before Consano.  I am so grateful for the ability to designate my donation to a research project I believe in!   Type one Diabetes can be cured.  Read my blog on Consano.   Thank you!
Consano	182238		/users/profile/239006	Sylviad	Donor	5	10/24/2013	This Organization  has provided  hope for many who are working so hard to find a way to save many from  their  suffering.  Cancer rears up in so many parts of the body and each need a special treatment..The trick is that someone has to put years into searching  for that cure. Consano had the vision  to find a source to help those researchers.Good going.
Consano	182208		/users/profile/238973	pm52	Donor	5	10/24/2013	What could be better than an organization that allows people like me to help fund ground breaking research that will eventually lead to reductions in cancers?  Founded by a family directly impacted by breast cancer, Consano is the ultimate give-back for a second chance at life.  And it allows those of us who are not wealthy, but have also been affected by cancer, to have a direct shot at helping others.
Consano	182181		/users/profile/238947	caze17	Donor	5	10/24/2013	Great organization that funnels for your donation dollars directly to medical research projects. I like that the projects are vetted by experts, and that the money is going straight to the projects. The updates from the researchers are great too; they help you understand how your dollars are making an impact.
Consano	182141		/users/profile/238905	JennP	Donor	5	10/24/2013	Consano is a fantastic way for individuals to donate directly to medical researchers. The project descriptions let you know what disease(s) are being targeted and what, specifically, the money being raised will go towards. You can find researchers studying those conditions that you are passionate about for personal reasons, or learn about new ones that are just as worth of your investment. The projects are updated and added to frequently. On Consano's website, you can also see stories from people whose lives have been touched by many of the illnesses being studied. It's inspiring, heartwarming, and bittersweet. When I donated recently, I even received a very rapid thank you directly from one of the labs I supported, and the PI offered an avenue for donors to directly contact them through email about research. As a researcher in the natural (nonmedical) sciences, that kind of connection is amazing! Finally, funding for scientific research has rapidly dwindled in our current economic climate, and thinking about the setbacks this could cause for medical progress is frustrating and frightening. Consano offers you a way to do something about that as well. Support loved ones facing health challenges, support science research, support medical progress! 
Consano	182058		/users/profile/238814	ScottMD	Board Member	5	10/24/2013	Consano provides an easy way for individuals to direct their donation to specific medical research projects that matter to them, giving donors the ultimate in transparency -- 100% of each project donation goes directly to support research and connection -- donors receive quarterly updates from the researcher throughout the life of the project. And I know that every research project is high quality and important because each project is vetted by Consano's 28 member volunteer Scientific Advisory Board. There is no question that Consano makes complex medical science accessible, relatable, and understandable to the public, giving all of us the opportunity to work together to advance medical progress.
Consano	181955		/users/profile/238708	KaraL	Volunteer	5	10/24/2013	I have been volunteering for Consano since its inception.  Consano is extremely transparent and uncomplicated.  Individuals can browse the site to view the various research projects listed for a variety of illnesses.  Anyone can donate any amount to the project that resonates with them, and then receive on-going updates about the project directly from the researcher.  100% of all donations go directly to the project chosen (minus a minimal fee PayPal takes to process the transaction), so there is no question what your money has funded.  I think it's amazing that Consano doesn't take one cent from the donations made to projects...their overhead is funded by completely separate donations.  I am so proud to be a volunteer for this organization!
Consano	181952		/users/profile/238705	KatieL	Board Member	5	10/24/2013	Medical research is vitally important.  It's provided us with treatments for conditions that used to devastate us, and provides us with constant hope of finding treatments for new conditions.  It's also complicated, disbursed among institutions across the country, and difficult for regular people to even know about, let alone access.  Consano solves each of these issues.  It finds medical research projects dealing with a variety of conditions, has a Scientific Advisory Board that reviews projects to ensure they're scientifically sound, and enables you to donate directly to those researchers.  It's a brilliantly simple model that empowers anyone who wishes to donate directly to a project that matters to them.  
Consano	181841		/users/profile/238591	Janelle T.	General Member of the Public	5	10/23/2013	This is the only way to donate money to the organizations you believe in because the money goes directly towards the cause you want to help!  You can browse through the list of projects and then easily donate to the one that relates to you!
Consano	181748		/users/profile/238474	Kitzisa	Donor	5	10/23/2013	This is a great company that puts the money that is donated directly to the researchers that are working on treatments and cures for various diseases.  You pick the research project  that interests you, get to know a bit about the researcher involved and know that your money is going directly to the project. You can receive updates if you wish about the project. I have donated to projects ranging from pediatric cancers, lung transplant research and pediatric diabetes.  I have donated in memory of friends and family and their families have appreciated the gift.   It is a wonderful company, easy to use website and I highly recommend it

Self Enhancement, Inc.	140965		/users/profile/187186	action5	Client Served	5	11/18/2012	There are moments in life when the combination of relationships, concepts and processes come together to significantly impact personal lives.  SEI was that for me!  In light of what I received as a young SEI participant 30 years ago, I was ecstatic to be in a position to contribute, organizationally, as a Board Member.  Thus, I have witnessed both sides of this life-changing non-profit.  SEI is a lifestyle.  I felt loved right away and because of that reality, love became embedded into another part of my world.  The relationship foundation captivated my attention and was solidified with being taught life concepts well beyond what attracted me there (basketball).  Due to the evolution of the SEI brand, reach and effective tools over time, the mission is now all-inclusive and comprehensive so youth and their families benefit greatly.  The culture provides a road map to WIN, but since the staff cares so much about you, they stay connected with you to ensure you realize your full potential through young adulthood.     
Self Enhancement, Inc.	132579		/users/profile/178227	Tricia503	General Member of the Public	5	11/02/2012	I went to their fundraiser last year - as a community member who has worked with Tony Hopson on the Portland African American Leadership Forum.  I had always heard great things - but never seen them as up close as this.  They are doing a great job instilling a love of learning and a zest for life into their kids.  And most amazing is the mutual love and respect between the children and all the adults who work there.
Self Enhancement, Inc.	132074		/users/profile/177672	Greg21	Donor	5	11/01/2012	Problem - Portland public schools graduate just 59% of their students. This isnt even close to the worst in the nation. The national average is better, but still pathetic.  Its worse for minorities. Studies have shown that only 25 to 40% of African American students meet basic reading, writing and math standards in the 10th grade.  Outcomes for so called at risk kids are worse still. Just consider some of the long term consequences of this reality. More importantly, imagine the positive social and economic impacts of dramatically turning this around in every community across the nation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Solution - For more than 25 years, SEI has been supporting kids in Portland Public Schools. Each year, they work with approximately 1,000 young adults. They start working with kids at age 8 and support them through age 25. Over 90% of SEI kids are minorities, and 90% are at risk.For many kids, SEI is where they go for inspiration and unconditional support. SEI builds self-respect and develops positive attitudes and life skills that result in success in and beyond the classroom.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Amazing results - For the past decade, the average graduation rate for SEI kids is 98%! Its been 100% for the past three years.  85% of SEI kids go on to college or other post-secondary education. Many of these kids are the first in their family to do so.  SEI is simply phenomenal at creating resilient young adults. Please check them out. Their founder, team, kids, and results are simply awe inspiring.
Self Enhancement, Inc.	131477		/users/profile/177035	sandylou29	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/30/2012	 I am a retired School Psychologist and Licensed Clinical Psychologist who worked in the Portland Public Schools for over 25 years. I first met Tony Hopson when he was a high school counselor and respected the work he did with the students. When he created Self-Enhancement, I was very pleased and excited about the possibilities. I became a donor and a fan of the work. When I was completing my doctoral dissertation on the topic of "Girls in Gangs" I was able to make arrangements to evaluate and interview a number of young women attending the Self-Enhancement summer program. The information I was able to gather made a significant contribution to the  field of research about adolescent women. In addition, I was happy to learn that the Self-Enhancement program was working as a great deterrent to future gang involvement and other-at-risk behaviors. I especially value the mentoring and community support that is provided to the young people of Portland by Self-Enhancement.  The youth who have benefited from this wonderful resource continue to give back to the community and to the young people following in their footsteps. I believe that Self-Enhancement is a perfect example of what happens when a great idea arises from within a community and is given support and nourishment to become a well-respected institution that meets a huge need.

SEI makes that a reality and the proof is documented by the past and present recipients of SEI leadership.  As a young man who grew up in North Portland and knew the consequences of negative youth distractions, I personally looked to leadership groups in the community for guidance.  SEI has proven to me a valid investment in a community that needs solutions.

SEI supported them through high school and played a significant role in the graduation from college. SEI assisted me with airfare during the holiday and summer breaks; provided funds for books and other college fees.  The organization has played a very important role in my family and I don't know what I would have done without the assistance from Pamphlin Program. Each year I dedicate my United Way contributions at my full time and part time jobs to SEI. It's the least I can do!

SEI has been in my  family life seence  my daughter's 1 grade end, (2002) seen the start of summer progrom.  Over the years Millie has got help in their after school program. In the after school  program they help kids with their homework & they feed the after noon meal/ snack. They give them mentors  & give them wonderful activities after school. In the summer they run summer school/actives. The kids in the summer get to do fun actives, they put kids on teams with tee-shirts, when the kids line up you see a rainbow of kids each color of the rainbow is a team. The kids learn to work as a team member & that kids from different schools can be friends & not rival gang members. The SEI try's to teach the SEI Standards are founded upon the principles of Integrity & Respect of each other & are self.  As a parent I have taken parenting classes & a parent support group. I have taken the domestic violence course & I have been given the opportunity to learn new healthy life skills. I have been able to learn The SEI Preamble & The SEI Standards also. Plus Learn the right way to be a Phenomenal Women & mother, independent women in to day world. By having a positive women role model from the older women  (Primcella Smith & Ellon Manly & Mrs Wells & Charlotte Mitchell-Reese) in the SEI programs. SEI is like having a village raising are children. As a family we have gotten water services and energy assistance to pay are family electric bill. We have been able to get holiday assistance such as food boxes and gifts for the holiday's. My daughter went to SEI Academy for her middle school  Grades 6th, 7th, & 8th. Even through family separations SEI has been a rock hard foundation for support for our family.  Even though we have had a few set backs with each other, as a single parent home. We still have had SEI family supporting both our needs as a whole family. Make a safe place for my daughter while she   & I to work throw  are independent needs. As a family we have had to put are problems a side to help other family's from the SEI families village ( we choose  as a family to go to funerals ).  As she going throw the teenage years, she has been living in a 3 party home. My hope that she will grow up to be the most Phenomenal Women she deserve to be with help from The SEI Program. Thank You!! All

A few weeks later she contacted me with a new program where the agency she worked with would help me with 6 months of partial payment for rental assistance. It made me feel like someone actually cared. I know she had me on her mind, and that when this opportunity came up she offered it to me. I can say with 100% centainty, that if I had not had that asistance, my 16 year old son and I would have been homeless.  I was waiting to hear from disability and had $440 of income a month with $860 rent due. Margot was there to encourage me mentally and to let me know there was someone out there who did care about me and my son's well being.  I have a growth on my brain that was causing severe headaches and depresion at the time. I can not thank Margot enough for the help her and her agency has given me.

For the last 10 years before my retirement, ( 1993-2003),  I directed a one-week music camp "Let Music Be the Food of Peace" at PSU for 30 children (ages 8-10) from SEi.   This was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life.  The people at SEI were wonderful to work with and the staff members were always present for me. They were  enthusiastic, helpful, communicative and supportive. And not to mention the best part - the children. Such a joy to be with respectful, creative,  and definitely "individual" kids.  I learned a great deal from them!  The camp alwaysended with a concert performed by the children  and their college student mentors showing what they had all learned throughout the week.   At the final concert  in 2003,  there was standing room only!   The relationships made during that time continue to live on.  For example, the piano scholarship winner from the 2003 camp, who is now a Junior at OSU will be visiting with me next week.  Thank you SEI for all that you do for our community!

Self Enhancement, Inc.	116255		/users/profile/158271	burk	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/22/2012	I have had the opportunity to experience the transformative nature of the Self Enhancement, Inc., philosophy over many years from different perspectives.  First, as a middle school principal my school was one of the first schools to become involved with SEI in the early years.  What was different from the very beginning was an approach that was not about delivering services to "clients," but a clear focus on establishing a personal commitment to individual students coupled with presenting them with a code of beliefs and values that were lived daily by the entire organization.  It created a culture of achievement and communicated to students that expectations were high, but personal commitment to their success was steadfast.  From the beginning SEI created a unique culture that has continued throughout its organizational life.  Later, in my role as a central office administrator, I had the opportunity to witness the role of SEI as community partner and advocate.  SEI had established itself as a voice for the needs of the community, especially students, and came from a position of strength by being open about results achieved, sharing services and resources as a community partner and creating a solid, efficient and effective organizational presence that literally changed the neighborhood.  In my more recent roles of state level administrator and of university faculty member, I continue to see the role of SEI advocating for change but stepping up to be a part of the solution.  In the most recent round of state school reform initiatives, SEI correctly identified the lack of opportunity for communities of color to participate in public input sessions because opportunities for such participation had not been developed by state policy makers.  SEI stepped in to, not only, advocate for the opportunity to provide input, but also, to put their facilities and direct support on the line for this opportunity to happen.  These efforts provided significant and important changes to new state school governance and accountability measures to require more use of disaggregatred data in school performance measures.  SEI has a long, positive record of success with students, serving the community and influencing key policy questions.  It is an outstanding organization.

I had to go into the hospital for emergency surgery and i had only received 60 percen tof my earnings from my job at this time I needed help with my rent SEI stepped in and helped me out. This organization is so amazing, not only do they help the childern in the community but they help their families. I am so blessed to have this organization in my corner, not just for a mentor for my child , but as a liasion to the childern in the community. it takes a village to raise a child and that is what SEI is doing helping the community raise our childern of the future.
Self Enhancement, Inc.	116238		/users/profile/158252	Rebekah6	Donor	4	06/22/2012	SEI, Inc makes a real difference in the lives of young Americans. These are children that otherwise may be left behind. The kids learn to be valuable members of society and will pass that on to other children.

Self Enhancement, Inc.	116229		/users/profile/158244	samantha.lee3	General Member of the Public	5	06/22/2012	We worked with SEI for a service project, bringing out PCC volunteers to serve alongside the SEI Academy students. It was a wonderful experience working with Jackie Meyer and the enthusiastic students to beautify the center grounds. It was clear that the students were well supported by SEI, and it was wonderful for our own students and staff to work alongside them to benefit the neighborhood. SEI is also pivotal in the Middle College program at Jefferson, which has a strong connection to PCC as the students receive college credit for high school courses.

Dogs for the Deaf Inc	237632	9	/users/profile/322415	AnimalLove	Professional with expertise in this field	1	02/05/2015	I see that the reviews here are pretty old.  There is no doubt that the dogs placed by DFD make a wonderful difference in people's lives.  But the sad truth is that DFD is a struggling organization with many problems and a lack of leadership is making the problems worse.   As I write this in January 2015, DFD has only placed 2 dogs in the last seven months.  And yet they have an annual operating budget in excess of $2million.  What are they doing with that money?  They're certainly not rescuing, training and placing dogs!  But they do own TWO country club memberships for the enjoyment of their management team.  They hired a new CEO who is making more than $100K per year, and yet is inexperienced, does not understand nonprofits, and has managed to lose almost half the DFD staff - including nearly all of their dog trainers - since he took the reins.  DFD is dishonest with donors about how money is being used -- their administrative and fundraising expenses are MUCH higher than they claim.  They use very creative accounting to keep the number artificially low.  Read their 990 carefully and you can see that.   And finally, although DFD was founded to rescue animals from shelters and train them to be hearing dogs, they have now decided -- at the urging of their new CEO - to start a breeding program.  If you're interested in animal welfare, this should make you angry.  Rather than reduce the numbers of dogs in shelters, DFD will now start contributing to the problem by producing puppies - many of which will not pass the training programs and will be discarded.  They will rescue even fewer dogs than they do now.  To me, all of this speaks to an organization that is falling apart.  I don't support them philosophically anymore, and I sure wouldn't give my money to them.

It is the oldest and largest training center for hearing dogs in the United States.These dogs are rescued from shelters, given special training and then placed free of charge with deaf people nationwide and in Canada and Puerto Rico.Dogs For the Deaf receives NO Government funding. Donations from individuals, service clubs, businesses and foundations enable this special work to continue providing the priceless gifts of love, freedom, independence and life itself.Dogs unable to successfully become a certified hearing dog are adopted out to loving homes and are never returned to a shelter.

Dogs for the Deaf Inc	50701	4	/users/profile/51244	jen20	Client Served	5	08/19/2010	Three years ago, I was blessed enough to receive one of Dogs For the Deaf's highly trained Hearing Dogs.  Since Hattie has come into my life the possibilities of my life are endless. Before Hattie came into my life, I walked through my home filled with fear and dread due to the sounds I was missing in my daily life.  The severe to profound hearing loss I have does not allow me to hear the sounds in life that make everyday living a simple pleasure.  I would lay awake at night consumed with fear that I would not hear the smoke detector if it were to alert me to any impending danger.  I burnt many meals because I did not hear the oven timer, company rarely was greeted at the door because I failed to hear them knock. I would walk through my home with the telephone in hand with the hopes I would hear it ring if someone were to call. Now, I am no longer filled with dread and fear, thanks to Dogs for the Deaf.  I often say the day Hattie was placed with me was the day my life truly began.Without Dogs for the Deaf training and placing Hearing Dogs for those of us with hearing loss the independence and peace of mind I currently posess would not be possible. By training and placing Hearing Dogs with individuals like myself, they enable us to take a disability and change it into infinite possibilities.  I can sleep a peaceful nights sleep, I can eat a well cooked meal and I now know when family and friends stop by to visit.  Hattie has transformed my life in ways I never knew was possible.There are truly no words to describe what an exceptional organization Dogs for the Deaf truly is and there are no words to describe what they have given to my life.
Dogs for the Deaf Inc	50698	4	/users/profile/51235	nancy-plasman-otte	Client Served	5	08/19/2010	Eleven years ago, Dogs for the Deaf graciously matched me with a certified hearing dog, my first, when I was 52 years old and had been severely hearing-impaired all my life.  Although educated with a master's degree and having taught deaf and hard-of-hearing children for many years, living life independently and well (I thought), my angel dog Harley has changed my life to the point of giving me independence and quality of life I never dreamed existed.  After spending all my time listening for sounds, Harley took over the work of listening so that I can spend time in thought, or reading for pleasure, or relaxing in nonthought or nonaction.  I am able to relax, be more effective in my life, be a better teacher, and a happier person as a result of Harley's help both when there is a sound and when there isn't.  Dogs for the Deaf's staff is gifted in the work of training, matching, and placing.  No one except a recipient, close friend, or family member can fully appreciate the value of a hearing dog that is well-trained and well-matched.  My husband of 40 years wishes we had always had a hearing dog because his life is so much easier and my life is considerably better with the dog than it was without.  Dogs for the Deaf, I will never have enough right words to thank you for the difference you and Harley have made in our lives.
Dogs for the Deaf Inc	50689	4	/users/profile/51223	kathy31	Donor	5	08/19/2010	All that I can say is that, I know for a fact, Dogs For The Deaf has made a significant difference in the life of one of my special friends. She struggled her entire life with a hearing impairment, always being misunderstood, because her meniere's disease was not something that very many people had ever heard of, much less knew how to deal with. It wasn't until she & Hattie were united, that she is now able to live a full life, free of all of the fears that she once had. Thank you, Dogs For The Deaf, for making it possible for Jen & Hattie to become an awesome team.

All display great concern, care and dignity in providing for their fallen comrades. The group strives to find all those abandon on shelves or forgotten in unmarked graves. It is definitely 'the right thing to do.'

Missing In America-Veteransrecovery Program	33133	1	/users/profile/33955	eddie1	General Member of the Public	5	03/13/2010	My first experience with the missing in America project was meeting Rick Prioetti and he was telling about the starting up of the project, next thing I heard about was the honor to Arlington project which was totally overwhelling to me to think about all the work that went into getting this project together.I got more information and details on the Honors to Arlington through a Channel 7 news story my own Son did on the MIAP. Then we meet again at a Viet Nam Veterans of America State Council meeting in Fresno where Fred Salanti did a presentation on MIAP, listening to Fred and the passion in his voice about the project locked me in as a supporter and I encourage my V.V.A. chapter to support them with some funds.Being able to follow the ride to Arlington by internet was a genius idea and gathered more supporters along the way. What we are most proud and supportive of is the MIAP is a National project started in our own backyard Shata County.My next experience with MIAP was our chapters planning to celebrate The Welcome Home Vietnam Veterans Day Celebration on Sat. March 27.The idea came up to do a Motorcade from the Vets hall to the Igo Vets Cemetery. I knew exactly who to contact...MIAP. I got in contact with Rick P and he talked to Fred and they did what I wished and expected them to do,they took the motorcade over as a MIAP project and that is one thing about the celebration we did not have to worry about, It was done! They have been to every planning meeting actually a few more than myself. MIAP is an asset to the County, Community and Veterans Community.Thank you M.I.A.P.Eddie McAllisterVietnam Veterans of America Chapter 357President530-524-7504
Missing In America-Veteransrecovery Program	33002	1	/users/profile/33832	roadrunner	Volunteer	5	03/11/2010	I am not sure when I first became a supporter of the MIAP/Missing in America Project.  But as time passes so quickly for me these days, I would probably be safe in saying it has been about 2 years.  I know I became involved in the early days because I saw what they were doing as no less important than the soldier down on the field of battle, alive or dead, being dragged and carried back to his own line, by another, who lived/lives by the credo no man left behind.  As hard as they try, some are still left behind and become what we call MIAs.Those veterans, who return home from active duty, often come home with scars left from the battle.  They sometimes drop out from productive life as those of us more fortunate, call it.  And when they pass, often become the MIAs in America.  For whatever reason, they lie, unclaimed by anyone, on mortuary shelves in containers; some for many years.In my association with the MIAP, I have been honored to help many times, in the laying to rest of these MIAs.  They were lost, but not forgotten by the MIAP.May of 2009, The MIAP took three very highly decorated, veterans remains to Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia.  We took them from Redding CA, then Sacramento, CA, to be placed in their proper resting places of honor.  We escorted them in a motorcycle procession, with pride in the knowledge we were giving them the proper honors.No one in this organization takes any profit, we all give gladly of our time and resources to make this happen.The MIAP has become nationally recognized, and continues to locate veterans in need of family to give them their final honors.  I hope people across this nation can help in this endeavor.Bert SteadMIAP Escort RiderRedding, CA
Missing In America-Veteransrecovery Program	32863	1	/users/profile/33688	larissakgb	Volunteer	5	03/10/2010	The experience was unforgettable, amazing and unique in many ways! Eric and I, the photographers and medical support for the troops, we enjoyed the trip, created bond with the veterans and learned this group of people on very deep emotional level, how much they need each other, to share the memories, the feelings they have been hiding for years and their vast experience. We have gained unmeasurable knowledge about our past from first hand, we looked into their soles, we shared the pain and joy with them along the way.  It was a rare opportunity for us and we thank you, Fred Salanti, MIAP for that! Read our book "Honors at Arlington" at blurb.comLarissa Browning and Eric Matchko

Here in Colorado when the funeral homes were approached, they wouldn't even talk to us because of how the law was written. Even though the law stated "that the remains could only be released to a responsible party", the attorneys interpreted that to mean "only a family member". I had met and talked to Representative Don Marostica before, and approached him about getting the law changed. He was very helpful in getting this accomplished. About one year later the law was signed by Governor Ritter and took effect immediately. It now states "that the remains can be released to any Veterans organization", which we believe should be Ft. Logan. We have been trying for about one year now to get the funeral homes cooperation, but their lawyers are dragging their feet looking at it to make sure that they wouldn't be held liable in case of a law suit. We meet with the owner of one of the largest funeral Holmes here in Denver this week end to see if we can't get going on this. Hopefully the first time we can do an escort, and get some press coverage to help get the word out about MIAP. We have a scheduled service the second Saturday of each month that covers all of the unclaimed remains that come into Ft. Logan each month, so after the initial escort, and hopefully press coverage, these unclaimed remains will start to come in each month and be covered by this service, so they all get the Honors that they so much deserve. It's been slow but hopefully all of our efforts will pay off soon.

Thanks to the information supplied by the Missing in America Project, we were able to provide the honors due this veteran and give him a final resting place respectful of his service.

He is a remarkable man and the MIAP program he has started has been much needed. He has taken it upon himself to correct a long negelected problem. Hero's have been left languishing on shelves in mortuarys across America. Fred has made it his main focus to see that these men and women are buried with respect and honor. Some have been Metal Of Honor winners, the highest honor this nation can bestow upon a person.  Every veteran Fred and his hepers find are buried with honor and treated with the respect they deserve. God Bless the MIAP!

I did not know the soldiers that were laid to rest that day and felt honored to attend such a beautiful service. The men and women of our military fight willingly for our freedom and should never be forgotten.

I asked what I could do and was sort of given an area to check funeral homes for stored cremains.  After that I got involved in their escorts of veterans from funeral homes to the Veterans Cemetery in Igo.  I also participated in the "Honors at Arlington" mission.

Missing In America-Veteransrecovery Program	32657	6	/users/profile/33480	tail-gunner	Volunteer	5	03/07/2010	It was with great honor and humility to have participated in two MIAP escorts.  The first was the "Honors at Arlington" escort.  We picked up the escort in Carlin, NV on May 21, 2009 and escorted them to Elko, NV.  Our association held a ceremony and BBQ for the mission, then on  Friday, May 22, we escorted the group to the NV-UT state line.  The second escort, on August 28, 2009, was performed by our association with the assistance of the MIAP.  This was Nevada's first escort and involved escorting the remains of five veterans from Elko, NV to Fernley, NV.  As a patriot, being surrounded by so many veterans and other patriots while performing such a noble mission cannot be accurately described in words.  I have never been prouder!

To this day so many still haven't heard or did not pay attention to any of the information about this Tragedy.I like to think that WE all have been raised better than to let this to carry on.  Every Volunteer from the Cemetery staff that do so much to accommodate us, to the Last Guard preparing to ride Off like a lone horse soldieras soon as the tears clear from his eyes, Have their Hearts and sense of Honor abiding in the appropriate order, Sense of Honor , Duty , Respect , Family, Justice, Volunteerism,Sacrifice and Love for a Brother or Sister who for whatever sad reason have left their Mortal Remains and no one has seen fit to Honor their sacrifice, This cannot continue !!! and yet every day a veteran dies and is put on a shelf with the others.  We Need Money to Pay for the remains, Its just that simple, we can volunteer our time as well as money.   From what I have seen none of us appears to be wealthy and thats why we need donations

I first learned of MIAP about 1 1/2 years ago. Until that time I was totally unaware of the forgotten heros awaiting proper final honors and arrangements. I am now attending the honors ceremonies every other month at N.

This MIAP gives honors to those veterans whom were never remembered, mostly were foresaken and lost because knowone cared that they even existed.  I encourage each American to get involved either by participating and paying your respects for these veterans in a ceremony or just giving support in anyway you can.  Thank you MIAP members for doing Gods works.My family salutes you all and is forever grateful for how just one person can make a difference, one organization can make a difference, and that is Major Fred Salanti the Founder of the MIAP.

MIAP provides an invaluable service bringing abandoned remains to their final resting place. Without the intervention of MIAP these servicemembers would likely remain unnamed and abandoned on back room shelves and in sheds across the county. Their services are well planned and supported by the community, they reflect great honor and respect upon the Warriors being interred.

The hours that are spent finding, processing and burying these forgotten American Heroes is staggering. The time and effort spent discussing and getting laws passed to support the MIAP's mission and get the Veterans their deserving end is overwhelming at times. The staff of the MIAP needs all the financial help and support they can get.

At the same time there is a lot of work that needs to be done before we can bury the Veterans and a lot of it is political with lots of trips to the politicians in order to get laws that allows us to bury the Veterans.Just think how many Veterans wouldnt have had there due if not for the MIAP and how many wont get it if we dont continue our work??

Missing In America-Veteransrecovery Program	32609	5	/users/profile/33433	markboehle1	Volunteer	5	03/06/2010	I have been involved with MIAP for over a year and have found the cause to have no political agenda other than to simply do the right thing on behalf of living and deceased veterans and their families.  The mission is simple: locate the unidentified and unclaimed cremains of veterans in order to give them the honor, respect and military burial they deserve.  I participated in the MIAP escort to Arlington National Cemetery (May 2009).  I witnessed and participated in a "mission" that showed me the heart and soul of this nation as ordinary citizens showed their respect to 3 fallen heroes. People understood what this mission was about. It showed in their actions whether it was standing on a freeway over pass in the rain and dark holding a flag; a girls softball game that came to a standstill as the girls took off hats and placed them over their hearts; law enforcement providing escort or simply standing at attention and rendering a salute;  a solitary figure standing at attention in a field holding a flag.  In every state we saw incredible displays of respect. It was a statement that our fallen veterans have not been and will not be forgotten. It was an emotional, spiritual and honorable journey on behalf of Dunn, Mays and Callahan.  As Fred would say, "they deserved nothing less."  This is the heart of MIAP.. The desire to do what is right on behalf of fallen veterans who have been abandoned but not forgotten.  MIAP has provided escort for two heroes this week in Redding.  MIAP has a bi monthly service nest week (March 10th) for veterans who have been laid to rest without family or military honors.  We will provide the military service and the honor they deserve.  It is truly a privledge to be involved with MIAP..  Respectfully,Mark Boehle
Missing In America-Veteransrecovery Program	32606	10	/users/profile/33430	bud1	Board Member	5	03/06/2010	I voluntered with MIAP from the very first in 2006. I have contacted and worked in several funeral homes that have over 100+ unclaimed cremated remains. At first you sort through the names looking for veterans and spouses. Then as you narrow the list down they start to become people again and you start calling them be their first name.  This isn't weird, it is very personal. It changes your life, you start to have a different outlook about today and tomorrow. To locate and have our veterans properly buried gives me peace. I am a veteran and served in Vietnam and know what it is to not be recognised for your service.  This is my way of giving back.   Bud Thieme
Missing In America-Veteransrecovery Program	32582	8	/users/profile/33403	Eric Matchko	Volunteer	5	03/05/2010	Last year, I rode with Missing in America Project (MIAP) as a photographer on the trip to Arlington that made national and world news. I was deeply impressed with what I saw, the respect that these MIAP riders had for the soldiers we were transporting; I was moved by the stories of each soldier we buried - what they gave so that we might have a better life today. I was also impressed with the volunteers that I worked with, their dedication to the cause and their personal stories about being vets and working with this under served population. It opened my eyes to the hidden world of the veteran, all too often forgotten and overlooked once they leave the service or come home. MIAP makes sure that no one is ever forgotten. MIAP's accomplishments are just astounding and I don't know of any other veteran group that can claim to have raised veteran awareness quite like this. My assignment ended last year but I still am doing what I can to promote this wonderful cause.

Many have been in the military, and even those who were not understood what it meant for these remains to be placed here at ANC.  Even through the many miles it took to ride from California to DC, they rode for one common goal.  I met with most who rode or came, and the common "brotherhood" and love that shown through was incredible.  I am glad to know that while we as young soldiers stand on the frontlines, there will always be those who stand behind us and look out for those who went missing along the way whether it be out there or here in our own back yard.

These Numbers Have Faces, Inc.	129495	1	/users/profile/174859	sanforddr	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/26/2012	Millions of Americans travel internationally each year. Whether we're overseas for a week, a month, a season, or a school year ("study abroad," anyone?), we come back changed. Sometimes that change is for the worse. Sometimes it's for the better. Rarely, however, does it convert a 26-year-old into a social entrepreneur on the scale of Justin Zoradi. Don't miss the fact that These Numbers Have Faces works. It's growing. And it's poised for much more growth. Why? These Numbers Have Faces empowers African young adults to pursue a university degree, land a good job, and then turn around and fund a full-year scholarship for another person in their same community. Those new scholarship recipients later fund still other full-year scholarships.  Potential downside? So far, none. www.thesenumbers.org

Working for them changed my career path from just wanting to design to wanting to work for non-profits from here on out. They do amazing work and the best part is that it is sustainable.

For years, we've donated to different non-profits but TNHF was changing the world in ways we could relate to.  As a soccer player, dancer and advocates of education, we are overjoyed that the things we love are making a difference in the lives of others.  As military members, time is not something we can give like TNHF can, so being able to help despite where we're stationed means the world to us.  We are so proud to be part of such a great organization and love telling everyone (or showing thanks to our book!) about These Numbers Have Faces.  We can't wait to be able to more with you guys:)

I loved that they had a world cup bracket this summer and was excited that it became one of the biggest espn brackets in the world (#20 I think). They are excited about their work and have worked hard to develop a in country staff as well.
These Numbers Have Faces, Inc.	52599		/users/profile/53549	lottiezorn	Volunteer	5	09/16/2010	These Numbers Have Faces is an exemplary organization that performs its mission with integrity and fierce dedication.  As a finance intern, I have had the privilege of working for Executive Director Justin Zoradi, whose inspirational leadership and visionary brilliance are the keystones of the organization.  Justins commitment is so inspiring that the professional staff of TNHF are willing to pour their heart and soul into the organization for minimum-wage pay, while the intern staff are willing to work for free. In their modest office in Portland, Oregon, the walls are bare except for poignant photos of South African scholarship recipients and a tribute to Nelson Mandela.  What the office lacks in frills, it more than makes up for in goodwill, laughter, and cooperative productivity.  TNHF is a healthy, lean, ethical organization where every possible dollar is used to further the mission of helping South African youth attain education and empowerment.
These Numbers Have Faces, Inc.	52402		/users/profile/53310	melanieg	Volunteer	5	09/14/2010	It's the holistic approach of These Numbers Have Faces that I love. Yes, getting a scholarship is great, but if a student does not have encouragement, support, accountability, or practical life skills, the money is wasted. TNHF understands that. I am completely on board with the mission of the organization and the staff is just the cherry on top. I work with genuinely caring, supportive individuals. We are driven towards a common goal and believe in working together to accomplish our best work. It is this community effort that allows us to effectively impact South Africa. These Numbers Have Faces is truly the embodiment of the quote by Margaret Mead, "Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed people can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has."It's a blessing to be a part of that small group.
These Numbers Have Faces, Inc.	52325		/users/profile/53218	mattispositive	Volunteer	5	09/14/2010	I first found out about These Numbers Have Faces in 2008. I had come across their website from some mutual friends that were supporters of the organization and decided to look into them and see what they were about. I was pleased with their mission and with their interactions with me, answering any questions I had. I offered my services as a Video Production Professional and we stayed in touch. Earlier this year (2010), I had edited a few videos for them and was informed by Justin (founder) that TNHF was going to start an internship and he wanted me to apply. So I did, and the Board agreed to bring me on the TNHF team as the Video & Media Intern. As of writing this, I've worked for the organization for over 5 months and have grown even more pleased with the organization since getting more involved. One area that has greatly pleased me is the efficiency with which money is distributed. So much of the funds donated goes to South Africa and that really encouraged me that I was working for someone with integrity, an organization that truly cares for the people it's helping. I am also happy that it's not basic charity but that the organization is built upon a model that can be taken anywhere and can be sustainable in the area that adopts that model, eventually without the help of These Numbers Have Faces. To have an exit strategy is not common among many non-profits and for that, I commend TNHF and it's founders, for wishing to bring more than charity to the people of South Africa. They seek to help them build a foundation for their future and for those who will come after the students currently in the program. They hope to one day hear that the organization itself isn't needed anymore, as the program has become a fully South African model that is sustaining itself. The organization is very personal with it's donors (it's how I ended up working for them) and is responsible with their resources and donations.
These Numbers Have Faces, Inc.	52306		/users/profile/53200	jlyons1	Volunteer	5	09/13/2010	I first heard about TNHF from a friend of mine while I was describing my struggles to get in touch with a different local nonprofit in the Portland area.  She mentioned that she had heard great things about this organization, that it was small, but extremely effective.  One glance at their website and I was enthralled.  I loved the mantra that called for TNHF to work themselves out of business, by helping to create sustainable change through South African youth in their communities.  I immediately emailed the volunteer address and was shocked to receive a personal email from Justin a few hours later, thanking me for my interest.  That personal touch is apparent through out the website and in the videos with interviews and speeches given by the scholarship recipients.  The humility and dedication of our scholars inspired and motivated me and I am very excited to be a recent member of the TNHF team.
These Numbers Have Faces, Inc.	52301		/users/profile/40189	andrew7	Volunteer	5	09/13/2010	TNHF strives to provide education opportunities in South Africa through unique methodology that I find inspiring.  Students are not simply given money to go to school.  They are holistically taking care of via financial literacy programs, mentorship, and of course, their collegiate educations.  The staff is fully dedicated to this cause.
These Numbers Have Faces, Inc.	39238	7	/users/profile/40189	andrew7	Volunteer	5	05/17/2010	My experience with These Numbers started from an outside view.  I loved how they used people to tell their story.  Their financial model really impressed me as well.  The idea that a dollar could have such a reach and multiple applications is a rare find in many non-profits today.As a current intern, I love the hearts of the people working there, and it's obvious that the primary focus are the students in South Africa.
These Numbers Have Faces, Inc.	52191		/users/profile/53042	laurenamaro	Donor	5	09/11/2010	This organization has grown as organically and sustainably as they intend to develop communities in South Africa. I met Justin Zoradi, the director, in college and have kept up with his work over the years only to be constantly amazed at the genuine compassion and intelligence exhibited by this non-profit. They have created something that few non-profits can do: a project that will end if all goes well. As such, I am proud to represent their work in my classroom. I recently taught a lesson to a Public Speaking class at Arizona State University dealing with the use of language and the use of ethical messages to communicate and persuade about big ideas. As a class, we examined this group's webpage and had a discussion about how this group's communication is making a difference. My students were excited to see a direct example of the principles that we discussed and, more importantly, an example of what young people can do for and with each other to change the world. TNHF is doing that, and doing it well.
These Numbers Have Faces, Inc.	43623	1	/users/profile/44497	sam10	Donor	5	06/10/2010	I know a number of people involved with TNHF from volunteers to the chair of the board. I am continually impressed with their attention to detail that is coupled with their laser-sharp focus on the long-term vision - which is to go out of business! That really should be the goal of any development organization... that they help reduce poverty to the point that they are no longer relevant.  TNHF is well equipped to handle the messy process that is development. They have the relationships, resources and vision to do some real good, long-term work in South Africa and be a catalyst to empower local leaders to change their communities forever.
These Numbers Have Faces, Inc.	43038	6	/users/profile/43800	doug5	General Member of the Public	5	06/04/2010	I am a long time friend of the founder of TNHF.  This is one of the best organizations I have ever had the pleasure of being involved in.  The biggest strength of TNHF is their clarity of purpose.  Whne you walk into their office in Portland it is clearly written on the wall.  As a donator I know exactly were my money is going.TNHF also does an incredible jod of connecting with their contributors.  Whether it is a weekly newslater, posts of facebook, or even a friendly hand written thank you note, you always feel invovled and like you are making a difference.  TNHF also connects their contributors with the people they are working with.  They attatch faces with the work they are doing.I have worked with other non profits and NGO's in the past, but my experience with TNHF has been so much more rewarding then anything else.
These Numbers Have Faces, Inc.	41828	12	/users/profile/42622	janice2	Volunteer	5	05/29/2010	TNHF is a grass-roots organization committed to sustainable change in S. Africa through education and community development.  It has been inspiring to observe the consistent enthusiasm by young people for those living across the globe. That passion is complemented by hard work on a daily basis to advance the goals.  And it's paying off:  beginning with funding the college education for one student in 2008, TNHF now has placed 8 students in 2010 with plans to increase the number to 20 in 2011. One specific fundraising goal this year is to enable 10 women to attend college.  Small donations fund the project, which seeks to change the world, one face at a time.  And it's happening.  I'm proud to do my small part for such an impressive, visionary organization.
These Numbers Have Faces, Inc.	41266	7	/users/profile/42119	heidi10	Donor	5	05/27/2010	I heard about These Numbers Have Faces through Facebook, and thought it sounded cool.  When checking it out I noticed they had an awesome t-shirt design and so I bought it.  I get a ton of compliments on the shirt, I know the money went to a good cause, and so I bought a bunch as gifts for friends. Now I pay attention to the charity, know about the cause and the need for education in the townships, and am really impressed by the methods These Numbers Have Faces uses to reach the public and help get education opportunities to youth and thus help a whole community.
These Numbers Have Faces, Inc.	40943	7	/users/profile/27026	Lesley3fold	Donor	5	05/27/2010	I love this organization. TNHF is grassroots, but that doesn't mean they're not professional in approaching tough issues in South Africa. The organization has taken the time to understand the communities where they are working, and to provide options for South African young adults who can truly impact their country for good. I also appreciate the creative ways TNHF fundraises. As a donor, they keep me informed and educated as to how the money I give is impacting individuals.
These Numbers Have Faces, Inc.	40702	6	/users/profile/41599	irvinmac	Donor	5	05/26/2010	I got to know the founder, Justin Zoradi, when we both were in Belfast together in 2005 - 2006.  Since that time, I have kept close tabs on These Numbers Have Faces and what they are doing.  I have been very impressed by their work with the soccer and dance teams that they support in South Africa.  More importantly, they are enabling these kids to get a University education through sponsorships and have an economic model in place where they give back after graduation.I have been impressed by how they are run operationally.  The videos and pictures that they put together are top notch.  I have received hand written thank you notes from their staff and they are very passionate about what they do.
These Numbers Have Faces, Inc.	40555	7	/users/profile/41461	alair	Board Member	5	05/25/2010	I remember receiving a call from a good friend from college and he told me that he wanted to start an organization committed to helping South African college students.  From that moment, I was hooked.  Since then, I have seen These Numbers Have Faces grow and flourish from a simple idea into a sustainable, impacting organization that is touching many lives.  I have always been impressed by the organization's focus on specific, tangible actions that create lasting change.  I'm grateful to be a part of this organization.
These Numbers Have Faces, Inc.	40448	6	/users/profile/41365	mjchapman	Volunteer	5	05/25/2010	TNHF is a solid nonprofit that is taking an honest look at one specific issue - lack of access to education for black township youth in South Africa - and doing what it can do create positive change for those affected. They are working to break the most debilitating generational poverty cycle that I believe exists. There is clear energy and momentum surrounding this relatively small and young organization. The amount of positive press is only a testament to the power of a transparent, progressive, and grassroots movement.I began volunteering to put my development and business degrees to work, and once inside the organization it was clear that they have a clear sense of purpose and calling. Having worked for a number of similar organizations, I was very impressed at how well TNHF is run, and how clear it is that the mission of the organization comes before anything else. They have a clear identity and that will take them so far.
These Numbers Have Faces, Inc.	40441	4	/users/profile/41354	alesha	Donor	5	05/25/2010	There are hundreds of non-profit organizations out there, each with its own mission and goals.  Sometimes it seems like giving money to help impoverished children is like throwing pennies into a bottomless well, or getting stuck running through a revolving door with no end in sight.  Although the charities that take care of these kids are important and they should receive support, it is overwhelming to hear that 1.1 billion people in developing countries have inadequate access to water, and 2.6 billion lack basic sanitation (2006 United Nations Human Development Report).  Or that 15 million children worldwide were orphaned due to HIV/AIDS (State of the world's children, UNICEF, 2005).  Don't lose hope!  We CAN make a difference!  Despite all the statistics, you should always remember: These Numbers Have Faces.  The global impoverished youth is not merely a tally mark on a bar graph, or a distant intangible cause.  These are real people, with hopes and dreams, fears and doubts, and optimism and motivation beyond that which we can comprehend given their circumstances.These Numbers Have Faces is a unique community impact model through which South African youth are given the opportunity to receive a college education with the goal of creating a sustainable culture of reinvestment and mentorship.  There are no better people to help a community than those who have been raised within it, whose families and friends depend on their support, and who have a personal and passionate interest in helping their townships succeed.  Recently, These Numbers Have Faces has been able to start an initiative to raise $50,000 for a Women's Empowerment Fund, to support township girls as they pursue college educations, which many of them did not think could happen in their lifetimes.Students are nominated by township leaders and undergo an extensive application process to ensure their commitment to their community and their personal growth.  The accepted students are required to maintain good grades, participate in community service, learn about financial literacy, and set examples for children and other youth in their neighborhoods.  Throughout the process, they have community mentors from the JL Zwane Church or Football Club, and they also have the individual and group support of their friends here in the U.S.  By donating to These Numbers Have Faces, you can have a personal relationship with one of the students in South Africa.  You can send encouraging e-mails and letters, get updates on final exam completion and college graduation, and you can actually see your donations making a difference in the lives of the youth.  These Numbers Have Faces is an organization with a goal of sustainability, which means one day the students who have been a part of this community impact model will be the township leaders, working to reduce poverty and improve the quality of the communities in which they live.  For These Numbers Have Faces to go out of business because the students you helped encourage and support are doing such a great job of reinvesting their resources and their talents into their communities will be awesome.  We should all get together and celebrate on the day These Numbers Have Faces can contentedly close its doors...I'll provide the pizza, you guys bring the drinks.
These Numbers Have Faces, Inc.	40419	5	/users/profile/41332	josh4	Donor	5	05/25/2010	These Number Have Faces is a hazardous organization to your apathy. By putting a face, a person, and a story behind real world, solvable problems, they provide both the motive and the opportunity to assist those in need. While I know that I can't change the world, TNHF helps my money make an impact by supporting real, living, breathing people, and works to support an bring opportunities to those in need. Their community impact model is brilliant. It supports those involved in the program, and provides a means for the continuation of this great cause.Their website is clean, functional, and welcoming. Their marketing materials are top-notch. You can tell that they pour their heart into everything they do, and that's exactly the type of nonprofit I want to support.
These Numbers Have Faces, Inc.	40411	6	/users/profile/41324	juliantheguy	Volunteer	5	05/25/2010	I got involved with These Numbers Have Faces about 8 months ago when Justin contacted me about doing some video work.  Since then I have been a monthly donor and remain involved in both These Numbers Have Faces and the friendships I have built with their staff.  While the vision appears simple, it is the heart and thoughtfulness of These Numbers that keeps me engaged in this organization.
These Numbers Have Faces, Inc.	40365	6	/users/profile/41289	lphillipwestmontedu	Board Member	5	05/24/2010	I used to live and work in Cape Town with an organization that was involved with community development work on a small scale through training community health workers.  When I moved back to the states I was looking for a way to stay involved in South Africa.  These Numbers Have Faces is working in a very similar community to the one I had experience in and I appreciated their vision to find ways for the recipients of their scholarships to take ownership in their communities by giving back through financial reinvestment and community service.  The organization is putting structure in place to be mentoring the youth they have in their scholarship program, so it's not just about giving money, but it has more of a relational focus which in turn makes it more sustainable.  I think the most important thing the organization could move towards is putting the leadership in the hands of local South Africans so it will be run even more effectively.  As they launch the Women's Empowerment campaign I'm excited to see how they expand their influence in the community by having more of a focus on bringing women into their community impact model through granting scholarships to them and plugging them in to the different facets of what is expected of those receiving scholarships.
These Numbers Have Faces, Inc.	40338	8	/users/profile/41265	hughese83	Donor	5	05/24/2010	This organization is tremendous in their efforts to assit not only the women of South Africa, but ultimately, through them, the greater South African community.  Meaningful relationships is the counduit of all they do; through this intimate and hands-on approach, communities are being tranformed and will eventually be able to lift themselves out of poverty through education.  I wholeheartedly believe in the excellent leadership of this organization and know that the affects of their work will ultimately reach farther and wider than South Africa.
These Numbers Have Faces, Inc.	39389	6	/users/profile/40407	charles-alamo	Donor	5	05/18/2010	These Numbers Have Faces is a first-rate international development nonprofit.  Their work outside Cape Town, SA defies the traditional development model.  That's why I was initially drawn to their programs.  What began with youth soccer players in the townships has grown into an encompassing community 'to end poverty' model.  It's quite fantastic.  I'm personally motivated by their mission and the wonderful people working behind the scenes at TNHF.  Keep up the good work!
These Numbers Have Faces, Inc.	39273	8	/users/profile/40225	kmyers	Volunteer	5	05/18/2010	I have so enjoyed getting the founders, employees, board members, and interns at These Numbers Have Faces over the past year.  On one occasion I spoke at length with a board member of this organization and was challenged to hear of the relational basis of their work and impressed by the sustainability of their model for providing higher education scholarships and opportunities for young women in South African Townships.
These Numbers Have Faces, Inc.	39267	5	/users/profile/40218	erin7	General Member of the Public	5	05/17/2010	I asked one of the founders of These Numbers Have Faces, Justin, about why he decided to start this nonprofit. He gave a compelling answer about how reporting statistics regarding poverty can be overwhelming and dehumanizing, but through connection and stories we can really come to understand why fighting for dignity and equality is so important. He described exactly how he met the people he works with and what they hope to do. This organization is driven, passionate and inspiring.
These Numbers Have Faces, Inc.	39071	6	/users/profile/40004	sarjmic	Volunteer	5	05/15/2010	I was first introduced to TNHF by the Executive Director, Justin, in 2006. We met at a coffee shop so he could share his story about meeting the JL Zwane Football Team, Coach Eric and Anda. He wanted to continue his relationship with the team, felt called to do more, and formed a sole proprietorship business in order to do so. Little did he know that soon, after many a meeting in his attic, this little sole proprietorship would be the incredible nonprofit it is today. I believe in TNHF and am honored to be associated with this organization not only because of their responsible community-based development model and understanding that investing in girls is a key solution to addressing poverty from the bottom up, but because of the passionate dedicated leadership behind the scenes. Justin, his wife Trisha, the very few staff members, and the countless volunteers work at TNHF because they believe in the power of education, the dignity of all human beings, and they just love their friends in South Africa.
These Numbers Have Faces, Inc.	39042	6	/users/profile/39976	tommyj17	Volunteer	5	05/15/2010	These Numbers Have Faces is a tremendously committed group of men and women that work everyday to play their small part in improving this world. It would be easy to be discouraged when tackling something like poverty in South Africa, but what they are accomplishing through their community impact model is revolutionary. They have the potential to empower not only the youth of South Africans to lift their communities out of poverty, but also leave a sustainable organization and structure that in the future will not be reliant on These Numbers Have Faces.
These Numbers Have Faces, Inc.	39033	6	/users/profile/39966	melblesio25	Volunteer	5	05/15/2010	My volunteer experience with These Numbers Have Faces (TNHF) has been nothing short of continuing growth.  The team at TNHF is unusual.  Once the team recognized my talents and skills I was encouraged to come up with creative ideas to help grow my area of skill.  I had been so accustomed to working in a controlled environment Id almost forgotten what it was like to be free and creative.  When Im not volunteering I work in marketing for a company who sells consumer products.  Having the knowledge I did in marketing and some contacts in the non-profit world here in Portland proved to them I could help get the job done.  We met weekly to talk about ideas and status on projects.  Every week I was there was positive and we continued to move forward.  The positive feedback on ideas encouraged me to dig deeper for creativity within myself.When a company or non-profit allows their employees or volunteers to be free the sky is truly the limit on where they can go.  I know TNHF will continue to inspire those they aid as much as those who volunteer.

Oregon Rural Action Inc	153092		/users/profile/72635	Janet M	Volunteer	5	04/07/2013	Oregon Rural Action is a vital member of Eastern Oregon, the State of Oregon and as a member of Western Organization of Resource Councils to the whole of the west.  The members and staff work for a more sustainable situation in rural Oregon.  The experiences that touch my heart and soul the most are the campaigns for Justice for All and local food awareness.  This organization has shown incredible courage and strength to go where others have feared to tread.  Also very inspired by the younger generations that are giving their lives and expertise to the causes of Oregon Rural Action. Proud to be associated with this organization and definitely ranks as a GREAT NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION.
Oregon Rural Action Inc	66453		/users/profile/72635	Janet M	Volunteer	5	02/10/2011	A truly indispensable organization for life east of the Cascades.  Working tirelessly for sustainability in regards to food systems, renewable energy, social justices and accountability of elected officials.  Also working with local, state and federal legislation that will make a difference far into the future.  I am most grateful for the model of organizers supporting members to become active instead of the usual top down models.  This is a big shift for most people to understand and Oregon Rural Action is staying with the mission and vision.  As a member, I am grateful.

Oregon Rural Action Inc	80884		/users/profile/88310	bridgetanne	Volunteer	5	03/01/2011	I moved to northeast Oregon roughly six months ago, and quickly became acquainted with Oregon Rural Action and their work.  After attending a focus session I realized how necessary this organization is in the community based on the large turnout and enthusiasm of all the members.  I immediately felt part of something larger than myself and was impressed with how organized, coordinated and focused the staff and volunteers are. I look forward to doing my part in helping this organization grow and prosper. 
Oregon Rural Action Inc	80718		/users/profile/88091	lotsofsocks	Volunteer	5	03/01/2011	 ORA has a way of bringing folks to together on a wide range of issues relevant to our community.  I appreciate the educational aspects of elements such as gardening, emphasis on local products and alternative energy. Thanks ORA for being there for NE Oregon!
Oregon Rural Action Inc	80566		/users/profile/87937	kalle	General Member of the Public	5	02/28/2011	Oregon Rural Action provides the citizens of Eastern Oregon with the tools needed to create a community that actively works towards economic health. Through community organizing this organization has begun discussions on food security, local economics and social justice issues. These discussions have led to on-the-ground changes: greater access to local foods, enhancement of local food pantries and greater collaboration among the organizations that are working on similar issues. 
Oregon Rural Action Inc	80389		/users/profile/87757	shaunmdaniel	Professional with expertise in this field	4	02/28/2011	I came to the rural northeastern corner of Oregon at the start of 2008 to work for Oregon Rural Action as a community organizer. Having grown up in a town of 250 people in the northeastern corner of Washington, the communities where Oregon Rural Action works as well as the issues we work on seemed very familiar. Despite the can-do individualist streak that is fairly common in more remote areas like this, these issues are bigger than any one person. They require people to come together and work together to solve them. And that's just what Oregon Rural Action does... ORA empowers everyday people to have a voice in their community, in their state, and in their nation. It helps them learn the key skills to be effective spokespeople and leaders in their communities. In its nonpartisan stance, ORA strikes a crucial balance between traditionally polarized camps of liberals and conservatives, giving people a place to come together, to discuss the deeper root causes of these issues. Moreover, there is no other group like ORA in Eastern Oregon, so ORA fills a vital niche in civic engagement and the pursuit of strong and thriving rural communities. After thousands of miles driving through rural Oregon as an organizer, countless meetings, long days and nights, participation in inspiring actions and activities, and the chance to speak with a wide array of people, I am proud to work for Oregon Rural Action - first as a community organizer and now as Communications Director. Moreover, I also pay dues as a Sustainers Circle member and give over a hundred dollars a year to the organization so that our wonderful membership can better achieve its mission.
Oregon Rural Action Inc	80355		/users/profile/87721	Kent Coe	General Member of the Public	5	02/28/2011	Oregon Rural Action is a driving force in bringing alternative energy, farmer's markets, community garden's and general organizing of under-served/under-recognized groups throughout northeast Oregon.

Oregon Rural Action Inc	79882		/users/profile/87231	seasonalchanges	Volunteer	5	02/28/2011	I have been a member of ORA since it was organized.   When I was a practicing attorney I provided pro bono legal services to the organization,  Now that I am a full-time farmer I participate as a local producer.  The organization actively promotes social justice, local economy and sustainable living.  I applaud the organization for managing to focus on issues that are inclusive, rather than issues that would divide us into opposing camps.
Oregon Rural Action Inc	78685		/users/profile/85969	James McIver	Volunteer	4	02/27/2011	I have been a member and volunteer for Oregon Rural Action (ORA) for nearly 10 years. I have participated in and watched how ORA has made a difference in our local community.  From several successes in land-use issues, to helping with veterans, to starting up the La Grande Farmers Market, ORA has made a huge difference in the lives of many citizens of the La Grande area.  Certainly, ORA has made a difference for me, and I am proud to be a member, a donor, and a volunteer.  
Oregon Rural Action Inc	78678		/users/profile/85962	Philip Paterno	General Member of the Public	5	02/27/2011	ORA is a positive presence in the community.

Oregon Rural Action Inc	78459		/users/profile/85715	pamgrowinggreen	Volunteer	3	02/27/2011	I am new to the program having joined one year ago.  I wanted to try my hand at gardening, and signed up for a garden plot.  I was able to help only a little, but managed to help with getting the garden plots set up, and helped with spreading wood chips for walking paths.  Sadly enough, I could not make most meetings as I work for law enforcement and work many evenings. Even worse, I missed the potluck and the cider making event!   A chance to participate in making apple cider was disappointing to me, but perhaps next year I can be there if the opportunity comes up.I want to tell you about my gardening experience.  I learned that I needed more room!!!  Beggers cannot be choosers however, so I made do with my little plot.  I had some mishaps, and I had some good results.  I also had some volunteer sunflowers grow in my lttle plot that I did not want, but since they were so persistant I didnt have the heart to kill them.  They grew, and grew, and grew.  HUGE!  Jack in the Beanstalk could have used them on his mission.    Well, I figured the birds could enjoy the seeds.  This coming Summer I have other plans however.  I want pumpkins, and Hubbard squash.   No Sunflowers!I was able to attend a class on composting which was informative.  I met some wonderful people.  I watched the progression of everyones garden and enjoyed walking around their plots and seeing what was growing.  I learned what worked and didnt work for me, and had good results with my tomatoes which I shared with people.  My squash did not have quite enough time to really ripen, but hopefully this year the weather will cooperate.   Just want to say that this was a great experience for me.

Oregon Rural Action Inc	77984		/users/profile/85249	Ramon	Board Member	5	02/26/2011	Oregon Rural Action (ORA) is the go-to organization when a community in Eastern Oregon finds itself with an issue that isn't being resolved through the usual local government channels. ORA also collaborates with other like-minded organizations in the Northwest to get  state  level actions and legislation that have a positive effect for rural communities. ORA also partners with it's sister organizations under the Western Organization of Resource Councils umbrella to effect national actions and legislation that have impacts on the rural communities of Western United States.The ORA staff is probably the most effective group of people working for a non-profit that I have ever had the pleasure to work with. They have increased the membership by relativly large numbers in this sparsley populated region and increased the local funding well beyond the goals set by the board. 
Oregon Rural Action Inc	77651		/users/profile/84905	gal friday	Volunteer	5	02/26/2011	I have watched our local ORA office evolve into a respected and influential positive force within the community mainly due to the drive and enthusiasm of young volunteers and staff members like Nella Parks, and 'retired' volunteers like Margaret Mead and Bill Whitaker.I count on our local ORA staff and volunteers to act positively in our community without personal political agendas, social bias, or economic discrimination, supporting positive lifestyle changes for all local  residents. As a Master Gardener, mentor small business owner and school district employee I turn to ORA as a resource for reference and educational information, as a supportive source to assist myself and other area residents attain a healthier, more self-sufficient lifestyle, and also as a vehicle to create and promote worthy causes and educational programs within the community  to improve the health and well-being of children and families. ORA is a socially and environmentally responsible regional non-profit which networks and partners with a variety of area organizations and agencies to create, promote, and/or physically support a number of diverse area projects and programs such as (my favorites):  the Community Garden, Farmer's Market and school lunch nutritional programs. I am confident that when ORA is involved in a program or project, effective and efficient policies and procedures will be incorporated to successfully complete objectives and goals. I approve of the way ORA staff and volunteers 'walk the walk' and, through modeling, set a higher standard for us all to follow.Generally speaking, ORA  improves the quality of life for local communities, and I am proud to be a member.

These young and not-so-young people continue to amaze with the programs they design and implement and the level of commitment shown not only by the staff but by the committed volunteers making them happen.  The Farmer's Market, the Community Garden, the Farm-to-School  program are but a few. The depth and breadth of the issues addressed can be noted in their regular e-newsletter.  
Oregon Rural Action Inc	77125		/users/profile/84374	jennifer	Donor	4	02/26/2011	I enjoy being a part of ORA because it's an easy way to get involved with community in ways that matter to me.  
Oregon Rural Action Inc	77122		/users/profile/84370	Gustav	General Member of the Public	5	02/26/2011	I have never seen such an active and inspired group in this community.  ORA is an asset. 
Oregon Rural Action Inc	76993		/users/profile/84233	kevin	Volunteer	4	02/26/2011	From farmers market to solar education, ORA is a great local community organization.  While not always taking on controversial issues, they provide a grounded perspective and balance to a community that needs it.
Oregon Rural Action Inc	76952		/users/profile/84190	cilla	Donor	5	02/26/2011	Oregon Rural Action is a refreshing breath of air in La Grande.  It is an exciting group of people dedicated to community and all the things I care about - community garden, good food in schools, farmer's market, and much more.  
Oregon Rural Action Inc	74449		/users/profile/81342	Donna	General Member of the Public	4	02/24/2011	Great website...lotsa good information and ways to get active, meet people, do some great stuff!
Oregon Rural Action Inc	74300		/users/profile/81177	Andy	Volunteer	5	02/24/2011	Oregon Rural Action developed from the Western Organization of Resource Councils in 2001.  Our La Grande group is known as the Blue Mountain Chapter.  Sometimes we network with the other ORA chapters in Pendleton, Ontario and Baker City and its a great way to meet others that are actively working on rural issues.  ORA gives these great volunteers and staff a way to increase effectiveness and to feel that wonderful spirit of community and diversity.   Each chapter is member organized and goals are set to meet the needs of each area so all of us are heard and can find a way to be in service.  Staff and members work together, networking with local groups to make changes that help areas be more productive in a holistic sense.  
Oregon Rural Action Inc	73216		/users/profile/80024	maxsprite	Volunteer	5	02/22/2011	In 2001 I joined ORA and have watched this small group grow larger and more effective.  We have tackled many local issues, some in conjunction with the Western Organization of Resource Councils or other groups and some on our own.  Many projects have worked, such as community gardens, Food to School, Farmers Market, the Solar Fair. A few haven't been successful, like getting the city to allow chickens and rabbits in town and a solar ordinance, but we will try again.  We have a dynamic staff, good leadership and have grown in numbers.   Those good vibes we all get from participating in our communities are palpable at our gatherings, like gardening or potlucks.  Designing and putting in a sprinkler system at the gardens was hot, hard work, but fun to watch all levels of expertise work together, the young learning with the elders.   We have some issues, like local fund raising has been weak.  So its good to see reviews showing up here, and I think the reviews will be great for the most part.   We will continue to move towards more local support financially, the rest I think we've got down pretty well.   Thanks for putting this project together.
Oregon Rural Action Inc	67414		/users/profile/73684	hollybells	General Member of the Public	4	02/12/2011	ORA has kept the public informed on a number of programs to help us out here in the rural area of east Oregon. From community events to what's going on at our local farmers markets, their website has quite a bit of information.  One thing that would be good to see is more work on community outreach to the hungry.  In living in an agriculture area plus and economically depress area, there can be ways to help each other.    
Oregon Rural Action Inc	67052		/users/profile/73282	Teresa	Volunteer	5	02/11/2011	It is great volunteering for Oregon Rural Action and feeling like I am part of a community.  I also appreciate the interesting discussions and focus on addressing root causes of issues.
Oregon Rural Action Inc	66856		/users/profile/73068	Dave	General Member of the Public	5	02/11/2011	I've watched ORA accomplish great things for local communities in eastern Oregon - starting and supporting farmer's markets, developing a renewable energy grant program with Union County, running the community garden, the list of successes is long.  Even more important is ORA provides a voice for progressive change from our thinly populated corner of the state, heard in Salem, across the West and in Washington D.C.   
Oregon Rural Action Inc	66595		/users/profile/72790	Bill	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/10/2011	Oregon Rural Action is one of the most effective organizations I have seen in 40 years of organizing and social justice advocacy. It is effectively building alliances between farmers, ranchers, and residents of eastern Oregon. ORA has strengthened community, affected social policy most recently helping secure amendments designed to protect small farmers and producers in federal food safety legislation, introduced school children in several eastern Oregon communities to school gardens and the benefits of locally grown food, been a voice for reason, developed an exceptional web presence. It has truly sowed seeds of change that are sprouting and prospering throughout multiple eastern Oregon counties.
Oregon Rural Action Inc	65943		/users/profile/72079	Jeffrey C.	Donor	5	02/09/2011	ORA is a indispensable organization for our small rural community.  They are constantly advocating on our behalf, strengthening the county through sustainable projects such as farm to school and community gardens, and furthering environmental awareness in our area.  Thanks so much for all you do!
Oregon Rural Action Inc	65934		/users/profile/72068	Linda	Volunteer	5	02/09/2011	ORA inspires the young and old  in our community to work together to help make our town/world a better place. In the 9 years that I have been a member, they have worked hard to find the common connection we all have to help us to realize that we can work together for the common good. Whether that is for a thriving Farmers Market, a community garden, coordinating a solar fair, working through the legislature on agribusiness issues to assure that small local farmers wouldn't be driven out out of business, launching the first Farm to School program and/or fostering the vision to help develop a plan for a sustainable economy, especially in our small rural community. The meetings are buzzing with idea's and energy and the ORA directors and volunteers are helping to make them happen. As a group, instead of watching the future speed towards us out-of-control, we have made positive changes for our community and know with confidence that we can make more!
Oregon Rural Action Inc	65171		/users/profile/71237	Mike S.	General Member of the Public	5	02/08/2011	ORA has given countless hours to our community in the areas of sustainable foods, healthy eating in schools, and support for farming and ranching.  I live in La Grande, Oregon and out Farmers Market (facilitated by Oregon Rural Action) is one of the greatest gifts we have as a community.
Oregon Rural Action Inc	65138		/users/profile/71200	Liz A.

Oregon Rural Action Inc	65136		/users/profile/71199	AMalmberg	Volunteer	5	02/08/2011	If every region in the country had an organization like Oregon Rural Action the nation would be a much better off.  Oregon Rural Action is saying no to the civil cold war being played out in the media.  We are creating venues for people from all backgrounds to interact, learn, and create real, workable solutions that promote sustainability. Oregon Rural Action will be strengthened by increasing local fundraising so that it is not so dependent on foundations.
Oregon Rural Action Inc	65124		/users/profile/71185	Christopher J.	General Member of the Public	5	02/08/2011	Oregon Rural Action has played a vital role in our local community.

I have supported it personally and through my affiliation with Rotary International. Frances Dixon and her many villager/members have created a multi-faceted organization grounded in local culture and committed to sustainable practice.
Adopt-a-Village in Guatemala	307907		/users/profile/50514	senor-david	Donor	5	10/04/2016	Hello Friends, I have worked with Frances for a few years now on projects and have seen the work of the organization, Adopt-a-Village.  They are definitely serving well an almost-forgotten people when it comes to government services.    Your donation will be channeled by a founder who has passed up the "good life" of retirement for a greater one working in the mountains of Guatemala.
Adopt-a-Village in Guatemala	245492	1	/users/profile/50514	senor-david	Donor	5	06/17/2015	Yes, I have become friends with Frances Dixon this year, founder of ADV, and see the good work of her small organization in NW Guatemala through the many windows provided by her on Facebook showing the education and nutritional work of the organization.  I also have helped fund a project and can see the value of a group whose founder is always next to the heartbeat of its activity.   David Pack
Adopt-a-Village in Guatemala	307898		/users/profile/399267	RitchieM	Volunteer	5	10/04/2016	Almost two decades ago I fell in love with the people of Guatemala and a year ago I returned for a visit with my family and the love grew even more.  After our visit we wanted to find a way to help the people there.  We started looking into starting our own organization, but that was looking like a long road and we were unsure how to find people to help. Then a friend Introduced us to an organization they worked with, but we didn't get the response we were looking for at that time.  After a  failed attempt I found Adopt-a-Village in Guatemala and liked their Facebook page.  We started off by sponsoring a student, but before we threw our dedication to this organization and sought to promote it we had to see it for ourselves. So this summer our little family, my wife, seven year old daughter and I, packed our bags and headed to La Maya Juaguar.  It was such a great experience! It is hard for me to put it into words. We were able to meet Frances Dixon, the staff, one of the local board of directors and we were nothing but impressed with the vision and execution of this organization and we are even more in love with what they do after we say it first hand.  I was able to work on some needed construction projects and with with the students. My wife and daughter helped in the kitchen, gathered eggs, work in the green house, taught some yoga and played UNO with the students.  We are grateful we found Adopt-a-Village and are excited to work with them.  The work they do to promote education and to educate is priceless to the people of the region.  All who are involved weather as a student, teacher, member of the local community, volunteer, donor Etc are better off for being a part of it. 
Adopt-a-Village in Guatemala	307880		/users/profile/399246	Susanne N.	Donor	5	10/04/2016	This organization is amazing. The leader, Frances, works at a very grassroots level and all the money goes exactly where it's supposed to. A truly wonderful organization across the board.
Adopt-a-Village in Guatemala	248693	8	/users/profile/333979	GaryfromCymru	Volunteer	5	07/16/2015	When I first traveled to Guatemala in 2007, I soon realized it was not enough to be a tourist!  The Mayan people, even after 500 years of oppression, genocide, and tragedy, were so warm, friendly, and likeable.  I discovered Adopt-A-Village, and joined by sponsoring two kids to help with their education and health.  The next year, I went down again as a volunteer to find out more.  Folks, this organization is for real!  It works in an extremely remote region, largely among survivors and returnees from the civil war.  (Most non-profits in the country cluster around the sexier, safer regions of Antigua and Atitlan.)  It is a small, flexible responsive organization.  They listen to the local leaders for guidance, and they respect traditional culture.  There is no paid gringo staff.  Not a dollar is wasted.  In my three trips there, I have witnessed amazing new construction and networks.  AAV-G doesn't dispense aid; it builds opportunities.  I find that I am a better person for having become a volunteer.  
Adopt-a-Village in Guatemala	247831	2	/users/profile/335464	Valmiller61	Donor	5	07/08/2015	I have been supporting Adopt-a-Village in Guatemala (AAV) for over 13 years as a donor and actually worked for them for a short while.  If you want a charity that lifts up families, children and widows, you don't need to look any further.  They give a hand up and not a handout.  Their goal is simple, educate children who then go back into these remote villages and teach the villagers how to prepare a garden, how to start a garden and then grow food for their families. These students go back and teach other children how to read, nutrition, and animal husbandry.  How to be self sufficient and learn skills that will benefit their families.   Through sponsorship, it helps to pay for the teacher who then goes to these remote villages and teaches children that Guatemalan Government has forgotten.  AAV brings in volunteers who provide medical and dental care.  They have brought in carpenters who have taught villagers how to build.  All of things are done in a quite and respectful manner so that it is not the Americans coming in to save them, but partnering with them to learn the skills they need to have a better life.  AAV does not have a religious affiliation, but in my book what they are doing is what Christians should be doing, helping others less fortunate than themselves.   AAV runs on a shoestring so that donations are used to get as much value as they can.  Money goes to the children and families and not some big wigs salary.  This grassroots organization is incredible.  I wholeheartedly recommend AAV as an organization you should get involved it. 
Adopt-a-Village in Guatemala	247800	4	/users/profile/335425	Catalina1951	Volunteer	5	07/08/2015	My field is nursing. I volunteered for Adopt a Village in the remote NW corner of Guatemala in March, 2015.I saw first hand the mentoring and support for the desperately poor so they can grow nutritious food and learn life skills.  Frances Dixon's program is carefully managed and well thought out.  I saw first hand how far an annual child sponsorship gift of $250 goes and what a huge difference it can make.  Maya Jaguar High School  also created by Frances and her non profit is producing students who are continuing on to the university level and returning to the community to improve lives.  A high school education is a rare opportunity/privilege for Mayan youth.  One person can make a difference.  Frances has devoted her life to these people for many years.  She has  built a solid foundation that promotes  self reliance and well conceived projects that will benefit  villages the most.Her corner stone is education..  The school is planned for expansion so please, consider giving to Adopt a Village.

I am so impressed with the accomplishments of this organization and how it has helped rural indigenous people.  While I usually donate to local non-profits, Adopt-a-Village in Guatemala is one non profit that I wholeheartedly support.  I feel confident knowing that the money is going directly to the needed services.  I hope to return to Guatemala some day and meet and see the amazing people and work that has been accomplished.
Adopt-a-Village in Guatemala	245714		/users/profile/332928	Cecilia7	Volunteer	5	06/19/2015	I heard about this wonderful nonprofit from a local npr station.  They were interviewing Francis the  woman that started this org.  They help the indigenous people of Guatemala that have been so neglected by their government. Adopt a village has been instrumental in teaching the farming skills needed to feed themselves, helping to dig wells  and also have build a school to educate their children. They have brought real hope into these remote villages.

We were fortunate to hear of Francis and her work with Adopt a  Village, and began sponsoring a child. We have been amazed at what Francis and Adopt a Village have accomplished over the years. We are so happy to be a part of this work in our small way. Her leadership and vision, the great efforts of volunteers, and the participation of the Mayan people have made Adopt a Village successful and effective.

I honor the work Adopt A Village does to help lift the Mayan people of Guatemala out of poverty through education and sustainable agriculture.  This is a very worthy cause.
Adopt-a-Village in Guatemala	245623	1	/users/profile/332815	BethSheehan	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/18/2015	I  became involved with Adopt-A-Village Guatemala and their Maya Jaguar High School through Rotary.  I met Frances at a Rotary conference and the program she has lead is NOT a duplication of service and has built in sustainability.  Education is THE way out of poverty and rather than trucking in donations to the marginalized, indigenous Mayans, AAV is working to re-teach them the ways of their ancestors--how to farm, what to farm, and how to cooks and prepare what you grow.  The high school is teaching Mayan youth how to use computers and technology and agronomy and literacy so that they can work--not just subsist.  This program is not a hand out, it is a hand up and donations are not a give away, they are in investment that brings a future.

We believe that we are helping to make a difference by donating to a small, grass-roots organization that was begun by Frances Dixon about 20 years ago.  We are pleased and confident that our dollars are used appropriately.  It's amazing what has been accomplished by donors who have caught the vision of Adopt-a-Village.  Be an agent of change by finding out more about this dynamic, growing program.  Your gifts will make a difference.  Every dollar matters.
Adopt-a-Village in Guatemala	245538	1	/users/profile/332712	acracr	Volunteer	5	06/17/2015	In February, I spoke at a reading conference in Guatemala and met three teachers from the Adopt-a-Village school.  We talked about their school at dinner that night, and I am now scheduled  to conduct some training for their teachers early next year.  I will be a volunteer and pay my own expenses.  I have also donated funds to the project.  I am very impressed by the dedication of these teachers and of Frances Dixon, who gives leadership to the effort.  I listed myself below as a volunteer, but I am also a donor and a professional with expertise in their field of endeavor.
Adopt-a-Village in Guatemala	245535	1	/users/profile/332710	Dahira	Donor	5	06/17/2015	my niece was adopted from Guatemala and thus began a great admiration of the Mayan people. I sponsor a little boy myself, as does my sister, but I also have a student club at my school which fundraises for this organization. We sell Mayan crafts that Adopt A Village provides and are planning on other snack food sales and even hopefully a big Day of the Dead day at our school. Our club has been helping to sponsor a high school student at their Maya Jaguar high school. As I am a Spanish teacher,  I also help translate letters from sponsored children, including Cristobal, our own high school scholarship student. We love this organization and we especially admire and love Frances Dixon!

Adopt-a-Village in Guatemala	245532	1	/users/profile/332708	Emiliacl	Volunteer	5	06/17/2015	Why do I support this wonderful organization? 1) "Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime." I love that Frances Dixon and other volunteers have implemented a Sustainable Gardening Program for Mayan families in NW Guatemala. The high school students at the Instituto Tcnico Maya Jaguar learn agronomy and go to various villages to teach their organic gardening skills. 2) I sponsor a child to help foster connections to my adopted daughter's homeland ($70 per quarter--that's affordable). I'm hoping that my sponsored child, Carla, can get have the opportunity to become educated like her sister, Estela, who has gotten a scholarship to continue her studies in the Nursing field. We need to see more women as leaders! 3) My sister volunteers by translating letters into Spanish. We have sold Guatemalan crafts for Adopt-a-Village in order to raise funds for high-school scholarships. There are many other volunteer opportunities that you can help with--fundraising--or behind the scenes. Help by spreading the word--invite people to their Facebook group, send them the link to the webpage (www.adoptavillage.com), or email Frances at guatvillage@aol.com.

Very little money is used for administrative expenses, most things are handled by volunteers. There is "no high paid CEO".

Adopt-a-Village in Guatemala	245489	1	/users/profile/332663	Lee_50	Donor	5	06/17/2015	It started with a quest to find an organization to help a poor friend that we helped in the states after a devastating tornado.  After months of researching and talking to Christian and non-Christian organizations that were no help at all, I found AAV-Guatemala.  My Friend Tomas, lives in Northern Guatemala as well and  Frances Dixon was the only person who would speak to me and offer her advice and resources.   Over the last 3 years I have seen the amazing and miraculous things that AAV has done for the impoverished In the Northern region of Guatemala.  This organization is not just an Adopt a child  and forget about it type of place.  They teach  the students, who then go out and educate the villagers and teach them how to help themselves.  IF more organizations would do this, I believe we would see a decline in poverty in so many poor nations.  Frances Dixon had dedication her life to this cause.  Her love for these people is unwavering.  I am proud to support AAV in my small way.   Fondly,  lee Belanger
Adopt-a-Village in Guatemala	245481	1	/users/profile/332654	tgenaro	Donor	5	06/17/2015	I've been a sponsor of children for more than a decade, ranging from wee ones to a teenager seeking higher education. I never have any doubt of where my money is going, because Frances Dixon, the founder, provides daily updates and photos on Facebook.  I receive photos and drawings from the children I sponsor, and the hands-on work of volunteers in to the Guatemalan communities is not about aid: it's about teaching skills and building a sustainable community. I give unhesitatingly and would encourage others to do the same.

Adopt-a-Village in Guatemala	245456	1	/users/profile/332622	Terri_Touchet	Volunteer	5	06/17/2015	Upon returning from a trip to Guatemala I searched for a grass roots organization that was assisting these people who are severely oppressed. Frances is truly dedicated to this cause and also takes the time to get to know the donors. The effort she spends connecting with me is why I have donated my services to the organization.   I believe the work being done by AAV Guatemala is making a large impact in weakening the never ending cycle of poverty. There is so much joy in the pictures of the people that Frances is helping. This is in contrast with what I saw that prompted my search for her organization.    
Adopt-a-Village in Guatemala	245454	1	/users/profile/332620	ARCHIVE-CD	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/17/2015	Frances is a compelling voice in the plight of the Mayans in Guatemala.   I first heard the story via Rotary.  My wife and I were so taken by the need, adversity, and tenacity these people displayed in simply living from day to day.  We are proud sponsors of two of the children, Alberto (7) and Claudia (5) and have donated to the general fund as well.  Alberto wears a single large red cotton T-shirt, the only clothing he possesses.   That is soon to change. It takes very little to make a big difference in the lives of these people. I hope you choose to help make a difference as well.

I was  impressed with her single-minded focus on, and passion for, elevating the Mayan people. Over nearly 26 years as an unpaid leader, she's helped to build a web of support that emphasizes educating teens (and soon, pre-teens) for futures that include higher education. Sustainable agriculture, direct aid for widows and orphans, and literacy projects are also part of the non profit's work. My husband and I support a young man through AAV scholarship program. We are proud of him and of the agency that brought him out of the fields and into the classroom toward a brighter future for him, his family, and  his rural community.
Adopt-a-Village in Guatemala	245633	3	/users/profile/332829	jschad,	Donor	5	06/18/2015	With a longstanding interest in this region, I was privileged to discover the work of this organization. I have supported it personally and through my affiliation with Rotary International. Frances Dixon and her many villager/members have created a multi-faceted organization grounded in local culture and committed to sustainable practice.
Adopt-a-Village in Guatemala	245436	2	/users/profile/332596	jduewel	Volunteer	5	06/16/2015	Getting involved with Adopt A Village Guatemala has been an honor and a joy.  I love being able to see pictures of the little girl who I sponsor, and to hear stories about what life is like for her in her village.  I love seeing the progress that's being made for her family and others, as a direct result of the contributions from Adopt A Village.  And I love that there are so many ways I can choose to be involved.  I started by just writing a check.  Now I'm helping to organize fundraisers.  I hope, eventually, that I will be able to go down to Guatemala and spend some time working next to the other volunteers, and meeting some of these beautiful people for myself.  I wish there were more nonprofits getting the job done the way this one does, and I highly recommend them to anyone wanting to make a difference.
Adopt-a-Village in Guatemala	245434	1	/users/profile/332593	quetzalito	Donor	5	06/16/2015	About 8 years ago my family began sponsoring two young sisters whose father had died. We're no less than amazed to see how a little support gave these girls the opportunity to study and thrive. We receive frequent letters from and photos of the girls. My daughter, who we adopted from Guatemala, is very proud to contribute her own money towards our sponsorship. I plan to support children via Adopt A Village indefinitely.
Adopt-a-Village in Guatemala	245426	1	/users/profile/332586	cortabianco	Donor	5	06/16/2015	I heard about this organization from a friend who had worked with them in Guatemala. He praised it so highly that I was inspired to "adopt" a village child. Unlike some sorts of charities this one is totally personal and you know all the money goes right to the people in need. There are no high salaries, high admin. costs, mailings, "gifts", etc.. I receive letters and photos from my child and have met Frances and trust her completely. This group empowers the Mayan people, teaches sustainable skills  and respects the cultural integrity of the people it serves, no hidden agendas! Adopt a Village is the perfect charity. 
Adopt-a-Village in Guatemala	245425	1	/users/profile/332585	ZoeB	Donor	5	06/16/2015	Under the leadership of Francis Dixon, this amazing organization provides educational opportunities to empower Mayan youth.  I cannot say enough about the integrity and dedication of this fine organization and all it has  accomplished over the past 25 years to assist hundreds of Mayan families.  My favorite nonprofit!   
Adopt-a-Village in Guatemala	245423	1	/users/profile/332583	brandacerojo	Volunteer	5	06/16/2015	I really like this organization because it is small but achieves big things. As an all volunteer organization, almost all donations go to help some of the poorest people in Guatemala. 
A Home in Community	231184		/users/profile/209492	nancybeetoo	Volunteer	5	10/31/2014	I think that AHIC is admirable because every dollar goes straight into buying a  house in community that a disabled person can live in. There is a visible  and permanent result from their work.  Lives are made better. Our community of 70 people benefits from the presence of the disabled people who would otherwise not be able to be here, and the disabled resident benefits by being here in community.  I myself learn a lot from Mike's attitude toward life.
A Home in Community	157954		/users/profile/209492	nancybeetoo	Donor	5	05/15/2013	What I appreciate about this organization is that all the money  goes straight to the cause- there is no paid staff. When you give here you know exactly what your money is doing- making it possible for disabled people without the financial resources to buy a home to enjoy cohousing.
A Home in Community	218116		/users/profile/281666	Natacha O.	Donor	5	09/29/2014	I wish there were more initiatives like AHIC, since the kind of work they do changes lives. I know this sounds like a ready made phrase, but in this case I feel that I can't find better words to describe what this organization does. Providing a home for a person with a severe health problem helps not only that person  live a dignified life until the end,  but it also helps the community as a whole. We all learn how to live with, learn about, be less afraid and embrace the humanity, challenges and gifts illnes can bring. AHIC made it possible for me to meet and spend time with a wonderful neighbour,  a brilliant man that lives with Multiple Sclerosis.  In short, thank you to all the people that make AHIC possible. My family have learned a lot from being a part of its community. 
A Home in Community	218115		/users/profile/178644	kuzanga	Volunteer	5	09/29/2014	A Home in Community has provided Mike a home, and a whole community he can participate in.  We fundraise together to donate money to help raise the funds for AHIC.  It is a wonderful organization, and provides a unique way of life for people with physical disabilities.  
A Home in Community	218113		/users/profile/281663	GregCraven	Volunteer	5	09/28/2014	A Home in Community is a great nonprofit.  I live across the path from Mike am regularly inspired by how much he gives to our community and what a great role model he is for the young kids in our world.  I love seeing my donation dollars in action!
A Home in Community	218112		/users/profile/176330	stony.lohr	Donor	5	09/28/2014	I really appreciate Mike's participation in the CoHo community, which would not be possible without the help of AHIC. He is an active and insightful contributor to many community discussions, sometimes hosting small meetings in his home.
A Home in Community	130825		/users/profile/176330	stony.lohr	Donor	5	10/29/2012	I live near CoHo Ecovillage. Our family visits the community most days, and we end up chatting with Mike a few times a week. He has often contributed produce from his garden to community meals I've helped prepare, and often comes along when he volunteers his helper to help with meal preparation. He is always ready and comfortable talking to our kids when they have questions about his condition, his wheelchair, or any other random thing about his life. It is a pleasure to have him in our lives, and I am grateful to A Home in Community for making his presence in the community possible.
A Home in Community	216447	1	/users/profile/176493	RobDietz	Board Member	5	09/23/2014	AHIC does amazing things with volunteer labor.  The mission is inspiring, and the organization is incredibly effective at accomplishing it.  Our donors have supplied generous amounts of money to purchase a house at CoHo Ecovillage, which  provides a home for a tenant with physical disabilities.  After seven years in operation, we've almost paid off the loans on the house, and our tenant is a vital and well-loved member of the community!
A Home in Community	130973		/users/profile/176493	RobDietz	Board Member	5	10/30/2012	AHIC is an organization that gets things done.  As a volunteer on the board of directors for the past few years, I know that AHIC provides valuable services with negligible overhead.  We are helping to diversify and improve quality of life at CoHo Ecovillage, and we are supporting other communities in their efforts to be accessible to people with physical disabilities.  A Home in Community is not a think tank with questionable results -- it's a "do tank" with clear and visible results on the ground.  These results are all the more impressive, given that AHIC is entirely staffed by volunteers -- truly a heartwarming story!
A Home in Community	215992		/users/profile/209569	jyan	Donor	5	09/20/2014	The organizing is very well run.  The volunteers do so much work for this organization. It is a great cause. It is inspiring.

A Home in Community	215012		/users/profile/278338	JC.Lohr	Board Member	5	09/13/2014	I really love being a part of a small non-profit that is really making a difference on a personal level.  AHIC is a boon to CoHo Ecovillage, enabling Mike to be our neighbor and a vital part of our diverse community. More generally isolation is a common side effect of disability, and cohousing is a wonderful cure which I'm proud to be a part of.
A Home in Community	215002		/users/profile/206428	jodicoleman1000	Board Member	5	09/13/2014	AHIC is my favorite nonprofit.  I love how friends, family, community members, and even strangers have worked together to make our collective dream for Mike a reality.  Mike's energy, his attitude, and his commitment to community are a wonderful example for all those around him.  I love seeing how my donations make a huge impact on so many people.
A Home in Community	155505		/users/profile/206428	jodicoleman1000	Volunteer	5	04/21/2013	It's a pleasure to have Mike living in our community.  He brings such depth to our lives, and models living a rich life with a disability for all those around him.  It's wonderful seeing our community rally around helping those in need...something I cherish for myself and my family.
A Home in Community	214998		/users/profile/175984	volpemr	Client Served	5	09/13/2014	My apartment at CoHo Ecovillage is the first apartment home that I've had in my 40years as an adult. I feel like part of the community at CoHo by enjoying the benefits such as friendships, assistance and learning from others while being able to give back to the community by contributing my time and abilities to further the goal of CoHo Ecovillage.
A Home in Community	157990		/users/profile/175984	volpemr	Client Served	5	05/15/2013	A Home In Community (AHIC) was created to buy an apartment at Coho Ecovillage that would be rented to a person with a physical disability. I have no voluntary movement below my neck, due to Multiple Sclerosis (MS). It has been a challenge for me to be engaged in my community. I am the person that has been living in the AHIC funded apartment for the last 5 years. This has given me the opportunity to live in a co-housing community. The opportunities to be engaged in Coho are tremendous. I can simply roll out the front door of my apartment and engage with my neighbors. I can simply use my wheel chair to attend event in the community common house and neighbors homes or just go outside and talk to somebody. AHIC has made all of this possible.
A Home in Community	130512		/users/profile/175984	volpemr	Client Served	5	10/28/2012	I am the current resident of the unit that was purchased by A Home In Community (AHIC). Living in CoHo Ecovillage for the last five years has been a life altering experience for me. I know and talk regularly with my neighbors. I feel like I am part of the community in CoHo which was never a feeling I had at the other places I rented. The community meals, community get-to-gathers such as barbeques, music events, movie nights, and work parties greatly increase my feeling that I am part of this community.
A Home in Community	213968		/users/profile/277182	D_Stanley	General Member of the Public	5	09/08/2014	As a strong believer in diversity, I find AHIC a shining example of a group effort to create a more caring and strong local community.
A Home in Community	213953		/users/profile/209649	Patricia Parcells	Donor	5	09/08/2014	I love being able to see my money in action.  Donating to AHIC produces a concrete result -- our neighborhood has a sense of inclusiveness because of the AHIC affordable units.  It keeps us all mindful about accessibility issues, so people's behavior changes.  
A Home in Community	158065		/users/profile/209649	Patricia Parcells	Donor	5	05/16/2013	AHIC provides a housing unit in a close-knit cohousing community for someone with physical disability and who lacks the means to buy into the community.  It integrates someone into a village-like atmosphere, someone who might otherwise live a very isolated life.  AHIC provides the financial means to enable the members of the community to then act as their best selves, taking care of one of their own in other ways.  AHIC makes the cohousing complex it occupies, and the entire neighborhood around it, a better and more humane place to live.  It keeps us, as neighbors, thinking about accessibility issues, when we might otherwise just not notice them.

A Home in Community	130795		/users/profile/176295	DebbyV	Board Member	5	10/29/2012	I am fortunate to be the President of the small and wonderful organization, A Home In Community.

A Home in Community	157439		/users/profile/208805	joeyk	Donor	5	05/09/2013	A Home In Community has very effective leadership and uses its funds quite efficiently. The concept of this organization is working extremely well -- its first recipient, Mike, is very involved in the community, and both he and the community benefit from his living here, which wouldn't be possible without AHIC. In addition, I believe the friendships and interactions he gets by living here encourages and allows him to be more active in the broader community, so the benefit of this nonprofit is indirectly spread to many others as well.
A Home in Community	157433		/users/profile/208788	r.e.hervey	Donor	5	05/09/2013	AHIC is important both for it's immediate impact on the life of its first tenant Mike Volpe and because of its promise for impacting many more similar people over time.  Mike is an amazing paraplegic (from MS).  He lives his life giving to others, yet without AHIC, there would be only his paid care givers to give back to him.  AHIC allows him to live in a caring cohousing community.  Living here he can visit friends via an easy unassisted exit out his door. Cohousing is a growing movement world wide.  AHIC's mission is to establish similar housing in other cohousing communities.  Communities who will benefit from exposure to someone like Mike.  Someone that will help many others see disabled folks as people with their own skills, strengths and weaknesses.  
A Home in Community	157410		/users/profile/176424	judhee	Donor	5	05/08/2013	I can see the impact that A Home In Community has right here in my neighborhood. It's so important to incorporate people with disabilities into our communities and our lives.
A Home in Community	130907		/users/profile/176424	judhee	General Member of the Public	5	10/29/2012	Mike is a valued member of our community and all our lives are richer by having him here. AHIC has made this possible and has enabled Mike to be here and be a part of this cohousing neighborhood. People with these kind of handicaps can become isolated in traditional housing situations and AHIC, and of course, Mike, have made his inclusion as a neighbor and a valued member of the community possible.
A Home in Community	156704		/users/profile/207835	Jess12	Volunteer	5	04/29/2013	Well-run organization that has a direct impact. I've been very pleased to have the opportunity to volunteer and become involved.

I am inspired to donate again this year and I can hardly wait to year's end to hear that we've raised another $10,000 and now there's only $30,000 left on that mortgage.  Way to go guys!
A Home in Community	155416		/users/profile/206322	susanhyne	Volunteer	5	04/19/2013	A Home in Community provides a unit in CoHo Ecovillage so that a disabled adult can live as our next-door neighbor.  The first tenant, Mike, is fully involved in community life.  A neighbor mounted a door opener on his wheelchair so Mike can go in/out of his front door and join in activities.  Mike is a favorite among the kids and dogs.  He even towed kids along the snowy path with his wheelchair.  And neighbors are close by to help Mike if a caregiver isn't around.  During a recent power outage, several folks stopped by Mike's unit to see if he needed anything.  Life in community is grand!
A Home in Community	131102		/users/profile/176642	Susie8	Donor	5	10/30/2012	AHIC is an incredibly efficient non-profit organization, whose purpose is to make it possible for people with disabilities to live affordably in cohousing, which not only enriches their lives but also the lives of those around them. I love having Mike as part of our community, not only for my sake but for that of my kids, who have grown up knowing him (my daughter, as a toddler, would see wheelchair symbols in parking lots and on buses and exclaim, "There's a Mike!"). It takes away the stigma around folks with disabilities in a more real way than words ever could. 
A Home in Community	130898		/users/profile/176415	Andy O.	Donor	5	10/29/2012	My friend Mike is able to live in our community thanks to AHIC's "A Home for Mike" project.  Even better, my young kids grow up with him as a positive role model, showing how someone confined to a wheelchair (Mike has ALS) can still be a vibrant contributor to a neighborhood.

It's great to be Mike's friend and neighbor (the only downside has been when I accidentally hit the controls to his power chair, causing it to run over my foot.....!) Here at CoHo we strive to be as diverse and inclusive as possible, and the AHIC home makes it possible for an adult with disabilities to have their own home in CoHo.

While my previous employer did provide employment assistance with a national outplacement firm, it was primarily through web-based seminars, which I found to have limited impact.  Having attended many of the career workshops offered by Northwest Family Services, I found them to be an ideal resource for my job search. I am particularly impressed with our facilitator, Rob Seemann, who brings a passion to his work, and really goes above and beyond with every class in order to address issues common to the group, as well as individual coaching and insights.  Great job Rob, and to Northwest Family Services!

Northwest Family Services	249718	2	/users/profile/337553	MacToff	Board Member	5	07/23/2015	Of all the non-profit organizations that I have supported over the years, none have touched my life more deeply than Northwest Family Services (NWFS).  My first involvement was more than 25 years ago when my wife and I attended a FACTS class with our oldest (then 13 yo) daughter.  We learned so much over the course of those 4 weekly sessions.  Our communication was not only enhanced with that daughter but those sessions helped us set appropriate boundaries and enhanced the character development of all of our seven children.  While our family has clearly benefited, the many programs offered by NWFS over more than 3 decades have improved the lives of literally hundreds of thousands of individuals throughout Oregon.  Further, its online educational resources, such as its Natural Family Planning curriculum, are being accessed by and benefiting individuals and couples all over the world.  NWFS is clearly an Oregon non-profit jewel!

Check out their free community builder lunch events (see nwfs.org) and learn why you should consider this organization above other worthy outfits.  I am honored to serve on the Board and encourage others to support NWFS.

To see the creative, effective poverty solutions designed and implemented for youth and families is exciting, and enriching. The entire staff of NWFS should be commended for their hard work, and pursuit of excellence in service to our communities. Even at a professional level, I am able to see that the director and staff make every dollar count, and are accountable for how each dollar is spent. NWFS is truly a first-class operation.

Northwest Family Services	249431		/users/profile/337253	Suzb	General Member of the Public	5	07/23/2015	My daughter and I had the pleasure of attending a class at providence hospital, put on by NWFS, about puberty, and general sex Ed specifically for girls and their mom's. It was fantastically informative and a great opportunity for my daughter to hear solid information about all the upcoming changes. Loved the healthy and faithful information on a basic intro to the natural process of reproduction and signs of fertility in our body. My daughter was really impressed and wants to know when and how to get NWFS in all the schools. More moms and daughters need to know about this tremendous resource. Thank you for the great, supportive, dignified and faithful work you do in our community.

Northwest Family Services	241903	1	/users/profile/328602	ygwilliams	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/30/2015	As the coordinator for National Educators to Stop Trafficking (NEST) I get the distinct privilege of receiving success stories from organizations who work in the anti-human trafficking arena and have written prevention curriculum and resources for educators. Here is one about the "Deceptions" program facilitated by NWFS. Thank you so much for bringing this program to our school! I was trafficked last year when I was thirteen and had some really bad things happen to me. Girls need to know this is really happening in our community, says a 14-year-old high school student. Vancouver Police Departments, Sergeant John Chapman explains, Unfortunately, in the past two years local law enforcement has learned that domestic minor sex trafficking is a very real problem that greatly impacts our community. It is very exciting to have a new curriculum presented in our schools that will warn our boys and girls of the dangers and consequences that lurk within innocent locations and relationships. We need to inform our kids and give them skills to recognize threats and retreat.

Northwest Family Services	237905		/users/profile/322869	erouffy	Client Served	5	02/11/2015	I am a public middle school educator who welcomed experts from NW Family Services into my classroom to educate eighth graders about suicide prevention. The teachers were outstanding. The curriculum was comprehensive and appropriate to the age group. They provided empowering information that allowed students to recognize the signs and symptoms of depression, and how to respond. My students were provided with a procedure that emotionally supported them in the event that the curriculum triggered difficult personal feelings. The presenters' knowledge of pedagogy and best teaching practices was very evident, as they kept the students focused and interactive. I am ready to advocate again and again for this tremendously valuable program. I am certain it reached many students directly, and likely will save a life/lives indirectly. Thank you!

Northwest Family Services	237078		/users/profile/321395	hunsakbc	Board Member	5	01/20/2015	I've witnessed the staff and volunteers at Northwest Family Services bring stability and joy back to Portland-area families that struggle with life's challenges.  This team's genuine concern and love for their neighbors radiates through their daily activities.  A few weeks ago I attended a health fair at Milwaukie High School that Northwest Family Services organized.  I was impressed at the resources that were provided:  everything from free flu shots to free dental care (local dentists actually set up a mobile office and were working on teeth long after the fair was scheduled to end).  No doubt that the man who received this dental care is now in a better position both physically and mentally.  His new confidence will surely lead to a more successful job interview, which will ultimately lead to family stability.  I'm proud to be affiliated with an organization that takes a long-term vision of improving lives, families and our Portland community.

Board Member	5	01/19/2015	As a kid growing-up in NewarK, NJ with an unstable family situation, there was no organization like NWFS in our community. I was lucky. My mother ensured that I had a strong support network outside of the home. Not many kids have that opportunity. I am honored and privileged to work with an organization that gives children and families the tools to succeed that I didn't have. We roll-up our sleeves up every day and get our hands dirty making significant impacts in the rich soil of people's lives. It doesn't get better than that!

Northwest Family Services	236233		/users/profile/320034	nutsandbolts	Client Served	5	01/03/2015	I've had wonderful and extremely healing care through NWFS. I've seen one of their counselors over the past 6 years and received the highest possible care of any counselor/therapist I've ever seen. Their guidance has seen me through a struggling marriage that ultimately ended in a planned separation and then divorce. During that time my ex-wife and I saw ~5 other counselors and therapists including separate counseling sessions, joint sessions, and group sessions. Although well-intended, these other services didn't have nearly the expertise or qualifications that NWFS did. NWFS had highly trained and certified counselors with a wide background of experience and varied specializations to match our needs. In subsequent years, their guidance has helped me through various life changes and challenges, including my father being diagnosed with cancer and the ensuing battle. Although I don't regularly see them anymore, I would unequivocally recommend their services to anyone.
Northwest Family Services	233890		/users/profile/297906	Vancouver	Client Served	5	11/18/2014	My husband and I have benefited so much from the counseling offered at NWFS in the past year.  Our counselors are extremely caring,  competent, dedicated, and compassionate professionals who, we feel strongly, treat us with respect and are genuinely interested in helping us resolve our seemingly unresolvable problems.  Our counseling experience elsewhere in the past was frustrating to us as we were directed to focus mainly on patching up various problems that never ceased to crop up at that time but weren't taught the necessary skills to overcome our problems.  In contrast, the counselors at NWFS never fail to listen to us patiently and attentively, identify/recognize deep-rooted problems from the past, offer us objective opinions and practical advice, and encourage us to grow as a couple, as well as reaching emotional maturity as individuals.  We are very much grateful for our counselors at NWFS and hope to continue our journey under their guidance.

Mollys Adopt a Sailor	203451		/users/profile/265385	Denise87	Volunteer	5	06/22/2014	I've been a member of NavyforMoms.com and Molly's Adopt A Sailor since 2008.  My sailor had already been in the military for well over 10 years when NavyforMoms found me.  I had come across a mailing about the organization and joined immediately as there was still so much I didn't understand. Each month Molly's Adopt A Sailor selects an adoptee from all branches of the military and sends them an array of care packages.  But the organization also provides a venue for the family members back home to find support, comfort and new friends.  As no one understand your situation better than another military family.  I have attended several and hosted packing parties over the years and have made some truly good friends.  Keep up the good work Molly! 
Mollys Adopt a Sailor	203142		/users/profile/264956	2catsn2sailors	Volunteer	5	06/17/2014	I have two children in the Navy, plus my daughter's fiance.  I found this group on the Navy For Mom's page, and have been involved with it for about a year. It's a wonderful experience. My daughter and her shipmates were adopted by another organization once, so I think about her stories every time I pack a sailor box.  They don't always tell you that it arrived, but hey, our military work really long hours when they are underway.  I've also gotten involved with Molly's special hugs projects, shipping boxes to other branches. One of the contact people takes the time to write a personal thank you to each person who sends a box. Given how busy they are, it's very touching to know that a simple box from home means so much to them: A sign that people care.

It amazed me how organized, dedicated, sharing, caring, and friendly the group was since everyone who volunteers is spread out all over the country.  Working together they have accomplished some hefty and amazing tasks.  I know their outreach to so many in our military has been a blessing.
Mollys Adopt a Sailor	202615		/users/profile/264345	annlinderman	Volunteer	5	06/11/2014	I stumbled across Molly's Adopt a Sailor through Navy 4 Moms when my daughter joined the Navy.  It is one of the best organizations of which I have been a part.  Military moms (and dads) become family through the mere fact that our children have chosen to serve.  We may never meet face to face but I would do anything I could to help these moms or their children.  We share family stories and cheer and cry for events in another moms day.  It is heartwarming to receive emails from our "adoptees" thanking us for the boxes from home.  Some of these servicemen/women never receive a box from family for any number of reasons.  To receive a package means so much to them.  I will be a part of this group long after my daughter leaves the Navy.  To know I can brighten just one person's day or offer support in any number ways makes it all worthwhile.  I love Molly Moms!!

Volunteers donate and ship packages every month. Encouraging letters and cards are included, and many volunteers make homemade pillowcases so the troops can have something to remind them of home, when they lay their head down. I can't imagine how our deployed would feel without the kindness and generosity of this non-profit organization. They need to know that they are appreciated and loved. I have met some of the kindest and caring people in this group. You should volunteer to help this outstanding group if you can. There are so many ways to help!!!

Mollys Adopt a Sailor	202555		/users/profile/264276	Carolyn75	General Member of the Public	5	06/11/2014	After I became a Navy mom, I was searching for other moms out there in the same boat (pun intended) as my myself. I found that in Navy4Moms. Along the way I was introduced to Molly's Adopt a Sailor. It's run by fellow Navy moms that love sharing a little bit of home to our deployed troops. Despite the name, MAS ships to ALL branches of our military. Each month they find a group, whether on land or at sea, to adopt. They get the word out and those that want to volunteer get the requested items and package them up to ship on the predetermined date. People (I hesitate to say just moms because there are so many out there that do this) from all over the US help to make this happen. School age kids and those in nursing homes make cards, draw pictures, send words of encouragement along with the goodies. I recommend getting on their website and checking out all MAS does for our troops. There are so many other ways they support and encourage them! Heads-at-Ease is an awesome project that has taken on a life of its own. They make pillowcases to send to our military.....a simple but powerful gesture. (Most recently they sent pillowcases to the victims of Ft. Hood and their families, again. :( )  There's also a section where cards are sent to our wounded warriors and others who have been injured. I highly recommend Molly's Adopt a Sailor as a great non-profit group!  There's something for everyone everyone, regardless of financial means, to help support our troops!! Their motto says it all: We Ship Love....... and they do!!
Mollys Adopt a Sailor	202550	1	/users/profile/264271	ljradabaugh	General Member of the Public	5	06/11/2014	I met Molly during a grant contest. It just so happens that my daughter was deployed at the time. The organization was just beginning but changing lives.  Several military "kids" received packages. They boost morale, provide needed supplies and feel like a hug from home. The packages seem to be delivered when needed the most.  It is sad we must rely on citizens to provide basic things to our military. Several of my "kids" feel like they are forgotten until something like a package from the States.  One said it was better than Christmas.

My son just returned from a 9 month deployed protecting our freedom (yours too) and Mollys Adopt a Sailor brought his ship happiness during a very very long deployment by send care packages (filled with all kinds of things from magazines, candy, food snacks, cards, socks, shaving kits, shampoo, body wash, ladies products my list could go on) to the ship.  Mollys Adopt a Sailor is just not for the Navy, but Air Force, Army, Marines and Coast Guard.  We are all volunteers and 100% of every dollar raised goes directly to supporting our deployed military by sending these care packages from home all over the world.  Mollys wants our deployed military Men/Women to know that there sacrifices are appreciated and to know that they are loved, missed and not forgotten.  It is hard for our deployed Men/Women to miss family/friends events but they know they have a job to do yes a job to do protecting our freedom. As for your comment that this group is ran by a group of emotional military moms  that may be true and thank God it is.  This group is passion, emotional about giving back and doesnt expect anything in return. So please dont forget to include ours passion/emotional group of  Dads, Wifes, Husbands, Sons, Daughters, Brothers, Sisters, Aunts, Uncles and Cousins that come out to volunteer. Mollys adopts a Sailor ROCKS! Im honored to be a part of this wonderful group.  So User 308301 consider me Emotional as well as Passion about volunteering my time for our Men and Women serving our country!

It has become a passion for me to help our deployed troops know that they are not forgotten and that their service is appreciated and needed. My son has been out of the Navy for almost a year now but I continue to support MAS and send care packages and pillowcases to the deployed heroes and the combat hospitals. Getting Thank You's from those who have received them is just blessings I never expect!  Not every service member has a loving supportive family waiting on them or some can't afford to send needed items to those who are deployed and that is where Molly's Adopt a Sailor helps! MAS supports all branches! MAS may have started out as a group of Navy moms but it is such a diverse group now. There are moms, dads, aunts, uncles, grandparents, siblings, friends and just those who support our military who are involved now. I am from Oklahoma and I have friends who live all over the USA with one thing in common...we all support our military!  Whoever wrote the negative comment should be ashamed that they are spreading gossip! Unless you were there and witnessed this so called misappropriation of funds, then you have no business trying to smear the good work that MAS does! To all of our military, present, past and future, THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE!!! As long as you need us, we will be here supporting you!

Mollys Adopt a Sailor	194723		/users/profile/254483	lauraj	Volunteer	5	02/23/2014	Molly's Adopt a Sailor is a fantastic all volunteer group.  100% of every dollar raised goes directly to supporting our deployed military by sending care packages from home. I am offended by the comments posted by "user308301". The group is not comprised of a group of "emotional military moms".  Dad, husbands, brothers and sisters are all members of the group.  The majority of the volunteers have degrees and advanced degrees.  The group is organized and refined.No funds were ever used or misused by anyone in this group.  100% of every dollar supports our military!  As a volunteer I can testify that we care deeply about the happiness & welfare of all of our deployed military.  In addition to the military units that contact Molly's for a monthly adoption, Molly's also supports several combat hospitals, assisting with their special requests.  The motto "We Ship Love" is 100% accurate for this fantastic group of volunteers!
Mollys Adopt a Sailor	194686	2	/users/profile/254430	user308301	Client Served	2	02/21/2014	Molly's is a great concept but ran with too much emotion and lack of expertise. Funds have been misappropriately used and donations from companies for the group to hand out have been used far to often for some of the moms "kids." It has been reported that during a trip to san diego a group of molly's moms bought many alcoholic drinks for marines and sailors at a well known restaurant, half of which were underage. It was said that there was a bit too much partying and favoritism involved. There is a lot of bias involved which is somewhat understandable from a group ran by emotional military moms. It is a fantastic concept and a group full of big hearted people. I hope to see some changes in the future and their overall goal is a great concept.

I have been a fairly regular participant for two years. Molly's Adopt a Sailor has a great mission to all our military and is a project that really makes their day!
Mollys Adopt a Sailor	130804		/users/profile/176307	Lorraine7	Volunteer	5	10/29/2012	Molly's Adopt a Sailor is a group of military Moms who check out a new adoption each month and send care packages to deployed sailors, soldiers, Marines, Air Force and even Coasties. It is so much fun that I'm addicted! I was in charge of one of the adoptions this summer. Now I'm even doing the Special Hugs project most months by sending packages to some military hospitals overseas. Whether we send one box or organize a packing party with many boxes being prepared, it's something I look forward to each month. Each Mom of the Month tries to bring out the fun in each adoption so our military are best served by our efforts. Some of the thank you's have included comments like "I haven't received any mail in months. Thanks for your package!" It's very satisfying to know we have lifted their spirits and let them know they're not forgotten. Molly's is a great organization.

Through the efforts of our volunteers we manage to cover adoptions of every type imaginable.  From our first of 250, to a largest of over 2,300, our volunteers group together across the entire country to send love to our deployed troops of all military branches, and our overseas hospitals.  We sew pillowcases, we collect goodies requested, we pack boxes every month, and we sometimes end up adopting a recipient as a family member.   The sense of family cannot be stressed enough.  I have met and made the best friends through our volunteer work.  While we know we cannot always hear back from those who receive our boxes or pillowcases, we know in our hearts that our work is appreciated.  When someone is able to write or email, the thank you's literally make us tear up.   Come join us for warm fuzzies through your volunteer work. 
Mollys Adopt a Sailor	194679		/users/profile/254421	Ruth40	Volunteer	5	02/21/2014	I have now organized five Molly's Adopt a Sailor "packing parties."  Through donations of needed and desired items for the military, we've sent shipments of 2, 6, 45, 65, and 76 boxes.  It just gets better as word spreads to the public.  Our military loves MAS and so does our community.  It's a great way to be involved and feel helpful and hopeful.  My American Legion Auxiliary donates a place to hold our party; churches, schools, banks, Girl Scouts, Boy Scouts, military veterans and families, other civic organizations, and individuals have all become involved donating and packing the day of the party.  MAS has helped with all the information we need to be successful.

We adopt a deployed unit every month, support combat hospitals in Afghanistan, and do Welcome Home events. We have moms who sew pillowcases so each month every adoptee receives one. We recruit family and friends to bring supplies to packing parties where boxes are filled for shipping. This group is 100% volunteer and 100% of all funds received are used to purchase items requested by the troops and to ship those items. The thank you notes we receive, bring us all close to tears. It is, indeed, an honor and a privilege to be a part of this wonderful organization. It is also an honor to make a difference in the lives of our deployed troops.

Some times it is just cards and letters, other times it is pillowcases, candy, personal care items.  One year we sent a Christmas tree!

MAS sends care packages and other things to our deployed military to let them know that they are not forgotten and that they are appreciated for their sacrifices. Being away from family and friends for long periods of time is hard on them and MAS tries to help with morale. I have had the privilege of traveling to different states to help other Molly Moms volunteer by packing care packages and once I was able to welcome home sailors that had been deployed for many many months! When some of those sailors gave me a hug and told me 'thank you' for remembering them and sending pillowcases and care packages, it just made my heart melt. They were the ones that needed a parade and a huge WELCOME HOME!! Being a Molly Mom is trully a blessing! The morale builder that MAS does is unmeasurable!!
Mollys Adopt a Sailor	109874		/users/profile/95704	Marybeth G.	Volunteer	5	04/14/2012	Molly's Adopt a Sailor is a 100% volunteer $0 salary/overhead charity that ships care packages to our deployed troops on ships, bases and hospitals across the globe.   Started in June 2008, we have already adopted over 20,000 Sailors, Marines, and Soldiers.  We adopt a different group every month, and Military Moms and communities from around the country host packing parties and collect donations of snacks, toiletries, and little touches of love from home.  We Stitch Love is our pillowcase project -  handmade or decorated pillowcases for the troops to lay their heads on.  The Special Hugs project has adopted combat support hospitals in Afghanistan to send love to our wounded troops.    We rely solely on volunteers, donations and grants.

Mollys Adopt a Sailor	85713		/users/profile/95704	Marybeth G.	Volunteer	5	04/14/2011	What I love most about Molly's Adopt A Sailor is how far they've come in such a short amount of time.  In less than 3 years this group went from writing a few letters to Navy recruits in bootcamp with no support from home to shipping hundreds of care packages each month to deployed Sailors, Soldiers & Marines around the globe.    The camaraderie amongst "Molly Moms" is contagious and infectious.   LOVE YOU MOLLY!

We were out to sea for yet another deployment and packages started rolling in around four and a half months into it...with enough pillowcases to outfit our entire squadron of close to 300 people. Nothing says we care like a new pillowcases and a note from home. Thanks Molly's Adapt a Sailor.

Mollys Adopt a Sailor	99168		/users/profile/118652	Nancy23456789	Volunteer	5	10/10/2011	As a Molly mom I am privileged to work with some wonderful women (and some men) all across the country. My part in the group is to make sure everyone of our adoptees receive a home made pillowcase. It is a personal reminder to our troops that every day they are supported and cared about. Our group is 100% volunteer and every month we have more and more join us in our passion of sending hundreds of letters, cards, pillowcases and care packages to that month's adopted group. MAS is also growing and our Special Hugs area is charged with supporting our wounded in Combat Hospitals. Our We Stitch Love area coordinates the stitchers and decorators of our pillowcase efforts. I love this group and what it does. I am a Navy mom and it makes my days brighter to know that I am sending my support and love to our military, especially those who have little or no support from home. 
Mollys Adopt a Sailor	85838		/users/profile/95892	Donna L.	Volunteer	5	04/14/2011	The thing I like the most about Molly's Adopt A Sailor is that everyone is included as having an equally important part.  Some months Moms can't afford to buy items or attend a packing party, but then can write letters, cards and notes.  As more than one member of the military has told us -- "The goodies are great, but once eaten they are gone.  The mail you send can be read and re-read!"
Mollys Adopt a Sailor	85806		/users/profile/95849	Cheryl S.	Volunteer	5	04/14/2011	Molly's Adopt A Sailor is an organization unlike any other I have come upon. Made up almost entirely of Moms' who love and support their military and it's deployed service members, 'they ship love' from home.  Nothing brightens the day of a deployed sailor, soldier or marine like mail from home, and these Moms write letters and fill care packages with more love than you can imagine, all to show how much we care. If you've ever wanted to feel passionate about something, this is it. Navy, Army, Marines or Air Force... Molly's loves them all!!

Vestibular Disorders Association	277664	8	/users/profile/367482	Glenn S.	Volunteer	5	01/21/2016	I was diagnosed with a terrible vestibular disorder called Meniere's disease back in 2011, and for a long time everything seemed hopeless. I had a terrible doctor and so much of what I could find online only made me feel worse...Except for VEDA. The Vestibular Disorders  Association was my one source of hope and good information in those early days.Unfortunately, vestibular disorders are not widely understood by both patients and doctors. VEDA exists to correct this imbalance by educating doctors and empowering patients to advocate for themselves.Navigating the waters of a vestibular disorder is a terrifying ordeal, but thanks to VEDA, we don't have to do it alone.

We quickly discover, we don't know it all!           After a long period of floundering with the aftermath of my diagnosis with Labyrinthitis in 2002, VEDA quickly became my lifeline. Their information and reference  material have been priceless to me, after feeling isolated for many years. I recently became an Ambassador for VEDA and want to thank VEDA for their support, pulling me out of a very deep hole! 
Vestibular Disorders Association	276707	1	/users/profile/366521	Writer	Donor	5	01/15/2016	From the time I discovered VEDA, it's been my go-to for information about treatments, lifestyle changes and practitioners. That first year, I became a member and have made a donation annually. The one thing that doctors routinely fail to do is to provide information. A diagnosis is the start of a new life. VEDA, among other things. fills that informational void.
Vestibular Disorders Association	276692		/users/profile/366503	jsg1	Donor	5	01/15/2016	My go-to whenever I need a new practitioner or when I need to help a friend who has a vestibular disorder.  All of the disorders are somewhat amorphous - they cannot scan inside your ear so it is hard to find the exact diagnosis.  This site is filled with terrific medical information.  It also highlights others experiences so that you know you are not alone.  Most importantly I have found the top MDs, PTs and other providers in the US by using this site.  Whenever I hear of someone with vertigo, Meniere's, bppv or any other related disorder I know they will find the most reliable information on this site.

It's difficult enough to have medical challenges, this group provides an outstanding service!
Vestibular Disorders Association	276611	1	/users/profile/366419	Judy155	Donor	5	01/14/2016	In a period of three short months four years ago my life completely changed. Raging vertigo lasting seven hours and more, pulsating tinnitus, hearing loss, and sensory sensitivities that I had never encountered, nor could have imagined. Who can imagine what a broken vestibular system feels like when all your life it had supported you flawlessly. I was sent to doctor, after doctor, and then I also started researching for myself and found VEDA online and finally all the pieces came together to complete one picture: Menieres I had a vestibular condition called Menieres. From that day on VEDA became a constant resource of support and encouragement. VEDA was a beacon of light at a very dark time and for that I say sincere thanks VEDA. Judy McNamara Tripp

After hearing about VEDA, and reading all the research and articles posted, I knew exactly what My condition was. That has since been confirmed through proper diagnoses  at Johns Hopkins, that I have VM, secondary BPPV and possibly CSD. VEDA is constant source of valuable evidence based research, new potential treatments and the emotional support that we all so need!
Vestibular Disorders Association	276590	1	/users/profile/366393	Writer	Client Served	5	01/14/2016	VEDA publishes information on current research for people with vestibular disorders. One study correlated low Vitamin D with the onset of BPPV in postmenopausal women. I showed the info to my medical doctor, she had my level tested and found it low. So with Vitamin D supplements and monitoring of my Vitamin D levels, I have been symptom free for a year and a half. This correlation was shared with my vestibular physical therapist who has been sharing with her patients. VEDA is able to be a clearinghouse of current research and information to help those with vestibular problems. I am grateful to the organization for giving me a way to control, but not cure my BPPV. Thank you. I donate to this organization so that others will be helped.

The hearing loss included loss of balance and acute dizziness, and sight problems.   I had to quit working.  6 months ago I found VEDA.  Following their advice, I started physical therapy with a therapist recommended on the site.  I had psychological counseling as well.  I am working with training a hearing dog.  My dizziness is much less and  I am improving the balance issue.  There is nothing to be done about the hearing loss, but I am adjusting to it as well.     The understanding expressed on VEDA has helped me educate my friends and family.  Thank you VEDA.

Vestibular Disorders Association	219024	2	/users/profile/282642	cmjw14	Client Served	5	10/01/2014	I endured 23 years of progressively worsening Meniere's Disease - alone.  I knew of no one who could identify with me.  My doctors simply didn't have enough information or education about my condition.  I think of the years of guessing at treatments while slowing devolving into a shell of the person I had once been.  For myself, discovering VEDA came after life-altering destructive surgery, as I was learning how to make my 'new normal' the best possible.  I can't find the correct descriptive words to give someone an idea of what emotions I experienced as I devoured the information on VEDA's site.  Sadly - I found VEDA on my own as I Googled information that might help me heal.  Why didn't my slew of medical professionals refer me?  Why didn't they hand me some of VEDA's very consumer-friendly literature?  Why didn't I see a flyer in one of the myriad of doctor's offices?  These days, I belong to a number of vestibular support groups - and at least daily I am giving their information to someone who feels as lost, confused and afraid as I was.  Someone has to help get VEDA out there - why not someone who owes so much of her quality of life to their outreach?

At that time there was no information available aside from VEDA either online or in print. Whether it's tips on how to describe my symptoms or clear information on causes, symptoms and treatments or vestibular disorders, VEDA provides the most current, helpful information. The directory of vestibular professionals is also very helpful as well as the patient support groups.

Vestibular Disorders Association	192676	1	/users/profile/251611	Babaone	Client Served	5	01/16/2014	I have been connected with VEDA since I was initially diagnosed with Vestibular "Neuronitis" in 1986 (pre-MRI; I am allergic to CT contrast medium;). At that time the research and growing body of information available through VEDA helped me to understand the symptoms I was experiencing, especially the varied distortions in my balance the dramatic changes in cognitive processes. VEDA has LITERALLY saved my sanity and self-confidence over the years since the initial onset. That is not an understatement!In the mid 1980's physicians were largely unaware of symptoms of vestibular disorders. I was fortunate to have worked with an ENT surgeon who quickly pinpointed the likely vestibular origin of my symptoms. However subsequent referrals by my primary care to neurologists brought very unpleasant, pejorative evaluations and allusions to malingering and psychiatric origins. I believe VEDA has been a major catalyst and leader in furthering awareness of vestibular disorders among physicians, the development of PT reeducation of balance, research to provide further information, support to and from specialists.... so many positive developments in a life-altering yet largely invisible disease process.  I was a highly functioning RN working in the operating room at the time of onset. After 6 months away from work, mostly housebound, much of the time sleeping and regaining a semblance of balance, I found that I was unable to prioritize and re-prioritize without extreme effort and hesitation, unworkable and unsafe for patients. Information from VEDA assisted me in decisions to move to other areas of nursing. And it helped me compensate for chronic disabilities and the accompanying fatigue. It also was a source of reassurance in a few situations when coworkers judged my situation harshly.  I have been fortunate to have been able to learn to compensate or leave behind prior pleasures (bicycling, skiing,) adjust my lifestyle and continue in my profession over the past 25+ years. As I am aging, I experience the subtle decline in balance and abilities to multitask are further challenged by the underlying chronic vestibular disability. PT is a valuable assistance. And VEDA continues to be a source of valuable information. I introduce VEDA to physicians, friends and acquaintances who are experiencing inner ear symptoms.VEDA is worthy of all the support we can muster; the money is well-used and the results are indeed life changing.

For many years I've utilized VEDA's excellent and reliable patient education materials, their resources for professionals and their Provider Directory to help people find help from vestibular medical professionals in their area.Now that I am fortunate enough to be on the Board of Directors, I've come to appreciate the hard work, passion and dedication from those 'behind the scenes' and am amazed by how much is accomplished by so few.  We are committed to serving and advocating for those with vestibular disorders, with the vision of an international community where vestibular patients are rapidly recognized, diagnosed and treated.Those with vestibular disorders frequently encounter a lack of understanding and support from their medical, insurance, employment and social communities.  VEDA is working hard to change this, so I encourage everyone who has or cares for a person with a vestibular disorder to consider joining and supporting this wonderful and necessary organization.

The Oregon Jewish Museum did an expert job in making this available to the public and with the teaching their staff provided to us.  Thank you OJM.
Oregon Jewish Museum Inc	21804	8	/users/profile/22946	Sharon	Volunteer	5	11/07/2009	My experience began many years ago with a position on the board. I spend a couple of hours, once a week, archiving the material of Portland Section National Council of Jewish Women & The Historic Neighborhood House.  I'm part of a team of 4 who have been working on this project for 5 years under the expert eye of Anne Prahl, the curator.I am also an interviewer for the Oregon Oral History Project at the museum.I am so impressed with the staff, interns and volunteers at the museum for their tireless work in a setting that is anything but luxurious.I feel the museum is important for our state.  Our Jewish population is small and our history is being well perserved by very capable, caring people.
Oregon Jewish Museum Inc	21781	5	/users/profile/22928	Sara B	Donor	5	11/06/2009	Here's what I love about the Oregon Jewish Museum: it is truly open to all, Jews and non-Jews alike! As someone who is married to a Non-Jew, and one who has a Jewish cultural (but not spiritual) identity, my spouse and I both feel comfortable and fully welcomed at the Museum! We've taken advantage of the Museum's varied offerings by attending stellar exhibits, compelling book discussions, scholarly lectures, astounding theatre productions, and moving musical events. The Oregon Jewish Museum reaches out to the entire community with a message of diversity, tolerance, and acceptance. We love it!

I am looking forward to going back.
Oregon Jewish Museum Inc	21644	5	/users/profile/22782	Liz	General Member of the Public	5	11/05/2009	The museum hosted an awesome street fair this summer which my friend invited me to.  We ate donuts, did free art projects, and danced to 3 live bands.  Hundreds of people filled up the street and created an energy I've never seen before in Old Town.  I hope they do another event like this next summer! So much fun!!
Oregon Jewish Museum Inc	21555	4	/users/profile/22694	TonyL	General Member of the Public	5	11/05/2009	I was working on an essay about minorities in Oregon and called Oregon Jewish Museum. The curator and one of the interns helped me find exactly what I needed both within and outside the museum. I can't thank them enough.
Oregon Jewish Museum Inc	21020	4	/users/profile/22139	leonard2009	Volunteer	5	10/31/2009	In 1966 I joined the faculty of Pacific University in Forest Grove, Oregon - quite a transition for one born, raised, educated, and employed on the east coast. I retired at age 65, following a 5-year reduced load phase out. My family and I affiliated with the Portland Jewish community immediately after arriving in Oregon, and have participated in many Jewish events over the years. Driving time from our home to Congregation Neveh Shalom, our present affiliation, is 45-60 minutes, depending on traffic, which has somewhat limited our involvement. During my retirement phase-out I had more free time and began to do more volunteer work in Portland. Rabbi emeritus Joshua Stampfer of Congregation Neveh Shalom , provided leadership in creating the Oregon Holocaust Resource Center (OHRC), the Institute of Judaic Studies, and the Oregon Jewish Museum (OJM). We joined all three organizations as they were established and have maintained our membership through the years. I donated a desktop computer, which I had built and used in my teaching and research, to OHRC in response to an appeal in their newsletter. Then I began to volunteer there on a weekly basis, initially to set up the computer and install software. Next I became involved with their ongoing Oral History project, making duplicates of their collection of audio and video cassette tapes, then transcribing them. Following retirement and the relocation of OHRC to Pacific University, I was able to volunteer on a daily basis and expand my activities. Before long, I created and managed the OHRC website, edited and published 2 quarterly newsletters, and created and maintained membership and mailing list databases. I continued this full-time volunteering for another 3 years, but following a change in Board of Trustees membership, appointment of a new Executive Director, and a shift of priorities, I was no longer comfortable with working conditions and ended my stint at OHRC. In a few months an ad appeared in Art and Artifacts, newsletter of the Oregon Jewish Museum, seeking a volunteer to assume management of the Museum's website (www.ojm.org). The timing was perfect: I applied, was accepted, and served as webmaster for over 10 years. I received instructions from the Museum Director, from the Curator, and from the Office Manager for updates and changes to the website. Given limitations of time and resources (from its inception the Museum has been seriously underfunded), I was limited to one afternoon per week. The Museum lacked suitable computer hardware and software, I carried my instructions home and did the webmastering there, often working well past midnight. In time I began receiving my instructions more and more via email and doing all the work at home. One of the Museum's deficiencies was a working flatbed scanner. Having had some experience with such a tool, I could recommend to the Director a specific make and model that would serve our needs, and she was able to find a donor to purchase that very tool. I was able to "show the ropes" about using the scanner to the three ladies who formed the permanent staff, all of whom quickly learned and became expert. This has proved a godsend to the Museum, which takes pride in its vast photographic archive, which documents the Jewish experience in Oregon from earliest times to the present. With the new scanner, and a great deal of time, this entire archive has been scanned and digitial images stored to hard drive. Over the years I used many of these digital images on our website. By a stroke of luck, the Curator's father is a professional photographer. When he visits his daughter in Portland (from Chicago) he brings along his bag of cameras, lenses, and lights, He generously donates his time to photographing all the items in the Museum's collection. So our photographic collection now includes digital images of all objects in the archive. During my tenure as webmaster, I uploaded the entire collection of archive images to the website. Another ongoing OJM activity in which I play a significant role is an oral history project. Beginning in the early 1970's and extending into the early 1980's, long before the birth of OJM, some perspicacious Jewish women began recording, on audio cassettes, personal memories of elderly Jewish Oregonians. An effort was made to have these tapes transcribed and safeguarded. After OJM was created these old tapes and transcriptions came into its possession, and the oral history project was resumed. Many of the old tapes showed signs of neglect and appeared fragile. I learned of this oral history project when I began at OJM, and how anxious the director was to duplicate as many of these old tapes as possible and to preserve them in a carefully controlled enviornment. When the Director approached me about doing the duplicating, I researched the matter and became convinced that since newly minted cassette tapes deteriorate with each playing and have a limited shelf life, even if unused, a better approach would be to digitize the recordings, do some sound editing, and then burn them to CD's. I was able to pursuade the Director and I obtained (out of pocket) a dubbing audio cassette player, and on eBay (also out of pocket) 200 Kodak gold and silver recordable blank CD's (with a projected shelf life of more than 100 years). During my volunteer days at the Museum, I carefully duplicated old tapes. At the end of my shift I took the duplicate tapes home with me. At home I played the cassettes with my home stereo player coupling the line out jack to the audio in jack of my desktop computer, and digitizing and recording the audio using the open source sound recorder/editor, Audacity. I used Audacity to improve sound quality, then saved the edited file in .WAV format to my hard drive. Next I used the Nero Burning ROM suite to burn the file(s) to the Kodak CD's. On my next trip to the Museum I returned the duplicate cassette tapes and delivered the CD's of the interviews. This first phase of the oral history project generated nearly 200 CD's. I am now involved with phase 2, having learned much about sound recording and editing, and about burning CD's. The current phase involves use of inkjet recordable CD's and my home Epson direct CD printer. Within the past year the Director found the resources to obtain a couple of digital voice recorders, which the Curator and I have been promoting for several years. Now our interviewers can generate high quality digital audio on the recorder's memory, which I can then download onto my computer hard drive, edit, and burn to CD, avoiding the need to make cassette duplicate tapes and try to record from them. I have already made nearly 200 more CD's from this second phase, and there are many more subjects to be interviewed.
Oregon Jewish Museum Inc	21001	4	/users/profile/22123	Jill	Client Served	5	10/31/2009	I brought my class to an exhibit at Oregon Jewish Museum. It was a super way to get my kids engaged in the issue of tolerance and to examine the Oregon's history of diversity and intolerance. The conversations extended for days after our visit, thanks to the great presentation by the director, Judy Margles, and the thorough exhibit. It was presented in an attractive, accessible manner that the kids could understand and appreciate - and I could too!
Oregon Jewish Museum Inc	21000	5	/users/profile/22121	Edna	Client Served	5	10/31/2009	When I was doing research on Portland history in the early 1900s, Oregon Jewish Museum provided me with many excellent first-hand accounts and photos - they really rounded out my knowledge of the period.
Oregon Jewish Museum Inc	20998	6	/users/profile/22119	Jericho	Volunteer	5	10/31/2009	I cannot say enough about the Oregon Jewish Museum. I first became involved with OJM as a volunteer when I was in college, helping to catalog and prepare archival material, and doing research for exhibits. The wealth of primary resources, in the form of interview transcripts, ephemera, primary documents and artifacts makes OJM an invaluable resource for anyone doing research on Jewish life in the Pacific Northwest. Exhibits at OJM are consistently thoughtful, as well as well presented and well-researched. Their presence is especially important in the relatively young town of Portland, with its youthful population and rapid development. Alas, my present schedule prevents me from volunteering  at OJM, but I continue to benefit from the excellent exhibits and from their fine work with the schools in the Portland metro area.
Oregon Jewish Museum Inc	20937	5	/users/profile/22061	joycegail1	Board Member	5	10/30/2009	I am a new member of the Board of Directors.  In my short time on the board, I am very impressed with all aspects of the museum.  The entire staff is very dedicated and has great vision as to what the museum is and can be to the community.  They are currently in the process of moving locations and all programs, events and exhibits have been carefully planned to provide the best space for the museum.  They are continually working on new programs to involve and benefit the community.  The board is also very involved and enthusiastic about every aspect of the museum - from fundraising, exhibits and communtiy outreach.  All in all, I am happy to be involved and look forward to my future experiences with Oregon Jewish Museum.
Oregon Jewish Museum Inc	20936	5	/users/profile/22060	A	Former staff	5	10/30/2009	The Oregon Jewish Museum is exceptional in everyway: innovative programming and community events, thought provoking exhibitions, dedicated resource to the greater Northwest, and unsurpassed staff.  I had the privilege of interning with OJM a few years ago, and I saw the great lengths that the staff and board members go to make this institution accessible, relevant, and inviting.  The evidence of this is their brand new building that they will be moving into this winter. I cannot say enough good things about OJM, their board, staff, volunteers, and the work that they produce.  Any community would be lucky to have an institution like the Oregon Jewish Museum.
Oregon Jewish Museum Inc	20918	5	/users/profile/22038	Sam236	Volunteer	5	10/30/2009	I am a new resident in the Portland area and am not familiar with local Jewish history.  My volunteer experience in the archive department has been extremely informative and interesting.  I work in a very amiable atmosphere which certainly has a bearing on my continuing involvement in the museum for many years to come.
Oregon Jewish Museum Inc	20842	5	/users/profile/21966	msw	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/30/2009	This organization produces creative and stimulating exhibitions on a shoestring budget. I know the staff to be talented and dedicated and I've always enjoyed working with them.
Oregon Jewish Museum Inc	20640	5	/users/profile/21768	leb	General Member of the Public	5	10/29/2009	The Oregon Jewish Museum, with its exhibits and archives, has enabled me, and others like me, toconnect with the lives, experiences, struggles and contributions to the greater society of Jews during the last 150 years, not in some far off places but right here in our own state.  Much ofthe material the Museum has gathered and displayed was previously unknown to most of us.It has provided me, my family, and other families, among them non-Jews, with a greater understading of "our" role in Oregon's history.
Oregon Jewish Museum Inc	20170	2	/users/profile/21338	gloria1947	Volunteer	5	10/28/2009	This wonderful organization has always done remarkable work on a small budget because of the strength of passionate, hard-working volunteers and passionate, highly competent staff.  I have volunteered in many capacities -on committees, on the board, on the executive board as President - and enjoyed working with this organization because of the obvious dedication and hard work of volunteers and staff.  Everyone involved, and there are A LOT of us, seems clear about the mission of the organization:  preserving and presenting the history of the Jews in Oregon to our own community and to the wider community.  The organization brilliantly combines exhibit presentation with archival preservation.  I feel great pride and satisfaction from my involvement with this young (21 years old), vibrant, growing, gem of an organization.
Oregon Jewish Museum Inc	20118	2	/users/profile/21291	Heather	Volunteer	5	10/27/2009	In September of 2008 I was named the Sara Glasgow Cogan Scholarship recipient and began an internship with the Oregon Jewish Museum. Through my internship I have been given the opportunity to grow and tackle new challenges. My major task has been to research and assist in the development of an upcoming exhibit on Jewish professionals. My internship ended in January but I continue with the museum on a volunteer basis. I have been working with OJM for a little over a year now and what keeps me coming back is every day I learn something new. As a non native Portlander OJM has been an invaluble resource for me in getting to know about, not only the Portland Jewish community but about Portland itself. It is, in no small part, through the comittment and dedication of the director, the entire staff and fellow volunteers of OJM that this is possible.
Oregon Jewish Museum Inc	20089	2	/users/profile/21259	elijah	Volunteer	5	10/27/2009	The OJM fulfills an essential role in the local Jewish community by acquiring and exhibiting material related to the Jewish experience in Oregon over the last 150 years and by providing a venue to discuss contemporary local and national issues. When it moves to larger quarters in a few months, these activities will only increase and expand. As a new-to-Portland volunteer working with the archives and interviewing interesting natives, I have become immersed in the community's history and its people, much to my enjoyment and enlightenment. The OJM is a wonderful place run by a dedicated staff and engaging interns and volunteers. It can only get better in its new space.
Oregon Jewish Museum Inc	20084	2	/users/profile/21254	Andrea	Client Served	5	10/27/2009	I am pleased to share my experience with OJM over the past many years and highly recommend it.  OJM plays a unique and important role in the Portland/Oregon Jewish and non-Jewish communities.  It serves those who are looking to understand the Jewish experience, both locally and nationally; to experience an art museum show in an intimate setting; and to use valuable research resources.  Those who work and volunteer at OJM bring a high level of enthusiasm and commitment -- and the upcoming move to a new space will only enhance the many things OJM provides to the community.
Oregon Jewish Museum Inc	20083	1	/users/profile/21253	PRM	Donor	5	10/27/2009	Portland has a rich and varied Jewish history and presence. Temple Beth Israel just celebrated its 150th birthday, having had noted Rabbis including Stephen and Jonah Wise.  South Portland was a thriving ethnic community with Jews, Greeks, Italians and other immigrants who enriched this older German Jewish community.  All of this is diligently being recorded and revitalized by the Oregon Jewish Museum which has an incredible education and outreach, as well as archival program.  On top of this it has initiated art exhibits of national significance, such as a nationally traveling Arnold Mesches exhibit.  This small museum is the glue which holds this vibrant Oregon Jewish community together.  Now that it is moving into a wonderful new facility - four times the size of its present facility - it will play an increasingly important part in the lives, not only of the Jews of Oregon, but for all Oregonians!
Oregon Jewish Museum Inc	20075	3	/users/profile/21244	Leoadlerfan	Client Served	5	10/27/2009	I am a writer and I have been blessed to use the human and archival resources of the Oregon Jewish Museum for a range of projects including a book, "The Spark and the Light:  The Leo Adler Story" (which led to the Oregon Public Broadcasting Oregon Experience Program "Leo Adler").  I continue to use their resources for a variety of other research projects on Jewish families in Oregon.  I could not do my work without them.When I started work on the Leo Adler project, I was unsure about what resources might be available in Portland.  Leo Adler (1895-1993) lived all of his 98 years in Baker City in the eastern part of our state.  When I went to the Museum and told the Director Judy Margles what I was doing, she smiled and said "Yes, we have a few things" and introduced me to Anne Levant-Prahl.  Scrapbooks were pulled out, oral history transcripts were presented to me and boxes and photograph came down from shelves.  Broad pieces of the Adler family history could be found from a range of sources, but the resources of the Oregon Jewish Museum allowed me to weave those pieces together.  I had the thrill of looking at family letters from Jacob Adler (Leos grandfather) to his son and daughters in Oregon (who emigrated from Germany in the 1870s) telling them when they should observe the anniversary of their mothers death.  Many of the letters were written in German and the folks at the Oregon Jewish Museum put me in touch with translation services that allowed me to dig deeper.There are other museums in Oregon with larger archives, bigger facilities, and more staff, but for me the Oregon Jewish Museum has always been the best connector museum.  It opens up questions for me and helps me blaze a trail toward answering those questions.  I always feel welcome when I come to do research and I value the interest of the staff in my work.  Since I am not Jewish, I appreciate the staffs willingness to answer my questions about areas that I am unfamiliar with.  I truly value the ways that the Oregon Jewish Museum has helped me to connect with a range of different worlds and I hope your assistance will help them connect with even more.
Oregon Jewish Museum Inc	19976	3	/users/profile/21150	Cwoll	Board Member	5	10/27/2009	The Oregon Jewish Museum is one of the most dynamic museums--if not the most dynamic one-in this community.  It consistently does more with less to serve its constituency and the larger community by its innovative and imaginative exhibits and outreach programs. Some years ago the staff and board realized that it could do more to enrich the local culture by telling the story of the Jewish community in exhibits of its own history than by a constant stream of costly traveling exhibits. It has now achieved a great balance between telling our Oregon stories and exposing us to the glories of Jewish culture from the wider world.  At the same time, OJM has created a dedicated cadre of future OJM members by curating an annual exhibit of objects and documents from the families of students at the Portland Jewish Academy with stories told by the students themselves.  The enthusiasm and energy this event generates every year belies the staid images of the usual museum experience.  Finally, the enormous work the staff and board have put in to secure a new and exciting building for the museum, which came to fruition this month, will leverage previously undreamed of opportunities to better serve the Oregon Jedwish community.
Oregon Jewish Museum Inc	19872	6	/users/profile/21061	Alice Meyer	Volunteer	5	10/26/2009	The Oregon Jewish Museum is the "little engine that could" - and is - and will! Its current space, ableit limited, is a remarkable beehive of activity out of which come originally curated art exhibits hanging, alternatively,with traveling shows and cutting-edge artists whose work is not otherwise available to see in the Pacific Northwest. It is thus an educator to its viewing public as well as to the many school children who regularly visit. In the Oregon spirit, OJM works as a local pioneer in the field of preserving Jewish memory while embracing the future, as it moves to triple its size and expand its outreach opportunities to even more graphically tell the story of Oregon Jews - those who came early, those who are here now and those yet to come.Founded on a shoestring as a museum without walls, 21 years ago next spring, its volunteers continue to do the heavy lifting supported by an extraordinarily dedicated staff and by partnerships with local institutions both small and large.
Oregon Jewish Museum Inc	19815	4	/users/profile/21007	paul schlesinger	Board Member	5	10/26/2009	I'm a board member of the Oregon Jewish Museum for the past year. The Museum has been a part of my life since if was founded as a visitor to its many exhibits, lectures, and the growing archives. The Museum is housed in a 1,800 square foot space. After many years of searching it will move into newly renovated space this Dcember of 6,500 square feet. The Museum will now be able to correctly house its growing archives, show multiple exhibits simultaneously and also house it's staff in offices. Along with the Museum, OJM will house the Oregon Holacaust Resource Center in the same building. A show of true collaboration. This is an exciting time for the Oregon Jewish Museum and the Oregon Holacaust Resource Center.
Oregon Jewish Museum Inc	19812	4	/users/profile/21005	Ellen	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/26/2009	As an historian researching western Jewish communities, the OJM has provided an invaluable resource through its archival collections. The curator/archivist has been incredibly helpful, knowledgeable, and accommodating.While they are limited in space (a problem soon to be rectified), they have created interesting and very professional exhibits on local Jewish history.
Oregon Jewish Museum Inc	19788	4	/users/profile/20980	Eliza	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/26/2009	I have been exposed to the Oregon Jewish Museum through my work as a history professional in Portland, Oregon, and I have been impressed by the quality and quantity of programming, exhibits, and collections initiatives they provide the community -- especially with such a small staff. The museum's director works to make all members of the community welcome and to broaden understanding of the depth and complexity of Jewish experience in the Pacific Northwest, echoing broader trends in the historical community that seek to extend study throughout the twentieth century. I am particularly impressed by the substantial oral history program, a vital aspect of historical documentation that would not be accmomplished otherwise.

The exhibitions that have been created over the years are absolutely first class.The Museum could not do what it does without the energy and creativity of an incredible group of volunteers. Thanks to them and the supporters in the community, the Museum will move to a new, larger location in December 2009.The Museum plays a vital role in both the Jewish and secular communities as a resource and collaborator for cultural and educational programming.

I verbally "pledged" $20, although their sample of donations were higher.  The caller handed the phone to her "supervisor" to verify with me the amount I would pay.  This is a very serious issue, so I felt  I should give.   The caller asked me to send in the check as soon as I got the pledge payment coupon.  I received that in the mail about a week later, and have been sitting on it after researching the foundations'  legitimacy.  Then I came across this website.

Two weeks home recovering from a botched horrific surgery, I started receiving calls from every cancer "charity" you can think of.  Of course they were the ones on the "worst charity" lists.  Folks, please quit giving money to these buzzards.  They do not support cancer patients, nor do they support research.  They are around to support their own pockets.

She said, "Oh, well I can't send you the information until you confirm your donation." So I said, "Oh, well I can't confirm a donation until you send me the information. So, it looks like we have a problem."   She tried to "nicely" shame me because breast cancer survivors would appreciate my help.

I received an unsolicited call from a telemarketer asking for a donation.   I pledged $35 and told them I would honor the pledge if the charity was legitimate and passed my research.   I sent them a letter back stating that I would not be honoring my pledge based on their history and IRS filings, then received several calls from an anonymous "out of state" number asking me to "honor my pledge" and "uphold my commitment to cancer survivors".      From what we have found, the Breast Cancer Survivors Foundation is a legitimate registered public charity.  Their IRS EIN is 27-2827805 and they regularly submit their 990 filings as required.    The organization is founded and operated by  Dr. Yulius Popylansky.  It was founded the year before his retirement and relocation from NJ to Florida.  He is still a licensed physician / internist in NJ and Florida.     The organization employs a telemarketing company called "Outreach Consulting", owned and operated by  Damian Muziani, an aspiring actor from NJ with connections to Dr. Popylansky.    Muziani's call center operations in NJ have been featured on several news exposes highlighting the darker side of telemarketing, including this one from Tampa:  http://www.tampabay.com/topics/specials/worst-charities2.page  The Breast Cancer Survivors Foundation only donates 2.91% of revenue (charitable contributions) to breast cancer survivors.   This charity spent over $3.3M on telemarketing with "Outreach Consultants" and another $1.1M in operating expenses to generate $4.6M in charitable donations.   It costs the charity $.96 to earn $1 in donations, leaving just $.04 (4 cents) on every dollar received available for donation to survivors.     The national spokesperson for Breast Cancer Survivors Foundation, Dee Dee Lowland, is a professional fundraiser for charitable organizations.  She is located in Missouri and is hired by the Breast Cancer Survivors Foundation to represent their interests.     Other members of the charity include Marjorie Velasko, who opened the Adagio Medical Practice and is registered on their LLC along with Dr. Popylansky, despite his retirement and non-practicing status.   The remaining members of the Breast Cancer Survivors Foundation do not list their board membership as part of their professional social media presence, including LinkedIn, HealthCheck, Spokeo, etc.   Several list other board affiliations, but not this one.  That is a red flag for me as well.   The bottom line is this charity spends a lot of money on telemarketers, professional fundraisers, and telemarketing campaigns but spends a minimal amount on "Breast Cancer Survivors".  They have donated some money to various clinics to offset the cost of early breast cancer detection (Mammograms) for low-income clients; however these procedures are usually covered through other state and federal programs.    Your money could be better invested with other organizations, this one appears to be a scam.  
Breast Cancer Survivors Foundation	252627	55	/users/profile/340724	Snowbabe	General Member of the Public	2	08/11/2015	I also looked them up online.  They had called me asking me to pledge money.  I told them that I do not give my credit card number out over the phone and asked them to send me some literature.  They sent me a pledge form.  I looked them up on line and they do have a glitzy website.  But, what is strange is that they have addresses listed in various parts of the US: Linn, OR; Butler, WI; NJ; Atlanta, GA; Aventura, FL?!  This made me suspicious.  Then I finally found a charity rating for them and it said in 2013 that only 27% of their funds went for program expenses: https://www.sos.wa.gov/charities/search_detail.aspx?charity_id=29314.  I'd like to know what they are doing with the rest of the money.  So I am not going to donate to these people.  I think they are a scam.  Furthermore, in Wisconsin, in a 2011 inquiry, the Better Business Bureau had tried to contact them for information on their charity and they did not respond.  Very suspicious organization.
Breast Cancer Survivors Foundation	252134	42	/users/profile/340176	Rosalie S.	General Member of the Public	1	08/08/2015	Boy, am I glad I did some research before going forward with the donation!  I pledged on Monday, and today, just 4 days later, I received the "Pledge Payment Coupon" in the mail, in an envelope that included what seems at first to be legitimate literature about breast cancer.  After reading the other reviews here, each of which sounds accurate and 'fits' my own experience with this so-called foundation, I'm partly still furious but mostly grateful - for having been guided somehow to double-check.  How have these people not been caught yet?  Wouldn't it be soooo easy to go to that P.O.Box, visit there every day for a while until someone with the key to that mailbox also pays a visit to pick up their mail, approach that person right there or maybe follow them for a while, confront them, arrest them, force them to return all the money they've stolen from the actual survivor community and supporters?  They've been doing this for YEARS.  WTH?!
Breast Cancer Survivors Foundation	250320	37	/users/profile/338160	rayInGA	General Member of the Public	1	07/28/2015	Similar stories to others here. Got the call and I was in a good mood so I said I would contribute but the y kept pushing for a credit card. I declined to provide one but said to send me an email and I would follow up. They sent a regular mail letter twice now but I have decided, with limited information about this charity, to put my dollars into one that is more open with their information.
Breast Cancer Survivors Foundation	248116	38	/users/profile/335797	VAfellow123	Donor	1	07/11/2015	I received multiple calls from this charity and agreed to pledge. After researching, I decided my donation could be put to better use by another organization. BCSF continued to mail me pledge cards. They eventually called again from a 703 number and asked if I would give them my debit or credit card information so they could obtain my pledge. I refused. The caller got angry and reminded me of the multiple mailings they had sent and how that money could have been used by BCSF. I replied I had changed my mind and she promptly hung up on me. If they ever call me again, I will not be a very nice person.
Breast Cancer Survivors Foundation	247724	36	/users/profile/335335	sg6182	General Member of the Public	1	07/07/2015	Pro Tip: DO NOT donate or give your personal info to this organization! But if you're bored, have some fun asking Siri-style questions from their weird robocall software. I received a call from a woman identifying herself as "Lisa Kent." It sounded like a strange robocall -- awkward pauses, nonsensical responses, responses repeated verbatim. Robocalls aren't unusual, but I found this one creepy because of how awkward and unusually aggressive it was. She asked me to confirm how much money I'd donate to the charity. I asked, "What's the name of the charity?" and she said "Yes." When I took a few seconds to process her bizarre responses, she'd aggressively say "hello are you THERE?!" "I said I'm going to transfer you OKAY?!" Um, okay? I was connected to a live person, and asked her if that was a robocall, and she said "No, you were talking to a live person through a computer generated call. She wasn't a robot." There was no way this could be true, but she adamantly denied it. A robo-dial that connects you to a live human ain't the same as a robo-call that connects you with an aggressive, interactive forerunner to Skynet. The live person was just as aggressive as the android. When she asked to confirm my donation before sending the pledge letter, I told her I had no problem with the amount, but because I wasn't familiar with their organization, I'd need to look up the charity before donating. She gave me their URL (breastcancersurvivor.org) and told me to look it up while she waited. I told her I wanted to look them up when I have time, please send the letter and I'll take a look then. She said they'd call me back tomorrow. When I told her not to call me back, just send me the letter and I'll decide when I get it, she said she "understood" that I "feel that way" and hung up! The first sign that this is not a trustworthy organization: lying about an obvious and poorly done robocall. It immediately undermines credibility, and made the robocall even creepier.  The second sign: not wanting donors to read up on the charity in any meaningful way before they donate. They didn't even bother asking for my mailing address to send the pledge letter! They presumably thought, correctly, that I won't donate after I come across hits like http://www.newtoseattle.com/2015/04/29/another-sketchy-cancer-charity-trolls-in-seattle/ and https://youtu.be/qNOIZLZ9occ.

Breast Cancer Survivors Foundation	241783	24	/users/profile/328437	Michael W S.	General Member of the Public	1	04/27/2015	Breast Cancer Survivors Foundation, Inc.  Scammers of the lowest order.  Call constantly trying to say we pledged money to them - which we did not.  When we blocked their number - they send letters saying we pledged "per phone conversation with...." which no one did cause we hang up on their calls.  They target people who attend cancer survivor groups and events - they somehow get people's addresses and numbers from the sign-up sheets.  They are scum - targeting cancer survivors.  Do not deal with these people - give them no money - hang up when they call.

She asked for me by name and when I asked how she got my name and number she said that as a charity they did not have to honor the no call list. My number is not listed, it is not in my name and I never mentioned the no call list. When I asked again how she got my name and number, she explained that she had muted my side of the conversation and apologized if she was taking over me. That was laughably one of the most passive/aggressive fund raising tactics I've ever had thrown at me.  The number is listed as a non-fixed voip number in the north Atlanta area.

Breast Cancer Survivors Foundation	193924	15	/users/profile/253325	agileone	General Member of the Public	1	02/07/2014	Call multiple times a day for the at least the past 4 weeks between the hours of 8:00 AM and 9:00 PM. Number they called from is 516-900-2942, which isone of their call centers, located in Seaford, LI, NY.We  finally answereed one of their calls and asked them to stop calling, as my # is on a Do Not call list. The woman on the other end laughed at my wife and hung up. We found their calling pattern to be abusive. If calls continue we will contact the Attorney General concerning their call pattern and financials. 
Breast Cancer Survivors Foundation	172039	14	/users/profile/227741	drlm	Volunteer	1	09/26/2013	The solicitations for this "non-profit" is done by Automated Professional Marketing. They claim I have donated in the past, not true. In fact, I have always informed them not to call my NO CALL Listed number, each time I  remind them that they must comply to my request, but that doesn't stop them. I have asked them where they are located and where the non-profit is registered; they completely ignore all of my questions regarding their foundation by continuing to go through their pitch and asking for money. Very unprofessional and very irritating.
Breast Cancer Survivors Foundation	171614	12	/users/profile/227221	partic	General Member of the Public	1	09/24/2013	They just called me a few minutes ago.  THEY LIED.  They said I had given them money last year which of course I had not.  They wanted to send me a mailer.  I said I always check out charities with the BBB before I give any money to them.  That ended the conversation within two seconds!  Saying you are going to check with the BBB ending the conversation certainly tells you something about these frauds doesn't it?  I discovered that almost all the money goes to some greedy people at the top of this fake charity, and very little to the people who need it.  F----  Always check online, and tell them you will check with the BBB.  The only one who was willing to call back a few days later was legit.  This one certainly is NOT!!    F----
Breast Cancer Survivors Foundation	162273	27	/users/profile/215371	NotGullible1	General Member of the Public	1	07/09/2013	I received a call from "Name Unavailable" (1-540-023-7856) and the woman asked for my wife. I said, "Yes, may I tell her who's calling?" and was told it was the Breast Cancer Survivors Foundation. I told her to hold a moment, went to get my wife and found her napping (she has progressive MS) and explained to the woman that she was unavailable. The woman then sarcastically responded, "Yeah, right!" and hung up on me. There are certainly worthy charitable causes out there, but the sad reality is that they seem to be outnumbered by scams operations that rely on peoples' inherent compassion and philanthropy to profit for themselves. I did a bit of research and found that Breast Cancer Survivors Foundation is located in Aventura, Florida. Their website URL is http://breastcancersurvivor.org. I also learned that their registered agent--apparently--is the Kansas City-based law form of Copilevitz & Canter, L.L.C.  This I found on the same Washington State Charitable Solicitations Program Charity Profile Report as another person who posted a comment about this organization. Updates numbers (2011), however, show gross revenues of  $2,547,079  with only 6% of that going to program services! Copilevitz & Canter, L.L.C. claims to be 'active in the nonprofit, fundraising, and telemarketing communities, and have successfully represented clients before all levels of state and federal courts and federal regulatory agencies.' Here's another interesting opinion with more insight about Breast Cancer Survivors Foundation:  http://phonyphonecharities.blogspot.com/2012/10/introduction-breast-cancer-charity-scam.html Readers here can decide for themselves whether this is a legitimate and worthy charity. My mind is definitely made up and I am happy that my wife was napping, didn't take the call, and didn't donate any money to Breast Cancer Survivors Foundation.

When they called, they were very pressured to get me to their donor area to confirm my information and kept asking me if I was comfortable with my $15 donation and if i would get it to them within 3 weeks--flags went up!  Brochure and form came last week. Almost wrote the check this afternoon and finally googled it and here I am!  Not donating based on the feedback on this page.  They did not submit their info to the BBB of Wisconsin either--another flag. Will wait for the onslaught of junk mail.

We get calls from our donors saying that Breast Cancer Survivors Foundation  has called them for donations.  I got a call from them this morning and pretended to be interested in donating to their organization to see what they do with the information.  I was told I will get a mailer in one week with information for the donation.  I was also told, they do not take donations over the phone.  Somehow they had my name and mailing address.  When I asked how they had gotten it, they said it just popped up on their computer.  They did not want to stay on the phone for long, or answer questions.  Their number was blocked when they called.  Now, to sit back and see what they are really going to do.

Breast Cancer Survivors Foundation	106570	44	/users/profile/144042	mhmiller74	General Member of the Public	1	02/16/2012	According to the most recent data available on the web site of the Secretary of State of the State of Washington, the Breast Cancer Survivor's Foundation received $531,041 in revenue in 2010, had expenses of $479,111, and spent 0% (none of the money collected) on program services for the year in question.  Apparently, payment for the four fundraising companies used in 2010 (Preferred Community Services, Inc.; Safety Services LLC; Outreach Calling; and Safety Service, Inc.) and retaining the difference between revenue and expenses ($51,930) is more important to the organization than its stated purpose and mission.

In addition, I insisted that I be removed immediately from their call list.After receiving a brochure in the mail, I am suspicious of the integrity of this organization and will not be donating. I perused the website, www.breastcancersurvivor.org and found only informational links to outside organizations. I tried calling the telephone number listed on the brochure (800-930-1220) for additional information. The call was answered after many rings but the person answering, "Foundation office", hung up on me when I started to make an inquiry. I tried to call again, but an answering machine picked up.
Breast Cancer Survivors Foundation	94292	41	/users/profile/108984	Leemor	Donor	2	07/24/2011	I made a donation to the Breast Cancer Survivors Foundation in honor of a friend and breast cancer survivor. My 2 star rating is not based on the effectiveness of the organization as I've not seen anything other than their website. My low rating is based on the fact that after making the donation, we started receiving 2 to 5 calls a day from different non-profit organizations. Apparently, in addition to our cash donation, they made a little extra by selling our information to other organizations. If they didn't sell it, I am still very disappointed that they shared it. Now we have to screen all of our calls. Note: The address I have for the organization is based in New Jersey and not Oregon, but it is the exact same name. The website of the organization I donated to is http://www.breastcancersurvivor.org (w w w dot breastcancersurvivor dot org) - I apologize if this is not the same organization and will promptly remove this review if so.

Our family knew nothing about MLD and thanks to Dean and Teryn's help - they have connected us to many many families that are going through the same thing.  The discussions have helped us with needs, pain management, symptoms.They are wonderful and we would love to have them continued for ever and their help to try and get the word out as well as raise money for research has been terrific.

They know how difficult it is to get information on how to help people affected with MLD. In an effort to help others not have to go through what they have been through they  started this foundation in order to help others have access to information. They have  many contacts in Medicine & Research that has been very valuable to many people. The MLD disscussion group which they started has been an invaluable sorce of information for me & many, many others.  They work tirelessly and effectively and helping other families affected with MLD & they have meant many of them.  This foundation offers support most of us can not get elsewhere even in the medical community it is difficult to find doctors that have even heard of MLD and most of them don't know what kind of treatments are needed. I have had 3 children with MLD and I am so thankful for the MLD foundation they have been a great source of help, knowledge, & comfort to me and I know many, many others.

That is also when we found the MLD Foundation when searching online and attended our first MLD conference.  It was at the conference that we met other parents who were so helpful to us by listening to us, answering our questions and sharing their own experiences.  The conference provided us with everything we were hoping for, education about the disease, the latest research, friendship and support.  The MLD Foundation discussion list has helped us to connect to other families from all over the US and abroad so that we don't feel alone in this challenging journey.   We are SO THANKFUL TO THE MLD FOUNDATION and to its founders, DEAN AND TERYN !

Thank the heavens I found the MLD foundation to turn to. They have been a source of hope, answers, and just knowing that youre not alone in this battle is worth the world!
MLD Foundation	44650	8	/users/profile/45559	zeester2001	Client Served	5	06/20/2010	I have nothing but great things to say about the MLD Foundation. They were warm and receptive right off the bat. My son was diagnosed with MLD in November 2008 after having an abnormal gait. He was tested twice to confirm the MLD diagnosis. Soon after my son was diagnosed, we contacted the MLD Foundation. I had so many questions to ask people in the support group that they offer online for families. All my questions were answered, and it was nice to get others points of view and hear their stories. The other nice thing that I experienced with the MLD Foundation is that the cofounders, Tery and Dean Suhr, have made it possible for families to get together around the world to meet other families with MLD. I was able to attend the last MLD conference they had last year, and it was so nice to meet them and other families. I no longer felt alone. So, the MLD Foundation is a big source of support in  my life and I am grateful to them.

After struggling alone for four years with mis-diagnosis and no-one else in the UK to help us we finally found the MLD Foundation.  They have given us unwavering support and help throughout our journey.Our son's MLD has been halted/slowed by a stem cell transplant from our carrier son.  When we went through major traumas when the transplant broke down and knew that whenever we used the e-mail forum there would be somebody there to support us and offer kind thoughts and advice.As a parent of an adult, our story is somewhat different from other families.  Our son is now 38 and 14 years post transplant.  We still struggle and know that we have the MLD Foundation there to offer any support we may need.Without the MLD Foundation we would still be out there, feeling alone and lost.  The MLD Foundation have given us valuable information on MLD helped us make our way through Scott's troubled life.We think the MLD Foundation deserves recognition for the way it helps new families through the first few traumatic months after diagnosis - one of the most difficult periodsTh.  MLD Foundation is a "family" who care about us and our children.

They have helped us meet other families with this very rare disease. I had never in my life heard of this disease before my son was dx. with it. Dean and Teryn are wonderful people commited to helping families suffering from MLD. Every year they have a medical conference that all MLD families can attend so we are kept well informed of any medical advances for the disease. This is a wonderful foundation!

We have been able to ask questions to families all over the world, and in return have also offered our help to people we have never met but we feel we know them because of the bond the MLD community has.There is no judgement, but there is information that alot of the doctors can't give us due to the rareness of MLD so being able to communicate with others going through the same problems in priceless.

I love the discussion group you can email everyone with questions and nobody will judge you, you can also put in some input that people will listen to and sometimes you just needed to hear something that someone has said.  This foundation helps you to know that you are not alone in the struggles that you have to overcome with MLD and there are others that are going through the same things that you are.  They also have conferences for people but I have not been able to attend any of them but the info they put on the foundation website is always very informative.

I have met many good friends through this organization.  It was a great support to me when I had no one to talk to.  I would have gone crazy dealing with this illness alone without having an online discussion group to turn to when I wanted someone to talk to.  It was so nice to know we are not alone with this illness.

The area they manage is now a secure haven for wildlife as well as a place where the local community benefits.  The people are empowered and are now willing custodians of the natural treasures around them.  I have been fortunate enough to visit the Big Life HQ and hear from the people on the ground.

First, to see Brandt's trilogy "ON THIS EARTH, A SHADOW FALLS ACROSS THE RAVAGED LAND" in Ulm, Germany then to Paris for his latest collection "INHERIT THE DUST", we are fully charged with anticipation!Not only is Nick Brandt my artist of choice, director of the Michael Jackson "Earth Song" video and does he personally answer E-mails...he's a God-send whose life-changing work shatters one's ignorance...particularly, this latest collection in which he photographs his life-size images of African wildlife in their former natural settings now transformed beyond their habitation. Together with Big Life co-founder Richard Bonham and their team of Rangers, they are the first organization in East Africa of coordinated anti-poaching teams operating on both sides of the Kenya-Tanzania border.Peace,Cindy BargArtist

I was fortunate on two visits to meet the staff as well as several game scouts/rangers on the job as well as witness the coordinated efforts to treat wounded animals.  The warrior class now competes with each other athletically in the Maasai Olympics rather than spearing lions to prove their prowess and bravery. I know of no other NGO as effective in dealing with poaching and human wildlife conflict.

Big Life's approach, its people and their ability to make a positive impact is remarkable.  What has been accomplished in a short period of time is very impressive.  I have seen for myself the Big Life operations in Africa and am grateful every day to be associated with such a fine group of committed people who are actually making a difference.

Big Life Foundation	292499		/users/profile/383027	MOT1966	Board Member	5	06/08/2016	Big Life's accomplishments in a relatively short period of time have earned the respect of donors as well as other NGOs, while  its commitment to local communities  - from supporting education, to capacity building, to mitigating human-wildlife conflict - has resulted in fantastic working partnerships throughout the Amboseli ecosystem. Rangers are highly regarded and work closely with the people living adjacent to protected areas, elephant and rhino poaching has been massively curtailed, and lion populations are increasing. Big Life's strong leadership - Richard Bonham, Nick Brandt and Kim McCoy -are to be hugely commended. I am proud to be involved with this wonderful organisation.

The best way to halt the destruction of the natural resources that make East Africa so fertile, is to have laws in place that protect the environment. But laws are not enough, you need to have buy-in from the communities that are most effected by the parks. Big Life does all this and more. My (safari) hat is off to them!

Big Life represents all of this and so much more. I could not be prouder to be a donor. I encourage anyone who cares about the fate of our planet and critically endangered animals to review their programs and donate today. Your funds will be used  wisely and effectively for the greatest results - animals and their environment saved. At the rate they are being poached African elephants will be extinct in less than ten years. Many African rhino species are already on the edge of extinction. These are animals that have been on our planet for tens of millions of years and which play a critical role in their ecosystems. Yet we are losing them on our watch and they are literally disappearing before our eyes. The positive news is that Big Life Foundation and it's team of brave rangers are on the front lines of this battle using innovative tactics to deliver highly effective results.

I have partnered with many national non profit organizations over the years and I can truly say this is one of the most thoughtful, impactful, and genuine voices for children and youth that I've ever had the honor of knowing.  The most impressive thing about Crittenton is how they listen to the voices of girls and young women to inform their advocacy.  They truly have the needs, experiences, challenges, and successes of the individual girls front and center in their work.   The collective voice of the local Crittenton agencies is making a difference in ensuring that girls and young women who are victims of abuse, neglect and sexual violence get the right help at the right place at the right time.  They have changed the way I look at the world for the better and given me new hope about the incredible strength and resilience of survivors.

For most of decades of its existence the organization has maintained  a  profile out of the limelight in its helping role but in the last few years, a concerted effort has been made to not only advocate for the needs of marginalized young women but to the aide them in advocating for themselves. The young women are activley taking the initiative to give legislators and the community at large a greater undertanding of their strengths and the trememdous potential they possess. Significant efforts are being made to break the cycles of poverty, ineffective parenting, abuse and neglect that majority of these young women have faced.

As a Board Member for National Crittenton, we continue to support our family of agencies & be the national voice of so many young women trying to break the cycle of negative family patterns. 
The National Crittenton Foundation	83014		/users/profile/91836	bam44	Board Member	5	03/23/2011	When I count my blessings, Crittenton is at the top of them. Crittenton has enriched my life on so many levels over the past 20 years. At 16, along with my my two-year old son, I moved into the Southern California-based Crittenton home. My stay at Crittenton served as a pivotal point of change for the better in my life & the life of my son. Growing up in a household filled with constant fighting, verbal & physical abuse, I had visions of a different life for us. Thankfully, there was a place for both my child & I to stay during a time of many transitions. Thanks to the program structure & caring staff members, I was able to save enough money to move into my own apartment at the young age of 18. The feeling of being able to provide for myself & son was so empowering! I went on to earn a bachelor's degree from CSU, Fullerton. I am forever grateful for the concrete foundation Crittenton offered for me to be successful in life. Now, I am a member of the Board of Trustees for The National Crittenton Foundation. They have opened up so many doors for me to give back & help empower other young women. The staff members at The National Crittenton Foundation are top-notch & committed to making a difference for young women everywhere.

She stated it was her birthday and she never felt that any one cared that she was even born.  I wanted to change that.  She is so important...her life does matter...she is special...and God has a plan for her future no matter what her past was like. I look forward to each birthday and take cake, ice cream, pop and gifts.  I am glad to be a part of the Florence Crittenton Volunteers!

This person in turn got a job there as a nurse, called her Mom and told me they needed volunteers.  A couple of phone calls later I was there filling out papers.  If you go on a regular basis you become attached to the babies probably more that the girls.  I know some really appreciate it more than others and that is ok. The staff is always very appreciative.  I guess I just hope that some of the mom's will realize that there are people, perfect strangers even,  that want to  help them.  Not point fingers just pure help.  The babies are so helpless and I hope that since they are at Crittenton that will give them a better future and hope. I hope I have made a difference for someone.

They send us the latest updates on best practices in the field, listen to the voices of our young women so as to better understand needs and challenges; and provide leadership training to young women. I am extremely impressed with their leadership and advocacy on behalf of all young women in this country. They are truly making a difference !!

Board Member	5	06/06/2012	I've seen tremendous growth and scalability of The National Crittenton Foundation's impact over the past three and a half years that I've been on the board. I've met with girls and women who have benefitted from programs and funding generated by the Foundation, including advocacy on Capitol Hill, social media campaigns, initiatives to measure the impact of services delivered, and more. I'm looking forward to giving more of my time in the future to help The National Crittenton Foundation ensure that all girls, young women and their families live safely in a just world in which they can visualize and achieve their unique potential as healthy, contributing members of society.
The National Crittenton Foundation	114085		/users/profile/155246	James39	Board Member	5	06/06/2012	Initially I was a Board member of the Southern California Crittenton Agency in Fullerton, California from 1991-1996.   I then joined The National Crittenton Foundation in 2001 and I am presently the Treasurer.   I have also rejoined the Fullerton Agency Board in 2009.   In this time I have had the priviledge of visiting 14 of the 27 Agencies.   What keeps me coming back is the change in the look in the young ladies eyes.   When they first arrive they are scared and in survivor mode.   After a time the look becomes trusting and full of hope.   Not only do they gain self esteem, many continue their education into college, and they become valuable members of our society.

I have been out of the life for 23 years and have been advocating for other victims of trafficking for 5 years. I met the Crittenton foundation last year where they had their open house of their office in Portland.  Since hen I have built a relationship with them and they have helped our small group of trafficking survivors through allowing us to use their space for meetings and allowing us office space. Our group is called Survivor to Survivor. I have been acoomunity oraganizer for 18 years and this organziation is very impressive. We shared the same philosophy as meeting people where they are as well as their long term dedication to their clients. I have never met a group that has consistently stuck to their mission for 129 years!

We are not legally or financially tied to the Foundation, but voluntarily participate with agencies across the county as partners in purpose. In that context, I have been a keen observer of the work of TNCF and can attest to its vision, character, and impact. TNCF consistently matches its actions to its purpose, conducts its activities ethically, and has been constant in its efforts to better the lives of at risk girls and young women. TNCF continues to provide a collective voice for the thousands of girls and young women served, not just by its affiliate agencies, but by all providers working with this population. I am proud to be a partnering agency and personally touched by all they do.

During this time, I have come to respect this organization as a unique leader in the area of women's empowerment.  They have grown tremendously as policy advocates and continue to do a lot with very limited financial resources.  More and more they are called upon by our nation's elected officials for their input and opinions in their niche area of marginalized women and girls.  Through their member organizations, Crittenton ably represents women of 31 states.

The National Crittenton Foundation has provided our agency with excellent opportunities to network with similar agencies accross the nation, exceptional professional development and agency development training, opportunities to advocate for pubic policy on the federal, state, and local level, and support for fund raising and program development.  On a personal note I was provided training and support to advocate to numerous US Legislative Representatives from my state for a variety of issues that were important to my agency.  The training and support was invaluable and allowed me to come back to my home state and continue the effort which included several invited testimonials to my state's House of Representatives and Senate which resulted in positive policy and funding changes.  This would not have been posible with out the training and support I received from the National Crittenton Foundation.  Additinally, the Executive Director of the National Crittenton Foundation, Jeannette Pai-Espinoza,  is a knowledgable, caring , supportive professional that acts as a resource on a variety of levels for all the agencies within the "Family of Crittenton Agencies".  
The National Crittenton Foundation	113952		/users/profile/155055	lady_kay_08	Board Member	4	06/06/2012	My name is Catherine Kamara. I was born in Sierra Leone, West Africa and was raised in Maryland/ DC. My journey with The Crittenton Foundation started in Feburary 2007, I was seventeen at the time and my newborn was five days old. The thought of my son and I being in custody did not settle too well with me at first. The day my son and I entered the doors of Florence Crittenton Services in Charlotte, North Carolina I was reassured immediately that this was a safe environment for us. I have lost both of my parents at a very young age and the only person I had trust in just gave me up for custody, so you can say I had little to no trust or faith left in anyone else. It took a lot for me to start trusting others but the staff at Florence Crittenton Services made it easier for me to start trusting again. Florence Crittenton Services was the first place my son called home and it was the first place since my parents died that I actually felt safe in, meaning not having to worry about my next meal, how the bills were going to get paid, or who will give me that boost of positivity when I felt like giving up in life. I have been out of foster care for about three years now and to this day I still continue to stay in contact with my FCS family. The National Crittenton Foundation has opened up doors for me no one else has. I have met some beautiful inspiring smart women that have walked in the same shoes that I have, as in having family members that abused them, not having the right resouces to help them, and being a single teenage mother. I can truely say these ladies are the big sisters that I've always wanted as a kid and I'm grateful to have met them in my adult life. When I'm with them I feel like I can speak about anything that's troubling me in life and not get judged by it. The last thing I need is to have someone judging my every footstep. With these ladies I have learned that it is ok to make mistakes and get right back up and correct them. They say God places certain people in your life for a reason, and I truels believe this.   I really appreciate the ladies of TNCF for entering my life when I most needed someone.

As a result of the Crittenton Foundation's connections we've been able to send 3 young ladies to Washington, DC to advocate for funding for the juvenile justice system, trafficking victims protection act & the shutting down of Craig's list adult service sight, which at the time was one of the avenues that pimps were using to sell teen girls.   To witness the bravery these young women display as they share their stories as well as the change that comes from them feeling heard and feeling empowered is amazing and almost beyond description.  Thinking about their stories and the resiliency which they display still brings tears to my eyes.

The National Crittenton Foundation	83097		/users/profile/91943	KarenSaverino	Donor	5	03/24/2011	I became familiar with the work of The National Crittenton Foundation (TNCF) in 2004 when I provided some consulting services as they were undergoing some changes. From an outside perspective, I was very impressed with the board and  the agency leadership. What's most unique is how the national organization works with agencies across the country. So many national non-profit  never see or interact with the  audience they help--not the case with TNCF. Through the agencies, they know the girls and young women personally. Another unique aspect of TNCF is that the leadership is not only committed to justice--they really, truly care about the girls and will stop at nothing to help and protect them. When Jeannette Pai-Espinosa took the helm,  I immediately became a donor. Under her leadership, I knew great things could happen. And they have.

Besides the support that Crittenton provides the work of over 27 Crittenton agencies, it is their goal to support the empowerment of girls and young women so they can achieve their unique potential as healthy, contributing members of society that connects us.

The National Crittenton Foundation	82581		/users/profile/91124	shakira	Professional with expertise in this field	5	03/18/2011	I work with a national advocacy and policy organization located in Washington, DC.  The goal of our organization is to seek and advocate for the expansion of federal support for organizations working with girls and young women who are at greatest risk for system involvement or who are system involved.  Most, if not all of these girls come from very difficult back grounds, have histories of serious trauma, and are in need of services that respond to their experiences as girls in a safe and healing environment - something that far too many girls go without.  The National Crittenton Foundation and its nationally distributed family of agencies are among the few organizations providing such services.   Each individual agency approaches the needs of each girl from a gendered lens, acknowledges and provides wrap-around therapeutic treatment for past trauma, and supports girls through programs that build on their strengths and fosters a sense of accomplishment and empowerment - something many of these girls have never experienced.   Further, the National Crittenton Foundation and its various agencies continuously work to expand awareness of the lives of girls by placing the voices of the youth at the center of their work and in the halls where policies are made - Congress. Excellent work!

Back in 2009, I was looking to "give back" and host a fundraiser on my blog, preferably to an organization that helped young mothers.  I found the National Crittenton Foundation and fell in love. Their services are outstanding, and I loved how they told their story through their clients' lives. I participated in the organization's 2010 annual meeting and was blown away by the passion and dedication of their staff. I was so inspired by their knowledge and devotion that I decided to go to graduate school to get a degree in Family Studies. This organization is the real deal and I am SO glad they are around to do the work they do. It is so necessary. 
The National Crittenton Foundation	82371		/users/profile/90769	lisetteo283	Client Served	5	03/16/2011	My life would not be what it is without Crittenton.  I became a mother at the age of 15 and like any other girl in my position, I felt that I had been thrown into parenthood too soon and felt penalized by the rest of the world because I now was "A teen mother" and apparently that is all I would be known for.  Crittenton was able to see past that, and their programs helped me remember that there was so much more to me than just a young mother, they helped me find my voice and my path to success. By showing me how to set my goals AND achieve them, mentoring, supporting and encouraging me, I was able to finish high school, pursue a college degree and now give back to the community. All this despite the fact I had both my children while still in high school.Through an abusive relationship and the everyday struggles of a girl raising two kids, I was able to use the skills and the resources I had learned from my program leader and move on to a healthier life style for my children and myself. Their commitment to young women like me is powerful, and is creating future leaders in the community. The array of services offered by Crittenton is truly empowering to the girls! I am so proud to be called an alumni of their program, and for them to allow me to volunteer any chance I can!

Learned who we can work with and what we can expect from both old and new leaders.  Learned that some of the people  I thought would most benefit from working toward our goal fizzled out.  It's refreshing to meet people as interested in achieving our common goals as we are.  I don't want the momentum that we started with to end.

I first participated in one of their programs in 2008, as a sophomore in high school in a community leadership program. Through that class, and my follow-up participation as one of the facilitators for the next cohort, I discovered my vocation in public service. Yet again, in the year following RDI provided the opportunity to build my leadership skills  as RDI staff encouraged a friend and I to present a workshop at their Regards 2 Rural conference, even as 'just' a college freshman. I can't thank RDI enough for the relationships, skills, and life path they have given me. 
Rural Development Initiatives (RDI)	316273		/users/profile/407539	debconrad	General Member of the Public	5	10/28/2016	Late in 2015, I was accepted into the Yamhill Valley 2016 Ford Institute Leadership Program.  During the past year, along with dozens of other local county residents, I've actively participated in 48 hours of intense leadership training designed to develop leadership skills in order to create community-based change.  It truly has been life-changing - not just for me and the other participants - but for the residents of this region who will benefit from community leaders who have learned how to build and sustain community capital.  Honestly, I knew it was a good program (I've been trying to get into it for years) but I didn't know just how good until I invested over 200 hours of my own time in the training, homework assignments, readings, and cohort project.  These are lessons that I will put to use in making my community a better place.  RDI invested in me and I will pay it forward , resulting in a better Oregon.

Our project was well planned, but as with any large project, we have encountered a hiccup or two. Without the training we received from RDI & the FFF we would not have been able to overcome these hurdles as easily as we have. We have learned teamwork, overcoming problems, resolution of disparate ideas & ways of problem solving. I know we will be much more effective leaders in our community thanks to these two organizations. I look forward to continued involvement in both.

The presentation of information on grant sources, how funders evaluate and select projects, and all the myriad details of the process was surprisingly comprehensive, delivered in an enjoyable way.  There were many templates and example materials which served both for instruction AND for direct application later for writing purposes.  I have saved all the materials and refer to them during various steps of grant application preparation.  The course prepared me very well to be ready when an opportunity came to assist a community group developing a secure drug disposal program throughout our extended local area.

We had trouble finding a project on our confederated tribal land.  It was our goal as RDI has done several projects in Pendleton, Oregon.  The majority of our group was either employed by or tribal members.  The Leadership training provided by RDI built our compromising skills so that, although the project occurred in Pendleton, both the tribal affiliates and the non-tribal affiliates could find satisfaction in the project.  Diligence was a major factor in our project - an outdoor revitalization handicapped by rain all day and graffiti taggers.  We completed the revitalization, thwarting the taggers efforts to become famous.

At first I had problems with the whole concept of ground up community improvement. I did not personally think it was worth time and effort.Not being in love with the whole bureaucratic broo ha ha of any government focused enterprise, I wasn't expecting much other than normal political jargon, hot air and promises by a bunch of self important stuffed suits.  Now that I have said that ( I feel so much better, The truth will set you Free!!!! ) I can tell you that I could not have been further from the truth!!!!  Right from the first session I began to learn about and enjoy what RDI had to offer! The " stuffed suits " that I had been so sure were going to test the  limits of my BS 'O'meter,  never materialized! Instead, I was greeted by some of the most knowledgeable , funny and truly Community concerned people  I have known! This fact never , not once , changed stride! Even the guest instructors were above and beyond informative and interesting people. ( My ages old concept of political stuffed suits was rapidly losing ground! ) During the whole course, the idea of normal ( who sets those standards ??? ) people changing their community or setting change in motion was the driving concept of the RDI instructors. We learned so many things about people in general , about how to interact with others to meet a mutually desired goal. Networking, interpersonal communications, task assignments, voting and debating  in a respectful manner to reach the end result of helping a community. Then, when all the book learning and practical examples  ( of which there are several ) are over, the class gets to put all of their new found knowledge to the test by creating an Event ( in our case ) from start to finish, all under the watchful and caring eyes of our wonderful instructor team!!  In this course I learned so much, I became convinced that a person can grow a concept into a team effort to help their community! This is a fantastic course, well worth the time and effort to attend. Given the chance, take this course, you will build relationships, friendships and your community ! can't ask for better than that! Our Cohort is now considering the possibility of building a better event next year!

Our event project was a real eye opener to how much can be accomplished if everyone works together.  Our teachers and their associates did a wonderful job of sharing their experiences and valuable information on what works and things to avoid.

Rural Development Initiatives (RDI)	264911	5	/users/profile/353639	Steve155	Volunteer	5	10/18/2015	I appreciate the dedication, skill and willingness to share of the RDI staff.  All of the RDI staff are involved, fun,  and have knowledge to share.  I have been involved with various RDI programs for five years and greatly benefit from their training.  They make a positive difference in our community by training volunteers to become more effective leaders.
Rural Development Initiatives (RDI)	264704	5	/users/profile/353426	burtone	Volunteer	5	10/16/2015	I have benefited greatly from participating in the RDI Regards to Rural Conference, and a variety of RDI-sponsored trainings.  I am also an RDI/Ford Family Foundation Leadership Institute graduate and serve as a volunteer community trainer/facilitator for that program.  All of my experience with RDI has been outstanding.  Their staff and programs are top notch, and they leverage partnerships to stretch scarce resources and model coalition.   RDI is innovative and proactive, often developing curriculum and services that meet needs in a very timely manner.

Rural Development Initiatives (RDI)	237405	4	/users/profile/321945	OregonCoastDawn	Client Served	5	01/28/2015	I have personal experience with RDI through the Ford Foundation Leadership Program. RDI provided 2 stellar facilitators for our leadership classes. Jess and Sara from RDI provided learning experiences for us all with grace and ease. They made the classes fun and exciting. I am so impressed with their skills and intelligence, and their love of community shined through everything they did. The support of RDI has helped, is helping, me to be a better person, better connected to my communication styles, and a better community leader, community builder, overall. Thank you RDI! 
Rural Development Initiatives (RDI)	237403	4	/users/profile/321973	robdickinson	Client Served	4	01/28/2015	Rural Development Initiatives, and the Ford Institute Leadership Program that they facilitate, are invaluable resources for our community in Cottage Grove and South Lane County.  RDI has been a long term partner in our area to develop strong leadership talent and to help network together committed community members to enhance our region's economic and social vitality.  The Ford Leadership Program is a great program and a great way to get involved citizens talking and working together, and doing so with skills that they've refined as part of the training.
Rural Development Initiatives (RDI)	237363	4	/users/profile/321914	wyeast	Board Member	5	01/27/2015	The time and energy spent in the various classes, lead by RDI and funded by the Ford Family Foundation,  was well spent.  The training helps us with both, business and personal issues that seem to bog nonprofits down. The information presented can be used in so many ways.  I truly recommend RDI and praise their commitment to helping people and our communities. The Ford Family Foundation deserves kudos for their support of our rural communities through RDI.
Rural Development Initiatives (RDI)	237336	4	/users/profile/321874	Karin L.	General Member of the Public	4	01/27/2015	The presence of RDI in this community has been a vital link and resource for me to get engaged, get informed and get involved. To be able to assess the scope of communities and how to find a place and offer my own abilities toward the community viability and sustainability has been a winning collaboration. I have benefited from classes as well as the extended relationships RDI has with other community partners. RDI fills a need here for both community education and the follow-through offered beyond the training. 
Rural Development Initiatives (RDI)	237204	2	/users/profile/321621	jeff_houston	Volunteer	5	01/23/2015	RDI's instruction and participation in the year long Ford Institute Leadership Program, that I recently graduated from, was nothing less than spectacular! RDI's trainers are top notch and shared the materials in an informative and entertaining  manner. Their professionalism is only exceeded by their compassion. RDI's trainers and staff "walk the walk" and exemplify the best in leadership in everything I have seen them do. RDI and TFFF are the guardian angels of Rural Oregon! Kudos, blessings and my thanks to RDI for one of the best years of my life!
Rural Development Initiatives (RDI)	237189	2	/users/profile/321586	edicicco	Client Served	4	01/22/2015	RDI has helped me connect and become more involved in my community of Dallas, OR. The instructors are inspiring and professional. The leadership development curriculum is useful and the hands-on application through a community service project pulls the concepts together.  
Rural Development Initiatives (RDI)	196365	2	/users/profile/256682	go4funds	Client Served	5	03/25/2014	 Our organization was in need of some capacity building & the tools we gleaned from the learn by doing class were invaluable.   We were better able to evaluate the activiities we engaged in and the impact of our time and energy.  We formed a new strategy, more focused on growing our numbers and volunteers, while dropping projects with little financial impact.  As a grant writer with intermediate level experience, I gained some new &  useful guidelines and resources that I immediately put to use.  We were successful in receiving grant support from a new small family foundation for our school swim program, and we have received another grant for a capital improvement project.    Couldn't have been more pleased with the benefits of the class.    
Rural Development Initiatives (RDI)	195626	2	/users/profile/255773	filmer	Client Served	5	03/13/2014	If you go into the class with the attitude of learning you will come away with a knowledge of what grant writing is really about and how to go about this process. I have come to understand what it means to learn how to think when learning instead of memorizing or following the leader because they are the leader. This class makes you think and then you can make things happen.
Rural Development Initiatives (RDI)	195509	2	/users/profile/255587	ACon	Board Member	5	03/11/2014	Our board has been partially paralyzed with the idea that we didn't know how to write a grant.  In fact, most of the board felt we needed to find a "professional" grant writer.  However, a couple of us took the Learn by doing  grant writing workshop this last Fall and decided that since we didn't have a "professional", we were going to jump in and do the best we could.  The results have been spectacular!  In late November we received our first grant which was quickly followed by a large check for our organization as the result of an organization profile we had filled out.  Since December we have written for a couple additional grants and while we were informed on one that they were only responding to "basic human needs", we know that we have gained confidence and organization simply by going through the process.  At this point, our entire board is taking advantage of every listening or outreach opportunity.  We're in a learning mode and are doing a much better job of communicating opportunities for grants with each other.  It's sort of like that saying "If you think you can or think you can't, you're right!".
Rural Development Initiatives (RDI)	195508	2	/users/profile/255586	Retired and Senior Volunteer Program	Professional with expertise in this field	5	03/11/2014	This class was very different from other grant writing classes I have taken.  We learned how to use new tools in every session, and we also did an activity each time that was very valuable.  The diversity of the tools and activities was (and still is) so helpful in the grant writing process.  This isn't your typical lecture-style class either.  It is very hands on and there are plenty of examples.  Also, getting to use your own organization as an example is really helpful because it gives others the chance to give their opinion and point of view, which you may have never heard before.  I will definitely continue to use the skills and tools I learned from this RDI class.

It was a life changing experience. Every chance I get to talk with people about these classes I recommend RDI and their personal commitment to help people and their communities. Members of the RDI staff make people feel like family and good friends!

It has been such a rewarding and enriching experience working with the RDI staff. Dare I say that if they were a rainbow I'd be heading to one end with a bucket, that's how valuable their work is.
NCOMPASS	314029	1	/users/profile/405388	bandmr1	Donor	5	10/24/2016	C.S. Lewis Academy elementary school in Newberg, Oregon has been supporting  Maranatha House orphanage for more than 10 years.  When we started, it was under Amber Outreach.  We first had a boy named Wilson, then a boy named Johnny.  These boys aged out.  Now we support a 10 year old little girl named Sherlande.  After the earthquake in 2010, the house was destroyed.  Amber Outreach took out a loan to rebuild the house but NCompass took over the operation of the orphanage.  Because of the influence and outreach of NCompass, the orphanage has seen nothing but progress and improvement. They have sponsored many successful projects.  The children are thriving in all areas.  NCompass is totally involved in working with the orphanage because they care for the kids.  They have a transition program to help the kids have a vocation when they age out.
NCOMPASS	313617	1	/users/profile/349365	Miles D.	Volunteer	4	10/23/2016	Ncompass has energetic leadership with inspiring vision to continue their growing impact in Haiti and their more recent venture 'Kidstarter'. A strength of the organization is leveraging the talent of volunteers. An upcoming opportunity will be to scale and measure their impact that has seen steady growth the past 10 years.
NCOMPASS	260775	5	/users/profile/349365	Miles D.	Former staff	4	10/01/2015	Ncompass began as a grass roots organization that evolved from serving the homeless in downtown Portland to providing the primary financial and strategic advice for an orphanage in Titanyen Haiti supporting over 40 kids. I was able to serve with Ncompass during this time and saw the ups and downs of an organization making this rather large strategic pivot. While they could use more help in how to effectively serve the orphans once they age out I can tell you they are powered by a passionate group of individuals who adapt well to change and are chipping away at this learning curve. They are excited to engage with donors and do an excellent job of practicing subsidiarity by allowing the voice of those they serve in Haiti influence operational and strategic decisions regularly. I recommend reaching out to Katie Matheny if you are curious on details as well as looking into the diversity of programs they use to support youth and considering going on a trip to Haiti to see the enormous positive impact taking place not only at the orphanage, but within the entire surrounding community.
NCOMPASS	313610	1	/users/profile/404966	Andrew107	Volunteer	5	10/23/2016	Ncompass truly cares about the people they support and want to help empower the peopleof Haiti. They have also helped create Kidstarter which empowers youth to project plan and learn how to raise funds for organizations and charities they care about. Both are incredible organizations!
NCOMPASS	312782	1	/users/profile/404155	Megan_B_	Volunteer	5	10/20/2016	Ncompass is making a difference in the world. Their focus is on partnership and positive impact, not just on giving hand outs. They are passionate about children, education, and developing leaders- both locally and globally- who will bring about positive change in their communities. This is a truly wonderful organization!
NCOMPASS	312710	2	/users/profile/404083	Will30	Donor	5	10/20/2016	Ncompass is an amazing organization! Unlike large non-profits, every dollar donated goes towards the cause and the people they are helping. The leadership team is amazing and they have unparallelled character, integrity and vision to impact the world! 
NCOMPASS	312494	3	/users/profile/403867	BenM	Board Member	5	10/20/2016	Ncompass is a great nonprofit striving to impact and develop kids and empowering  them to impact others through service.  I became involved first as a volunteer, then an officer, and now currently serve as a board member.  I can tell you that Ncompass takes stewardship of funds very seriously, and they work to make the most impact with the dollars donated.   They have grown consistently by being faithful over the small things and continue to do so.Giving to Ncompass is an investment in developing kids and helping them to have a heart of service.  Great organization!
NCOMPASS	312470	3	/users/profile/403842	rlinenberger	Donor	5	10/20/2016	Ncompass is truly passionate about their mission to develop and empower the youth of today to make an impact in the lives of others.  I know several students who have gone on missions trips with Ncompass,  it was a game changer for them. They came back with a desire to do more, give more and learn more about the world around them, and ways they can help the less fortunate.  I will always support and give to this amazing, life changing organization.
NCOMPASS	312406	3	/users/profile/348944	Surfandturf	Board Member	5	10/20/2016	I love the focus of this nonprofit. Kids influencing kids! I love that I know where my money is going and that if i want to see for myself I am always welcome to join a team to Haiti or volunteer on some other level. The people that are involved have amazing ideas and amazing hearts. The energy they put off is contagious . So glad I've been able to come along side and serve with Ncompass 
NCOMPASS	260363	5	/users/profile/348944	Surfandturf	Volunteer	5	09/30/2015	I have had the pleasure to help serve with Ncompass on many projects.  The heart of Ncompass is kids and empowering them at a local level and international. I have served the homeless for many years with Ncompass and have watched them transition over the last 10 yrs . I have traveled twice to Haiti and worked at an orphanage on numerous projects. People there are empowered  and the the volunteers that get to serve are forever changed.  It is an organization that dreams big and truly believes with all their hearts that if everyone gave just a little the world could be changed for the better.  Every year Ncompass continues to grow and like minded people from all around are hopping on board with their vision. 
NCOMPASS	304803	3	/users/profile/395987	Trudymart	Donor	5	09/15/2016	NCOMPASS partnered with my daughter to create a donation Birthday party event. They were able to help us plan and educate her guests about the children in Haiti at their orphanage. Katie Mathany was able to FaceTime/Skype the children in Haiti with our guests. It was truly a fabulous experience. I would highly recommend partnering with NCOMPASS for an event. The work they are doing in Haiti is helping so many children. It's amazing to be apart of it. 
NCOMPASS	303418	4	/users/profile/394582	Larry E.	Donor	5	09/12/2016	I have been a supporter of NCompass for about 3 years.  What drew me to them were there people.  They are young professionals with strong moral values and caring and compassionate hearts.  They are servant leaders.  These young leaders make it hard not to want to help them. I have found that most people want to be part of successful organizations.  It is hard to not want to be involved with NCompass and the vision they have for the future.  And it is fun to watch them flourish, grow, and make such a difference in so many lives.
NCOMPASS	303342	4	/users/profile/394502	Meaghan G.	Volunteer	5	09/12/2016	I went to Haiti with Ncompass the week before spring break of 2016. It was an incredible trip that fueled the love and desire I now have for Haiti. The leader from Ncompass that came with us helped us adjust to the culture very well.  Once we got there he brought us to the Maranatha house where we met the kids that Ncompass supports.  You can tell how much each of these kids loved our leader from the organization. As we got to know these kids we learned and saw how much Ncompass has loved on them and given them hope by partnering with the Maranatha house. After traveling to Haiti they have made sure to keep me involved with the organization and they continue to fuel the love I have for the kids in the Maranatha house and in the country of Haiti. I am so glad that I have found Ncompass and there vision is one that I support fully. I can'y wait for when I get to go back to Haiti with them.

We have traveled the past 3 years with NCompass to Haiti. We have sent approximately 60 students over this time span. Each year our students come home deeply impacted by all the different experiences they have had.  NCompass has always been highly organized and our students have been safe and well cared for and prepared. I would high recommend supporting NCompass and the amazing work they are doing  in Haiti. We have been able to see first hand how they are empowering the next generation of Haitians to make a difference in the future of their country.
NCOMPASS	271923	4	/users/profile/360838	Stephen56	Volunteer	5	11/12/2015	NCompass is an amazing organization that selflessly serves a small community in Haiti. I have known the leadership of the organization for many years and work with them on a daily basis with my own non-profit. They are innovative and look to see how they can make the biggest impact for the children they serve. A highlight of my experience with NCompass was traveling to Haiti in Spring, 2015, with their leadership to help with the orphanage expansion, and development of an internet cafe. We have amazing partners in Haiti who I consider now to be good friends of mine. I look forward to my next trip with them!
NCOMPASS	266288	4	/users/profile/355059	Writer	Donor	5	10/22/2015	Ncompass has done so many wonderful things to help those in need in Haiti.

NCOMPASS	261804	4	/users/profile/350438	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/06/2015	I was introduced to Ncompass in 2012, and it has turned out to be one of the best introductions of my life. I preside over a youth basketball organization which attempts to involve its kids in as many positive life experiences as possible.  It just so happened that one of those experiences turned out to be traveling to Haiti with Ncompass to serve at an orphanage! Not only did Ncompass welcome our kids with open arms, but they were excellent leaders on the trip - so much so that they inspired the kids to return every year since!  I've been able to witness Ncompass's tremendous work internationally, but also locally in Oregon with their Kidstarter platform.  The concept of having kids helping kids is one that I believe everyone can, and should, fully support.
NCOMPASS	261588	4	/users/profile/350197	cdaringe	Volunteer	5	10/05/2015	This group lives and breathes their mission.

They use their donations wisely and really stretch them to make the most impact. Its nice to know where your donation is going. Being a smaller organization, they are also very quick to respond if you ever have questions about their programs. Great non profit overall.

Everyone, including myself, that works for NCompass has a normal full time job and we do this on the side when we have time in our busy lives. We look to support from people like you that are everyday working class that want to make a difference in the lives of children with little opportunity in Haiti. If you're looking for a non-profit that is local, grass roots yet established and very transparent with how we spend our partners money, we would love to have your support!

Not only does there website provide conection for foster youth all over the country its staff provides hope and knowledge of a better futur for youth in foster care!! This summer fosterclub came to Arkansas and helped our Youth Advisory Board put together the most amazing conference! Our conference was the first youth conference put together by youth and actually led by youth. Fosterclub led 2 workshops....foster-to-famoous.....fosterclub.com intro. They truly were a key factor in the success of our conference.  Fosterclub taught me how to be a true leader. They provided training for myself and my fellow board members. And gave amazing suggestions. Life for youth in foster care has a positive future thanks to fosterclub. Their slogan "Built for Youth....Powered by Youth...Changing life for Youth in Foster Care" tells it all!!! Fosterclubs allstars are awsome, positive, and always willing to help! I say they diserve to win!!

Fosterclub	12370	12	/users/profile/14406	greta09	Client Served	5	10/07/2009	I was an all-star in 2009, and working with FosterClub has opened so many doors for me.  Everyone who works at fosterclub is invested heart and soul in the system.  Many times when I was in foster care I felt people only cared about me because they were paid to do so.  With FosterClub, I never felt that way.  Their staff are so conscious of the needs of youth like myself, and help shape us into becoming the kind of adults we wished for as kids.  They are amazing and are helping make visible changes within the system.
Fosterclub	12344	8	/users/profile/14378	Theresa	Volunteer	5	10/07/2009	I was an All-Star in 2005 and continue to volunteer with this organization from time to time.  The skills and experiences I have acquired have been invaluable.  From my internship experiences in 2005 and 2008, I developed skills in establishing boundaries, leading groups and workshops, and speaking.   Furthermore, my experiences with FosterClub helped me find my passion for reforming child welfare policy and practice.  I am currently a MSW student at Columbia University studying social policy and management.  FosterClub connected me to a new community of foster care alumni. Being connected is very crucial for foster care alumni after aging out.  I don't believe I would be as goal-driven and successful as I am today without FosterClub.  Please endorse FosterClub in an effort to advocate for the half million children in foster care.
Fosterclub	12233	11	/users/profile/14254	babblebug	General Member of the Public	4	10/07/2009	This is a fine organization!  Our former foster daughter (who is like our daughter now), became an AllStar, and learned so much.  She knows how to speak to groups, lead workshops, and understand her journey.  That AllStar experience is very valuable to her, and for that we are thankful to Foster Club.  The leaders of Foster Club really helped her to learn and grow.
Fosterclub	12164	5	/users/profile/14183	Shawn	Former staff	5	10/07/2009	I am proud to say that I was a FosterClub Allstar in 2005.What impresses me is the Director and her resourcefulness and creativity. What she can do with a budget is incredibly impressive. In 2005 she had 2 staff and was operating a network with more than 2,000 recipients.Celeste provided foster youth with channels of communication and a peer support network when there was none. She helped empower them by providing documents and young adults who had been through the process to help them become more active in their case and in their life. She created the majority of the documents her self initially. These documents such as the Fyi3 binders were highly acclaimed and were the general revenue for FosterClub. Celeste's ideas are constantly amazing and typically implemented successfully. She is one of my biggest inspirations and I constantly use her as a role model.The internship change my life as it enhanced many of my skills- public speaking, facilitation, endurance, work ethic, listening, traveling. It also made me much more attractive to other non-profits and my career flourished as a result.Watching FosterClub grow has been amazing and they deserve support as they have always supported young people and modeled an ideal youth friendly non-profit.
Fosterclub	12159	4	/users/profile/14178	Misty Stenslie	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/06/2009	FosterClub is AMAZING!  I work closely with young people and staff from FosterClub at least weekly, and I also proudly donate to FosterClub.  Supporting this organization is an easy thing to do--their mission is incredibly important, their work is ALWAYS top-notch, and they are excellent stewards of their limited resources.I encourage everyone to support FosterClub.  Young people in foster care need us to care for them, and to ensure we have excellent public policy and practice related to foster care.  By supporting FosterClub, you are raising up the 800,000 children who live in foster care every year.

Fosterclub	11356	8	/users/profile/13302	Odysseus	Former staff	5	09/29/2009	I have seen people paralyzed by anxiety to such an extent that every life circumstance to be dealt with becomes tinged by a sort of melancholic awareness of the impermanence of things.  The awareness by itself is not necessarily a bad thing except when there is no symbol of hope or rather awareness of a future good.  It is my opinion that Fosterclub provides an indispensable service towards this end, particularly in the form of the Fosterclub All Stars.  The All Stars, and indeed Fosterclub in general, give a silent permission to others to proceed with life rather than becoming paralyzed by the stark revelations brought on by a less than good childhood.  The programs offered by Fosterclub are impressive but would amount to very little were it not for the ever caring and ever patient staff of the organization whose compassion appears to me to be beyond question.  I have been a recipient of the love and infectious joy of those involved with Fosterclub for sometime and I grow more impressed each time I see a presentation delivered to a group of eager foster youth or when I see a youth having fun simply playing with an All Star.
Fosterclub	11018	6	/users/profile/12946	nay	Volunteer	5	09/25/2009	FosterClub has afforded me the opportunity, as a former foster youth to be the person, I now know, I was meant to be.  As an attendee of one of their events in New York I saw in their interns what it meant to be a successful former foster youth. The organization's approach and passion for helping young people inspired and motivated me. As an intern for 2008 and 2009, the emotions only increased. Having the chance to work for them has demonstrated to me what it means to truly enjoy and care about the work one does. I can not express how instrumental to my life, both personal and professional this organizational has been
Fosterclub	10743	7	/users/profile/12651	dan	Former staff	5	09/23/2009	In 2005 I applied for FosterClubs All-Star Program, an internship for former foster youth leaders who are chosen and trained to leverage their foster care experiences as expertise and to improve the system following a competitive selection process. As a young person who spent five years in New Yorks foster care system, I found this experience with FosterClub challenging and life changing. Although I had often struggled because of my foster care experience, I learned that my story is powerful and effective as an agent for change. Today I am a MSW student at the University of Pennsylvania and believe my experience with FosterClub will allow me as a social worker to utilize  my life story, struggles, and successes to be able to provide hope and inspiration for many youth in the same situation I once found myself.
Fosterclub	10512	9	/users/profile/12396	mama D	Volunteer	5	09/18/2009	I help FosterClub whenever I'm called upon. I know when I volunteer that every minute of my time is optimized, and that with FosterClub, no one's time and no one's money is ever wasted. I see it whenever I drop into their tiny office. The small staff seems to be working on 8 or 10 projects at a time. Every one seems determined to do as much as they can for foster kids -it's impressive to me that FosterClub hires former foster youth as much as possible. What's really amazing is how much is accomplished with such small financial and material resources and so much dedicated effort AND a lot of soul.
Fosterclub	10464	12	/users/profile/12340	BJL00	Volunteer	4	09/17/2009	I attended Teen Conferences around the country and advocated for underprivileged youth in the foster care system.    I accomplished this by sharing my personal story to positively influence and better the lives of youth in foster care.  I also presented various workshops that were designed to empower youth to reach higher, and this was made possible because Foster Club was able to bridge the gap between the youth and adult perspectives, which proved to be successful.    In addition, I collaborated with my fellow 2009 Interns and Portland State University to create online training modules that would enable supportive adults to communicate effetely with foster youth on the most pressing issues like sexuality, education, and mental health.    I really embraced this opportunity because it made me aware of the many challenges that face youth, and also empowered to know that I could make a difference in lives of youth.  Although I greatly ameliorated from the internship program, I distinctly believe that some changes need to be made in order to ensure that the internship program maintains its eminence. I firmly hope the managerial aspect of the organization is revamped or at least looked at.  I wholeheartedly hope that this constructive criticism is only able to enhance the organization, while also making it flourish even more.   This organization deserves to be noted for its ability to reach youth in many unique ways; this is something that other youth organization envy.
Fosterclub	10392	9	/users/profile/12277	DobbinsA	Client Served	5	09/16/2009	Fosterclub is one of the greatest things to ever happen to kids in care, it not only gives a way for foster care alumni to speak out for future generations of foster kids, it teachs current youth how to speak up for themselves
Fosterclub	10390	7	/users/profile/12275	JLong	Former staff	5	09/16/2009	FosterClub is the only national network for the 513,000 foster youth currently in care. They gave me the once in a lifetime opportunity to share my story and inspire others that no matter what their current situation is, they have the ability to overcome it and be successful. They showed me how to represent other foster youth through my experience. I am proud to be one of the 12 all-stars selected per year to experience something that most will never get the chance to. I cam honestly say that FosterClub is the coolest non-profit organization ever.
Fosterclub	10389	8	/users/profile/12273	JConner	Volunteer	5	09/16/2009	Over the past 2 years I have had the pleasure of working with Foster Club. They have proven themselves as a knowledgeable, compassionate, and trustworthy organization who desires to seek creditable advocacy movements that produce the maximum benefits for youth and children in the foster care system. For all the things that they have done, will do and continue to do, I am proud to know this organization and both the members and staff of Foster Club.
Fosterclub	10383	5	/users/profile/12265	epi_speaks	Former staff	5	09/15/2009	Through the FosterClub AllStar Internship of 2005, I was introduced to a lifechanging world, lifestyle & group of people.  That summer changed the way I saw "giving back" into something concrete and achievable. Since then, the organization has supported me financially, mentally and physically during my pursuit of my dreams.  By far I'd say that FosterClub has been one of the most influential groups in my developmental process, and (simply) in my life.  I am eternally grateful.As far as change that FC is making for youth:  bundles.  I continually encounter youth who've crossed paths with FosterClub in some way, and love the way they gush about the change they've made or experienced as a direct result of FosterClub.
Fosterclub	10375	5	/users/profile/12255	Isaiah09	Volunteer	5	09/15/2009	My experience with fosterclub haves been amazing. I only have been working with fosterclub since the Summer of 2009 as a fosterclub all-star. They taught me many different things i would need in the field that i am going into, how to advocate for youth more affectively and just how to communicate my needs as a foster youth. This is an organization that goes far and beyond to help youth on a national level.
Fosterclub	10371	6	/users/profile/12252	weaveman	Client Served	5	09/15/2009	I have had a deep passion and wanting to truly make a difference in the lives of youth for many years.  I began to get involved in local agencies, but I began to hear a whisper about this amazing organization that was created specifically for the improvement of the foster care system through the eyes of the true experts of the system, the youth.  This thing called FosterClub is a place where not only do youth truly get their voices heard, but things then actually happen, the plant grows from the seeds were are able to plant.  This organization is youth driven, youth powered, and youth led.  This is such a true statement, we as the young leaders determined the important factors needing attention and change, we chose what to learn about and work on, we visited Washington D.C. to speak face to face with the law makers of this country, we taught countless youth how to be resilient, how to keep ourselves safe when dealing with family, how to recognize the importance of permanence.  FosterClub touches the hearts of so many youth, and adults, and foster parents, and concerned citizens.          Of course, all this is what FosterClub allowed me to do, since the year of 2006 when i finally found out that all the whispers were true and this organization truly is amazing.  I had been having several tragedies take place in my life, and thus I was aimless in my direction and lost in my own heart's anguish.  I was in leadership positions in some local boards, but my heart was so filled with nothing that it was hard for me to help myself at the same time I was helping others.  I was told that I should apply to become a FosterClub All Star.  The state told me they would support me in this experience.  I knew I needed an adventure, a chance to find myself, and to truly put a flame to the kindling of my passion.  I was selected, and I was changed, and I was filled, and I found a small part of my purpose.  I was able to learn so much from the thousands of youth I came into contact with, and the tens of thousands the twelve of us All Stars were able to help.  I also developed very strong personal bonds with my fellow All Stars.  Having been in a position due to foster care where I had people leave me and thus I was unable to truly open up, being around people with similar backgrounds allowed me to explore myself in depth.  I grew socially, and professionally, and personally.  This program quite literally must have been sent to change lives and give people identity.  That is what FosterClub gave me, an identity.  I am who I am, and I cannot see who I have become without FosterClub.  And believe me, this isn't just me, I know of the fact that many of my fellow All Stars, both past and present, have had similar impacts in their lives.       Of course, beyond what I have done and what FosterClub did for me, I have seen the impact of the messages we deliver, the hope this organization inspires in an under represented but highly resilient and intelligent population of this country that deserves so much more than what they have gotten.  To know that a youth who before the impact of FosterClub felt as though they had no future and then after felt as though the stars are the very beginnings of what they can hold in their hands.
Fosterclub	10370	10	/users/profile/12250	heather	Volunteer	5	09/15/2009	I have worked with FosterClub for only a short period of time, compared to some people I know who have been involved longer. In  my short time becoming familiar with the organization I had come to find out that FosterClub was not just another organization looking to exploit foster youth, but an organization actually trying to make a difference in the lives of foster youth throughout the entire country.By being a 2009 FosterClub All-Star I had the opportunity to go to conferences over the summer and work along side youth and present workshops to youth, to make them realize that they can help to make a change in the foster care system. Without FosterClub many of the youth in foster care would have no where to go to ask questions and get answers about foster care, many of the youth wouldn't even know that there is something they can do to make a difference. FosterClub is built by youth and powered by youth, the reason for this is because the founder of FosterClub realized that foster youth will be more open to talking, sharing stories and experiences, as well as learning things about foster care from other current or former foster youth, rather than adults who probably haven't been through half of the things these youth have.FosterClub is now my family, something I didn't have until I got involved with this organization. FosterClub is a stepping stone for any current or former foster youth to find resources to create their own family and a sense of permanence.
Fosterclub	10350	8	/users/profile/12224	Meagan Tuhy	Board Member	5	09/15/2009	Coined as "The little non-profit that COULD", FosterClub's determination and dedication is continuously surprising the youth members, foster parents, staff, partners, and other field members. I see this organization as a leader that works with their eyes wide open and their arms open even wider. Opportunity is greeted with optimism. The mission is carried out with creative innovations. The young people FosterClub serves are loyal and protective of this organization, and that is how you KNOW you have a top notch service provider! If the youth needing the knowledge and help the most are willing and driven to keep connecting at high levels. Please consider FosterClub for the Youth Thrive Award.
Fosterclub	10344	9	/users/profile/12219	sbradfoz	Volunteer	5	09/14/2009	I have never been apart of any other non-profit organization that is as effective as FosterClub. FosterClub's strength lies in its ability to encourage and edify young people in foster care by teaching them the significance in their own voice so that they are able to speak for themselves. The life of a foster kid is very silent. We live our lives being told what to do and how to do it, daily. Case workers, social workers, judges, and foster parents rarely ask "us" what we think or how we feel about our neglected circumstance, where and who we want to live with, etc. We have little choice surrounding the direction of our lives while in the system and often feel like no one cares.      I was once a silent foster kid until I discovered the power of my own voice when I got connected to FosterClub. FosterClub taught me how to advocate for myself. Because of them, I was able to teach other young people in foster care how to do the same for themselves, thus continuing the rich FosterClub tradition of using former/current foster youth to engage current foster youth. There is simply nothing more powerful than seeing a foster youth who has experienced similar life circumstances empower other foster youth to look beyond their unfortunate familial circumstances and reach for a better life that is not defined by the negativity that they have experienced with their biological families. I cannot think of any other non-profit organization that deserves this award more than FosterClub!

Celeste Bodnar is passionate about helping these youth get connected to positive life experiences. I've worked with her to educate legislative representatives on the challenges that youth in foster care face. The youth who Celeste helped to prepare were incredible spokespeople and did a wonderful job at advocating for their brothers and sisters in care. Organizations like this are incredibly valuable to our society.

They are a lobbying group to protect the profits of those who make money from exploiting animals, whether it's animal experimentation, circuses, puppy mills or horse slaughter, NAIA always speaks out for the rights of abusers.

Look at its board of directors: circuses, horse slaughterers, factory farmers, rodeo organizers, puppy mill apologists, lab animal breeders and vivisectionists, fur farmers... it's a Who's Who of corporate animal abusers. This group exists for one purpose, and one purpose only: to defend the ability of corporate interests to profit from the abuse of animals.

It came into being to explain the confusing difference and goals of animal welfare and animal rights. They have done a magnificent job inshowing those differences to the general population, leading to the formation of more localized organizations in areas where that confusion has been exploited by the animal rights advocates. The most basic difference is that animal welfare advocates wish to preserve and improve human-animal relationships, and animal rights advocates wish to destroy all human-animal interactions at even disastrous cost to both. NAIA has ceaselessly worked to oppose legislation nationwide and lically that would impose the animal rights goals. They have done this with educational support and through local participation, rather than through lobbying with tax free donated dollars. NAIA has taken the high road, though the animal rights advocates do not know it exists. Naia has exposed the end results of proposed bad legislation and punitive laws concerning all stages of animal ownership and rallied people in those jurisdictions to oppose them through education and information. They are the first and best organization of their kind and deserve far more support in every way.

Ecology in Classrooms and Outdoors (ECO)	312184		/users/profile/403541	Nmathes	Board Member	5	10/19/2016	Time and time again, principals, teachers, and most of all students request ECO to return  to the classroom to teach and inspire students to be more knowledgeable about the natural world.  Students love the opportunity to take that knowledge outside and see the classroom teaching in the world.   ECO works in partnership with the schools and other organizations and enjoys fostering those relationships.  ECO's educators are top notch and strive to provide the best curriculum for the students.  ECO is a wonderful organization!

I recently volunteered with ECO to help teach about ethnobotany and I was impressed by the students' enthusiasm for the lesson and how well the material complemented what the students were already learning about NW native peoples. The ECO teachers are engaging and the ethnobotany lesson included an interactive outdoor portion where students learned about the uses of several native plants and made a bit of rope from plant materials to take home. ECO visits a classroom several times a year, which allows teachers, students, and ECO staff to build stronger relationships. This organization provides a much-needed service in schools today: to get students outside and excited about the natural world they inhabit. I would gladly volunteer with them again! 
Ecology in Classrooms and Outdoors (ECO)	226619		/users/profile/290350	TomTwo	Volunteer	5	10/25/2014	Ecology in the Classroom and Outdoors (ECO) is one of the extraordinary non-profit organizations working at the Southeast Portland school where I volunteer.  The ECO staff impresses me with their knowledge and thoughtfulness, by their friendliness, enthusiasm and energy, and by the skill with which they work with students.  But what I most appreciate are the ecology lessons that they teach.  These lessons are important on multiple levels. The lessons are important to students because they provide a hands-on introduction to the natural world and develop skills in observing, questioning, making predictions and gathering evidence to support predictions - skills that are at the core of science and central to critical thinking generally.  Students learn first-hand about subtle interactions within and between natural systems.  One example of such interaction occurs in the garden insectary.  The insectary flowers attract bees and provide the bees with food in the form of nectar; the bees pollinate the garden plants producing fruits and vegetables that become our food The lessons are important to the community because they include a component of community service.  Just a few blocks from the school is creek where ECO takes students for field studies.  Over the past century, the creek watershed has been degraded by human development, but is now part of a major restoration project that will reduce local flooding and restore the original natural watershed functions.  As part of their field studies along the creek, ECO has students participate in the restoration by planting native trees, shrubs, and smaller plants along the creek banks and floodplains.  The field study introduces students to a marvelous natural resource close to home that they can visit and explore outside of school, and invests students in their community through their contributions to local habitat restoration. The lessons ECO teaches are important to the planet.  The impact of climate change on human life is one of the critical issues of our time, but largely ignored by our countrys political leadership.  Actions taken to reduce or turn back the effects of climate change will come through political decisions.  Without a citizenry that sees itself as part of the natural world, that appreciates subtle interactions of natural systems, and is able to think critically about living in a sustainable manner, we will be trapped in the downward spiral set by our political leaders.  ECOs lessons help develop the informed citizens we need to stop the ongoing degradation of the planet. ECO connects students to their natural world and develops their critical thinking skills.  My hope is that ECO continues its programming in schools for the next 100 years and that 100,000 nonprofits teaching the principles of ecology, like ECO, blossom and flourish across the county.

This past year, I received a grant for music creation software that helps enhance the programs my students are creating. The grant enabled students who otherwise might not be interested in the coding aspects to engage in class projects by creating sound effects and music to go along with the action or storyline in programs coded by their peers. As a teacher, I continue to receive low cost education in Alice and GameMaker (as well as other available courses) that allows me to enrich my student's knowledge as they explore these programs.

In addition to providing opportunities at low (and sometimes, no) cost to learn about programming and technology, the organization also hosts a GameMaker programming contest in the Spring. My students love the opportunity to show what they have learned to different panels of knowledgeable adults, and they also gain valuable insight into various technology fields when they get the opportunity to meet with professionals in the field - and at least 2 of these opportunities are scheduled into their day when they go to the competition.The classes have allowed me to become a confident enabler of various software programs and it is a joy to watch the students explore the programs we use and explore ways to go beyond the lessons I teach.
Techstart Education Foundation	51443	2	/users/profile/52100	motioco1899	Client Served	5	09/01/2010	I learned about Techstart from a colleague in Eugene.  This organization sponsors outstanding educational events for teachers and support persons working in Northwest schools.  In addition, the organization spearheads opportunities for young people working with technology.  My daughter participated in Techstart's computer programming competition for high schoolers, held yearly on the campus of Willamette University, and through this participation she gained confidence working on a team of dynamic students, taking on supremely difficult programming tasks.  Her experience was very positive.  It helped her grow in skills to the extent that she was prepared to take on a summer internship at the University of Oregon's computer science department, something that would have been beyond her without the preparation of working on the programming team.My two experiences attending SuperQuest, the summers of 2009 and 2010, afforded me the opportunity to learn skills essential for the teaching of technology I do.  I teach at Kennedy Middle School in Eugene, and while my assignment is teaching mathematics, I have developed two additional elective courses for students, one in Lego robotics, the other a mix of electricity, animation, and music.  I gained exposure to the software needed for animation that first summer.  Attending that event, held at Western Oregon University, I was astounded at the expertise the Techstart people had assembled for the conference.  A broad range of topics were presented in the CS4HS program at that conference, many of particular interest to multi-level instruction, such as "Computer Science Unplugged" and discussions of equity issues.  I settled in to a workshop introducing me to GameMaker, taught with skill, precision, and helpful flexibility.  Leaving that conference I knew what my next steps would be to get started with setting up experiences for my middle schoolers.The summer of 2010 event held at Oregon State University once again brought many new topics to my attention, including a fascinating talk on cryptology.  All speakers at that conference were exceptionally well-prepared.  I particularly enjoyed the various experiences we were given to see the work done at that campus "up close" through talks by those teaching computer science and engineering, through tours of the robotics areas, and up-close talks with students at Oregon State working with robotics.  The robotics workshop was extraordinary!  Our instructors were first-rate, absolutely bursting with information and helpfulness.  I couldn't have asked for a better introduction to programming in Robot-C, and building the robots, right down to the nitty-gritty of which parts to buy, how to troubleshoot potential difficulties, and insider tips on competition using this technology.  Beyond the workshop, I've set dates for further attendance at Techstart events.  It is convenient that these are scheduled at times I am able to come, and that various locations in Oregon are utilized.  In the busy life of a teacher this scheduling and location choosing is crucial.  Finally, those who staff Techstart clearly go out of their way to provide an exceptional experience for conference attendees.  We had everything we needed, including great food, fun breaks in the action, and a really personal feeling between participants and staff.  I especially liked the banquet opportunities, the chance this gave me to hang out with some people I'd not yet met, including a fabulous robotics team from Philomath, Oregon called the PHRED.  Leaving Corvallis this summer I felt like I had been treated to a most wonderful event.  Techstart absolutely "has its act together" when it comes to bringing us great experts in a delightful setting at a convenient time.  I now know why others speak of attending SuperQuest events many summers in a row.  I'll definitely be back next time.

As a college computer science instructor, I have attended Superquest 2009 and 2010 in order to learn better ways to do outreach to encourage young people to enter the field of computer science.  I have attended games programming coach's training sponsored by Techstart.  And, last but certainly not least, I will be a mentor for a high school robotics team 2010-2011 due to connections made through TechStart sponsored Superquest.
Techstart Education Foundation	51238	3	/users/profile/51837	patkut	Client Served	5	08/29/2010	Techstart put together a computer programming game competition for middle school through high school students. This was my first year in the competition. Techstart did a fantastic job from inception in February to the final prize awarded in May. My students were thrilled to be amongst hundreds of like-minded students. Their parents and myself were impressed with the scope of preparation and organization of the competition. My teams presented to 2 separate groups of professional programmers and game designers and also presented and listened to peer presentations as well. Techstart brought all of this together for a very reasonable participation fee ($50 per team). My students were inspired and excited to be part of such a great competition. Winning two awards was icing on the cake.

I have attended courses in robotics, gaming, Alice, JAVA, and Python programming, and web design.  These courses have given me the tools to succeed as both a tech teacher and as the Head Coach for our school Technology Team (Robotics, Engineering and Computer Programming).  I look forward to maintaining a positive relationship with TechStart throughout my teaching career!

The organization helps students bridge the gap between math and science facts and the application of those facts.  It encourages teachers to use curriculum that is thought provoking and challenging.  I hope to continue attending their trainings for years to come.

I went into the training knowing nothing to very little about FLL, gamemaker, and the Lego robotics. I am an after school educator that needed new ideas and cirriculum.

This growing contest simultaneously promotes creativity, technical expertise, teamwork and leadership in a 100% positive environment.The first time I volunteered for this contest, I saw learning-disabled or economically disadvantaged young people working productively side-by-side with gifted or economically advantaged people in a spirit of camaraderie, sharing triumphs and supporting each other through setbacks.

Never before had I thought Robotics could serve our students in so many manners.  When it comes to workplace skills, subject matter engagement, personal growth and exploration, interaction with difficult science content, and the overall hands-on technology education Techstart is supreme!  I have grown as a teacher, as a person and as a learner of science.  School has not even began and I have parent volunteers who are calling me!   I have a list of 18 students who searched for me during registration because they are so excited about my new curriculum (and we have not even began school)!  This was a huge benefit and I will be sure to come to every Techstart Superquest I can from now on!  Thank you for the opportunity! --Stacey Johnson Science Teacher at Junction City High School
Techstart Education Foundation	51166	1	/users/profile/51739	mjb2	Volunteer	5	08/27/2010	We hosted the SuperQuest workshop here at Oregon State University this year.  So, I got to work with Natasha MacDonald, Stevie Viaene, Kathy Zettl-Schaffer, and Ron Tenison on the planning.  What a great group of people!  So dedicated!  So passionate about education!  It was a real pleasure working with them.Then -- once the workshop actually arrived -- what an experience!  Tech Start really does an amazing job of bringing educators together in a tremendous "watering hole" environment, where they all exchange ideas and teach each other new material and best practices.  I was very impressed.  I can see that tech Start fills a very important gap in our education system.             -- Dr. Mike Bailey                Computer Science professor                Oregon State University
Techstart Education Foundation	51145	1	/users/profile/51726	dtkopf	Board Member	4	08/27/2010	The worthiness of the mission of TechStart Education Foundation (TEF) is clear to see.  We need to raise the quality of technical education in Oregon and SW Washington to support economic growth and quality of life.     Board Members and the many friends of the TEF have incredible passion to fulfill this mission.  Their vision for programs and coordination of resources is bounded only by one thing, restriction of funds.   Joining the TEF in passion to drive improvements is a collection of technology teachers who deliver training and mentoring to other teachers.  This group drives the curriculum of SuperQuest, the teaching training "camp" that teaches robotics, programming and other technology curricula.  TEF is the primary funding of this training and mentoring program.  Don Domes, at Hillsboro High School, epitomizes the vision and selfless dedication to drive something much bigger than themselves.  Several board members and other friends have done an outstanding job of creating vision and specific messaging to promote the story of TEF.  Great work has also been done to connect the structure of their most important fundraiser, UncorkED, to their mission.
Techstart Education Foundation	51121	2	/users/profile/51710	kevandunsmore	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/27/2010	I had a fantastic experience with Techstart.  Throughout the day I reviewed game competition entries from middle school teams and was amazed at the standard.  I've been working in software for 16 years; the amount of thought, care and attention put towards the games developed by these kids was often on par with professional software development.The competition ran smoothly; the whole process was superbly organized.  All the kids, and the volunteers and judges, approached the day with a very positive attitude.  Everyone had fun.  I would definitely do this again.
Techstart Education Foundation	51120	2	/users/profile/51709	mark-lawler	Volunteer	5	08/27/2010	TechStart Education Foundation is a wonderful non-profit that helps promote technology education in Oregon K-12 schools through its programs, events, scholarships, grants, and donations.  I donated my time to recruit, educate, and coordinate a group of over 40 volunteer judges for the annual Oregon Game Project challenge.  The middle school and high school students that participated in this event were able to not only demonstrate their research and talent, but were also able to learn from 3-4 judge panels made up of industry experts who shared their professional experiences with the participating students.  I was amazed by both the interest and participation at the middle school level as well as the diversity in terms of the student populations.  In an environment where our leading technology educators are being laid off by schools (even winners of our Technology Educator of the Year award and grant winners for funds for their class rooms) these types of programs are critical for keeping our K-12 students interested in high tech pursuits.
Techstart Education Foundation	51119	2	/users/profile/51707	andrew12	Board Member	5	08/27/2010	TechStart (formerly the Software Association of Oregon) has to be one of the most effective, efficient non-profits in Oregon, despite its modest size.  It focuses on awakening a passion for technology within Oregon students and does so largely through teacher professional development as well as student engagement programs.  It fills a key, previously untended niche and leverages its industry affiliation as a supporting entity to the Software Association of Oregon.  With a laser-focus on program delivery, heavy involvement of committed volunteers, and a can-do attitude, TechStart makes a substantive difference for Oregon students every day.  It also represents a great blend of public and private partners, working together on behalf of Oregon students.  It was a pleasure to serve this committed group.

At the Oregon Game Project Challenge (OGPC)run by TechStart, I saw firsthand in May the culimination of months of work of students that programmed games to address biohealth.  Not only did they work in teams to accomplish a goal, but their energy was electric.  That's the energy that TechStart can create -- the kindling of the technology fire in OR kids.

There are many citizens in our small rural county that can't be taken care of in their final days through the normal and accepted channels of health care.  Some very dedicated and concerned citizens stepped up to the challenge of working with the very well managed and extremely compassionate staff of the existing Curry County Home Health and Hospice department to organize the dedicated volunteers into their own supportive entity.  The organizing group spent many hours to establish the mission and goals, obtain the non-profit status and construct volunteer guidelines to coordinate the talent and energy of many truly gifted and caring community members.  The results are well earned and continually improving. However, this organization needs continuous support and donations to perpetuate this wonderful gift to those in need in our communities.

It has been a privilege to volunteer with this organization.   I am continually impressed with the professionalism of all the staff.  Volunteers are never considered "just volunteers," but are one of the team of people dedicated to helping patients focus on living.   The emphasis in Hospice  is on paliative care which allows patients to stay in their home with their pain managed and other medical help they need.  As a volunteer I stay with the patient for a few hours a week to allow the caregiver time to get away for lunch with a friend, run errands, or do whatever.  The work I do with patients is very rewarding.   C2H3 never turns a patient away for lack of money or insurance.  Therefore funding is always a concern.  Contributions go directly to help keep the program operating.

When I say "education," I mean more than academics (although academics are certainly important). I want an environment that nurtures the whole child and helps to shape children who are kind, respectful, self-reliant, and community-oriented citizens of the world. I want to know that when my son goes to school in the morning, he is looking forward to the day ahead, not dreading it, and that when he comes home, he will enjoy telling me all about the book he read that day or the seed he planted or his after-school yoga class... LCMCS inspires all of these qualities in children and so much more. I feel incredibly blessed that my son is able to attend such a wonderful school, run by extraordinary staff and teachers who genuinely care about the whole-person development of each individual student.

These commitments are forged from the principles of social entrepreneurship and innovation to generate broad positive returns for society.  All of these elements together converge into 'lightning in a bottle' to create a truly unique and holistic education that represents an ongoing evolution of the Montessori philosophy. With the rise of the information economy and globalization, the LCMCS experience is the education of the future. Countries with top-ranked education systems, like Finland, have taken notice and are incorporating many Montessori principles into their school curriculums.

Lewis & Clark Montessori Charter School	269694	2	/users/profile/358418	Sarah281	Client Served	5	10/30/2015	My family has been at Lewis and Clark Montessori Chater for 5 school years. I am proud to say I have three children going here and have one child waiting to start next year. We drive 15 miles to and from the school daily because we cannot imagine our children at any other school. The dedication and heart of the staff is impressive. I send three pieces of my heart to school everyday knowing that their teachers and the staff value them as much as I do. I feel the teachers go beyond teaching my child the basics, they teach them how to be good citizens and model empathy as they solve problems. The whole child is loved and taught on a daily basis, it's quite impressive. To top it off they serve healthy lunches! I couldn't ask for a better place for my children to grow and learn! 
Lewis & Clark Montessori Charter School	269603	2	/users/profile/356989	geigernation	Donor	5	10/30/2015	Lewis & Clark Montessori Charter School continues to amaze me each year with their dedication, creativity, and passion for bringing such an enriching, heartfelt program to students. With receiving only 2/3 of the standard allotment of state and federal dollars, they stretch every penny as far as it can go. The programs and exceptional staff inspire many families to drive upwards of 30 miles from out of district to provide the best public education available. LCMCS is an active participant in the local community as well modeling civic duty to all students, supporting seniors and the elderly through community outreach and the farmer's market. The parent community is also a thriving group of dedicated volunteers that supports student activities and fundraisers. Investing in this school continues to be an honor and a privilege.  
Lewis & Clark Montessori Charter School	269587	2	/users/profile/358310	Marcella M.	Volunteer	5	10/30/2015	This is the fourth year at Lewis & Clark for my four children and they are all thriving. The practice of the Montessori method at this school is done with excellence. The staff are highly trained and there is a real sense that they enjoy both their teaching careers and working with each other. The school community is warm and inviting. There are many extra curricular programs offered, including some sports teams - something one rarely sees in charter schools. The lunch program is mostly organic, locally sourced ingredients and delicious, my kids really love it. I just can't say enough about how lucky we feel that we discovered this gem of a school and that we can stay all the way through the 8th grade! 
Lewis & Clark Montessori Charter School	269325	2	/users/profile/358050	Mamatopenny	General Member of the Public	5	10/29/2015	Having an opportunity for a charter Montessori is tremendous! This school is outstanding in its methods and and its character. 
Lewis & Clark Montessori Charter School	269279	2	/users/profile/358005	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	10/29/2015	As a grandparent of two children at LCMCS I have observed the growth of the school from a few classrooms in 2008 to a full spectrum for pre-school to middle school now in 2015. As a non-profit that functions with lower per child funding, the school with strong administration has weathered the storms of growth with insufficient funding and facility challenges with the support of the school community, fundraising and community support. LCMCS has become a leader in service to the communities that the school serves. The "Helping Hands " project of bringing fresh produce to seniors from the gleanings of the school/student grown garden and local farm donations is just the start!   
Lewis & Clark Montessori Charter School	269208	1	/users/profile/357932	Leslie87	Client Served	5	10/29/2015	As a staff member and parent to a child at LCMCS, I can rave for days about this incredible school that we are blessed to be part of. From the amazing working relationships that we, as a staff, share to the community connections of farming, feeding seniors with food insecurity, to managing the local farmer's market to our fresh, local and delicious food service program, LCMCS is a shining example of what a true community can do when given the opportunity and led by a visionary and committed administration. 
Lewis & Clark Montessori Charter School	269041	3	/users/profile/357771	Writer	Volunteer	4	10/29/2015	My children are thriving at LCMCS...this is our second year and I continue to be amazed at the dedication of the staff and the community feel of the school as a whole.  We feel blessed to be a part of this program, whether it be eating delicious local, organic farm food for lunch, watching salmon eggs incubate and hatch to study their life cycle, or watching our children blossom because they are taught to follow their curiosity instead of being  taught to a standardized test.  We LOVE this place!
Lewis & Clark Montessori Charter School	269011	2	/users/profile/357693	Tinkertoysoldier	Board Member	5	10/29/2015	We tried other charter schools they didnt fit the our children.  After searching for other charter schools we found LCMCS. So we took a leap of faith and hoped for the best. When we picked up our from the first day of school, we asked how was your day, she said Thank you, I don't ever what to leave I did real work today . When she said that we knew we found the right place. LCMCS offers many learning opportunities such as Spanish, music, orchestra Choir the list goes on. The adolescent class maintains a full garden then delivers the fresh vegetables to residents in the area with a food instability. The school does wonder full things with only receiving only 58% of the funding per student compared to the public schools. The school lunches are made fresh daily form the schools in house kitchen, using produce grown from the school garden in the salad bar.  Its wonderful to be a part of such a great school and its community.
Lewis & Clark Montessori Charter School	268901	2	/users/profile/357632	Writer	Donor	4	10/29/2015	I am constantly in awe of the dedication and care shown by by the teaching staff of this Montessori school. They give so much of themselves to better the world by improving the lives of children. I give because I want them to be able to continue doing such amazing things.
Lewis & Clark Montessori Charter School	268900	3	/users/profile/357631	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/29/2015	This is my child's second year at The Lewis and Clark Montessori Charter School and the growth, both personal and educational in him is simply remarkable! He is not only able to perform large division problems, in 1st grade!, but he is also recieving Spanish, music, art and learning how to be a compassionate world citizen. I couldn't ask for much more and certainly couldn't find it in the woefully bleak regular school offerings, right now.  I love the fact that this school, as a public charter, has a super diverse population. It represents our varied area and gives our children what they need and it gives me hope!
Lewis & Clark Montessori Charter School	268174	4	/users/profile/356906	Writer	Donor	5	10/28/2015	Community connections is what we like about this organization.  Lewis & Clark Montessori Charter School goes far beyond the standard education mission to connect to the large urban/rural community it serves.  Community arts events, a unique, locally sourced lunch program,  student-based gardening, an outreach project to deliver food to elders in need, and sponsorship of the local, weekly farmers market are some of their projects.  Its about kids, its about community - well worth supporting.
Lewis & Clark Montessori Charter School	268168	3	/users/profile/356901	Writer	Donor	5	10/28/2015	My habit is to give generously to the organizations I believe in - both the mission and how the organization carries out its mission. LCMCS does what is says it will do and does it very well. The administration works wonders with the sadly low funding it gets from the state education monies, and makes the most of the fundraising/donor dollars it works hard to gain. The school manages funds responsibly. Not only does the school do a great job of educating its students, but implements  important service projects in the wider community. LCMCS has my loyalty as a donor. 
Lewis & Clark Montessori Charter School	268071	3	/users/profile/356801	Writer	Donor	5	10/28/2015	LCMCS deserves a 5-star review as a great non-profit because not only does it function as a stellar educational option for Pre-K through 8, it also serves its community and beyond.  It is very remarkable that students are able to receive high quality Montessori education at no cost!!  This caliber of education is typically unavailable to families that cannot afford the cost of private school tuition.  LCMCS offers its students an environment to succeed as individuals, and tools for success interpersonally as well.  The school culture promotes finding peace within the individual and tools for creating and understanding of peace between persons and world.  LCMCS has its very own organic farm, ran by students!  Students learn the importance , knowledge and skills to promote sustainability within our environment to carryon into their careers and communities.  Furthermore, produce harvested from our farm is donated to seniors with needs in our community!   LCMCS offers several information and enrichment opportunities not only for our students but also open to the community- all are welcome.  We possess a strong volunteer base among families.  The list abounds.. a thriving music program, healthful, organic lunch program, spanish, STEM opportunities and more.   Please, check us out at lcmcs.org! 
Lewis & Clark Montessori Charter School	266793	4	/users/profile/355548	Writer	Board Member	5	10/23/2015	Lewis and Clark Montessori Charter School is a shining star in the local community and in the realm of Oregon charter schools.  Researching other non-profit Montessori schools in the area, this is the only school that uniquely offers high quality public Montessori education ranging from pre-K through 8th grade, with an organic farm to school lunch program, foreign language, music, bus transportation, athletics and diverse enrichment programs for its students.  It also boasts a high level of community activism such as delivering weekly baskets of fresh produce to needy seniors in the community, offering enrichment classes to seniors, managing the local farmer's market and connecting the adolescent grades to local community through farming practices.  This school is remarkable for any one of those reasons, let alone all of them.  On top of that, the school (like many other charter schools in Oregon) only receives about 58% of the money per student compared to other public schools. An actively involved parent community, highly dedicated staff and a solid standing in the greater community keep this school moving forward despite the financial burdens.  This is a school to support for all that it gives back!
Friends of Trees	252010		/users/profile/340030	Ruth55	Volunteer	5	08/06/2015	We love planting trees with FOT. Rain or shine, we believe every neighborhood deserves baby trees.
Friends of Trees	173361		/users/profile/229502	A.Stone	General Member of the Public	5	10/04/2013	Friends of Trees in Portland, Oregon engages adult community members and youth in their own neighborhoods, trains them to train leaders in other neighborhoods, facilitates planting of street trees, and does other valuable restoration work in the metropolitan area.  This is cost effective for the city, reduces storm water, reduces homeowner cooling costs, and has spillover effects through ongoing civic engagement of community members in other areas.  FOT also sponsors, organizes and otherwise supports educational events and speakers on related topics. It's amazing how something as simple as planting trees has so many economic and social benefits. Top 5 best non-profits in the city for sure.
Friends of Trees	111144		/users/profile/151284	Kristin14	Volunteer	5	04/30/2012	I have volunteered for Friends of Trees since 2006, first as a Crew Leader helping teams of other volunteers plant street trees in our neighborhoods, then as a Neighborhood Coordinator, planning my own neighborhood's annual tree planting. I keep coming back because the work feels so beneficial--to have more trees in our urban environment. But mostly I keep coming back because Friends of Trees makes volunteering so enjoyable--the staff sets a fun, upbeat, lively tone to every event. We get important work done AND we have fun doing it, which makes continuing the work easy. 
Friends of Trees	110321		/users/profile/150195	Linda71	Client Served	5	04/19/2012	I bought two (very reasonably priced) trees from FOT for my parking strip.  This involved some special steps, and the organization helped me all along the way to get them done!  FOT arrived on time on the day designated and planted my trees.  I volunteered afterward in the kitchen at the site where volunteers met for lunch.  I met some great neighbors I didn't even know I had. My trees are blooming now. It was a great experiene over all!
Friends of Trees	86382		/users/profile/96695	Catherine	Volunteer	5	04/19/2011	Wow!  Adding green to my neighborhood and condo complex was easy with Friends of Trees! A true grass roots organization helping to add nature back to the city.  They make it affordable so that everyone can enjoy some more nature, more wildlife and better air.
Friends of Trees	82991		/users/profile/91801	Jeff C.	Volunteer	5	03/23/2011	First I ordered trees for my own house and helped plant them along with neighbors.  Then I became a crew leader on plantings.  Now I'm a neighborhood coordinator and it's been rewarding every step of the way.  Friends of Trees (FOT) builds community is many ways, not only in improving the canopy of trees along our streets, but connecting neighbors and volunteers with their own places of living.You can't plant a tree and not think about them a little differently afterwards.   The hands on aspect is key.FOT's mission is growing, and keeping up with that is the biggest challenge of all.
Friends of Trees	82923		/users/profile/91700	Conan H.	Volunteer	5	03/22/2011	I started volunteering for Friends of Trees around 15 years ago, but I have had such a positive experience that I keep coming back every year!  They are always well organized, positive and dedicated to increasing the tree canopy in the greater Portland metropolitan region.  They are constantly challenging themselves to improve their processes and they also work hard to connect with all of the communities in the region.  Thanks to Friends of Trees, the Portland/Vancouver area is gaining tree cover instead of losing it!  I will be back for as long as they keep it going!
Friends of Trees	82917		/users/profile/91695	ellenoregon	Volunteer	5	03/22/2011	 I am a crew leader for the Neighborhood Trees program.  This means I spend four or five Saturdays planting about a dozen trees.  This experience never fails to make me happy.  You would think the focus would be on the trees, greening the city and reducing global warming.  But actually, the best part is getting to know the folks I am planting with, finding out why they decided to volunteer and what their life is about.  Portland, Oregon is a big city, but  this is the greatest way I have found to find new connections with others.  I love  to see neighbors who didn't know each other, become friends by the end of the planting.  Then we go back to where we started and have a great lunch, prepared by other volunteers.  In the end, the trees get in the ground, and everyone is excited to watch how they grow.  
Friends of Trees	82879		/users/profile/91651	Michelle W.	Client Served	5	03/22/2011	I really love what Friends of Trees does. I gave my brother a gift tree for Christmas this year and I enjoy all the wonderful trees all over Portland that Friends of Trees and their hard working volunteers have planted. Having more trees makes my bike ride along the I-5 multi-use path so much more enjoyable, and my neighborhood has trees filling in dead space, with the Friends of Trees tags fluttering in the wind! They are a great, hard working bunch, thank you Friends of Trees, thank you for making my air more breathable and our communities more beautiful. 
Friends of Trees	82877		/users/profile/91643	Linda R.	General Member of the Public	5	03/22/2011	I've been involved with Friends of Trees, off and on, since its founding in 1989.  I still volunteer once or twice a year, despite my advancing age and physical limitations.  I'm always impressed with how well organized the planting events are.  Planting of trees is the most visible benefit of their work, but the bringing together of people in the neighborhood is even more important.
Friends of Trees	82618		/users/profile/91198	SusieMac	Volunteer	5	03/19/2011	I couldn't wait to request that Friends of Trees plant a tree in my yard. I loved the idea that there is a group who would do that. As I was welcomed into the process, I found out that I myself, and my neighbors, are that group! When you connect with F.O.T you become part of something larger: a community effort where you meet new friends and neighbors, enjoy part of the day working outside in the fresh air. There is a wonderful satisfaction in having joined together to plant hundreds of trees.  Friends of Trees staff are friendly, capable stewards who are passionate about planting trees in Portland neighborhoods. As soon as I made my inquiry, my local representative connected me with the beautiful F.O.T. website, where I learned about many new varieties of trees, and easily select the one I wanted. The price was extremely reasonable. F.O.T. communicated the timeline clearly, giving me lots of notice to reserve that day for volunteering. They gave clear instructions on where and when to meet, and which task I was requested to volunteer with. I saw that they could use snacks, so I was happy to contribute.  I was really struck by the overall spirit of cooperation fostered by this amazing organization. I see new trees frequently in my area and they dramatically improve the quality of the area.  I'm happy to have been part of the planting. I may volunteer for another day in someone else's neighborhood. This group does such important work!
Friends of Trees	82471		/users/profile/90942	Lacy C.	Client Served	5	03/17/2011	I ordered two trees from Friends of Trees and honestly had an amazing experience throughout the process.  From the great website, to the volunteer who came to our house to tell us what trees would go good where and the emails reminding us what to expect made it a very positive experience!  The day of the plant I was unable to volunteer because of a lack of childcare BUT when the volunteers showed up to plant our trees I was able to help out and everyone seemed to be having a great time!  One mother brought her 6 year old whose job it was to "stomp the dirt in"!  I was able to meet two neighbors whom I had seen around but it gave us a chance to actually talk and create community. I know wave and say hi every time I walk the dogs past their homes. Now a month later both my trees are doing great, and are daily reminders of such a great experience. I can't wait until they come back to our neighborhood!  I am going to order some more fruit trees.  
Friends of Trees	82284		/users/profile/90586	qwertyopia	Volunteer	5	03/15/2011	Until volunteering with Friends of Trees, I was mostly an indoor-type person and wanted to change that. So I had been on the lookout for a well-run, professional, environmental, and community-building focused organization to which I could volunteer my time. Friends of Trees is precisely that. The staff knows their stuff when it comes to trees and they know how to expertly organize and manage volunteer, community-based events every single weekend during the planting season. And there's just something fundamental about putting trees into the ground and wondering what they will become 10, 20, and 50 years from now and knowing the benefits trees provide to future generations. Friends of Trees is simply fantastic!
Friends of Trees	82118		/users/profile/90126	Albert K.	Volunteer	5	03/13/2011	We planted 212 trees yesterday in Irvington, Portland, Oregon, USA We love Friends of Trees.  Efficient, friendly, organized, and creating a lasting changing in our City.

Then we volunteered to help plant... Meeting people in our neighborhood, learning how to properly plant trees, getting to be part of an amazing organization, etc... it was an a memorable experience!  FOT helps our environment, our community, and every individual who has the opportunity to be a part of it.

Friends of Trees	82072		/users/profile/90061	Katie B.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	03/13/2011	Friends of Trees here would be a stellar organization if its accomplishments were a tenth of what they have been. The average non-profit would be proud of enlisting one tenth their number of working volunteers, and any organization that planted one tenth as many trees would be considered a rousing success.  Many organizations have studied the concepts of "flat" and "agile" and tried to implement them, but Friends of Trees here eats and breathes them. For that reason they run circles around everybody else with a fraction of the resources.  From professional study, I know that there is no more important environmental remedy for cities than creating a lush tree canopy --nothing better for urban and global warming, air quality or water quality. 
Friends of Trees	82056		/users/profile/90041	Laura S.	Volunteer	5	03/12/2011	I helped to plant trees with Friends of Trees recently and it was an amazing experience.

I will be volunteering again in the future for sure.  I love what they do!!

Friends of Trees	2871	17	/users/profile/4518	maureen	Volunteer	5	02/26/2009	I volunteered two and a half seasons with Friends of Trees as a crew leader for the natural areas plantings. I enjoyed every minute of it. It was a wonderful feeling knowing that each season I was responsible for getting at least 200 new trees planted. Every volunteer that I was a crew leader for was enthusiastic and interesting. I think FOT attracts caring, kind and seemingly very bright people : ). I also all the crew leaders that I met and worked with. It has so far been one of my favorite volunteer experiences in the Portland area.
Friends of Trees	2866	14	/users/profile/4513	vancojo	Volunteer	5	02/26/2009	What I love about this group, in addition to its admirable mission and friendly staff, is the focus and organization of its events. Volunteers who show up for neighborhood tree plantings are efficiently assigned to small groups which spread out and systematically plant trees--If you like a sense of accomplishment and teamwork and don't mind dirt--join this crowd. (You also usually get snacks)

Collateral Repair Project	161807		/users/profile/214605	Joanne Ehret	Donor	5	06/30/2013	I have been impressed again and again by the life-saving work that Collateral Repair Project has done over the years! With such a small staff, they are doing so much to meet the basic needs for food and shelter for Iraqi and Syrian refugees. I consider it a privilege to support their work with a monthly donation.
Collateral Repair Project	161778		/users/profile/214572	Lisa McCreary	Donor	5	06/29/2013	I have personally witnessed the work that is done my this charity in Amman. I went with one of the founders to visit a few of the recipients of their work. It was heart-breaking to see their situations and hear their stories.   As a result of their connection with the Collateral Repair Project, they were rescued from situations that would have only become increasingly worse.  Also, I believe  they no longer felt they were alone, which psychologically gave them hope--something they clearly needed as well. The various programs that CRP provides are imaginative, creative and offers interesting activities to every age group-it is amazing that so much is provided with minimal funding. The members work tirelessly, and their commitment is very evident to those who know them.I hope this will help to gain their organization more recognition so donations will increase, the need is great and I have seen the impact of their work. As I mentioned earlier, so much is done with the funding they do receive, not a penny is wasted. 
Collateral Repair Project	161735		/users/profile/214522	kim schultz	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/28/2013	What an amazing organization. They do so much for so little. I know every dollar I give them gets put to use. Their overhead is small, as is their donor base. They could always use more help for the important work they do. Iraqi refugees have been abandoned. This is a disgrace. This organization sets about to try to do some repair. And now with thier expansion into working with Syrian refugees, it is even more important. Amazing, life changing work for a few amazing folks!
Collateral Repair Project	161733		/users/profile/214520	blj_maj	Donor	5	06/28/2013	The accomplishments of this grassroots organization have impressed me since  the beginning!  Two or three women, starting just with their urge to somehow make up for the enormous injustices of the destruction of Iraqi society, have done amazing things. Their slide presentations are eloquent.  I have no doubt that the social and financial support they provide for the refugees in Amman, Jordan, are literally a lifeline for the individuals and families they serve.  The dedication, resourcefulness and staying power of the Collateral Repair Project staff and volunteersare truly admirable. This is a way of life for those who are on the ground in Amman, responding to the needs they see with energy and determination.   I am proud to donate to such a worthwhile organization, and I have used contributions to the group as a way to honor family members on their birthdays. 
Collateral Repair Project	161707		/users/profile/214496	Veronica Ramadan	Donor	5	06/28/2013	I love the Collateral Repair Project.  It is hard to imagine people more committed to making change in this world than the Director, staff and volunteers at the Collateral Repair Project. After a lifetime of working in the nonprofit field, I would say they have renewed my faith in the ability of nonprofits to actually put the people they serve first and foremost.  Besides the no frills management, no massive overhead, no unnecessary expenditures their absolute dedication and hands on approach to helping some of the world's most forgotten and desperate people is commendable and to be admired.
Collateral Repair Project	161701		/users/profile/167265	Rosemary N.	Board Member	5	06/28/2013	CRP has formed personal relationships with the refugee community in Amman and because of this network is able to respond quickly to emergency situations. Please read my longer review of CRP that I posted in 2012.  CRP is still doing an outstanding job of stretching its donations for maximum benefit and to literally keep food on the table for the most destitute.  CRP remains a unique haven for those who have lost everything and have no other place to go for help. Your donations make CRP's work possible. Please view CRP's wonderful work--helping YOU help Iraqi and Syrian refugees-- and almost daily updates on Facebook.
Collateral Repair Project	122803	3	/users/profile/167265	Rosemary N.	Donor	5	09/21/2012	I believe CRP is a very special charitable organization.  It is run with absolute openness, wise frugality, and respectful compassion.  It seeks to preserve, as other reviewers have stated so well here, the dignity of the Iraqi refugees it serves and to help them rebuild a sense of community as well as help, as funds allow, with life and death needs.  I just wanted to highlight the CRPs community/resource center.  The Center offers a lot of practical learning opportunities (ESL, cultural understanding, computer literacy, experience in running a micro-business, lending library, art for kids, kids self-defense classes, etc.) as well as simple social activities for all ages.  These do wonders in helping Iraqis begin to heal and regain self-confidence and hope after they have endured so much violence and deprivation.  Often the CRP team taps the talents of the Iraqi refugee community itself for leaders or instructors, who earn a small stipend for their services.  Productive, valued work helps rebuild self-esteem and dignity, as well as supply much-needed income.  Sasha and her team are amazing in their insight, ingenuity, sustained inspiration, true empathy and kindness.  You can see this clearly as you follow their day-to-day activities on the CRP Facebook page.  I dont know HOW Sasha and her colleagues find the time to keep this information up to date so charmingly!  Their Facebook page gives you, among other things, almost immediate and complete feedback on how your money is being spent.  Sasha uses this simple tool to bring together all of us around the world who love CRP to share in its daily activities, from a brief clip of the kids doing karate chops to a feast-day meal for single men to a teen art class to pictures of Iraqi women managing the Hope Workshop selling their crafts in one of Ammans traditional marketsYOU are there!  We also become aware in a very natural wayjust like when your neighbor needs a cup of sugar!of the daily struggles, needs, and joys of the Center and the Iraqi community there.  They become a part of us.  We are then able to respond with real empathy to a call of need because we KNOW the need is real.  Any amount is welcomedafter all, $3.75 feeds one person for a week!  I wanted to mention, too, Sashas anecdotes of daily happenings at the CRP athey are wonderful, poignant, sad, and informative all at onceand some even give us tears of joy.  These personal stories broaden our minds and hearts and put us there.  Rest assured, you will not regret giving to this wonderful group!  The CRP group will see to it that your money is stretched to its maximum!  Whether you contribute to overhead costs (without which CRP cannot even open its doors), to specific activities or needs, or to occasional funding drives, Im sure Sasha has a list at the ready of ideas just waiting for your help!!
Collateral Repair Project	161327		/users/profile/213946	Deborah67	Donor	5	06/24/2013	I found CRP through friend recommendations and love the fact they are vrass roots and take care of the basic needs,  I truely beieve until awi have food in our belly and a safe roof over our heads we can't begin to see the larger picture and problem solve. The updates make it feel very personal
Collateral Repair Project	161291		/users/profile/213899	Chubby	Donor	5	06/24/2013	Excellent organization that helps a variety of refugees with virtually no overhead. As a donor, I've been very pleased with how CRP makes use of its funds. They go directly to very poor refugees though buying them food, clothing, and heating. I will continue to fund CPR, and encourage other to do the same.
Collateral Repair Project	161254	2	/users/profile/213820	Amanda84	Board Member	5	06/23/2013	CRP is a very unique and special organization in Amman, Jordan.  Most of the larger organizations working with refugees pass out assistance from time to time without building relationships with the families they serve.  Building community and relationships are very vital elements in CRP's mission.  Our community center welcomes individuals and families from any nation and/or sect and delivers fun and educational activities to help them both interact and begin the healing process.  Our food voucher and emergency assistance programs deliver valuable assistance to the most vulnerable refugees who receive no other aid whatsoever.  As refugees continue to stream into Amman from Iraq and Syria, the aid network has certainly become taxed, yet refugees coming to CRP are offered a respectful and a supportive community in a way that no other organization can.
Collateral Repair Project	161252	1	/users/profile/213817	Vanessa H.	Donor	5	06/23/2013	I am very grateful that CPJ is there to do the work that they do, with compassion and love. Hearing about some of the terrible injustices that people on the other side of the world face, often leaves me feeling as though there isn't much that I can do, but through CPJ I know that even the few dollars that I can afford to send will be spent wisely and stretched far. 
Collateral Repair Project	161227		/users/profile/213791	Mary178	Board Member	5	06/22/2013	I've been associated with this grassroots organization since its inception in 2007. I've watched it grow and witnessed first hand the invaluable work it has done for the hundreds of refugees it has assisted. From emergency assistance to educational and social opportunities, CRP reaches throughout the refugee community in Amman, Jordan. CRP is regarded as a top-notch resource, providing vital services with honesty and respect while preserving the dignity of  those it serves. 
Collateral Repair Project	161179		/users/profile/213700	Bidour A.	Donor	5	06/21/2013	A wonderful organization that truly cares about helping others and telling their heart warming stories.  I get the feeling that the workers and the volunteers truly want to help the refugees and will do whatever it takes.  My family and I were told about this organization by a friend and we will hopefully continue to help :) It is wonderful how they are continuing their great work!
Collateral Repair Project	153173		/users/profile/167106	Carmen4	Donor	5	04/07/2013	I am so impressed by the way CRP continues to survive financially just by donations, and actually increases and broadens the assistance they offer. CRP now helps victims of the conflict in Syria too.Something that has stuck in my mind recently is how CRP brings together all religions, sects, and representatives of all sections of Iraqi and Syrian society, and inspires people to work together.  The fabulous Womens' Co-op is a great example.CRP continues to be a human, caring face, treating people as individuals with individual needs. The recent addition of hygiene packs is such a super idea.  I love the classes, especially the self-defence and English classes.Thank you CRP for all you do.
Collateral Repair Project	122688	3	/users/profile/167106	Carmen4	Donor	5	09/20/2012	 I have only been able to make a few small donations to CRP, but I hope this will change in the future as my finances improve. I am amazed by the amount of dedicated work, and the assistance that CRP gives to the Iraqi people they serve so humbly in Amman. Sasha and her team think outside of the box and provide such things as kids' karate classes, English classes, dominoes nights, IT Training - including Skype so communications may be made more easily to family living elsewhere. Providing photos is a great idea as most people have lost theirs. The Womens' Cooperative is amazing... CRP pays for medical treatment whenever possible..... the list goes on...... I am deeply grateful to CRP and am humbled by their example.
Collateral Repair Project	141870	1	/users/profile/188272	Aveen A.	Volunteer	5	11/21/2012	CRP is one of the greatest organizations dealing with refugees' issues.. They assess the cases objectively and make sure that those who deserve the aids get what they need.. They have a very friendly, dedicated  staff and they treat all those in need equally and with great deal of respect.  They provide refugees with food vouchers, basic items, and second hand clothes, among other aids. Besides their role in paying family visits for assessment, CRP is a community center that provide classes (English and computer) and activities (children fun time and adults communication nights).. CRP touches and changes the lives of refugees in a tremendous way, and I am truly honored to be part of their volunteering team... 
Collateral Repair Project	122865	1	/users/profile/167375	RADavis	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/23/2012	I am a researcher on Iraqi refugees and have reviewed many NGOs and non-profits working with refugees. CRP is among the best I've ever seen. It is a refugee-driven charity that treats those it serves with dignity and respect and serves to help everyone in need. It is based in the community and receives tiny bits of funding from hundreds of people and in-kind and financial donations from those living in Jordan. Most importantly, it has developed programs for children, women, and men both to provide services to others and to receive services. Self-defense classes, free haircuts, dominos night, reading group, in addition to food vouchers and used clothing and goods for the more needy. It functions such that refugees help refugees (those who teach the classes are Iraqi refugees) and don't just receive handouts and remain victims. 
Collateral Repair Project	122730	2	/users/profile/167153	Susan121	Donor	5	09/20/2012	I heard about CRP via a network and began communicating with the co-ordinator in Amman.  I made no indication of becoming a donor, just curiosity in how it was run, having myself worked all my life with refugees and related projects and also being a stickler for accountability and appropriate community development / empowerment principles. Immediately I was furnished with accountabilities/acquitalls,details of all aspects of the financial management of the project and all questions answered about programs, philosophical frameworks and so on.  What I really like about this project is that is it truly grassroots, you really do know where your money is going and that not a cent is wasted. Moreover, you have options as to what you want to support financially. I was concerned for the monthly running costs (so little is needed for this) and that CRP should not have to worry about raising funds for this and rather concentrate on the direct needs of the refugees. So I took that option and tried to rope in others to cover this monthly expense on an ongoing basis. At other times, I have the option to send additional amounts for particular activities or needs of a refugee. There is no pressure, every little contribution is highly appreciated, you just follow what is going on and respond when you feel moved  (and able) to do so. This is the kind of organisation that works with its heart and never promotes itself...it truly serves with humility and with respect for the sanctity of life and dignity of the human spirit.
Collateral Repair Project	122674	3	/users/profile/167089	Sarina S.	Donor	5	09/20/2012	I have made several donations to this group only because I truly believe in their outstanding work that is being done overseas to help rebuild lives that were war stricken and homeless. I do believe in the power one soul helping others makes a big difference. Surprisingly enough they have made my donations stretch beyond what I could ever imagined to lots of people not just one person.
Collateral Repair Project	122661	2	/users/profile/167075	mary r	Donor	5	09/20/2012	This charity is indeed a project, for the improvement of the lives of people. I truly admire the creativity of the staff in finding solutions that focus on the personal development of the well-being of the persons they serve and that means as well respecting their need of remaining human beings. They do not treat them as faceless figures, but they welcome them and recognise their need to have a space to gather socially and to heal inside after the traumas that afflict them. Being refugees, having lost all that was previously familiar to them and in the aftermath of war, they are very vulnerable. The humanity that the staff shows to those who they assist is a precious commodity, as well as being impressed by the accountability of this charity, which responds in a detailed way to donors and gives concrete proof of the work they have done with the donations that have come to them. There is so little overhead, and so much done, that this deserving charity is the essence of what a charitable organisation should be, but often so many are not. They also are very grateful to their benefactors, even if the amount is not large, which is yet another aspect that is lacking in most of the organisations I have had experience with. I cannot reccommend this charity more highly. 
Collateral Repair Project	122659	4	/users/profile/167074	Danae H.	Donor	5	09/20/2012	I found this charity through a church friend who did a play about Iraqi refugees.  After seeing her play, I was horrified by what's happened to refugees there and I wanted to do something.  She suggested Collateral Repair Project.  Responses have been quick from them, I see where my money is going since they post pictures on their Facebook.  They're creative for such a small non-profit doing Mother's Day cards and Valentine's Day cards (I received one of those)!  I hope, one day, to be able to visit their project.  I hope and pray that this will help them get more donors to take care of these forgotten people.
Collateral Repair Project	122657	2	/users/profile/167064	Susan119	Donor	4	09/20/2012	I found Collateral Repair Project quite by chance on social networks and was immediately impressed by their Facebook page. To backtrack a little: I was horrified by the immense humanitarian crisis suffered by Iraqis and started reading more about it 3 years ago.  It seemed the world didn't notice the millions of Iraqis, who had to leave their homes and it stunned me that hardly anyone was doing anything to help these people. Or even raise awareness of their critical situations. And I have been a major supporter of non- profits for a long time. However, through a mutual friend, I found CRP.  I said I was impressed by their page; this is a non profit that literally works on a shoestring. But the simplest actions really brings benefit to people; whether it's a dominos night for men or simply purchasing a fan, a twin burner stove to make a families life easier. And the people who run CRP are clearly passionate about what they do... they use social media to promote their activities so all the resources they do have, are directly for the people they help. I cannot say enough about how much I admire CRP and I am writing this review for one reason only; to promote what they do because it would be awful to see such an initiative disappear.  
Collateral Repair Project	122653	3	/users/profile/167067	Christina Baseos	Donor	5	09/20/2012	An excellent non-profit org run by wonderful human beings, who work under the hardest conditions. Despite the obstacles and the difficulties they face on a daily basis in order to help the Iraqi refugees, this org ALWAYS puts human dignity above all else. Moreover, and this is very important for an non-profit org, there is 100% accountability & transparency for each and every donation made, regardless if it's $1 or $1000. CRP follows all rules & regulations provided for non-profit orgs, is a registered org and you will always be able to check whether your donation has been wisely used as there is constant feedback on every project CRP runs. I highly recommend Collateral Repair Project as a non-profit org and its cause is worth every single penny you can donate towards it.
My Fathers House A Community Shelter Inc	197278	2	/users/profile/257897	Kayell	General Member of the Public	5	04/08/2014	I just wanted to say that I really believe that this shelter and the people who run it are doing it from the best place... a true inner desire to help people and to change the world around them. Through my workplace I was able to take part in some fundraising for My Fathers House and also donated a Saturday of my time to help out at a "Thank You" BBQ that they hosted for some of the sponsors and volunteers who help the shelter. I was given a tour and met many of the residents at the shelter. I really enjoyed hearing from people about how My Fathers House was helping them and their loved ones. My Fathers House has helped many people through probably some of the worst moments of their lives with dignity and respect... and allowed these people to stay together as a family unit. I can't imagine anything more important when a family faces adversity than to be able to face it together.  These people care and it shows.... I'm proud to be able to do even a small part to help them and hope that anyone thinking of supporting this cause will do so. Thanks to everyone involved for proving that people do still care and can make a difference. 
My Fathers House A Community Shelter Inc	190259	1	/users/profile/248387	dustluvr137	Client Served	5	12/09/2013	I really don't know where to start. It would sound like an over dramatic statement if I said something like "My Fathers House saved my life and kept my family from being torn apart" but in a very real way, they did. I had no hopes for a job when we (my ten month old son, his mother, and I) were evicted from our apartment. No relative or friend would take us in as a group and we were determined to stay together. We were told about My Fathers House and had a hard time believing it... it sounded too good to be true. But, thank God, it wasn't! We were treated with kindness and respect. No one EVER made me feel like I was being looked down on. I felt real love from everyone from the Exective Director to my Growth Leader ( who happened to be the E.D.'s husband :D ) to all of the staff and volunteers... they all REALLY wanted me and my family to succeed. When you are totally down and out, most of the time you really don't want/need a hand out. In most cases, what would be best is a hand up. At My Fathers House, that's exactly what we got.
My Fathers House A Community Shelter Inc	87882	2	/users/profile/98687	Kathy	Volunteer	5	04/28/2011	     I remember when God gave Cathe a vision for this shelter. I worked for Cathe at East Hill church as one of her many nursery supervisors.  The other shelters in the city had limits on a child's age, so not all children in a family could go together to a shelter. If a child was 12 or older they would need to go elsewhere. It is very difficult for a family to go anywhere for shelter when rules limit a childs age. Though shelters do this to protect children from sexual child abuse it offered little hope to whole families with older children.  Cathe expressed to me she wanted to find a solution to the problem. From the duplex to the larger building, My Fathers House is growing and becoming what God planted years ago in Cathe and Dan's heart.     Both my husband and I volunteered for a short period of time. The beautiful orcastration God delivered in the organization of the shelter was solid, visual proof that a mighty God called for this to happen.     Years later I entered seminary and asked Cathe if I might intern for the shelters chapel. The shelter offers a church service on Sunday.  I look forward to my time in a place where God's love is abundant and in a chapel where the Holy Spirit is moving in mighty ways.
My Fathers House A Community Shelter Inc	57496	2	/users/profile/60782	Ginger C.	Volunteer	5	11/20/2010	I've always thought very highly of homeless shelters, but never went anywhere near them. I donated from afar, dropping things into boxes set up to be delivered to them. But last summer I met some kids from My Father's House at Eagle Fern Camp. The day after camp ended I visited for the first time. The building itself is beautiful, built specifically for the purpose and filled with uplifting artwork. The children have a large playroom with all kinds of toys and a large, fenced in play structure. I immediately signed up to volunteer. The staff continually thanks me every time I work. I do a four hour shift once a week, answering the phone and greeting visitors and volunteers. I knew before I ever met Cathe Weise that I would like her. I worked on her day off for quite a while so when I finally switched days and met her I told her immediately how impressed I was with her staff and how I knew that all the consistently positive attitudes I saw in her absence had to be coming from the top down. Working with her regularly has only confirmed it! Every time a staff person even begins to say something negative, they stop and correct themselves, stating the truth with hope instead. I've been there long enough to see the fruit of the ministry in the lives of the people who live there as they find faith, jobs, and hope. The building doesn't feel like a ministry, it has a heart like a church, but more like a home, because it is one. 
My Fathers House A Community Shelter Inc	57196	3	/users/profile/60113	Lynnette	Volunteer	5	11/17/2010	It is my great pleasure to help with My Father's House's quarterly newsletter. I always look forward to it. My husband and I also make occasional monetary and food donations, and we are adopting a family for Christmas again this year -- it really brings the spirit of Christmas to life for us. There are many ways to contribute to the success of MFH and their clients. MFH changes lives in our community, which makes it a better place for us and everyone else (including you!) to live. 
My Fathers House A Community Shelter Inc	57195	2	/users/profile/60111	Tenora G	Board Member	5	11/17/2010	My Father's House is a privately funded shelter for homeless families that is meeting a huge need in our community.  It is unique in that it allows families to stay together while helping them regain their independence.  A core value of the shelter is that we don't do for our families what they can do for themselves so staff, volunteers and our board are all committed to treating our families with respect and dignity while helping them gain the skills and confidence needed to live independently once they transition out of the shelter. 
My Fathers House A Community Shelter Inc	57160	1	/users/profile/60052	master	Volunteer	5	11/16/2010	This non-profit is the largest family shelter privately funded and fully supported by ordinary people like you and me. They help whole families and doesn't split them up. They give families help, training, support and tools to become successful in their community. The families that have gone thru the program, come back to give and help out when they can!
My Fathers House A Community Shelter Inc	57127	1	/users/profile/60007	bketch	Board Member	5	11/16/2010	Why do I give to My Father's House?  Because every dollar goes soooooooo far!  Just 5 employees leverage over 240 volunteers every month who teach, train, and hold accountable these struggling homeless families.  Thank you volunteers!
My Fathers House A Community Shelter Inc	57122	1	/users/profile/60001	Angie A.	Volunteer	5	11/16/2010	I LOVE this place! I work in the Donation Center and at the reception desk! It is SO AMAZING to see first hand what a blessing this ministry is to everyone involved here! Residents, volunteers and staff are all just awesome people and I am constantly in awe of what God does thru and for these people. Everyone who can - should somehow become involved - it will bless you as much (or more) as it blesses those you serve. 
My Fathers House A Community Shelter Inc	40249	1	/users/profile/41163	donald5	Client Served	5	05/24/2010	Tell your story here and help others understand this charity            My family was fortunate enough to have lived at the new building of My Father's House for about 4 months.  The icing on the cake of instability was losing our housing situation in an unfortunate situation with our housemate.  We spent about 3 months couch-surfing among relatives (me, my wife, and our 4 kids).  I was still managing to hold down my full time job all the while.  One day my wife mentioned something about this "father's house" place.  I was willing to go see what they were about, so we set up an appointment with Sam.  As our luck would turn out, it was probably the best thing to happen to us in YEARS.  We are now over a year removed from our stay, and while the marriage is still on thin ice, we are definitely better off as people for having stayed at My Father's House.  And as I swore to Cathe on the day we left, I will ALWAYS find some way or another to help out the shelter.  And you should too!  They just opened up their new apartment complex, and so the needs are greater than ever.  But the help is burgeoning too.  Cathe, Dan, Dougie, Heather, all the Staff, I love you guys and I won't ever forget what you've done for me and my family.  Don S.
My Fathers House A Community Shelter Inc	23067	1	/users/profile/24126	stevenminardi@hotmail.com	Volunteer	5	11/26/2009	Almost from it's inception, we have had the privilege of observing the unrelenting faith and determination that My Fathers House has displayed in their vision to make a difference in our community by reaching out to homeless families. As part of the prayer support for this work, we have been able to stay very informed of the trials and victories that this outreach has encountered and absolutely marvel at the depth of assistance that they provide, and victories in lives that they touch. This work has a very professional, solid and accountable foundation and at this point in it's ongoing development only needs finances to increase its good works and good fruit in our community.
My Fathers House A Community Shelter Inc	22800	16	/users/profile/23801	davemc	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/17/2009	I have been around this ministry since its inception and have found the commitment level to homeless families to be over the top.  They have chosen to provide the tools that families need to succeed.  Financial coaching, discipleship courses, relationship building, and above all accountability.
My Fathers House A Community Shelter Inc	22733	1	/users/profile/23737	golfnut	Volunteer	5	11/16/2009	I have been involved with several aspects of volunteering and have found this organization is far and above the best as far as staff and commitment to their purpose.  Relationships with the families as well as all volunteers is demonstrated by LOVE and DESIRE to fulfill the goals they have established in helping families.

My Fathers House A Community Shelter Inc	22687	1	/users/profile/23697	ericbahme	Board Member	5	11/14/2009	My Fathers House is simply amazing. The support they give staff, volunteers and those who live there is amazing. The organization is well run with wonderful systems of support. To be honest, this is one of the most well run non-profits I have personally seen or been a part of.
My Fathers House A Community Shelter Inc	22686	1	/users/profile/23696	DavidJoel	Volunteer	5	11/14/2009	I've volunteered at MFH for many years. I've seen how it helps the homeless community. One of the unique characteristics of MFH is that they don't split up families. They keep the residents accountable for their actions and help them rebuild their lives. The staff and volunteers don't look down the residents; they have a desire to help them get back on their feet. MFH has a lot of resources that offer free to their residents. They have a computer lab where residents can build their resumes, look for work, and new homes. The community that MFH resides in is very supportive and understands the need of MFH.
My Fathers House A Community Shelter Inc	22673	1	/users/profile/23669	tinman97030	Volunteer	5	11/14/2009	My wife and son have both served as volunteers, I am so proud of them for doing this.  It has been my great pleasure to serve also, as well as donating goods and finances.  The thing that impresses me the most is the complete program MFH provides to those who have fallen down and need a little help to get back up.  They allow an entire family to stay together while they rebuild their life.  For somebody who has lost everything, it takes more than 24 hours, it takes more than a month, MFH allows a family to stay for 6 months.  They have all kinds of classes in finances, how to apply for a job and interview successfully, how to be a parent and set boundaries.  Many families are rebuilt and return to society and contribute again.

It is so great to see these families receive the help they need and transform their lives.

Many return to visit and thank the volunteerts-Absolutely great!!!

My Fathers House A Community Shelter Inc	22559	3	/users/profile/23579	mruboo	General Member of the Public	5	11/13/2009	OH MY GOSH!!! WE NEED THOUSANDS OF THESE SHELTERS!!!  The Love of God is ooozzzing in and out of these doors!!!   I am just an outsider looking in, but if I were in need as so many people are these days, that is the FIRST place I'd run to!!  The Hosts are the most loving, compassionate, with great sense of humor children of God you'd ever meet.  They have followed step by step the Lord calling in this...so much so that they stay at the shelter and have given up their "dream Home"  to there children (because they lost their jobs and such), so that they could be on the front lines helping others.  Now tell me....how many of us would give up there Dream Homes to live in a shelter when they didn't have to?  That's the Love of God!!!  They provide so much to help people back on their feet.  And I understand that they would like to build another one because the need is so great....I HOPE SO!!!   WE NEED MORE OF THESE AND MORE PEOPLE LIKE CATHE AND DAN!!!!

We have been consistently impressed by the wholehearted service they provide.  The staff goes above and beyond to serve the clients in order to assure their success.  We feel great about donating as we know every dollar is spent very carefully.  My Father's House does so much with rather limited resources.
My Fathers House A Community Shelter Inc	22542	3	/users/profile/23563	Sagoron Girl	Volunteer	5	11/13/2009	The staff of My Fathers House are amazing. They care about the whole person and the long-term success of their residents to gain and keep independent living. Volunteering in a place that is helping people overcome the root issues that brought them to the doors of this shelter is very rewarding because I know they leave with tools and skills that will strengthen them throughout their lives. Classes like "Ready to Rent", "Financial Freedom", "The Genesis Process" and parenting skills are just a few ways they grow while staying at this shelter. I personally love being a support to the staff in a few of these classes, and I enjoy getting to know the families who are genuinely grateful to find a place that helps them change from the inside out.

They were giggling and pretty soon the big kids wanted to play, then parents got done with their class and we were all outside blowing bubble and seeing who's bubble could fly the furthest.

I lost 2 of my babies during the first trimester of pregnancy.  I had nothing tangible to hold or look at as I grieved and remembered my babies that had died.  One day I came across Calvin's Hats, and I requested 2 hats, one for each of my babies.  I treasure these teeny tiny little hats that fit on my fingertips.  When I hold them I feel connected to my babies, and it is so special to me to have something for them.  This organization does wonderful things and provides such a great service to grief stricken parents.

The comfort that they provide, both to parents who have lost babies (thankfully I don't fall into that category) and to those who wish there was something they can do to try to ease the pain for those parents, makes this organization one that I recommend to other charity knitter/crocheters that I know. I also must say that some of the people who contribute are angel baby moms themselves, and they derive comfort from being able to help other parents going through the same thing they did. I've read stories on Ravelry.com, for instance, where it has been said that being able to make the little hats to donate helps fill the hole left by not being able to make things for the babies they lost.

Calvin's Hats rushed us a package with a beautiful hand-made tiny hat. I took pictures of the hat on my very pregnant belly and joked that we wouldn't need it because our baby girl would stay put until she was much too big for that tiny hat! Unfortunately, our daughter was born too soon a couple of weeks later and passed away shortly after birth. During that brief window of time where she was still alive and we held her close, we had that ONE THING that fit her, that kept her tiny head warm, that showed we loved her and was just for her....we had that one hat. And in that moment, there was not a single thing in God's green earth that was as precious as that hat on my angel's tiny head. God bless Calvin's Hats, thank you.

I was completely surprised when my hospital nurse came in with a variety of hats for us to choose from to bury our baby girl in. She was only 15 weeks. Her pink knitted bonnet was so sweet and adorable. We got plenty of pictures.  We had no idea that something so small could make us feel so special about our baby girl who was already in Heaven.  They also gave us a knitted sack to place her in since clothes her size weren't an option. There aren't really any words to express just what a lovely and comforting touch it was to have the hat for our daughter.  When the nurse brought it in, I felt like even though my baby girl was gone, she was treated just as special as if she had been a live birth.  My husband and I can't thank you enough for comforting us,  and understanding our delicate situation.  The hat really made us feel like we weren't alone and that there were people out there who cared about our baby as much as we do.  Thank you.

I was SO WRONG. I found myself in this really dark place and scared beyond anything I had ever felt before. I made the call to Breast Friends, and my life changed almost immediately. Sharon and Becky provided the hope necessary to get through my diagnosis and treatment, and then they became family. I found my recovery to be a 2 phased experience. First your doctors heal you physically, and then the emotional healing begins. This is where Breast Friends helped me get back on track to a better life than I had before.  When I was going through all the surgery and recovery, a happier life is something I seriously couldn't  imagine.  It was a long and challenging journey, but when I needed that gentle voice, that ray of hope, that person willing to extend themselves to help, there is none better than Breast Friends. Their entire staff is there to help, and their volunteers are the BEST!

Breast Friends	58801		/users/profile/62898	Nice Lady	Volunteer	5	12/14/2010	Hearing the diagnosis of "breast cancer" is traumatic, and not everyone has family, friends or co-workers to provide support. The Mission of Breast Friends - "Until there's a cure, helping women survive the trauma of cancer...one friend at a time....." is to make certain every woman does have loving, caring, sincere support during a frightening, stressful, question-filled time.  Breast Friends is a blessing: the organization exudes kindness, joy and the all-important ear to hear the concerns of Survivors. There is so much fear and confusion beginning with diagnosis that many people feel uncertain about everything. Often, the Survivor, or family member, "just" needs to talk, and our "job" is to listen and help them down from the ceiling. My diagnosis has resulted in wonderful friendships that I am so glad to have in my life; in fact, I feel breast cancer is one of the most positive experiences of my life because of the special Survivors - all ages, backgrounds, interests, etc - I've met. Breast Friends has also provided me an opportunity to volunteer, and help make a positive difference in other women's lives.

I sell Cancer Insurance and as a result, become one of the first people to learn about cancer diagnosis from my clients.  It's a relief to have been exposed to Becky and Sharon's expertise about how to help someone at this point.  They give hands on examples of what someone who had been diagnosed with cancer is going through and help those of us around them to actually say and do things that make a positive difference in the lives of newly diagnosed cancer patients.

However that did not stop Sharon or breast friends from reaching out to me and providing support in my time to of need.  Sharon and I talked for hoursand she helped me through some tough times during chemo.  I can only imagine what they do for their local folks.  We now have a local chapter in raleigh, NC.  Breast friends is a wonderful charity and organization that provides services that are priceless.  I hope they have the opportunity to continue to do what they do and expand to help women everywhere.  Women diagnosed with breast cancer need them like I needed them.  Thanks breast friends for lending your hand to hold through very rough waters.
Breast Friends	58607		/users/profile/62556	cmn92158	Volunteer	5	12/08/2010	I volunteer at an ACS Cancer Resource Center in Bend Oregon.  The folks at Breast Friends have generously shared the materials and hats from their vast amount of resources with us.  It is such a wonderful opportunity to give a woman with breast cancer some very pertinent information, a tip sheet for the caregiver, and the uplifting hat which always puts a smile on the faces of everyone in the infusion room.  Thank you Breast Friends for being there for the women of Central Oregon.  
Breast Friends	58593		/users/profile/62522	piot	General Member of the Public	5	12/08/2010	I am a 10 year  breast cancer survivor. When I was going through my treatment, at the time, Breast of Friends was just  starting and not really developed. The only support groups for breast cancer were support groups developed at hospitals. I later met two brave women, Sharon and Becky, who had shared the same similar stories of mine and was on a mission to make a difference not only in Portland but with Breast Cancer. I have seen this organization grow the past 10 years and make a difference in this sisterhood. Breast of Friends had made a great difference in the community of women's cancer by their support,  passion,hard work, and most of their commitement to help find a cure for this disease. I would highly recommend this organization and support to continue this organization.  
Breast Friends	58580		/users/profile/62495	spotblue	Professional with expertise in this field	5	12/07/2010	This is a fabulous organization that provides one-on-one support to breast and ovarian cancer patients.  The volunteers are survivors and give an amazing amount of personal time and energy to provide support for patients, their friends and family members.  It's amazing what these women do for FREE!  I tell all new breast cancer patients about Breast Friends.; I consider them a key resource and don't know what I would do without them!
Breast Friends	58552		/users/profile/62415	Liz O.	Volunteer	5	12/06/2010	Alone, having just moved to a new city, I was incredibly scared when I found a lump in my left breast.  On my way to work one day I saw a "Cancer Support" sign on an office building.  Knowing I had no other support to speak of, I pulled in.  When I timidly entered Breast Friends' office and explained my problem, they immediately gave me hugs all-around.  Then they visited with me a bit to get to know my story, taking time out of their busy days.  Finally, they arranged to go to every single one of my doctor appointments so I would not be alone.  They took notes, asked good questions, and assured me that they'd stand by me whatever came.  They came to my surgery and wrote me cards of encouragement.  As it turned out, I didn't have cancer, but I did find some amazing friends.  I decided to volunteer with Breast Friends because they actually do things that help, like going to doctor appointment and giving hugs.  Without them, an incredibly scary time in my life would have been unbearable.  I'd recommend them to anyone.  
Breast Friends	58551		/users/profile/62412	MizBliz	Client Served	5	12/06/2010	I was diagnosed with breast cancer in March of 2010. After my initial meeting with the doctors, I was given a handbook that included many contact sites. I called Breast Friends one afternoon looking for advice on how to deal with my specific situation. I received a call back within an hour with honest and open answers to my questions from people who have had experience with the disease. My original contact has helped me and my husband deal with the fears and frustrations that come with the initial shock and has followed my progress. She has responded quickly to any calls/emails and has reached out just to check on my progress. Given the many volunteers in their group who have personal experience with a wide variety of situations, Breast Friends is in a unique position to provide excellent support.
Breast Friends	58548		/users/profile/62408	Paula	Client Served	5	12/06/2010	After being diagnosed with a high grade fast growing breast cancer in March of 2010 at only age 44 - panic and fear were daily emotions until I met a wonderful Breast Friends Melbourne Chapter Founder - Sherry - at my oncologist's office.  Sherry is a BC survivor herself and openly shared her insight with me. She literally held my hand each time they had to access my port to give me chemo (I hate needles!). She and the other women of the Breast Friends organization have continued to call, email and check on my recovery. Words can't express my sincere gratitude for the emotional support I have continued to receive! No women should go through this experience alone and Breast Friends ensures that the support is always there when needed. 
Breast Friends	58538		/users/profile/62396	Mary Schwartz	Board Member	5	12/06/2010	I have been a supporter of Breast Friends for a number of years now because of the assistance these wonderful women and this non-profit offers women going through cancer, in the middle of it or at the end of it.  There are no other organizations that I know of that are THERE for you like Breast Friends at the "time" they are needed the most.  They help families understand and help them through the process aiding them in their role and how they can help.  That in itself if absolutely the most important part in assisting the patient to get healthy again.  I wish this organization would have been around when my Mother had breast cancer.
Breast Friends	58533		/users/profile/62388	Ms Kristen L Janes	Board Member	5	12/06/2010	Breast Friends is an exceptional organization on many fronts.  First they provide a unique service.  By training loved ones, friends and co-workers on how to provide practical help, they multiply the level of support given women going through the trauma of cancer.  Second, they support the women themselves from diagnosis, through treatment and through the inevitable changes that occur after recovery.  Finally, they maximize their reach by being amazing stewards of every penny provided through donations and fundraising efforts.  80% of every dollar goes directly into programs and outreach.  The co-founders always put program and material costs before themselves.  
Breast Friends	58519		/users/profile/62370	Lyn K.	Client Served	5	12/06/2010	I was diagnosed with Inflammatory Breast Cancer at age 30 in April 2009.  I received a list of breast cancer support groups to call on my first oncology visit, and Breast Friends had a big star handwritten by it.  I called the next day, and Sharon H., one of the founders answered the phone herself.  I talked with her for over half an hour and I really felt like she understood.  She helped me to feel more in control of the situation, and to remember to take it day by day.  I received a box from Breast Friends the following week with various breast cancer items, including a hat to help deal with the upcoming loss of my hair.  Over the course of my chemo and surgeries, I became personal friends with Sharon as she visited with me and other patients during my chemotherapy treatments.  I have made many friends in the same situation as myself thanks to Breast Friends, and knowing there are people who truly understand and want to support you such as Breast Friends, is invaluable when in the battle and beyond.  I absolutely reccommend newly diagnosed and survivors alike to call and connect with them.
Breast Friends	58517		/users/profile/62365	dtjennings	General Member of the Public	5	12/06/2010	When I was first diagnosed with Breast Cancer,  I remembered Breast Friends. I went into their office for guidance and support. I received both. I was welcomed with open arms and both Sharon and Becky shared their stories. Their strength helped me feel a bit more at ease. They are wonderful people and I was lucky to have them on my side.  It is a wonderful organization that more people need to know about. Denise Jennings

Breast Friends is the solution.  They teach friends and loved ones how to be a FRIEND when someone you love is daignosed with cancer.  Without Breast Friends, so many of us would be lost.

They offer support, friendship, resources, and hope to women everywhere.   Breast Friends works directly with patients within two of our clinics at Northwest Cancer Specialists.   We provide their resources to our patients.  Becky is a phenomenal speaker and is quite inspirational to women all over the United States.  Breast Friends and Northwest Cancer Specialists work collaboratively together to enrich the lives of women everywhere.

Breast Friends	58512		/users/profile/62346	Corie B.	Volunteer	5	12/06/2010	I volunteered for Breast Friends for a year and grew to appreciate what they do more every day.  My Step-mom and well a my mom both passed away because of cance, so I have ties to cancer in that regard.  So watching their hearts is action was truely touching for me.  Becky and Sharon have a heart the size of Texas when it comes to supporting women with cancer.  If there arms were big enough, they would encompass them all at once, but until then they will continue to do it one woman at a time.

Eves Daughters	113282	1	/users/profile/154159	machele	Client Served	5	05/30/2012	I was introduced to Eve's Daughters through our church.  I had gone through a divorce and felt very alone with little support in the area.  Eve's Daughters was a place that I could go and not feel like I was going through the journey on my own and could develop a support system with other women going through a similar experience.  Although, I started out as a mom attending the monthly dinners and various parenting workshops; I ended up volunteering as well.  I wanted to give back in some way.  I also volunteer at the annual art fundraiser.  It feels so good to help other women going through the tough and challenging transition of divorce and solo parenting. Eve's Daughters is a blessing, and a much needed support system for single moms!
Eves Daughters	113279	2	/users/profile/154156	bradll9	Volunteer	5	05/30/2012	Eve's Daughters is an organization that helps single moms get back on their feet with community, seminars, financial help, and so much more.  We are volunteers who make a meal one night a month about four times a year.  It is a privilege and a blessing to us to be able to make a meal so these moms can come together and share with one another and to spur one another on.  The children also get to interact and make crafts and share with one another.  Sharing stories and knowing that one is not alone on this tough journey is refreshing and encouraging and gives one energy to keep going even when life is really hard.  We are also donors and we appreciate that Eve's Daughters works hard to use money wisely and efficiently to help mom's in crisis get through and feel like someone cares and they can make it.  This is a tough journey to make and Eve's Daughters helps ease the burden in real and practical ways that changes lives.  We are honored to be part of this organization and be able to support through volunteering and financial means.  
Eves Daughters	112886	1	/users/profile/153644	Mazz5557	Client Served	4	05/24/2012	I am a single Mom with two children at home.  Raising children and keeping a house together on my own has been difficult, lonely and challenging at times.  Eve's Daughters has been a ray of sunshine, giving encouragement, advice, connection to resources and hope.  They have blessed my family several times during the Christmas season with gift cards.  I would not have been able to do anything for the holiday without this.  Recently, as I am waiting for my child support to begin again, I was given a financial gift to help with my rent.  Eve's Daughters is comprised of leaders that have been in my shoes and experienced the things and feelings that I am.  It is a powerful thing to see that it can be done, single, and it can be done well.

Its not only been a great place to meet other moms, but its also allowed me to have a network when I needed help with a situation. I personally would recommend it to other single moms, of all ages.

I have had regular meetings with Karen Sjoblom, who has been an incredible mentor and friend. They offer financial and legal help, as well as clothing, food and invaluable support in often tough situations. I recommend Eve's Daughters to any other moms I run into, and attend their dinners as much as I can. They're amazing and have far exceeded any expectations I could have had :)

They are dedicated, experienced single moms who understand what it's all about.  They have raised great children and are trying to help make the journey a bit easier for other single moms .  Supporting Eve's Daughters is a way to help single moms when you don't know how else to help those women in your circle.  Please join me in helping them help others.
Eves Daughters	112488		/users/profile/153101	domino	Donor	5	05/20/2012	I have donated to Eve's Daughters from the start and continue to contribute to this wonderful organization.  They support single moms and their families emotionally and financially, on a continual basis and/or giving them that one-time "boost" to get over the hurdle to keep going.  They have fought to get a breast exam for a mom with a family history of breast cancer who couldn't afford it and could not get other breast cancer charities to help her. They helped with a car repair for a stranded mom.  They offer emotional support and respite in the form of monthly get-togethers.  I am also impressed that moms who have been helped by Eve's Daughters have returned to help other moms.  
Eves Daughters	112048		/users/profile/152467	Terbo	General Member of the Public	5	05/14/2012	I lead a single parent ministry nearby, and am frequently referring our female participants to also become active in Eve's Daughters.  The leader, Karen, is a wealth of resource for aiding and encouraging single moms. Those in our ministry who attend their events receive helpful education and are uplifted by being involved. Key concepts learned at Eve's Daughters filter into our group meetings, and thereby help a wider span of single parents in the overall community.  Karen also spoke at our group last year and it was so inspiring!  This organization genuinely cares for single moms and tends to their real and felt needs on consistent basis.  Eve's Daughters fills a gap for a great need in our community!  I am convinced that entire families benefit from the care single moms receive here.  I will continue to refer single moms with confidence!

It was a hard transition for me, especially being from India and the cultural implications. I had a 2 year old to consider, had just landed a job but in a very tough economic climate. I attended several of Eve's daughter's dinners sometimes simply to socialize with other women like me. They also helped me find a roommate and provided a lifeline at one of the most difficult transitions in my life. Kudos to all the volunteers and staff - they deserve an award for their kindness and dedication.

Eve's Daughters is "Life-changing" for single mom's. I was told about this organization from a friend and I have been singing Eve's Daughters priases to other people, including my church's pastors.

We started with an idea in 2006 and currently serve nearly 250 women. Our hope is to continue to extend our reach to other geographic areas as it seems ours is a unique and appreciated approach to developing community and providing support to single moms and their kids. We've got much work to do, but are thankful to be on our way.
Eves Daughters	111796	1	/users/profile/152200	Amber N.	Volunteer	5	05/11/2012	Eve's Daughters provides a solid foundation for women who need help after divorce or domestic violence.  The women who founded and run Eve's Daughters have been through tough situations themselves and through smart work and determination have succeeded in moving forward in their lives.  They want to pass along all the knowledge and information they have gained so other women can move forward and navigate the diffulties of life after experiencing trouble or trauma.  Eve's Daughters is a pillar of the community because as an organization it takes nothing and gives back everything these women need, with love, kindness, respect, dignity, and care.  Eve's Daughters helps make women whole again by providing the resources and connections women need.  
Eves Daughters	111779		/users/profile/152181	girltimes4	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/11/2012	Eve's Daughters (ED) is an amazing organization that helps so many single moms!  I was fortunate to learn of it when it was first launching and have watched it expand and touch many women in need.  I have attended events and recommended it to others.  ED hosts monthly dinners with activities and/or education opportunities for moms, and often for the kids too.  It's a great way to have a night off from cooking and get social time with women in similar situations.  Loneliness and lack of support/community are common struggles for any single parent.  I think ED does a great job of addressing those needs, in addition to networking single moms for basic needs like housing, furniture, appliances, etc.  They also connect with single moms online through Facebook and blogging.  I'm not aware of any other organization in the Portland area that specifically supports single moms in the practical and caring ways that Eve's Daughters does.  My only feedback is that I hope word spreads about this organization so that many more women will benefit from it!
Eves Daughters	111687	1	/users/profile/152074	HelenHarder	Volunteer	5	05/10/2012	I interact with Eve's Daughters every month and I have for the past year. My main interactions involve doing crafts with a group of kids while their mom's chat with other mom's over dinner. As a high school student, sometimes the last thing I want to do is volunteer to watch a group of kids in my spare time. But the thing about Eve's Daughters is that the second I get to the meetings, I can feel the support and the good work being done there. While I only play a small role in this by watching the children while the mother's get to talk with each other, I always leave feeling blessed that I got to help them in some way. And the kids are pretty great too. Throughout high school I have participated in a variety of volunteer situations, but I must say Eve's Daughters is something special. The work they are doing is not only good for the moms involved, but the kids are given a creative and social outlet as well. Overall, I only observe a small portion of the good that Eve's Daughters does in my community. These ladies are wonderful and deserve recognition for the time effort that they put in to supporting mothers in need.
Eves Daughters	111684		/users/profile/152068	Tamara V.	Client Served	5	05/10/2012	There is no other group or resource like this for single women in the area or perhaps even our state. I came across it one evening by myself as I was searching for single mom resources on the internet. I was searching desperately for something, but I was also very wary of being scammed. I felt like I was trying my best at being a single mom, but it wasn't enough and I just felt like something had to give. At the time I didn't know a single other single-mom. But I came across the Eve's Daughters MeetUp link. And as I read the description I knew that was just what I needed: A place to meet others going through the same things. No cost involved, childcare provided, no need to bring anything- just show up. And I was pleased it happens to be only 15 min away for me. (Although recently we have had women drive out here from Washington to attend.) Eve's Daughters is a wonderful organization. I have been attending their monthly dinners for the past year and a half. It is a very welcoming place. I have made many new friendships, and there is an instant connection since we are all in similiar places in life (being single moms). We all have different experiences and backgrounds, but being a single mom can be very lonely at times, and at times it can seem like we are the only single mom out there. But having a chance to interact with other single moms is a real blessing! I also really appreciate all the volunteers who take the time to make us dinner each month. And my son really enjoys coming too. The kids do crafts/watch a movie in another room which is fun for them, and gives the moms time for more grown-up talk for once which is fun for us. Eve's Daughters has been such an important part of my life since  I began coming and I look forward to it every month.
Eves Daughters	111680	1	/users/profile/152065	Nest	Volunteer	5	05/10/2012	So many of my friends are in the category of those that this nonprofit serves: single moms. Since I've heard and witnessed so many of the stories that my friends have shared, I wanted to be involved to offer encouragement to women in similar circumstances. When contacting the directors of Eve's Daughters (ED), about how to plug in and be of assistance, I received very quick and clear responses. Once the ball started rolling as a volunteer, I was pleased to discover how quickly and graciously the inevitable questions that I had were answered. Appreciation is readily offered, as well.  This has motivated me to involve more of my friends in supporting and volunteering to assist ED. They have been as impressed and delighted, as I have been.

I've had the privilege to work closely with one of the co-founders and leaders of the ministry and I have constantly been impressed with her integrity, generosity, commitment and heart which she invests in this ministry.  It has been a life line to many divorced women and as a result it also greatly impacts and  benefit their children.  It's a great ministry with excellent leadership, vision and passion. I highly recommend and endorse it.

Eves daughters has allowed me to meet other ladies like myself, who understand what it is that I am going through.  It is such a great feeling to be in a room filled with people that don't judge you. They also helped me to get a bag of clothes for my newborn son.  If I were to give any feedback it would be to have each women introduce themselves at the dinners and tell the group a little about themselves.
Eves Daughters	111650		/users/profile/152028	Mollie L.	Donor	5	05/09/2012	Most people are familiar with the story of the Good Samaritan. A unexpected stranger who helped a person in a time of great need. No judgement, expectation or formula. Just kindness extended at the right time. Eve's Daughters does this and more. I've seen them encourage and equip others to get a new perspective as they work together to change what they can about their circumstance. I've witnessed grateful hearts who get to heal and breathe and refill with hope, "it's going to be ok, I'm not alone." Eve's Daughters create a community which nourishes and supports. It is that phone a friend life line. Eves Daughters gives an understanding shoulder and a hand up, not a hand out. I am so happy to support the efforts of the hard working women at Eve's Daughters. After all, we are all connected. Eves Daughters is a place to connect when single moms need it most. In my book, theyre not just good, but Super Samaritans.

Skipping Stones	300746		/users/profile/391638	Writer	Volunteer	5	08/17/2016	I began interning with Skipping Stones this summer and I have really enjoyed being able to read and learn from the variety of submissions we receive from all around the world. The multicultural magazine provides a platform for young adults to express themselves through art and literature and I am constantly shocked by the level of intelligence these young artists and writers possess.  The best part about being able to read through all the submissions is that they are always unique and vary in length and content. Each individual entry is personal and insightful, while at the same time relatable. Topics include stories and poems about racism, friendship, family, traveling, history, nature and many more. Skipping Stones teaches you to be open minded and to embrace people from all walks of life, while simultaneously inspiring and educating you.
Skipping Stones	187158		/users/profile/244156	emilycarpenter	Volunteer	5	10/31/2013	One of the beautiful things about literature is its ability to create mutual understanding. We can talk all day without really considering or sharing a new perspective. But through an engaging medium, one that captures us with the magic to see alternate worlds, we can truly come to understand our brothers and sisters, no matter how distant physically or culturally. Skipping Stones is this medium, providing youth with stories to learn from and a voice to tell. 
Skipping Stones	187148		/users/profile/244145	maggiepeake	Volunteer	5	10/31/2013	I began interning at Skipping Stones as a writer with a limited knowledge of international cultures and conflicts outside of the U.S.A. After months of volunteering, I was introduced to countless facts and traditions I had never even heard about by children as young as six years-old. But it goes deeper than culture, straight down to the writer personally where original ideas and personal experiences open readers' eyes to new perspectives and broaden their conception of the world. This magazine is education that you can't always find in school because it is from youth with significant messages that live lives completely different from our own. This magazine is important, and it is valuable, and I couldn't be happier to be a part of it.
Skipping Stones	186133		/users/profile/243113	hnannerz	Volunteer	5	10/30/2013	Skipping stones is an excellent non-profit multicultural children's magazine. It accepts and publishes submissions from children all over the world on a variety of multicultural topics. In particular, Skipping Stones seeks art, poetry, and essays pertaining to issues of global, cultural, or ethical importance. Not only does the magazine encourage young authors to write, it encourages them to express themselves about what makes them unique, and to share their experiences with a wold-wide audience. It also inspires me, as an intern, to work harder and do better, to use my skills in the most productive way. It brings culture and global literature together, in a place where children of all ages have access.  As I continue to volunteer at Skipping Stones, I find myself realizing the dedication it takes to run such a non-profit organization.   I enjoy helping out at Skipping Stones because it gives me a sense of purpose, a sense that I am creating something that will enrich the lives of children everywhere.
Skipping Stones	183980		/users/profile/240901	mullinsjulian	Volunteer	5	10/29/2013	Skipping Stones is an incredible magazine, one that promotes valuable and important messages about our global citizenry, culture, environment, health and more. One of the most deeply meaningful magazines I have ever read, Skipping Stones manages to share the stories, opinions, and experiences of writers, young and old, from all over the world. It is truly an honor to intern here; I enjoy every minute and I am rewarded by knowing that I am making a difference in the world through each and every issue that I work on.
Skipping Stones	183724		/users/profile/240635	bhaskar.mandavilli	General Member of the Public	5	10/28/2013	This is a multi cultural children's magazine where we learn about lots of different cultures and individual writings and kids art. We always look forward for the new issue to learn and see the creativity of the children which is always diverse in nature. It always gives children a positive experience. The Editor, Mr. Arun is a very dedicated person with lots of vision and devotion in giving & providing kids a great platform for their writings, poems and art.

Their dedication to children and desire to foster understanding of cultures is not only admirable but an important world cause.This magazine offers children from around the  world a way of expressing themselves. During my time at Skipping Stones, I read so many inspirational stories.

Skipping Stones	112677		/users/profile/153362	Vanamali C.	Volunteer	5	05/22/2012	I have volunteered for Skipping Stones as an IT Consultant for over ten years.  I am inspired to do this, because I feel Skipping Stones is a very positive experience for children, both those who have their creative work published, and for those who read and share in other children's perspectives through the magazine.  It gives children a voice and encourages and nurtures their positive energy and idealism.  It is for this reason that I have wholeheartedly contributed my time and energy to Skipping Stones.
Skipping Stones	112005		/users/profile/152412	Paula15	Volunteer	5	05/14/2012	I have been a volunteer illustrator at Skipping Stones for around 7 years, and really love my involvement. Arun, the editor, has a wonderful vision for the magazine, and is wholeheartedly devoted to giving kids around the world a platform for their poems and stories. I remember when I was a child, getting to have one of my poems and one of my drawings in a magazine. It was exciting, and powerfully empowering, to say the least. To think of all the kids who enjoy both reading and writing for Skipping Stones warms my heart with gratitude for all of Arun's hard work as editor. 
Skipping Stones	109320		/users/profile/148921	Ranjana P.	General Member of the Public	5	04/09/2012	Skipping Stones is a refreshingly earnest and content-heavy magazine with a clear and strong mission- to encourage creativity and communication among today's youth in order to celebrate diversity. I read and contributed in high school and now, 16 years later, I hope my son will be able to read and contribute to it as well. The caliber of the writing and art submissions is inspiring and humbling, especially since most of the contributors are children. It is a great platform for allowing youth to voice their opinions and share their creativity with each other and the world.
Skipping Stones	109197		/users/profile/148726	yoshu	Board Member	5	04/06/2012	I'm a board member and volunteer. I support Skipping Stones because it connects young people from many cultures and lets them exchange ideas, stories, and traditions. In our hyperactive and attention-deficit world, Skipping Stones comes along at a meditative pace and provides a quiet, reflective space that encourages creativity and self-expression.  Our founder and publisher of 23 years, Arun Toke, excels at the difficult task of promoting a tolerant exchange of ideas while at the same time standing tall for core values such as global peace, respect for all cultures, and a deep commitment to protecting the sanctity of the natural environment and all forms of life.
Skipping Stones	109138		/users/profile/148628	Suzanne16	General Member of the Public	5	04/05/2012	As a mother and educator, I find Skipping Stones to be an invaluable resource for cross cultural learning. I live in Japan, and my children are bicultural (Japanese and American). My daughter has mulitple disabilities. Reading about similar children helps to build their self-esteem. My children have also expanded their world view through reading stories by others around the world. They have also been motivated to write and share their stories and artwork. We love Skipping Stones and look forward to every issue.
Skipping Stones	109131		/users/profile/148616	rbkeis	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/05/2012	I have been involved with Skipping Stones for over twenty years. I have served as a board member, classroom teacher whose students submitted their writing and artwork, and as a contributor myself. In those twenty years, I have seen Skipping Stones evolve and mature into an international forum for young people and adults to share their cultures and dreams for a better world. What greatly impresses me about Skipping Stones is it ability to consistently produce a very high quality magazine on a shoestring budget. It has managed to retain its integrity and original mission without having succumb to pressures to commercialize or lower their standard. I have seen the joy on children's faces when their piece is published, and experienced that joy myself when I have been published in the magazine. It validates culture, it validates individuals, and it celebrates diversity at the same time. I have just distributed copies of the Jan, - Feb. 2012 issue to children here in Mexico, where I currently reside, who had their photos on the cover. One such child was from Ayotzinapan, a tiny Nahuatl village in the Sierra Norte of Puebla. She never dreamed of being in a magazine, and now wants to contribute some of her writing. So do her friends. Skipping Stones makes a difference in the lives of young people and provides a forum for them to share, not through cyberspace, but through the printed word, on paper, that you can hold in your hands. It does a formidable job as a small press making a big difference.
Skipping Stones	109070		/users/profile/148410	Stephen8	Board Member	5	04/05/2012	I first met Skipping Stones publisher Arun Toke in 1986.  I was an out-going board member of another non-profit organization, and editor/business manager of its house publications; Arun was my incoming replacement.  One thing I learned about Arun early is that he is a man of profound belief/faith, is consistent in it, and walks in integrity to a degree unusual among men.  Not long after, he founded Skipping Stones, and I've had the honor of serving on its board most of the years since.  Whereas my own (commercial) publication operated under the usual financial terms -- debt to finance start-up, early operations, cash flow, and growth -- Arun has always run Skipping Stones in the black.  He's done so by keeping all costs  (including his own income) to a bare minimum, helped in part by a steady stream of volunteers and interns who gladly give of their time and talents for Arun and the mission of Skipping Stones.  Not one penny is wasted, nor is a single sheet of paper.  Arun has also been diligent about applying for -- and receiving -- grants; I do't have the list, but many important organizations and foundations have seen value in supporting Skipping Stones over the years.   Board discussions periodically return to questions of sustainability and growth -- how to pursue it, and how to pay for the pursuit.  I cannot shake the idea that if Skipping Stones had more support (capital), it could give wings to its vision in a much broader way with much more impact on the world.  Most mass marketing campaigns, however, often involve some kind of dumbing-down of the product, some compromise of the mission, some appeal to commercial methods and interests, all of which Skipping Stones has been committed not to do.  So it continues on, with a very committed, strongly supportive niche audience.  I wholeheartedly support the mission and organization and its leader.  Any donations (or purchases of subscriptions) are very frugally spent, every penny wrung out to effect the greatest good possible.  That great good is a very great good among those it reaches.
Skipping Stones	108987		/users/profile/148317	Julian M.	Volunteer	5	04/04/2012	Skipping Stones Magazine is an outstanding organization that helped me learn much more about the world, my writing, the importance of hearing other voices, and the importance of sharing my own as well. I distinctly remember the happiness and pride that I experienced when my writing was included in the magazine, making me a published author at last! That moment spawned a new passion for writing, and soon I became a frequent contributor to the magazine. It wasn't until I started interning at Skipping Stones though, that I gained a profound sense of myself, and the world around me. My work as an intern included reviewing submissions from young authors all around the world. Not only did this enhance my own writing and critique skills, but I also learned a tremendous amount about other cultures and ways of life. This developed a new sense of connection and love for the world, and all the people in it. Skipping Stones Magazine opened my eyes to the world, and helped me gain new levels of experience and passion for writing. And for that alone, I am ever grateful.
Skipping Stones	108921		/users/profile/148226	Katie32	Volunteer	5	04/04/2012	I love Skipping Stones! I've been a student intern for almost a year and have learned an incredible amount about the day-to-day operations of nonprofits and tangible ways to create positive social change. Even more personally, I've learned how to effectively edit the work of others to increase clarity while retaining a certain unique voice; my own writing has also improved through learning how to make sentences more concise. Skipping Stones' greatest selling point is that it offers youth of all backgrounds a chance to have their story heard. Rather than publishing accounts of one particular group's experience and traditions, diversity is celebrated, flaws and all. Fostering a love of learning and a sense of responsibility for society at large is also important, and the magazine's themes are almost always positive and optimistic as well as timely. For example, recent issues have covered different accounts of bullying and how the situations were ultimately overcome; growing up with gay parents; growing up adopted; and ways to promote sustainability, such as through plastic bag collection. Bilingual pieces, folktales and cultural celebrations are published in every issue, encouraging readers to become one with the entire world. I greatly admire what Skipping Stones has accomplished.
Skipping Stones	108877		/users/profile/148176	Ron Marson	Board Member	5	04/03/2012	I have served on the board of Skipping Stones ever since it published its first magazine almost 25 years ago. I have contributed to this non-profit from both my personal funds and through my business, TOPS Learning Systems, because I so believe in its cause  bringing children and young adults together across all cultures to foster international understanding, green living and world peace. The only way for our next generation to really understand each other is to EXPERIENCE each other through opinion, art, poetry, and stories. Skipping Stones is like a mini foreign exchange program where students meet face-to-face within the pages of the magazine. Arun, the editor of Skipping Stones has been doing real good in the world with very limited resources. Contributing to Skipping Stones is an excellent way to guarantee that your generosity will really count for something.  --Ron Marson 
Skipping Stones	108870		/users/profile/148169	Charlotter09	Volunteer	5	04/03/2012	Even thought I have only recently joined Skipping Stones, I have already learned and contributed a great deal to the magazine.  I was quickly introduced to all aspects of making an issue, from reading submissions sent by aspiring writers from around the world to formatting and proofing articles.  My favorite assignment was being asked to write an article of my own.  Once I got a feel for the multicultural and ecologically aware stories that characterize Skipping Stones, I wrote an article about the wildlife of the Sonoran Desert, where I grew up.  I loved having the opportunity to teach about the desert as part of Skipping Stone's focus on nature conservation and getting to share my hometown with readers.  I was so happy to have my article featured in the magazine and I was very excited when a picture of the Sonoran Desert made the front cover!  With all of this happening in my first few months, I am looking forward to see what other contributions I will be able to make.  As I continue, I'm also excited to keep reading the wonderful pieces sent in from youth of all ages. I love seeing the talent and creativity that pours into Skipping Stones and I am grateful to be a part of it.
Skipping Stones	108833		/users/profile/148120	amyminato	Professional with expertise in this field	4	04/03/2012	I helped launch Skipping Stones and have continued to be impressed with its heart and sincerity. Folks involved now work harder than ever to showcase children's stories from around the world. The quality of art and writing continue to impress me, and the general message is always compassionate and real.
Skipping Stones	108777		/users/profile/148056	sfillinger1	Volunteer	5	04/02/2012	Skipping Stones Magazine is in its 24th year of educating youth on global issues, publishing young writers and artists, and encouraging literacy and arts both in the US and abroad. This multicultural, ad-free, ecologically-friendly childrens magazine allows young people to celebrate their differences, learn about relevant global issues, and voice their opinions in an eloquent and creative manner. The magazines success in fostering a love for the arts and humanities in children of all ages has been recognized by many organizations; Skipping Stones has twice been given the NAME Award of the National Association for Multicultural Education, and many other honors over the years. As a high school intern working at Skipping Stones, I am continually awed by the impact I have witnessed this special magazine have on young lives; I have read submissions from immigrant children, children that have lost parents, teenagers living on their own, and even youth prisoners, and I am so grateful that they have this opportunity to see their creative work publishedalways in the original language with English translation on the same page. Children that often do not have a voice in their day-to-day life get to share their stories and speak out for what they believe. Working at Skipping Stones has given me the chance to offer my opinions to other conscientious readers of the magazine, grow as a writer, and learn about running a non-profit organization. Because of my time at Skipping Stones, I had the honor of speaking at an interfaith 9-11 memorial service as a youth representative. Arun Tok has served as a mentor to me, constantly impressing me with the gentle way that he touches peoples lives and changes the world from the ground up. He is an exceptional and dedicated man, an active peace and youth advocate in our community, and the driving force of this non-profit magazine since 1988. The simplicity and awareness with which Arun Tok lives and runs Skipping Stones is very much in keeping with the magazines goals of communication, cooperation and creativity. Thanks to the dedication, imagination and innovation of all who work at Skipping Stones, this unique magazine is helping youth worldwide grow into globally conscious, active citizens dedicated to the arts and humanities.

Fallen Warriors Foundation	34361	7	/users/profile/35189	viento	General Member of the Public	5	03/31/2010	I would personally like to thank the Fallen Warriors Foundation for the incredibly emotional and healing effects I experienced at their annual retreat.  I did two tours in Viet Nam, the last as a crewman on a Marine CH-46 helicopter in I Corps.  I had carried the guilt and shame for 40 years and in a 4 day week-end an emotional log jam was broken and I had a new perspective. I  regained some of my self respect and could understand better why I felt the way I did about myself.  Claude AnShin Thomas, Jack Esteys, Colleen O'Callaghan and the 25 or so Vets and supporters changed my life and I can't thank them enough.  The first thing I noticed when I entered the hall of meditation was a table filled with kleenex and note pads and I used a lot of both in my stay.  For the first time in my life I broke down and bawled like a baby and then was encouraged to explore why I felt the way I did.        It gave me new courage but not enough to return and finish what I need to do.  I have never been through such an emotionally stressed experience in my life and it has scared me.  I need to know that I can go back and face it again because it is the only healing I've known.       I can't say enough about the Fallen Warriors Foundation and the work they do.
Fallen Warriors Foundation	34316	4	/users/profile/35140	justjane	Client Served	5	03/31/2010	As the wife of a Viet Nam vet, I began to accompany my husband on the annual Fallen Warrior Foundation retreats in 1999 after he had hit the wall struggling to manage his PTSD.  He had reached the point of feeling that there were few, if any, options left.  After our first experience it became immediately apparent that what we learned was going to be highly beneficial to him, to our family, our marriage, and to me. I have attended 8 of the past 11 retreats.  Three with my husband and five after his death several years ago.  I return year after year because I, as a "veteran wife," feel the need to support and be supported by a wonderful group of caring and compassionate people. In an era when everything seems to be on double fast forward, it is remarkable how beneficial it is to receive instruction on how to slow down, shut up, sit quietly, breathe...how to create a different relationship with our thoughts and that which sends us spinning.My being a part of this particular veteran community is a privledge.  I am honored by the legacy that my husband left to me.

The work that Jack, Colleen and Claude have undertaken through the Fallen Warriors Foundation and through their annual retreats is simultaneously inspiring and down-to-earth.  This is a strong organization with dedication, honor, and a deeply humanitarian mission.
Fallen Warriors Foundation	34238	9	/users/profile/35040	ww2vetdaughter	General Member of the Public	5	03/30/2010	A few years ago I was invited to attend a Fallen Warriors Veterans' retreat by my friend, Colleen, who with her husband, Jack, conceived and organized the retreat every year on or close to Veterans' Day.  I had heard over the years about the struggle of the advertising, mailings, contacts, finding a venue with lodging and kitchen, finding cooks to prepare healthy and satisfying food for the group over several days, hosting the retreat leader and his companion and assistant (which they both looked forward to), and generally making sure that attendees had a seamless and meaningful experience.  They made sure no one who wanted to attend was denied for lack of funds, and would seek a benefactor or personally pay expenses if necessary.  Their commitment to their vision of teaching life and coping skills, stress reduction and positive means of living with fear, guilt and pain induced by war is genuine and tireless.They could not have found a more skilled, insightful and appropriate teacher to lead the retreats.  He is a Viet Nam vet who has become a Buddhist Monk.  He shares the devastating effects of war but is well trained to teach the skills of living a meaningful life by  accepting rather than repressing, rejecting or being shamed by painful war experiences through different forms of meditation, writing and sharing in an environment of silence and contemplation.  He is articulate, sharp and compassionate, earning the respect and love of diverse groups no matter how extreme or complex the presented struggles of a particular group may be.Although I felt at first a little out of place, not being personally involved with the Viet Nam war, I soon learned that as a daughter of a WWII vet, PTSD had been a huge part of my growing up.  As I learned the symptoms of the condition, I realized that my family had been living with them from day one.  Many of my fathers behaviors, which I had so negatively judged, were most likely the effects of his combat experience for which we had no emotional context.  That generation could not express pain or accept help, and most never knew their anxieties, restlessness and destructive behaviors were not just "who they were".  I watched my father regularly explode, avoid intimacy and search for connection in all the wrong places.  My association with Jack and Colleen, then Fallen Warriors, taught me that I could love my father without shame.  That is a life changing event for which I will forever by thankful.
Fallen Warriors Foundation	34188	6	/users/profile/35004	phlegmasia1	Board Member	4	03/30/2010	In the summer of 1997,Jack Estes gave me a call and asked me to go to Vietnam with the Fallen Warriors[Foundation] and Northwest Medical Teams[now Medical Teams International] on a medical mission.We spent two weeks in Danang and Tam Ky Provinces , with 2 days spent in Hue. From that extradorinary and multifaceted experience of witnessing former soldiers waging peace,came  a renewed appreciation of the sacrifices of all Veterans and committment to honor those who have served.The Vietnam war was a searing experience for this country and left scars on the entire body politic of the USA.  Attending a Fallen Warriors Retreat with veterans and their families under the guidance of a soldier turned Buddhist monk where quiet and solitude impel the sharing of often terrible memories is often the first step in healing.This Experience was cathartic and healing for me too.  In 2000 I worked with the Fallen Warriors Foundation to help fund a project to bring clean water to the people of Nui Than.With the help of East Meets West Foundation a deep well , equipped with 1.5hp pump that pulls water into a 12 meter high concrete tower where the water is aerated,filtered and gravity fed to 500 homes was built.The villagers dug trenches,laid pipe,and back filled the trenches.Water meters were installed to reduce waste and charge the villagers a small fee for maintaining the system.A plaque commemorating the installation reads:Waters of Reconcilliation.  This is just some of what Fallen Warriors has done to honor our Veterans and heal the wounds of war.

Not only have the retreats been very beneficial toward my own personal military experiences and their manifestation in my life today, my family and friends have benefited as well. Because Fallen Warriors have taken the risk of securing a retreat site without a financial commitment from the Veterans attending, I was able to benefit. I see how difficult it is to host the retreat when there are so many Veterans and their friends and families deciding to attend at the last minute. In addition, I received financial assistance for a partial scholarship to attend the retreat.

The Fallen Warriors Retreat I attended was a benefit to me in many ways. As a combat veteran of Vietnam era, I was highly motivated in seeking help to understand what I had experienced in combat. I can't say it was a particular therapy or the leader that gave me a sense of safety, but a sharing of experiences with other veterans and learning to listen to them, changed me. I would give Fallen Warriors Foundation a 5 of 5 stars on any chart. I would attend again.    I'm impressed enough with what the Fallen Warriors Foundation has done for veterans, that we started, (Jan 2010), a version of the Fallen Warriors Retreats here in Gilpin County Colorado. So yes, what Colleen O'Callaghan and Jack Estes have put together is of value and would be a big hole for many veterans if it were not available.Sincerely,Deni DarbyGilpin County Veterans Service Officer2960 Dory Hill Rd.

I attended a Fallen Warriors retreat and the work we did, writing, meditating, talking in groups about our experiences, all were a tremendous help to me. They emphasized no particular religion, but there was a Buddhist monk there who'd been a Vietnam veteran. Being able to ask him questions, how he dealt with the really big issues (like killing people), was exceedingly helpful. I came away not cured of PTSD, but confident that I could be, and having a group of people that I could stay in contact with. Very helpful to me.

Approximately 12 years ago I served for about 2 years as a volunteer with the Foundation's board of directors and assisted in various outreach projects to vets in the Portland metro area.

Meditation is a healthy and positive response to the symptoms of PTSD. Anything I can do to avoid medication is wanted and needed. Fallen Warriors have done a great job in caring for vets with PTSD! I rate then FIVE STARS PLUS!!!  THANKS, TOM NORTON

I attended their annual weekend retreat a few years ago which I found extremely healing by being in contact with other Veterans who also suffer from PTSD. The couple who have organized this effort are unbelievably dedicated and selfless. I believe that they should be supported in any way possible and strive to do that myself.
Fallen Warriors Foundation	32835	1	/users/profile/33666	lisa12	General Member of the Public	5	03/09/2010	I have observed first-hand the strong commitment that the Fallen Warriors Foundation has toward helping our Veterans and their loved ones over many years.  The work that they do has helped many people deal with the trauma that war can cause to an individual, as well as the family, upon returning home. They provide a great service to both our Veterans, and our country.
Manley Foundation	126968	1	/users/profile/172000	phyllisherinckx,	Volunteer	5	10/18/2012	Manley foundation has helped us the past few years in scholarshipping individuals with disabilities. They get riding lessons at reduced rates or at no cost. We serve children, adults and  veterans with social, pychological and physical disabilities. Organzations like Manley help fill in the gaps in our endeaver to fundraise for our clients so they can become the "best they can be". "There is something about a horse that is good for the inside of a man" is well said by Winston Churchill.  One of our clients who is scholarshipped is a boy named Issac. He has  cerebral palsy and other developmental disabilities. When he came here at 4 years of age, he could not sit up or walk. His grandparents bring him here every other week for a riding lesson. They come from Silverton, Oregon, at least one hours drive. Soon after starting his lessons, he began to sit up on his own.  As time went on he was able to walk with assistance. At age eight, he began to walk. Doctors never thought he would walk. He was not in any other therapies other than horseback riding.  Small miracles to big miracles, Manley can take some of the credit for making it happen.

Manley Foundation	165424	1	/users/profile/219885	SJHart	Board Member	5	08/19/2013	It has been a privilege and honor to work with the board and officers of Manley Foundation for many years. The high level of integrity as well as the genuine concern for the needs of others in often devastating circumstances far exceeds a merely corporate approach to charitable giving. Each request is carefully considered and reviewed to maximize the impact of the grants, and the rewards of seeing what even small contributions can make to a deserving organization are immeasurable.

I have the good fortunate of serving alongside an all volunteer Board of Directors who shares a passion for assisting small, often overlooked organizations.  Despite being very small, weve succeeded in helping people on local, national, and international levels since our inception in 1989.  Together, we continue our work to make a positive difference in the world around us, and to reach as many people as possible.  We remain exceptional stewards of our donors funds, keep our overhead low, and ensure that funding reaches those in need.  I look forward to serving Manley Foundation in its mission to reach those most in need for many years to come, and extend my heartfelt thanks to those who make our work possible.

The goal of Manley is to affect lives and organizations that will use financial resources for the direct benefit of the situation in need.  I have personally met with, and been associated with, past and current board members as well as Manley's current President and I can say, without any doubt, their ethics and their passion are exemplary.

We are proud members of OGA, not just because of the strong coaching that our children receive, but because we believe so strongly in it's mission.  We are proud of OGA's focus on serving the community through the All Star program that provides an option for children with special needs.  We have thoroughly enjoyed helping when our gym hosts the Special Olympics gymnastics competition.  We support the Character Counts program that is not just an annual event but a year-round focus.  There is a focus on the team on being a team and supporting one another, not on only achieving individual athletic goals.  We are confident that our children are becoming better athletes and better people because they are at OGA.

My kid loves to play with her in that environment.  We are already planning to add another session to her weekly schedule, as we love the experience. There is also the flexibility to attend on different days due to sickness which is very helpful. We have very thoughtful people at OGA who even provided us the option to get benefits when we originally (was a misunderstanding)thought the fees was higher (we misunderstood the fees). There is plenty of space to watch the activities and lots and lots of equipments for the kid to play around. We always get good alternate options when we want to come on an alternate day. Katie is thoughtful on what kind of time/day will be better suited for our kid, and not just any other available time/day, which means a lot.

Oregon Gymnastics Academy	64566		/users/profile/70601	GymMom	Client Served	4	02/08/2011	My son, 12 yrs.old , has been competing with the Boys' Team at Oregon Gymnastics Academy since 2006, and my daughter, 10 yrs. old, competed with the OGA Rhythmic Gymnastics Team from 2007-2010.  Both of my children began taking recreational classes at OGA at a very young age, and their experience piqued their interest and helped to instill enough confidence in them, that they decided to pursue competitive gymnastics.  The gym has definitely experienced "growing pains" over the course of our tenure as member clients, as the gym went through an extensive expansion, has had several changes of management, and the competitive teams we have been involved with have increased in size dramatically, but the organization's priorities have always been to offer children a safe environment in which to explore their abilities, and to test and hone their strengths and character.  This facility has, in many ways, become our second home.  On an even more personal note, our son was diagnosed with a form of high-functioning autism during his first year on the Boys' Competitive Team when he was 7 years old.  Many of the coaches at OGA have since been very encouraging and willing to learn more about how they can best communicate with our son and help him achieve his potential.  Most importantly, they have never treated him as "disabled," but rather they have facilitated his ability to rise to the occasion of every challenge he faces.  Gymnastics has made an enormous impact on the lives of our family members, and OGA has helped to pave a path toward many future successes for both of our children.

Kind Tree Productions, Inc.	60238	1	/users/profile/65408	Nancy Bright	Volunteer	5	01/17/2011	I have enjoyed the privilege of being a volunteer for Kind Tree- a grass roots organization whose volunteers exude loving and passionate support for the autism community- a population severely underestimated and under served. As a watercolor instructor at the summer retreat (a weekend camping and enrichment experience specifically designed for people on the autism spectrum, as well as their families and caregivers), I witnessed the absolute joy that participants had as they splashed beautiful color onto the paper as well as the proud, accomplished feelings they had when their paintings were complete. Watercolor painting is just one of the many exciting workshops and activities offered at the retreat. Sadly, as the class I teach takes place only on Saturday, each year I have had to make the difficult decision whether to participate in this amazing event, or to stay and work as a vendor selling my art at the local Saturday Market.  Kind Tree made it possible for me to participate one year by generously offering to pay me a stipend so that my participation in the event would not be a such financial hardship on me. This, to me, was an extraordinary gesture, given that this group operates on such a shoestring budget. It not only showed tremendous support for me as an artist, but also demonstrated the value they place on providing a rich art experience for retreat participants. I have also enjoyed the pleasure of being a juror for the annual Autism Artism show for which artists from far and wide submit their work. These artists pour their heart and soul into their work and it is incredible that Kind Tree makes it possible for them to display their work professionally in a gallery, as well as to offer it for sale to the public. The impact this organization has on our community is immeasurable. There is no other organization in our community that serves the autism population the way Kind Tree does. Be it recreation, the arts, or social groups and outings - everyone who wants to participate is welcomed with open arms. As a parent of an adult with Aspergers Syndrome, I am very comforted to know that this supportive community exists, should my own offspring ever desire to participate.I urge you to support this vital part of our social network that serves a community whose needs are high but whose recognition and acceptance is low. Many people on the autism spectrum (my son being one) slip through the cracks and are not being served through government programs such Developmental Disabilities Services, and, in turn, are not eligible for brokerage services. Kind Tree- Autism Rocks helps to fill a tremendous gap for people acutely in need of social support and who are hard pressed to find it in our society. Not only do they serve individuals on the spectrum, but their gift to this community extends to their families, care givers, and  educators, as well as to the general public. I urge you to help keep this incredible volunteer organization alive and thriving by supporting it with your financial backing.  
Kind Tree Productions, Inc.	60019	1	/users/profile/65138	asperamber	Volunteer	3	01/13/2011	Regarding the camp, it is great, but it needs to be longer and we need to have a day where people can just "hang out." No events, but just where they can relax and chat in their cabins or stim rooom or whatever. I wonder if a nap time would be appropriate. People on the spectrum tire easily and nap. A jam session with T.R. Kelley would be cool. In the pinata, there should no candy with just stim toys. No puzzles, plastic dinosaurs, etc. We could have a day where a shuttle takes us all over to the beach. That would be great. Do we need the same menu exactly every year? Pictures need to be taken more equally of everyone also. Perhaps more entertainers if we stretch this thing into a week. Other than that, it's good. Whoever picked our spot did a great job with that. Keep it up!

He looks forward every year to participating and sending in his artwork and to see it on the website each year.  Their newsletter is outstanding and so informative like non I've ever seen.

I love that they provide an opportunity for people who experience autism to be in art shows and sell their art work and the self esteem booster that is for the folks and their families. The support group for people on the spectrum is extremely helpful.Their camp is a high light of my year and the lives of all who attend. For a weekend we all play together and families feel supported and not alone. Everyone is accepted no one gets weird looks. Its a dream come true with lots of art projects, swimming and boating, talent shows, concerts, karoke, good food, camp fires, etc. As a volunteer I have so much fun helping out it isn't even work. I love referring the families with children who have autism that I work with as a social worker about this organization. i can't say enough good about them.

For people we serve, access to creative expressions through KindTree is paramount in their overall integration and inclusion in our community.  They provide appropriate support, mentoring and activities to a wide range of individuals and are successful in their dreams and pursuits.
Kind Tree Productions, Inc.	59628		/users/profile/64522	Suzline	Client Served	5	01/07/2011	Kindtree is the best!!! They have helped promote so many artist with autism and I should know, for I am one of those artists!They have a "unity through diversity" outlook and outreach program. I'm so glad I live in Oregon, the home of Kindtree. I pray someday all states have such a fantastic arts organization  and program to better and enrich the lives of people who are gifted with autism.
Kind Tree Productions, Inc.	59623		/users/profile/64511	NancyStamm	Donor	5	01/07/2011	Kind Tree Prodpuctions, also known as "Autism Rocks" is a remarkable group of supportive professionals reaching out to high functioning autistic young adults. The support group has cut through the loneliness so many youg adults experience, and the peer discussions of social and workk-related problems is comforting and constructive. It's nice not to be alone! The group also offers Social Skills classes, which are great ways to develop tools that would otherwise be incomprehensible. They practice reacting to different situations, they talk about unspoken ways that non-autistic people interact, something that is hard for autistic folks to understand. The Social Skills classes also involve planning outings as a group, fun ways to interact in a safe, interesting social environment in "the outside world." My nephew has found happiness, friendship, structure, and self-awareness through Autism Rocks. He likes the people and the activities, the play-acting, and the discussions. A lot.
Kind Tree Productions, Inc.	59609		/users/profile/64477	Autism society of Oregon	Professional with expertise in this field	4	01/07/2011	They have a wonderful summer program that I have heard fabulous things about!  An opporuntity for families to get together and enjoy a great summer venue, with sensory games, music, great food and laughter.
Kind Tree Productions, Inc.	59579		/users/profile/64427	geri newton	Volunteer	5	01/06/2011	I have been involved with Kind Tree for over 10 years. They are unique in the respectful exciting manner with which they invite people who experience autism to find their artistic voice. The camps they provide are amazing experiences. Hundreds of people have attended and been relaxed for the first time, free for the first time, appreciated fully for the first time and neurotypical people are allowed to be part of the magic. The art shows bring a powerful and meaningful voice to the artistic community. I have been moved to tears, laughter and learned more about the world by having the privelege to view this art. Many of the pieces live in my memory as a guide post to humanity.
Kind Tree Productions, Inc.	59566		/users/profile/64407	ScottJackson	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/06/2011	I first came to know about Kindtree Productions Inc., around October 30, 2010 when Sec/treas Tim Mueller was honored in Vancouver, BC at the The Naturally Autistic People Awards for his Award for Mentorship.  I had the priveledge, as an autistic radio show host to speak with him during the post-awards banquet celebration.  Within a few weeks, I was So excited about the creativity, hard work & dedication that was enthusiastically produced from this Inaugural event--that I began hearing about my artwork & it's value as an autistic artist.  Having faced the endless bargaining & "false promisses" of various scam artists under the umbrella of supposed, publishing companies--It took me many years to find value in my own artwork.  That very same artwork was seen by Tim Mueller & within a month's time--I was accepted, encouraged & a published, autistic artist with KindTree Productions, Inc.  This devoted non-profit, with much passion & understanding in the field of autism has helped me to regain the self-confidence, escape from the confines of four walls & re-surface.  The generosity of the staff at KindTree has by far exceeded any expectations.  For the first time in 32 years, I can finally say, "I'm a published, autistic artist!"  Without Tim Mueller & his amazing mentorship, I would still be drawing within the confines of my home & the abilities of so many other autistic people would be sacrificed at the hands of false publishers who are for profit.  KindTree Productions, Inc. is making it happen--all over the world!  I'm so thankful in so many different ways that I can describe in two final words, "Autism Rocks!"   Scott Jackson, ScottJackson@americanautists.comFounder of AmericanAutists.com, Artist Guild Member of KindTree -- Autism Rocks, Radio Show Host, Co-Host of  Naturally Autistic ANCA Radio & Online Team Contributing Writer.
Kind Tree Productions, Inc.	59552		/users/profile/64380	nell	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/06/2011	Kind Tree is a great group that creates art of real value - value for the purchaser/patron and value for the creator.  Kind Tree artists create holiday art cards that are beautiful and are the cards you'll want  to share, whatever the occasion.  The Kind Tree newletter is always full of information and creativity.  Go Kind Tree!
Kind Tree Productions, Inc.	59541		/users/profile/64366	Laurie G.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/06/2011	Kind Tree Productions, Inc.  supports autistic artists to expose their works and sell them to the larger, non-autistic population.  As the advocate of one such autistic artist, I have appreciated the opportunities Kind Tree takes to display the artwork, and then to contact the artists annually to report on total sales and to provide commission cheques to every artist for any of their work which has sold in the past year.  Receipt of that letter and enclosed cheque is a real boost to self esteem for an autistic individual.  Kind Tree also puts on symposiums for parents and professionals and an annual summer camp for autistic children, teens and adults , their families, and/or their support workers.  We have attended several of these camps as well over the years, despite the fact that we live 700 miles and 3 states away.  I highly recommend this organization.
Kind Tree Productions, Inc.	59516		/users/profile/64327	Notarygirl	General Member of the Public	5	01/06/2011	Kind Tree provides so much for the autism community - it spills over into the general public, like me. I have a granddaughter with autism and these dedicated people bring me news ad fabulous art work from the autism community.
Kind Tree Productions, Inc.	59511		/users/profile/64320	dgermain	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/05/2011	I've been involved with Kind Tree for several years and have appreciated the commitment to people experiencing Autism Spectrum Disorders.  Kind Tree provides a variety of venues from which support for the many interests people of all ages have.  They celebrate the artists in our Autism Community and serve to encourage creative expression and have provided venues in which to display their art as well as earn some revenue.  Kind Tree maintains a well rounded service from which people experiencing Autism Spectrum Disorders can learn social skills, express themselves through art and gain a feeling of respect and value.  This organization is unique and innovative toward helping others feel part of a community at large.

We love KindTree.  I am retired, & in the past worked with people on the Autism Spectrum...aren't we all somewhere on there!  This is an exceptional organization.  I am so impressed, I hope to find a way to volunteer with this agency. DeeAnn Darby Bradley & Jason Bradley
Kind Tree Productions, Inc.	59506		/users/profile/64315	Haidee	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/05/2011	Hello! Kind-Tree fill a unique role in our community! There are opportunities for camps, informational news letters and a way to market your creations. The truly unique aspect comes for the manner in which Kind Tree interacts, represents and supports individuals on the spectrum. Kind Tree focuses on what individuals with autism can do, helps them realize their potential and even gain a little pride in being a bit self-supporting. (Sadly the world still judges the individual on their ability to earn money.) The positive experiences that can be found are indeed unique! Thank you!Haidee Copeland

Kind Tree Productions, Inc.	59503		/users/profile/64310	kcerrudo	Client Served	5	01/05/2011	One day I featured a young autistic artist from Kind Tree Productions in a treasury on ETSY. At the end of the treasury, I went to purchase the young man's artwork, but was too late. Every picture had sold! The next morning, the artist told me he thought there had been a mistake at first because he had nothing in his shop. He was thrilled that people loved his work and a new friendship was born. I was able to order a later picture and was inspired to design a fairy in the artist's color scheme, donating the profits to KindTree Productions, Inc., a charity close to the artist's heart.
Kind Tree Productions, Inc.	59501		/users/profile/64308	ldemonia	General Member of the Public	5	01/05/2011	KindTree Productions has been our sunshine in a sometimes dark and isolated world.  We are parents of an autistic daughter.  She has been fortunate enough to have her art recognized by KindTree.  This has  helped us appreciate the gifts she has been given and not focus on her struggle living with autism.I hope KindTree continues to get the support it deserves for making such a difference in helping those in the autistic community! 
Essential Health Clinic	90818		/users/profile/103717	Vanessa Acosta- S.	Volunteer	5	06/14/2011	I have been volunteering as an interpreter (Eng-Spa) since late last year.  It has been a rewarding experience being able to help other express their need to get help.  It is amazing how many people go through the clinic every night they are open. Also, it has served as an opportunity to learn from others and to meet other amazing volunteers.
Essential Health Clinic	90627		/users/profile/103425	Catherine	Volunteer	5	06/13/2011	I absolutely loved volunteering at the Essential Health Clinic.  It was an honor to work along side such kind, competent and giving volunteer medical personnel.  Everyone involved in the clinic does an outstanding job to bring quality medical care to local families in need.  They treat patients with care and respect and go the extra mile to connect even patients with complicated medical conditions to follow-up care.  Most of their patients would either not receive care or would end up in the emergency room without the Essential Health Clinic.
Essential Health Clinic	90624		/users/profile/103420	tomasgalicia	Volunteer	5	06/13/2011	Essential Health Clinic provides free medical care to the needy. Until universal health care is a reality in the US, this clinic and similar clinics across the country are the only places they can get the help they need. Many of those people are poor, and many don't ever see a doctor until their illness is well advanced. They suffer a lot, silently. I am an interpreter at the clinic, and I have been doing it almost weekly for over 2 years. I am so glad I can add my little contribution, helping with those that don't speak English very well.
Essential Health Clinic	90573		/users/profile/103337	Julie M.	Volunteer	5	06/12/2011	The Essential Health Clinic is an invaluable resource in our community. It provides much needed urgent care health services to the un-insured population of Washington County Oregon, which is a growing population, somewhere over 80,000 individuals at this time. For the past 5 years I have witnessed the miracle of caring in healthcare that EHC provides 3 nights a week to a grateful population.
Essential Health Clinic	90560		/users/profile/103321	Brent K.	Volunteer	5	06/12/2011	I have volunteered at the clinic for several years and have seen first hand how the clinic provides me medical care for uninsured that would otherwise have no place to turn.  The clinic also helps uninsured patients get set up with providers that can care for them long term.  Tuality Hospital also donates lab and xray services.  This is the kind of place that makes you feel good about America again!
Essential Health Clinic	90534		/users/profile/103288	Britney F.	Volunteer	4	06/12/2011	I am a volunteer at Essential Health Clinic and am very impressed with the efficiency and organization of the program.  All the volunteers are very kind and focused on providing quality care no matter what role they are in. I have had many patients tell me that they are so glad this clinic exists because they are without medical insurance for one reason or another and going to the emergency room would be too expensive. The entire process of admitting, vital signs, exam, and discharge is so efficient and organized that I can hardly find any way to make the process faster and as effective as they have already set it up to be. I would highly recommend this clinic to anyone in the Washington County area who is struggling without medical insurance and needs to see a doctor for an urgent issue. The only problem that I see with the clinic is that they can only be open two days a week. There have been a few times where patients told me they ran out of essential medications because they thought the clinic was open more often, and they had to wait two or three days before they could come in again to get the meds.
Essential Health Clinic	90508		/users/profile/103246	littlemacor	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/11/2011	Were it not for the Essential Health Clinic, many of the clients whose children have basic care under the Oregon Health Plan would have no access to care at all.  The staff works tirelessly to see that urgent care needs are met for those who have no insurance - they are an incredible group of volunteers!!
Essential Health Clinic	90491		/users/profile/103223	krabiipdx	Volunteer	5	06/11/2011	Since the beginning of my freshman year of college, my real passion has been volunteering at the Essential Health Clinic.  I started at the EHC as an intake clerk, in the overcrowded lobby of the Washington County Health Department.  All the patients of the clinic are uninsured, and within this group we have people from the correctional facility down the street, pregnant teenagers, migrant workers, and families just trying to make ends meet.  The clinic environment surrounds me with triage nurses, doctors, and many other volunteers all donating their time and energy to help the people who are falling between the cracks of our healthcare system.   The energy in the EHC clinic is remarkable. Everyone volunteers at the clinic to make a difference in our community any way possible and the volunteers come from all professions, ages, ethnicities, and socioeconomic backgrounds. Every Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday we put aside whatever stress we have accumulated from school, work, or life and work together to set up a real clinic. Every piece and person within this group is a vital part of making the clinic run smoothly, and everyone there comes to volunteer with a real spirit of altruism.  I plan to pursue a career as a physician and I know I will continue to comeback and give to the community and my family at EHC that has given me so much. The amount I have learned about health and healing, and our healthcare system is immeasurable. I am so grateful to the volunteers and staff at the Essential Health Clinic for the wonderful opportunity they have provided me.  I have been able to spend time there working with friends, learning about my future profession, and trying to provide health services to the members of our community.
Essential Health Clinic	90449		/users/profile/103160	Amy P.	Volunteer	5	06/11/2011	Essential Helath Clinic provides invaluable medical care and concern for the most vulnerable and underserved members of our community.   The clinic offers basic medical care and screening, free medications (when available), free lab work and diagnostic testing.  This care is provided entirely by volunteers, from the physicians and nurses to the interpreters, lab techs and data entry positions.   As one of those data entry volunteers, I have seen first-hand the difference this clinic makes in the lives of so many.  Lives have literally been saved,   Disorders such as diabetes and hypertension are diagnosed and preliminary treatments are initiated.  Follow-up care is provided as often as possible to ensure that the client's health issues are fully addressed, monitored and managed through several community partnerships.   The clinic treats each and every client with dignity and respect, and provides a much-needed friendly face in the healthcare quagmire.  The staff is dedicated to providing this service to the community.  The board of directors is active in developing the necessary resources, both financial and cooperative, to the operation of the clinic.  The uninsured, unemployed community put their lives in the hands of these amazing caregivers...and I am truly honored to be a small part of such a grass roots solution to the healthcare crisis in my community.  
Essential Health Clinic	90446		/users/profile/103156	Astin M.	Volunteer	5	06/10/2011	Essential Health Clinic provides care for un/underinsured people with medical needs!  It operates nearly entirely on the basis of volunteers, screens patients with more urgent medical needs for Project Access medical care, and is the only safety net for many people who can't otherwise access care.  It keeps a large volume of people out of more expensive, less efficient, and less effective environments like the Emergency Room.  Its an excellent model for care, and should be benchmarked and copied all over this state!
Essential Health Clinic	90444		/users/profile/103154	ginny	Volunteer	5	06/10/2011	Essential Health Clinic has 2 sites that serve children and adults in the Portland/Hillsboro/Tigard area in Oregon. Adults and children who have to source of medical care are seen respectfully, with translators always avalabile, and care coordinators to help them get followup care, and volunteer doctors and nurses who listen and to the extent they can, treat acute medical problems, or get them to the next step for their chronic medical problems. Getting them inexpensive medicines either free or low cost is one of the skills the clinic teaches--both its patients and its clinical staff!
Essential Health Clinic	90437		/users/profile/103145	Liz T.	Volunteer	5	06/10/2011	I have been volunteering with Essential health clinic for over 3 years and believe   that this organization provides an important services to the uninsured citizens.
Essential Health Clinic	47699	4	/users/profile/48420	big-grandma	Volunteer	5	07/02/2010	I have had the privilege of volunteering for about 6 years at the Hillsboro Essential Health Clinic, a free clinic to people with health needs and without health insurance. It has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life.  The need for health care is huge.  The patients are grateful beyond expression: to see a smile on a once worried face, to hear the depth of appreciation from them.  The leadership in the clinic is exemplary, striving always to minimize cost and maximize service.
Essential Health Clinic	47675	4	/users/profile/48392	emrall	Volunteer	5	07/02/2010	I really enjoyed volunteering at the Essential clinic.  I started as a student and have come back now that I am out of school.  It has changed for the better and really grown in the last 6 years.  These patients really have no other options for healthcare and are very grateful for the help.  This is a volunteer event but I feel that I am getting 'paid' by how good it makes me feel to be able to help.
Essential Health Clinic	47082	5	/users/profile/47867	feldmange	Volunteer	5	06/30/2010	This is a wonderful medical experience!   I have been an Internist for 34 years and this is always an uplifting evening's work for me.  The staff are very supportive, have great senses of humor and obviously enjoy helping people.  I would highly recommend this as a way for you to give back your medical expertise to the community.
Essential Health Clinic	46886	5	/users/profile/47694	cricket1	Volunteer	4	06/29/2010	I especially enjoy and appreciate the willingness of all the volunteers, staff and providers to work together to provide needed basic health care for the low income, uninsured people in our community.
Essential Health Clinic	46866	5	/users/profile/47677	ginny5	Volunteer	5	06/29/2010	I've worked in many volunteer clinics, having started one myself while in med school in the 70's. Essential has a superb quality I've not seen before--which is a referral coordinator who works during clinic hours and behind the scenes to get follow-up for patients. The main limitation of most volunteer clinics is the inability to give more than a one-night-stand type of care. Essential is able to find continuity of care for the many patients with chronic illness who come in for refills, or checks--but need far more. Essential has also worked with other community clinics so that most patients can leave with assurance they will get at least a generic of the meds they need.   All-in-all---a First Class clinic!
Essential Health Clinic	46466	4	/users/profile/47307	mcgeek	Volunteer	5	06/29/2010	Health care reform in America is presently in a state of suspended transformation and the forces of change are stalled as the number of uninsured rise and continue to die from lack of care that comes late in the course of illness in the U.S. The big picture is one of national change while the little picture continues to be that people need access to health care. Patients without health insurance commonly rely on some type of safety net. Essential health clinic (EHC) is a well organized and personalized safety net clinic that I have had the opportunity to volunteer as an RN and soon to be health care provider.
Essential Health Clinic	46331	4	/users/profile/47194	margarita1	Volunteer	5	06/29/2010	Essential Health Clinic provides medical services to uninsured patients.  All the Staff members and volunteers are compasionate and dedicated to make the patient experience as great as possible.  The Clinic is really well organized and runs smoothly. THus, it's a real pleasure to work with them.
Essential Health Clinic	46315	4	/users/profile/47178	ghadley	Volunteer	5	06/28/2010	I have had the opportunity to volunteer at the Essential Health Clinic (EHC) for the last several years.  There are a few paid staff memebers, but most of the people staffing this clinic, including all of the providers, are volunteers.  The staff members have a genuine concern for the well being of patients coming to the clinic.  They go out of their way to provide the best care possible with the resources they have available.
Saving Grace: Imagine Life without Violence	184727		/users/profile/195013	R Smith	Board Member	5	10/29/2013	I am proud to be a member of the board of directors for Saving Grace. Saving Grace provides critical services to Central Oregon's victims of intimate partner violence, and their children. They provide follow-up services that assist a victim to get back on her/his feet and independent again. It is well managed financially, has dedicated and skilled staff, and many volunteers to support the mission. They are a top-notch organization.
Saving Grace: Imagine Life without Violence	147493		/users/profile/195013	R Smith	Board Member	5	12/31/2012	After the recent devastating gun violence in Newtown, CT, there is no better time to recognize the services that Saving Grace provides to victims of domestic violence (DV) in Central Oregon. Did you know that in Oregon in 2010, 28 females were murdered by males in single victim/single offender homicides? Nationwide, 52 percent of female victims were killed with guns. Of these, 70 percent were killed with handguns. "For women in America, guns are not used to save lives, but to take them." ("When Men Murder Women: An Analysis of 2010 Homicide Data" by the Violence Policy Center).  Saving Grace is the Central Oregon provider of a state-wide web to protect and serve victims of domestic and sexual violence. In 2011, Saving Grace provided 11,303 crisis services for 4,686 people; answered 2,320 hotline calls; protected, fed, clothed and lodged 229 women and children for 3,0202 days; taught 2,650 people how to prevent violence; supervised 1,609 visits and exchanges  for 275 parents and children in DV situations. Seventy-five volunteers provided 14,320 hours of services. (Saving Grace Annual REport 2011).

Saving Grace has been serving Central Oregon communities for more than 35 years. As a former client, I can say they are compassionate, caring and well established. Volunteering for Saving Grace has been a life changing event for me, and I would strongly urge any one interested in service work to give them a try!

Saving Grace: Imagine Life without Violence	181618		/users/profile/238345	mloc	Board Member	5	10/23/2013	Saving Grace is an excellently run, fiscally responsible, non-profit organization and Central Oregon should be proud to have an organization such as Saving Grace supporting its community. These folks pour their hearts and souls in to their work, creating safe places for victims and their families. If you don't know much about Savings Grace, I would definitely urge you to garner more information about all the organization has to offer. 
Saving Grace: Imagine Life without Violence	181579		/users/profile/238310	Chantal1958	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/23/2013	I'm almost a senior citizen now, and across my lifespan I have unfortunately experienced multiple sexual assaults. I've used those experiences to become a better person and also think about what is helpful for other survivors. An organization that walks it's talk is at the top of my list - if the organization's culture isn't respectful, positive, and forward-looking, how can the staff and volunteers there make a difference for anyone else? Saving Grace staff strive for continuous improvement, are highly ethical, and put the needs of victims' first. I can't recommend it highly enough.

My husband's violence toward our children and me was getting worse as time went on.  Our children and I felt like we were walking on "eggshells" in our own home.  We were emotionally and physically stuck in an abusive situation we had no idea how to deal with.  When Saving Grace stepped in and provided help - safety, information, education, resources, legal assistance, compassion, understanding, and someone to come along side us - our lives were given back to us!  I believe that God used Saving Grace to deliver my children and I from a harmful situation we could not deliver ourselves from.  I will be forever grateful to Saving Grace and it's staff.

I now am living a great life with no domestic violence in my life I went to college and got a degree as well I raised my kids by myself and they are both doing great as well. I love being a volunteer for Saving Grace it is a non profit that is really needed for people to be safe. God bless you Saving Grace.
Saving Grace: Imagine Life without Violence	179420		/users/profile/236067	BRullman	Volunteer	5	10/18/2013	When starting to write this review i wondered how long i had been involved.  i was very surprised to discover it has been almost 15 years.  i think Saving Grace is an outstanding organization, with an excceptional board, great senior staff and the most dedicated service providers i have ever seen.  Saving Grace is well run, in good financial situation and well thought of in the community.  On top of all that, the organization provides a service lauded by the clients.  an excellent organization.
Saving Grace: Imagine Life without Violence	179414		/users/profile/236062	JackieD	Volunteer	5	10/18/2013	Before volunteering to help Saving Grace with fundraising events, I was unaware of the great need in our community for such a service.  I have met "survivors" who truly appreciated the care and support they received from Saving Grace staff and volunteers because, without Saving Grace, some of these survivors may not be alive today.  Those people (mostly women and children) had - and others in similar situations have - a safe place to go.

I have heard others, many of them close colleagues, in the medical, mental health and legal fields/professions, say the same, emphasizing as I would, that this organization has been an exceptional agency of skill and care.  How fortunate we are to partner with such an organization in whatever way we might. Elizabeth C
Saving Grace: Imagine Life without Violence	147574		/users/profile/195191	MMurray	Board Member	5	01/02/2013	Saving Grace is an amazing organization providing services for victims of domestic violence and sexual assault. In 35 years, it has grown from a handful of volunteers with an evening-only hotline to a well-run organization serving three counties in central Oregon. With a 24-hour hotline, shelter for women and children, support for victims of sexual assault, stalking and human trafficking, and a facility for the supervised visitation and safe exchange of children Saving Grace literally saves lives.
Saving Grace: Imagine Life without Violence	147559		/users/profile/195162	BBalz	Board Member	5	01/02/2013	Saving Grace is one of the best run and most effective non-profit organiations in Central Oregon and the only one who is providing services to victims of sexual assault and domestic violence.  It has been successfully helping thousands of women and children for almost 40 years!  Saving has a strong reputation and is especially well regarded by other non-profits and public officials.   With a staff of almost 30 individuals and a volunteer network of 100 or more individuals, Saving Grace staffs offices in Madras, Redmond, Prineville and Bend with counseling available at these locations as well as a safe house in Bend where mothers and children are given temporary safe shelter.  
Saving Grace: Imagine Life without Violence	147558		/users/profile/195160	lrb3	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/02/2013	Saving Grace goes above and beyond here in Central Oregon. They serve thousands of individuals needing assistance while dealing with domestic violence and sexual assault. This is truly a community issue and chances are you know someone who has needed help from Saving Grace. Saving Grace is there with free and confidential services ranging from counseling to emergency shelter to support groups for these women, men and children. The work they do is life changing and helps many families get back on their feet and into a happier, healthier lifestyle. 
Saving Grace: Imagine Life without Violence	145886		/users/profile/192483	Patty21	Board Member	5	12/04/2012	Saving Grace is a life-changing organization providing services and shelter to victims of domestic violence.... women, children, and men!  They work hard to educate the community about the impact of domestic violence on individuals as well as the community.  DV is not just the victims problem!  The organization has a tireless, dedicated staff and amazing volunteers.  They've brought services to Central Oregon that are above on beyond national standards!  
Saving Grace: Imagine Life without Violence	143218	1	/users/profile/189656	cjp8784	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/27/2012	This amazing agency was born through the efforts of a hand full of volunteers in the late 1970's with a vision of "life without violence" and has grown and matured into a force for change in the lives of so many women and children through offering comprehensive services to person's victimized by domestic abuse or sexual assault.  The staff is passionate, compassionate, dedicated and visionary.
Northwest Youth Corps	213155	1	/users/profile/276308	Allistaire	Volunteer	4	09/03/2014	   I had the opportunity to work with NYC on their first adult crew as an AmeriCorps member in Oregon and as a crew leader for youth in Idaho. I gained a lot of experience and skills in the adult crew that will further my career.  Idaho was life changing for me in ways I didn't think would happen. I learned just as much from leading the kids as they learned from me. My crew leaders have been amazing and my program directors Steve and Tom were fantastic.   However, multiple times have the two girls in the payroll office sent my checks late (after not properly setting up my direct deposit). After my Idaho session was finished they did not send my check until I called about it in which they tried to blame the postal service for being late to hide their mistake. They also gave attitude whenever a draw was requested.  I'm unfortunately not the only one with accounts such as this with these girls.   NYC is such a great opportunity to get kids enthusiastic and excited for the field of environmental stewardship if not grow a healthy respect for the environment and the people who dedicate their time and lives for it. I recommend all teens and young adults to experience NYC and other Corps around the country for at least a session.
Northwest Youth Corps	138265	1	/users/profile/184318	Sara63	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/13/2012	I have had the pleasure of participating in planning and design processes with NYC as a member of an architectural team. During this process we toured the facility and met with staff in order to understand the workings of the organization as well as plans and needs for the future. During this process I was immensely impressed with the organization's commitment to the success of the youth it serves as well as the broad-reaching services it provides to communities far beyond its home on Augusta Street. NYC is deeply rooted to its neighborhood through its activities and facilities. The large community garden is utilized by youth as well as neighbors and a wetland on the grounds is being restored. Working closely with NYC, we prepared plans for improvements to the building and site (a former elementary school) that will ensure its continued ability to not only continue to function in its present location, but to do so more effectively and efficiently. Northwest Youth Corps looks far into the future and is taking steps now to ensure its continued ability to provide today's youth the necessary skills for future success.
Northwest Youth Corps	130895	2	/users/profile/176412	Larry Hills	Client Served	5	10/29/2012	I have hired Northwest Youth Corps every summer since 1993 to accomplish trail work on the Fremont National Forest.  We have had approximately 200 crews working for us during that time span with 10 crew members and 2 crew leaders per crew for a total of around 2200 young people.  My experiences with those crews has always been very positive.  They have always exceeded expectations in every regard.  The work they have accomplished over the years is truly remarkable.  Our trails program would not be what it is without the efforts of the Northwest Youth Corps crews and the staff in their headquarters office.  I would highly recommend them to anyone with no reservations whatsoever!  Working with them has been one of the joys and high points of my 28 years with the Forest Service.  Larry Hills, Fremont-Winema National Forest.
Northwest Youth Corps	123416	1	/users/profile/168069	Jason in Corvallis	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/27/2012	There are few opportunities out there for young people as good as the Northwest Youth Corps. As a former staff member, and licensed high school teacher, I know the positive influence NYC has had on many youth. In a time of so much media and screens, NYC offers young people the refreshing gift of healthy relationship-building and physical activity in the world's best classroom - the great outdoors. Students come away with a deep sense of self confidence, new friends, hard-earned money in their pockets and great memories that will last a lifetime. Working at the Northwest Youth Corps is almost certain to be one of the best experience you'll ever have in your life.   
Northwest Youth Corps	123236	1	/users/profile/167859	WilliamDrabkin	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/26/2012	1- The Executve Director, Jeff Parker, assisted me in creating the Youth Corps of Southern Arizona(YCOSA). He dedicated many hours of technical and practical(hands own) assistance. We modeled our program after NYC's highly successful youth development organization. 2- Over many years YCOSA sent crewmembers to receive training from NYC- particparing as Crew Members and in Crew Leader trainings. Those participants to a person all found the NYC experience to be of value- assisting them personally to become better Crew Leaders and better stewards of our natural resources.     3- YCOSA  also recruited former crew members from the NYC pool of volunteers/former participants. All of those young adults spoke admirably of their NYC experience. 4- Lasty, for those unfamiliar with this type of youth development organization, the outdoor environment can be very challenging- emotionally and physically. Many of the participants are not used to such challenges and many are struggling with a lot of issues- drugs, abuse, failure. The challenges are many and the rewards can serve the participants in all phases of their lives.
Northwest Youth Corps	123057	1	/users/profile/167628	Springer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/25/2012	Northwest Youth Corps is both a fantastic organization and a wise investment.  NYC partners with agencies like the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management, providing those agencies a workforce to complete necessary work.  The agencies pay a much lower rate for the labor they receive and the youth participants gain invaluable (demanding, exacting, complex, etc.) work experience.  It is a triple win for taxpayers, donors, and youth.  The program's legacy of positive impacts on youth and helping conserve some of the best places in the west in unparalleled.  This program is a critical part of the fabric of youth development in the northwest, connecting youth to our unique environmental treasures and instilling an uncompromising work and social ethic in them.
Northwest Youth Corps	122743	1	/users/profile/167176	L Kirby	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/21/2012	I have worked with at-risk young people as a professional in the conservation corps community, therapeutic wilderness settings, and work skills programs.  To know the intensity and challenge of working with any teen and then to add the challenge of performing skilled work in an unpredictable environment,  I can't recommend a program more than NYC.  Life changing experiences are shared by a community of young people that truly learn what is possible if you choose to challenge yourself.  The "real" world of the outdoors is the classroom for weeks of learning.  In this plugged in world it is refreshing to know that NYC participants & staffmembers make it happen with their hands & simple tools with wooden handles.  My experiences and skills learned as a participant in the NYC community help me on a daily basis.  
Northwest Youth Corps	122535	4	/users/profile/166879	asilver1993	Volunteer	5	09/19/2012	My name is Ashley Silver and there's honestly nothing I can say that's changed my life more then Northwest Youth Corps. My initial experience there wasn't exactly adequate. I was going through a difficult period in my life where I was very negligent and it was actually my mom who made me look into their 5 week summer program. I wasn't in any place to argue and I didn't really know what it was all about anyway so I wasn't opposed to the idea. I cannot deny that before being involved with NYC I lacked the principles of many things such as self motivation, self discipline, obedience and benevolence. I was definitely a very stubborn and close-minded individual. Now that I look back on myself I can see how much I have grown just in the past year since I participated in this summer program. In all reality, it was exactly this, that triggered the change in me. It wasn't until I experienced this program that I began to figure out what I took pride in doing and realized the responsibilities of being a contributing individual in our society today. When I initially did a session I still had some of these bad habits and lacked a lot of these principles so when I went to re-apply they weren't so sure about rehiring me because I hadn't demonstrated that I was diligent in the work they were doing and I had a record of having bad attitude towards my duties. It took a significant commitment for me to prove to them that I had changed, and while going to school at Northwest Youth Corps' Outdoor School, I was right next door to the headquarters everyday so they talked with my the faculty at my school. I not only had to give my word that I would be commited but I had to show it in my performance at school as well. I can glady say I did just that and completely turned it around. I graduated from ODS in June and got recommended for BLP on the session I just did in August. I've met so many of the most important people in my life through NYC and know where I want to go and what I want to do in life because of it. I can't express enough how much this organization means to me and I absolutely plan to continue my involvement with them in the future.
Northwest Youth Corps	122530	1	/users/profile/166871	BJDS	Donor	5	09/18/2012	We became foster parents to one of our sons friends when the young man was almost 16. He was taken from his mother when he was only 2 for abuse by her boyfriend and put in a foster home where he lived until they gave up on him. After 12 years, he was tossed out of the only home and only family structure he had known and we became his safety net.  As you might expect, he was filled with anger, sadness, loneliness and grief. He found it difficult to be connected to others because of fear and trust issues. We did our best to give him love, family and a sense of worth but he had already been badly damaged by what had happened to him. He was ripe to fall into a bad crowd while searching for a place to belong.  We were familiar with Northwest Youth Corp because our older son had worked as a counselor for them when he finished college. He had told us some wonderful stories about emotionally lost kids finding connection and building their self-esteem. We knew that our foster son needed to learn about teamwork and feel the gratification for a job well done and we thought what better way than to learn this while caring for the environment. So, we sent our foster son to the NYC program. He was reluctant at first but knowing that he would be given a nice check for the work when he was finished helped him consider this challenge. And, challenged he was. There were several times that we thought we would have to go and get him but he toughed it through and the counselors did not give up on him.  When we went to camp with him for parents night he greeted us dirty and smelly but with a smile from ear to ear. He had made friends and he had experienced what it felt like to have accomplished something important. It was easy to see the camaraderie that he had built with the counselors and other kids. Everyone was held to the same high standard and they were proud of it. It was amazing to watch these gifted and wise counselors work with the kids. They treated the kids with kindness and respect and seemed to know exactly what these kids needed. Our foster son grew in ways he never expected and learned things that would last him a lifetime. He had indeed joined a good gang and now he knew the difference.  My husband and I have become lifelong supporters of NYC because of the wonderful work they do with kids and for the legacy of trails, bridges and a healthy environment. Every year we get dozens of letters written by the kids in their own hand about what it has meant to them to be a part of this unique experience. NYC is training the next generation to be stewards of our precious land and along the way building teamwork, self-esteem and pride in an accomplishment that has been well done. So, Bravo and take a standing ovation Northwest Youth Corp! And, to your leaders, counselors and to the legislators and contributors who support your work, please keep this work going and expanding! We support YOU! Dr. Barbara Dailey Snohomish, WA   
Northwest Youth Corps	122529	1	/users/profile/166870	zsterner	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/18/2012	I supervise a Voc/Ed program for teens in Lane County, OR that prepare youth to be successful at school, at work and in the community.  I consistently refer youth to NYC with the utmost confidence that they will have amazing experiences in safe and responsible environments.  This program invites adult leaders and youth who desire challenge and who are not afraid to challenge themselves.  However, this program is not for everyone.  This is not a traditional summer camp or an adventure experience where youth are coddled in any way.  The leaders and youth learn to push personal limits as it relates to work ethic, personal growth and environmental education.  I highly recommend NYC for individuals ready to work, learn and accept personal responsibility for their community.
Northwest Youth Corps	122471	2	/users/profile/166790	J. Romig	Client Served	5	09/17/2012	Northwest Youth Corps has been one of the greatest experiences of my life. I have experienced NYC as a 17-year old corpsmember in 1999, and returned the next two summers. After completing college, I worked for NYC from 2005 through 2008 as a Youth Corps Crew Leader and then as a Youth Corps Program Coordinator.  When I completed my first 5-week session in 1999, I knew I would be coming back for more. Yes, it was THE hardest thing I had ever done. Early mornings, hard and demanding work days, long hikes to work, evening chores, and limited free time. At work, my leaders pushed me to work as hard as I could, and I found out what I could really do  there were no limits to what I could accomplish at NYC, or in life.  As an insecure teenager, NYC was the one place where I could be goofy and be myself. I learned to work out conflicts with fellow corpsmembers and we treated each other with respect, regardless of our differences. I made some of my best friends at NYC  people with whom I shared struggles, hard work, and a ton of fun. And I learned so much about the world outside my small Oregon town  meeting people from different backgrounds, seeing new places, learning job skills that helped me with future jobs.  The experience doesnt let anyone off easy  this isnt summer camp, and if you ask anyone who successfully completed the program, theyll proudly tell you its not. Safety and the well-being of every corpsmember was the priority of everyone in the organization.  But staff also strove to make Northwest Youth Corps a unique, challenging, and meaningful experience that would have a positive effect on each and every corpsmember. And as a crewleader and program coordinator, I saw over and over again how Northwest Youth Corps changed the lives of teenagers for the better, just as it had changed mine.  Being a part of Northwest Youth Corps as a staff member was one of the most inspirational things I have ever done. I returned to NYC to pay the organization back for everything I gained as a corpsmember. But I found that I just gained more. And often, it was from working with the teenagers out in the woods. I was constantly amazed at what a group of people could accomplish, and how a group of diverse people can come together and find common ground. I highly recommend Northwest Youth Corps for anyone looking for a unique experience, wanting to gain job skills and a solid work ethic, becoming a responsible young adult, meeting new people and expanding their worldview, and for anyone who loves spending time in the outdoors.
Northwest Youth Corps	122466	3	/users/profile/166783	jorlandini	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/17/2012	I had the pleasure of working at the Outdoor High School, a program of Northwest Youth Corps.  At the school we took students on 8 day camping trips modeled after the summer conservation programs.  I have witnessed firsthand the amazing experience these trips have on youth.  Many of our students also participated in the 5 week summer programs and I can say without a doubt that if they participated in those programs they were extremely successful in the school program.  The sense of accomplishment and pride that they come away with is second to none.  I have two children myself and hope to one day have them participate in the Northwest Youth Corps programs.  While not every single person has the same experience, almost all have one that positively impacts their life. I must add that the safety precautions, staff training (including Wilderness First Aid), and focus on leadership development are second to none.  I definitely recommend this program to anyone interested.
Northwest Youth Corps	122464	1	/users/profile/166781	Susanne Twight-Alexander	Professional with expertise in this field	4	09/17/2012	I was raised in California State Parks and, after college, worked as a seasonal Ranger Naturalist at Crater Lake Nat'l Park. I served on a California Regional Water Quality Control Board for two  terms; in Oregon on the Lane County Parks Advisory Committee for 11 years, and as a member of the Willamette Resources & Educational Network for two terms. I also have a degree in Wildlife Conservation from UC Berkeley and an MS in Environmental Studies from the University of Oregon. This background made me really interested in applying for an opening as development director at NW Youth Corps 17 years ago, a position I held for nearly four years. During the time I worked there I was able to see how this organization changed the lives of many of the participants. Through working in the outdoors they learned about our relationship to the forests, waters, mountains and meadows of the Pacific NW. They gained valuable work experience: showing up ready to work, performing to high standards, and learning to work as a team. Many of their instructors were young people who had served in AmericCorp or even the Peace Corps and provided a broader world perspective in the lives of the participants. Many youth work outdoors away from the main campus but there is also an alternative high school on site. A number of the enrollees are here because they haven't been able to fit in at other schools; this may be their last chance to complete a high school education. They work outdoors one week and in the classroom the next, applying what they've learned to their classroom education. Many youngsters in both situations have little or no experience in living in the outdoors. They get to see beautiful scenery and travel as well as learning to take pride in what they have done: trails built, campgrounds repaired, even repairing old cabins at one of the state parks using authentic tools from bygone days. Personnel from the U.S. Forest Service, State Parks and others provide evening programs that expand their learning experience. I always  took great pride in any grant I was able to receive for NYC because the funds went to help continue the growth of these deserving young men and women. Even now, when driving up some back road to take a hike, and seeing one of the NYC vans parked near a trailhead, I know that out there someplace along the path kids are gaining a once in a lifetime experience while providing important assistance to society.
Northwest Youth Corps	122455	2	/users/profile/166772	sandchrls	Volunteer	5	09/17/2012	Northwest Youth Corps changed my life. It provided me an opportunity to go beyond my limits. It built my self-esteem, leadership skills, and gave me an opportunity to become a part of a community of young people committed to making ourselves and the world a better place. I am now a teacher, and the life lessons I learned at Northwest Youth Corps drive what I do on a daily basis. Without NYC, I wouldn't be the educator I am. Without NYC, I wouldn't be the person I am today. Without NYC, I wouldn't live a life devoted to making my community a better place on a daily basis.
Northwest Youth Corps	121846	3	/users/profile/165809	K. Johnston	General Member of the Public	1	09/03/2012	RED FLAG to all parents and teens considering this NYC organization for a summer outdoor education or positive, safe experience.  My granddaughter, from Missouri, attended the "IDAHO" program as a member of the East 1 red crew June 9, 2012 - August 14, 2012.  Our family feels extremely fortunate that she came home alive or even in fair health.  She did end up in the Boise, Idaho Emergency Room where she underwent several blood tests, MRI, received IV's, etc.  My opinion:  dehydration, sleep deprivation and improper nutrition.  NYC charges these teens for this food/stuff.    Within the first 7-10 days, a "leader" and male crew member quit this "Idaho" East 1 red crew.  This left William as the only leader to organize, supervise, instruct & care for this crew of 9 or 10 until a roving leader arrived, "if" they did.  Dezi A. was the Idaho program coordinator of 4 crews, comprised of approx. 38 teens plus leaders.  Joe W. is the program director who I believe has his office in Eugene, Oregon.   Parents, if your teen can tolerate dehydration, possible heat stroke, lack of sleep, a menu of oatmeal or bagel; peanut butter or bologna sandwich; pasta each night for supper; NO gatorade(only river water with chlorine or substitute), no fresh fruit, no toilet paper at camp site, perhaps 2-3 showers for 5 weeks, this might be the program for your teen.  Honestly, as I read my granddaughter's daily journal, this did "NOT" sound like a youth development & outdoor education organization.  It sounded like "my" military officer's boot camp.  The summer of 2011, my granddaughter was selected to participate in the YCC Yellowstone National Park Program.  That was a wonderful education and well run program with even a chef to prepare meals.    However, my granddaughter's Volunteer Youth Program in North Carolina was by far her favorite.  A forest ranger came each day to their tent camp site to supervise the "start" of their day plus the 2 leaders who supervised the crew 24-7.  MAYBE, JUST MAYBE, the Washington & Oregon programs of NYC are better organized than Idaho but someone is definitely "asleep at the wheel", in Idaho.  No supervision, no compassion, no learning, no education is happening in Idaho.  My granddaughter's comment was:  "CHAOTIC" !!!     Dr. Keith L. Johnston, PhD., Emeritus Professor, Missouri State University.                               
Northwest Youth Corps	107554	2	/users/profile/145754	N. Shifrin	Donor	5	03/05/2012	My daughter went to Northwest Youth Corps through three different programs, earning her high school diploma through the Outdoor High School. The greatest thing about NYC was its ability to work with a kid who had never spent any appreciable time outside, and turn her into a young person who is mature, confident and self-reliant in the outdoors, and who can relate to people from many different backgrounds. Thanks to NYC, my daughter has work experience she can put on her resume. My daughters friendsmany who have also gone through this programalso know how to work hard and know the meaning of real friendship.  In todays society, where so much youth experience is virtual, and relationships are distant and mediated through an electronic device, NYCs programs truly are a breath of fresh air. This program offers youth and their families an authentic and challenging experience, with caring and experienced crewleaders who are invested in the youth. Graduates of the program know that they have accomplished a lot and it shows in their pride and demeanor. We are proud to be NYC donors.
Northwest Youth Corps	107553	4	/users/profile/145753	J. Parker	Professional with expertise in this field	5	03/05/2012	At Northwest Youth Corps, we look forward to connecting with our program alumni. The vast majority of these alumni describe a fulfilling experienceone that helped them become successful in their life pursuits. While we are always unhappy to hear of a dissatisfied participant, we use it as an opportunity to identify ways to improve our programming. One participant has chosen to anonymously post a review to this website describing a negative experience she had with our program fourteen years ago.  Typically, we would simply let this go, however, the letter has so many inaccuracies and the tenor is so untypical that we feel compelled to write a response. To begin, Northwest Youth Corps is a non-profit organizationnot a commercial enterprise.  We are governed by a highly respected Board of Directors that receive no compensation for their service.  We provide paid job-training, education, and leadership training to youth and young adults. We do this by carrying out conservation projects for the Forest Service, BLM, County Parks and one hundred other partners across the northwest. Typical projects include wetland and prairie restoration, trail enhancement, non-native vegetation removal, riparian and stream restoration, and tree planting. Our core purpose is to provide opportunities for youth and young adults to learn, grow, and experience success.  We are proud that Northwest Youth Corps is challenging.  We dont hide the fact that days start early, and that the work is physically demanding. We acknowledge that the more difficult aspects of our programdirt and sweatare just as important as the laughter, deep friendships and sense of accomplishment that participants also enjoy.  Through these experiences, young people can develop the sense of team work, individual effort, and leadership skills they will use to become successful in their future academic and occupational pursuits.  Northwest Youth Corps is not just a job, and the rewards go way beyond the paycheck that participants earn. NYC has many operational costs associated with providing this experience.  We charge a modest tuition because we must pay our field staff to provide 24/7 supervision and leadership at our programnot just on the work siteas well as provide each participant with accredited academic activities.  We also provide youth with weekend recreation tripsan essential part of the NYC program. Again, these cost money.  100% of the tuition paid by families goes directly to supporting these education and recreation activities. We charge participants a per diem food deduction because we feed our youth a more wholesome and balanced diet than most young people get at home.  NYC does not have owners who are enriching themselves off the labor of youthinstead, we have a fleet of vehicles that need fuel, tools and equipment to care for, workers compensation and liability insurance premiums to pay, and a very dedicated staff who work tirelessly for modest pay.  We are proud that in 2011, we put over $1,000,000.00 into the pockets of youth for their hard work. NYC promotes itself to active teens and young adults from all walks of life who love the outdoors and who are able and interested in working with others in a safe, supervised and structured environment. Our organization has won national certifications of excellence based on our commitment to high-quality standards and continuous improvement, program design, youth development, completed service projects, and demonstration of success. Although youth who make poor choices face a formal discipline process that includes dismissal, during the course of our 28 years of operations, only a very small number of young people have had to leave the program.  Northwest Youth Corps is about great kids doing great things. Since 1984, more than 15,000 young people have committed themselves to community, education, challenge, leadership, and empowerment through NYC.  While we are saddened that the participant who wrote the negative review had a bad experience, her description of our program was not accurate and her experience was not typical. We invite the reader to learn more about NYC and the positive impact it has on our youth and public lands throughout Oregon, Washington, and Idaho. Sincerely,Jeff ParkerExecutive Director 
Northwest Youth Corps	95632	6	/users/profile/111064	BellaBlue	Volunteer	1	08/12/2011	How about a review from a non-staff member?   I was a crew member as a teenager, and was so excited to start!  With my passion for the environment, I thought this would be a great way to spend the summer.  My parents were more iffy because, in addition to the fee to join (about $300), the cost for food per day was two hours' worth of pre-tax work ($8 per day, $5.25 per hour, works out to about 4 per hour after taxes), pay that was minimum wage.   But I begged and begged and finally got my way. The initiation weekend was fine.  Made a couple friends, but then was divided into a different crew after requesting to be in the same one as my new friends.  The person who divided the crews said we need to meet new people.  I thought that was mean.  I just met those girls!   The first site we went to was fairly nice.  We lopped off the bottom branches of trees and had fun looking for tree tag 69 (we were teenagers, what can you expect?).  The second site we went to was by a lake that we weren't allowed to sleep in, and it was so full of mosquitos we were bitten through our jeans.  The third site we went to had no trees and a complete lack of trees in the middle of summer isn't safe!  I didn't stay for a fourth week. On the weekends al the crews got together.  There was so little adult supervision that there was a lot of sex and drug-use happening.  My first exposure to illegal drugs was on the first get-together weekend.  I was ticked off that we had to pay $1 for every 3 minutes in the shower.  There were a few activities for us to choose from and we had to participate in one.  Not many people were thrilled with having to choose between three hikes after working all weekend.  Most of us wanted to stay off our feet!   During the weeks, I couldn't help but be angry that the brochure talked about relaxing in lakes, friendships, relaxing when off the clock, etc., when the reality was different.  We'd get up before dawn and hike an hour to our wok spot.  But we didn't go on the clock until we got there.  After 8 hours of work, we hiked an hour back to camp.  We were rushed when we went to the bathroom and had to use leaves when we weren't at camp (several of us sneaked toilet paper with us).  When we got back to camp, we had chore lists with the cooking being the one we all wanted.  It was the least strenuous.  The food wasn't so great.  Hot dogs got old fast.  By the time we got to put our feet up, it was bed time.  Five days a week it was like this.  And on the weekends, we all were assigned chores to do to "earn" breakfast. The final straw with me was someone messed with one of my medications, and I was mad that the care package my parents sent that had some money for me to buy some snacks to supplement the boring and gross food was lost by NWYC (it was returned to my home several weeks later).  On a Wednesday, in the middle of the shift, another crew member and I  were told we were troublesome by complaining that previous weekend (in my case, it was because my package was lost, and my crew-mate complained about lunch being the same peanut butter sandwiches every single day) and were going home, and were led back to camp to pack up and were taken into town and put on Greyhound buses to the stations nearest our homes.  Our parents weren't called prior to this.   My parents considered suing.  Who in their right minds puts minors on buses without making sure their parents are around?  My family happened to be out of state, and the first they heard I wasn't at camp anymore was after I got to the Salem Greyhound and bummed enough change to make some phone calls and got a hold of my grandma (who lived in California) since my parents weren't answering, and it turned out my parents were in California.  My parents scrambled to find a friend who could pick me up.  My parents decided to not sue and we all wanted to put it all behind us.   My dad had a friend whose company contracted with NWYC that summer and paid $15 per person-hour ($180 per hour for 12 people, including the 2 crew leaders my crew had), and was floored when he found out that, of that $15, I received minimum wage and then had to pay food.  He felt that if NWYC was profiting so much , the least they could so was to pay for the oatmeal we had for breakfast, the peanut butter sandwiches we ate for lunch, and the hot dogs we had at dinner. After the food deduction and taxes, when I finally got my check weeks later, for the 12.5 days of work, I received less than $100.  My parents received a bill for the bus ticket and my mom told the supervisor where he can shove the bill. I think the "self-reliable" and "independence" that most kids learn in this program is due to having to fend for themselves, and the kids learned to rely on each other because the adults weren't very helpful.  Even in my crew, we looked out for each other because no one else would. If my own child were to beg and beg to join NWYC, there's no way this side of hell I'd allow it.  Even if the pay were much much higher, no.  No amount of money is worth making her go through what I did. The biggest benefactors are the program directors.  The other three crews had three leaders plus 10 kids.  Between the 51 workers, NWYC received $765 per hour, or $6,120 per day, or $153,000 for the 25 work days, plus $12,000 in fees to join from the families of the teens, plus we paid our own food $14,400 between all 40 kids for the 45 days).  $179,400 is what they took in.  $1050 was the total paid to each kid and crew leader.  So $53,550 in salaries.  Let's say the full $8 went to food, and it cost $500 for the gas (that's being VERY generous) for each crew, plus $500 in miscellaneous expenses per crew, a total of $2,000. $179,000 minus $53,550 in pay to the workers minus $14,400 for food minus $4,000 for gas and other expenses.  And just because I'm nice, let's say the run-down buildings cost $5,000 to maintain.  That's still a profit of $102,100 for only five weeks.  The owners of this company pocket as much as the 51 people actually working do.  Shameful.  And what we workers got was a lot of tripe about the rewards of working in beautiful locations that were really hell with so little downtime during the week and startlingly little supervision on the weekends that many of us participated in drugs to handle the thought of the coming week.  Hellish conditions do make kids "grow up."

They have an impressive safety record, maintain high standards and produce top notch work. Project sponsors are very satisfied with the results and parents love that their kids learn great life skills. The testimonials from the kids about what they learned about themselves, working together as a group and the outdoor experience are priceless. The staff is incredible as well.

Shirley Scott is the most honest loving human I know her, love of animals who are abused left in the street or need a home will always be take it in and find a home. Shirley accepts all humans and animals alike and wants all to feel of value. Her constant working abilities allow her to work many jobs and still her most important path is to rescue animals. Donations to her ranch is a blessing for now she will honor your wish  to help all in need. To know such a person shows me the love of Christ her kindness and compassion are seen in her eyes and the many animals she rescues.
Rocky Mountain Animal Rescue Ranch	69505		/users/profile/75950	jays	Board Member	5	02/16/2011	I've been with the ranch from the beginning and I've seen Shirley find homes for animals and foster many until homes open up.   She loves the animals and works hard to help any pets she can.  Her programs are pro-active and she tries to change with the changing times.   She hasn't found her land yet, but that doesn't stop her from working with people, pets and other organizations.   This money would mean some much to her.

I called everywhere for someone to help me with this cute critter. NOT one of the several places I called would help me. I contacted Shirley because she was my only hope. I called her and without hesitation she told me to bring him to her. I did, and I am so thankful for that! Shriley let me visit our little critter while she was finding him a safe habitat.  Thanks to the Rocky Mountain Animal Rescue Ranch this sweet innocent creature had a great chance at life and is now living within a raccoon refuge ;) Much thanks!
Rocky Mountain Animal Rescue Ranch	64726		/users/profile/70770	Cassie	Volunteer	5	02/08/2011	I have known Shirley for several years as an animal communicator and psychic.  She is the real deal.  Her love of animals is apparent.   Our expensive little cat wandered away a few years ago into the neighborhood, got beat up badly and was hiding in a neighbors garage, not responding to my calls.  (I had known something was wrong - he wasn't following me around as usual, so I called Shirley - she said he was very close, within a couple houses away, and could hear me calling.  So I looked more to the west of us and south of us, couldn't find him, called her again.  She said he was across the road to the east within a couple houses.  I looked to the northeast and then had to go to an appointment.  She came to the house and pointed straight east, said he was in a building/structure of some kind.  I came home, got the message from my disbelieving husband, walked over to my friends house and found him huddled in her garage exactly where Shirley said he would be. A friend of mine raises, trains, buys and sells horses.  Needless to say she is a healthy skeptic about anything.  Shirley went out to "read" one of her horses, then started mentioning little things about all the other animals at the place.  My friend was completely astonished at the accuracy of details only she could have known about the animals Shirley was speaking about. I have had a variety of conversations with Shirley about her rescue ranch, she has obviously done her homework.  I am excited about the prospect of helping her with the horses that come for help.  Since the slaughterhouses have been banned, more and more animals are being literally abandoned, starved, and neglected.  I love forward to helping with that aspect of the rescue ranch. If there was any constructive feedback to Shirley's plans, I would not hesitate to mention it as she is ALWAYS open to questions and suggestions.

I have known the founder since before the dream became a reality, and know her to be a dynamic, hard-working, knowledgeable and caring individual with great integrity, who always puts the welfare of these animals first. I am very selective about which non-profits I support, and believe this one to be worthy of all I put into it.
Rocky Mountain Animal Rescue Ranch	62446		/users/profile/68254	smilingso	Client Served	5	02/02/2011	The Rocky Mountain Animal Rescue Ranch is run with one thing in mind; the health and welfare of animals. The dedication shown to all animals is  endless.  I am finding the more I associate with this group, the more selfless acts I find they are doing.  I'm particularly impressed with the work done with the local Prison and how a greater meaning of life is provided to the dogs and prisoners alike.  Another observation is the lengths they go to find families for poor homeless dogs. It is a common site to see volunteers walking these dogs downtown to introduce them to families. Not just once in a while, every weekend!

As an equine massage therapist in Michigan, I am always eager to see her newsletter and read her special insights into animal behavior.  The information is original, and I often find myself forwarding her newsletter onto other animal professionals, including our local humane society.  Shirley Scott is always in my prayers for continued blessings.
Rocky Mountain Animal Rescue Ranch	62118		/users/profile/67901	Steve08	General Member of the Public	3	02/01/2011	The ROCKY MOUNTAIN ANIMAL RESCUE RANCH has the vision of providing food, shelter and safety to animals that have nowhere else to go. Of equal importance is the love and dignity that is given to them by the people involved with the mission. Animals basically have the same basic needs, both emotional and physical as people do. We have all heard stories of people lost at sea that are pushed ashore by dolphins, or dogs that refuse to leave the side of their masters long after they have passed away. Many animals feel a love and kinship to people that is oftentimes beyond our understanding. The workers and volunteers involved with the ranch feel an obligation, born out of love and understanding, to help the animals that have nowhere else to turn to. As you look into their eyes, filled with uncertainty and desperation, ask yourself what, if anything, you can do to assist this very worthy organization. Stephen Pfeiffer.

I totally trust her intentions regarding the Rocky Mountain Animal Rescue Ranch. This is truly her passion in life, and it is a large part of what her SOUL JOURNEY is all about- service to the human and animal worlds.
Rocky Mountain Animal Rescue Ranch	61552		/users/profile/67212	Noella W.	Donor	5	01/28/2011	I totally trust Shirley Scott and her project. Whenever I can put some money together, I send it.  But the tiny amount I can send is not nearly enough or as much as I would like to send. Shirley's work with animals and her understanding of them is at an entire different level from many rescue groups. If animal is in need of help physically or psychologically, Shirley will get it done. This may or may not mean something to some people, but in my will, Shirley will take my two cats if anything happens to me. I trust her that much when it comes to my fur-babies.

Rocky Mountain Animal Rescue Ranch	61463		/users/profile/67096	Ray Hansen	General Member of the Public	5	01/28/2011	I have been following the work of this fine organization for the last year or more.  I, myself have two rescue animals and I know how important it is for organizations like this to operate in our area.  Shirley Scott, RMRR Director,  is a dedicated individual who has a wonderful heart and she truly loves her rescue animals.   One specific function that I think is amazing is the Prison dog training program that Shirley created at the local Penitentiary.  I am a 28 year veteran officer and I know what it takes to even step inside the walls of this Maximum Security facility. Shirley does it week in and week out because the program means more dogs from the Humane Society will be adopted.  The program makes these dogs more attractive to potential homes.  Shirley receives absolutely no compensation for this work.  It is purely her love of animals that drives this program.  Additionally the RMRR has a terrific program which helps pay for pet food so that the elderly won't have to surrender their companions to the kennel because they can't afford the food.  So many pets are surrendered to the Humane Society, in this economy, because their owners can no longer afford to keep them.  The wonderful feeling that comes from helping a senior citizen retain their pets is terrific.  Donations are hard to come by sometimes so I hope that you will find the RMRR worthy of this prize.
Rocky Mountain Animal Rescue Ranch	61417		/users/profile/67041	Marla F.	Donor	4	01/27/2011	I am a supporter of the Rocky Mountain Animal Rescue Ranch. It is still young and needs more support. While animals are being rescued, trained and finding new homes, there is still a need for land and a proper facility. The founder, Shirley Scott, is a great trainer and animal communicator.  Shirley has several dog training programs in the works and most, if not all, have been adopted following the training. Many of these animals likely would not be adopted without this training.  Shirley's work with the prison dog program is done purely on a voluntary basis.  Shirley, with a little help from others, is making progress in forming this full functioning rescue ranch (non-profit) that has been her vison for a number of years.  Securing land is the next big step.  Monetary donations for the current programs, and for purchasing propery are greatly needed. (or a donation of land).

India Partners	287012	1	/users/profile/377084	Sarah_S2	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	A friend told me about his neighbor that was elderly and very sick.  She needed to reach the doctor but could not move and refused to call for emergency help.  So we linked our arms and carried her to the car.  We ended up taking her to two doctors and a clinic.  Since we were in her home we saw that she needed food and clothing.  So the next day we came back with some cooked food and extra groceries.  We spent time and straightened her house a bit, she was poor so did not have much.  We sat and talked with her, she reached out and held my hand and said I saved her life.  I laughed, no but you sure have brought a lot of happiness to me, seeing the smile on your face and the melody of your voice after the doctor did his wonder.  I learned that it is the poorest of the poor that suffer the greatest as they fall through the normal systems.  Unless we look out for those that have no immediate family and those that are in extreme poverty they will suffer greatly.  I support India Partners, http://indiapartners.org/,  because they work to transform the communities they work with.  Not just giving a handout, but developing the community so that the people will no longer suffer, and teaching as they go, so that the people they help will not always be looking for another handout but seeking to see how they can help others.  I think of giving to India Partners as a leveraged investment in happiness.  I know that not only will I improve the lives of others but I will far happier as a result.  My giving is a double blessing.http://indiapartners.org/

It is the Gods chosen organization that brings Salvation to the soul and hope to live. It stood for me and encouraged me to live for others.   2.      India Partners is a wonderful organization because it is seeking poor and weaker section of the society to make partnership and to bring them up in life and bring light and hope in them. It strives to bring hope, justice and compassion to the people of India to become rich. India partners works alongside broad group of indigenous Christian grass roots agencies in India focused on alleviate poverty and injustice.  3.      My experience with India Partners has been great and marvelous it is started with one mans obedience and sacrificial life for the work of the Lord to bring light to the people in darkness, hope in the life of hopeless and to bring voice in the voiceless people. My life and the Orphans Faith Home ministry is great example. The meaning of India partners shows that God has a special plan to partnering between rich and the poor, educated and uneducated, white and the black to show to the world that God cares all. The founder and the present CEO of India Partners Brent Hample is the one who was chosen by God   like a prophet to bring liberty and justice to the outcaste and Dalit people of India. Through his sacrificed life hundreds of Orphan children and thousands of poor people received spiritually and material help and became self sufficiency people. India Partners (Brent Hample) became God father and comforted fatherless and motherless children and turned  tears into joy.India partners served our people in various ways. Health1.  helped to establish health clinics , conducted medical camps like eye, polio, dental and general health check up centers. Mobile clinics for tribal areas and slums. Polio surgeries and rehabilitation.                      Education: India Partners helped Pre residential schools primary and high schools integrated education for polio, blind, slum , fisherman, tribal and stone quarry labor.   Monthly educational support: to children of farmers who committed suicides, children with HIV/ AIDs patients , children of life prisons, children of unwed mothers etc., Adult education centers :    Child Care : Milk distribution to malnoursh infants , mid day meal center for children in slums , medical help and clinics.  Community development : financial help , support to aged women and unwed women, marriage helps to  children of poor, medical help for poor patients , housing for weaker sections ,old aged homes , street children homes and Asha Jyothi Sewing centers for Teen age girls and young widows to make them self sufficient .  Emergency relief, distribution of reief material to victms of tsunami , fire , flood , famine , cyclones , housing helps for tsunami ,fire, flood and cyclone victims .  Spiritual work: Evangelism, bible college, gospel meetings ,  women retreats, youth camps , disciple ship training program and pastors conferences.  To my experience India partners is the number one Non-Profit Voluntary Organization that is working in India. In future I believe that India partner organization will grow one and only the top nonprofit organization and will have more dedicated and generous people will come to support such a great nonprofit organization  in India. I love India partners and I Love my country.  Thanking you Bishop.G.Parishudha Babu

I have a deep personal passion for the people of India and cannot thank India Partners enough for what they do.  Their work with the indigenous grassroots agencies in the country is amazing.  Currently India Partners supports several groups that support the people of India in a variety of capacities including human trafficking, orphanage, educational programs, disaster relief, AIDS education and more.  India Partners ability to live missionally both through the way they run their fiscal business and the way the staff executes their vision is inspiring.

I became very impressed with the passion and professional being of those individuals actually on the ground in the locations India Partners assists.  In my opinion those India Partners serve in India are very appreciative of the help we are able to lend.  I love helping them gain a potentially better life and showing them the love of Christ.
India Partners	139279	1	/users/profile/185383	Linda150	Donor	5	11/14/2012	I have 2 adult daughters adopted from India as babies.  I knew then what their lives most likely would have been if their moms had not bucked the caste system and got them away from a life of  poverty, hunger and prostitution.  My younger daughter was able to travel with India partners Sept 2011 and was able to travel across southern India. She was able to see, hear, smell and experience the country of her birth as well as see what she had escaped from. Her ability to be able to help other kids in what most likely would have been her situation, changed her life. No one should have to live that kind of life or should I say existence, let alone a child. She most likely was an untouchable, she most likely was the child of a prostitute, she was suffering from malnutrition but an organization like India Partners then, gave her a chance and that is what she and we want for every child. A chance, to experience food, shelter, protection, school, health care and most importantly their value as a unique human being. India Partners puts their money and heart where their mouth is, saving and changing lives. We will be life time partners.

India Partners	138988		/users/profile/185080	Mcclintock18	Volunteer	5	11/14/2012	India Partners exists to serve and they do so incredibly well. They function with great integrity and purpose. I'm so excited and thankful for the work they are doing. This is a trustworthy, hard working and powerful non-profit!
India Partners	138606	1	/users/profile/184678	Benarjee	Client Served	4	11/13/2012	1. I love India Partners because their continuel sacrifice on our behalf is model for us to follow as we serve the  needs of the community. You might think it works the other way. But leadership starts at the top and our love for them is a response of their love for us.  2. India Partners is wonderful organization because the consistently demonstrate that they value us as Partners and the love that is  demonstrated through children support shows that they value the children as well. 3. My experience with India Partners has been great because they have consistently shown respect for us as Partners. They recognize that ours is a difficult task and yet the differences that occur become opportunities to work together to advance the work that we are doing together as India Partners.
India Partners	135800		/users/profile/181687	PolyJim	Donor	5	11/08/2012	I've had the privilege of not only donating but also witnessing first hand in India just how the funds are utilized.  India Partners is a very efficient organization that makes sure any donation is most effectively applied to those most in need.  The individuals working in Eugene, Oregon live sacrifically ensuring that every possible dollar gets to their partners in India.  Their partners in India are simply wonderful in their care for some of the world's forgotton people who are living in hopeless circumstances.

For the last 2 decades they have stood with me and slowly Malkangiri - the southernmost and most backward province of Odisha - India, is being transformed. Through  IP funding literacy rate has come from 0% to 40 %. Whopping cough is reduced from 40% to 5%.. Installing Tuble wells in 540 villages and reduced the water born diseases to almost nil. 
Mercy Corps	115718	14	/users/profile/157597	emoomey,	Volunteer	5	06/19/2012	As someone who has worked in international development, there are two things I particularly appreciate about Mercy Corps:                           1. Solutions are market driven --> Mercy Corps identifies community leaders and works with them to tackle community problems where Mercy Corps has additional expertise that can be useful in the projects.                                                                                                                  2. Mercy Corps recognizes that there are relevant issues that they have expertise in locally as well, and has invested money in the Mercy Corps Action Center and Mercy Corps NW to address these issues. The Mercy Corps Action Center does a fantastic job of engaging and educating the public about a variety of global issues, including things that Mercy Corps addresses every day.  Mercy Corps NW addresses many economic issues close to home, including business education, connecting potential small business owners to capital and mentoring, and providing entrepreneurial education to people who have been incarcerated in the past and may have a difficult time finding employment in alternative areas.
Mercy Corps	319744		/users/profile/411565	angelagg	Donor	5	12/02/2016	They do great work all over the world but what they've been doing in Syria the past 4 - 5 years during the civil war, it's really impressive. 
Mercy Corps	311934		/users/profile/403288	RobertChristens	Professional with expertise in this field	2	10/19/2016	Mercy Corps and other humanitarian groups are great but honestly the question is why is the US not doing more? Instead of others having to donate to Mercy Corps for resources why can't the government being paying for supplies? The silence of the white house on this is unacceptable. They should and could be doing more.
Mercy Corps	306272	4	/users/profile/397551	JerryDenver	Donor	1	09/23/2016	I consider myself a generous person and attempt to distribute donations to viable NPO's, I made the mistake of making a couple to Mercy Corp, and in the year since,  have received at list 100 calls asking for more money. They do not QUIT! I've screamed at them to take me off their donor list, I've sent emails asking for the same, but to no avail, they continue to call daily.Charity my butt! I cannot stand this organization, and save yourself a bunch of heartache and stress and give elsewhere. 
Mercy Corps	265668	9	/users/profile/354407	sanitycruzer	Donor	5	10/20/2015	I have been a donor to Mercy Corps for many years now.  I donate to Mercy Corps because they are at "ground zero" shortly after natural and human created catastrophes occur, helping those in immediate need of food, shelter and more.  I give to Mercy Corp because of the work they do for those who are suffering to no fault of their own.  They deal with victims of disasters who would otherwise have virtually nothing to eat and nowhere to live without the help of organizations such as Mercy Corp.  Hunger is America is not getting what you want to eat.  Hunger through other parts of the world are having nothing to eat.  When you are truly hungry, you take what you can get to eat.  When you are not truly hungry (i.e. in the USA), you might tell an aid worker, "Oh, I don't like that."  I give my money to those who are truly in need, not to those who just aren't getting what they want.
Mercy Corps	194952	6	/users/profile/254830	David218	Client Served	1	02/28/2014	What an insulting group of Americans. Mercy Corps Northwest does not serve Ex-Military service members that are disabled and live in poverty. I have gotten the run around 3 times from this group. Today was the 3rd time that I put in a request for a small business loan and was told " I am sorry but I can't talk anymore because I have someone else to call. Bye" This is who represents the SBA in Washington State? This is a bad choice to choose this SBA office.
Mercy Corps	183052	19	/users/profile/239954	gaiko	Professional with expertise in this field	3	10/28/2013	For the record, I worked for MC. I will say that MC is better than the majority of NGOs I've worked for in the past, and will also say ain't-nobody-getting-rich-from-working-for-MC. I'd also say MC's overhead is pretty darn low considering how comprehensive its transparency policies and audits etc are (read PITA for employees, good for donors i guess). I still find that MC is too much of a slave to "just keeping the donors happy" which doesn't always mean making real impact HOWEVER if you are going to give to an NGO it is certainly one of the better ones. Its a bit ironic that many that I see that are phenomenal at visibility are the more mediocre (on the ground). Lastly I noticed the guidestar rating 3 star is "meets expectations" and MC meets my (fairly low) expectations, but I gotta say after working in the sector for 10+ years, no one has exceed my expectations (ie done what they say they have done).
Mercy Corps	147369	6	/users/profile/194730	Donna Marie	Donor	5	12/28/2012	I wonder why Mercy Corps is not mentioned on broadcasts "if you wish to help ..." as opposed to Red Cross or United Way when so much of the contributions they receive go to people who run them.  
Mercy Corps	114327	9	/users/profile/155571	Al Anvil	Professional with expertise in this field	2	06/08/2012	Mercy Corps is extremely donor-driven, and its priority is to get grants, even if they don't match its strategic priorities. Serious management issues and low performance in country offices are ignored by HQ management, like in the case of Sudan/South Sudan: http://www.usaid.gov/oig/public/fy12rpts/4-668-12-009-p.pdf
Mercy Corps	104216	11	/users/profile/139725	Mary Latvis	General Member of the Public	1	01/23/2012	My elderly mother received 2 letters from Mercy Corps stating that they "spoke with her by phone" and that she agreed to make a $100 gift.Not only is this a complete fabrication, it greatly disturbed me since my mother had a stroke and has been in a nursing home,  unable to speak, for over 18 months.

Mercy Corps	103076	6	/users/profile/108457	barbara fann	General Member of the Public	2	01/09/2012	I very much admire the fact that this charity, in addition to its other merciful work,  offers microloans to US fledgling businesses, such as the one described in this article:    http://www.newsregister.com/article?articleTitle=acupuncturist+gets+start+with+mercy+corps%27+help--1324229737--2268--       America would be so much the better if these small loans were expanded to include small businesses in all the 50 states and NOT just those local to the corporate office in Oregon.    Right now so many small businesses in America are foundering.   SO MANY right here in OUR country are losing the battle for survival.   Without question,the plight of so many worldwide is  tragic,  I DO believe, however, given the current economic status of small business owners here in the US, in the case of MICRO-BUSINESS LOANS,  that charity should also be given at home - all across America.  I think of my niece and her husband and their  two small children, the younger of which is autistic and the elder still struggling with physical disabilities resultant from a premature birth They have worked so long and hard for 6 years to establish themselves and now struggle desperately to stay afloat ,feed  clothe and provide medical care for their family,  as they eke out a living and use every ounce of creativity to seek new alternative sources of revenue as they wait for the core industry for their business - the stagnant construction industry-- to rebound.  These young people did so much to help the community in ay way they could in donations, community contributions and so forth during their busiest years. Now they struggle day to day with no help for the weary.  I hope this agency will think on these things. 
Mercy Corps	98023	3	/users/profile/115982	Barbara_Itis	Donor	3	09/23/2011	I appreciate all that this charity does -- especially in times of need.  I hope you will support them too.
Mercy Corps	94198	7	/users/profile/108845	Debra S.	General Member of the Public	4	07/22/2011	Thankfully, there is Charity Navigator! Based on the Charity Navigator reviews, I am designating Mercy Corps as my charity through SurveyMonkey's reviewer board. I am sorry to say that I have never heard of Mercy Corps but have been a supporter of Samaratin's Purse which has a lower score. I will be contacting them to learn more. I only wish that their ceo didn't need such a high salary.
Mercy Corps	92257	7	/users/profile/105745	Linda H.	Donor	5	06/27/2011	I have been a Mercy Corps donor for about 10 years.  I know several of the staff and am frankly blown away by their work, their professionalism and their realistic approaches to development work.  Mercy Corps is frankly state of the art.  Most of the staff are nationals in the many countries where MC works.  There is a continuous evaluation of effectiveness and a strong desire to use resources carefully.  Women's health programs, education programs, community development -- each program is tailored to the needs of the community involved.  There is no hierarchical sense that all communities need X or Y; instead there is a process to help communities set their own direction.  In that process, communities also learn civil society techniques and objectives.   When there is a natural disaster, Mercy Corps is already on the ground and ensures that its work does not duplicate what other agencies are doing, instead focusing on neglected areas of need.  One of these is helping children deal with trauma. Mercy Corps deserves your donation, whatever you decide to give.  There are other wonderful organizations out there but there are also charlatans that are more concerned with fund-raising than with services.  Do careful research.  When you do, Mercy Corps will be at the top of your list.
Mercy Corps	92178	1	/users/profile/105633	Gordo33	Volunteer	5	06/26/2011	I enjoy raising money for Mercy Corps through producing compelling fund-raising events that seek to increase awareness and create exceptional value for people who are compelled to donate due to the compelling nature of the cause and the successful execution of the event itself.
Mercy Corps	90798	11	/users/profile/103689	TinyDancer84	Donor	3	06/14/2011	I wish I could give this charity 5 stars because they do a lot of good things. What I look for in a charity is the mission to create sustainability and independence in the people it helps instead of creating dependency while also helping with disaster relief. The fact that the higher ups make so much money is disheartening. I understand that the CEOs and presidents need to be paid but think of the good that could be done with the extra money if they weren't paid so much. I want to know that my donations are truly helping the people I intend to help and not going toward the CEO's summer villa. Perhaps the CEO would do well to read the story of the man whose words are being used with this charity. Gandhi gave up the life of affluence and chose one of poverty. I'm not saying that the CEO needs to become impoverished but nearly $300,000 is ridiculous.
Mercy Corps	89628		/users/profile/101955	Kelly L.	Donor	4	06/04/2011	update 06/06/2011Well, they got back sooner than I imagined (first workday).I guess the customer service is good, though not up to date (cause it's not a click of a button thing).anyhow, I would recommend this charity after they have the online account for monthly donors.--------------------------------------------------------------------Can't unsubscribe my auto monthly donation online.I've signed up for the auto monthly donation for a while now, times are tough and I want to cancel it.It's unpleasant to find out that I can't find a way to unsubscribe my auto donation.  I don't even have an account.I checked my email box, they didn't even send me a confirmation for the subscription, nor an account.I did get a confirmation for my one time donation the other time, but again, no account. Isn't it standard to give your customer an account when they paid for something? Especially when you are automatically taking money from them each month.It seems like they are trying to make it hard for people to unsubscribe.I sent them an message about unsubscribing, hopefully they get back soon. I do not recommend this charity.
Mercy Corps	85982		/users/profile/96097	Cyndy Lane	Volunteer	5	04/16/2011	Mercy Corps is the first charity my husband and I donate to in the event of any global crisis or disaster. They are usually on the ground before any other agencies, probably because they are already "in country". We became aware of Mercy Corps because they are based in Portland, Oregon and have a well-deserved reputation for excellent management paired with amazing empathy. Their staff is very helpful in supplying materials to aid in Alternative Gift Fairs, promptly and at no charge. Their gift cards for 2010 were distinctive, conveying their messages of hope with colorful pictures & catchy wording.

Portland Rescue Mission Ministries, Inc.	318071		/users/profile/409212	JuriHobbs123	Professional with expertise in this field	4	11/02/2016	I've been working for Portland Rescue Mission's New life Ministry program for roughly a year.  This is the third non-profit that I've been employed with in the last 12 years.  Few people realize the degree to which non-profit's impact their city.  The Portland Rescue Mission has been doing some heavy lifting including providing shelter, and two residential programs for men and women struggling with addiction.  The Portland Rescue Mission is an iconic institution that has served the city of Portland for decades and has a reputation for delivering volumes of grace to the untouchable elements of our city.  There are few organizations that have so closely aligned themselves with the teaching of Christ, and the ethic (or Spirit) that has brought "Goodwill to all mankind" not merely in word but in deed.
Portland Rescue Mission Ministries, Inc.	318015		/users/profile/409155	Angelique H.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/01/2016	My name is Angelique Hall, I'm a Community Life Specialist at Shepherd's Door. When I began working for The Portland Mission over a year ago I met a beautiful woman who came to  Shepherd's Door in deep depression for help. She recently suffered the suicide of her father and was fighting thoughts of suicide herself. I'd never met a woman so broken and hopeless, truthfully I feared there was no hope for her. Today she has graduated from the program and is a completely transformed person from the woman I first met! She went from a hopeless and depressed woman to a woman full of the life! After she left the program we kept in contact, she is a constant reminder of the power God has to transform even the darkest of situations. It's a tremendous blessing to work for a program that helps women receive the tools they need to recover and live a hopeful and successful life!
Portland Rescue Mission Ministries, Inc.	313881		/users/profile/405235	EFowler	Professional with expertise in this field	4	10/24/2016	I have seen people's lives radically transformed through the programs and the caring staff at Portland Rescue Mission.  I have worked here for 5 years and believe in the heart of this Mission to give hope and restore life. The staff are people of compassion and integrity. They have great wisdom and are willing to challenge men and women to take the next step forward.  This is an incredible place to volunteer at or work for. Portland Rescue Mission recently was named one of the "Best Christian Workplaces 2016"!

Portland Rescue Mission Ministries, Inc.	264219	5	/users/profile/352924	Writer	General Member of the Public	2	10/15/2015	Portland Rescue Mission has fallen. They are controlling and manipulative. Yes they have helped a lot of people. But they have also traumatized people and ruined their experience of trying to better their lives. There's dozens of unheard stories that ended badly due to the organization's misuse of power. One day the true stories will come out. And I can only hope they will ignite a positive change. Those who know the truth choose to remain silent for reasons unknown to me. Shepherds Door staff is constantly over turning, people are being kicked out without legitimate explanations, and mothers are forced to pay 50% off all income because, and I quote "donors pay for the women only, not the children's expenses" says Christine Ourada the director of Shepherds Door. When Eric Bauer was confronted on unethical conduct toward a resident his response was, this is a free program what do you expect?. They are refunded money from the USDA program for the trays of breakfast lunch and dinner that they serve to the kids who live there, but they continue to serve food that's well past it's expectation date that they get from a food bank. However for a staff meeting held weekly they buy fresh food that the residents are not allowed to have. Their legal advocacy department is invasive and forceful. If you do not sign what they want, such as ROI for bank accounts they kick you out and give you 5 minutes to get your things and leave. HIPPA laws have  allegedly been violated, and human rights have been blatantly disregarded. Unfortunately being a non-profit they can make their own rules, and by calling themselves a Church they are exempt from so many legal guidelines. They preach the word of God, but they do not show it. I'm sure it hasn't always been this way, but the people running Shepherds Door now have turned it into a joke, and no one is doing anything about it. Plenty of staff members quit because they see the wrong that's being done by Kathleen Bradley, Christine Ourada, and Lisa Zisa. The staff turnover in that place is enormous to say the least, and there's a huge reason why. I just wish the people who did leave would speak up, and help the women who Portland Rescue Mission are mistreating at Shepherds Door. It's not right, it's not ethical, and it's not Christian.

No big deal, until I have to wait another week for hoses to arrive.   Then, they ordered the wrong hose.   So another week.   That's 3 weeks I need to wait for a car that I've paid for and am insuring.   Worst car buying expirence ever.   I would recommend this to an enemy I'm that disappointed.

I would like everyone to know that I am retracting my earlier rating. I was very upset at the time and spoke before I thought. I should of spoken with someone at the Portland Rescue Mission before I spouted off. I was contacted by a very nice gentleman from the Mission, who wanted to make things right. Which they have done. We came to an agreement that has solved the problem.  I would like to say that the people that I have spoken to have acted in a very Christian way. I do believe that this is a good charity. They are out there to help people that need it the most. I also beleive that this incident was not a typical problem that they or the consumer run into very often or at all. A special Thank You to Dick Osborne.
Portland Rescue Mission Ministries, Inc.	118537	2	/users/profile/161211	Grumpy	General Member of the Public	1	07/16/2012	My husband and I bought a car for our Granddaughter through Portland Rescue Mission. I has only been 2 month and the car is no longer driveable. All of the pisstons are shot. We are told the the whole motor will need to be replaced. We spent $1200.00 on a lemon. Thiere asking price was $1500.00. We were under the impression that this car had been completely gone through. Twice the brake light switch was stuck to the on position and the last time the part had to be replced. I know this was a used car, but a person would think that buying a car from a place that says the car was gone through would have it last more then 2 months.  I just I had more faith in a place that says they are a Christian organization and want to help people.   
Portland Rescue Mission Ministries, Inc.	86735	6	/users/profile/97194	Jim A.	Volunteer	5	04/22/2011	Portland Rescue Mission has been one of my most productive and rewarding volunteer experiences. I sense deeply the love and skill that go into caring for children and families and others who are in distress. Those who provide the services are highly motivated  by a deep sense of Christian duty and service that helps them overcome any barriers that would normally separate them from those they serve. I have seldom seen the kind of sacrificial service provided by staff and volunteers at Portland Rescue Mission.

Portland Rescue Mission Ministries, Inc.	86493	4	/users/profile/96839	Lissa R.	Volunteer	5	04/20/2011	I have volunteered with Shepherd's Door, the women and children's recovery program at Portland Rescue Mission for many years.  Over the years, I have seen many women graduate from the program, which addresses all aspects of recovery - from physical to emotional to spiritual.  The program isn't rules based.  Instead the staff and volunteers help teach the women and their children, through a grace and love filled approach, how to make the best choices to heal their families and build their futures.  This approach seems to make the difference since so many of the women are successful at maintaining their sobriety and using their newfound life and job skills after graduation.  It has been a privilege to be a small part of this work.
Portland Rescue Mission Ministries, Inc.	82425	5	/users/profile/90857	HelenHarris	Client Served	5	03/17/2011	Portland Resue Mission Save My Lfe. Four years ago I came to Portland Rescue Mission from S. California where I was homeless for weeks. I never dreamed after 17 years of marriage,3 beautiful children and a life,for years,where I was active in my community and highly involved with my children and every aspect of their lives through volunteer work,which I simple loved,at the public schools and involved in my church,that anyone,not just me,could ever find themselves where I was.There I was,defeated by the lies,that my life had spun so far out of control that there just was no other way to go except down,and down I went,to a point where I hated everything about me and I was  just done.I gave up,I shut down emotionally and eventually stopped talking all together.I would duck out in allys or just keep walking,I was barefoot with a pair of jeans and a t-shirt on.I was scorched by the elements and I just did not care.Drugs and alcohol had robbed me of me,ruined my reputation,I just was so lost and humiliated I ccouldn't stand myself.However God had different plans.It was through random acts of kindness and love from perfect strangers that sustained me even once protected me from physical harm.Not that I cared,I thank God someone elce did.I finally was taken to the County Mental Institution,it was there the healing began. I still was not talking therefore I went by the name Jane Doe.I laid in bed day in and day out.There was a young lady who would come in my room and say out loud "I LOVE YOU JANE DOE!"She would even at times jump on me and hug me tight.In time I finally spoke,I got up,I was mad as heck at myself still but I said to the nurse stationed outside my door,'I have a phone call I need to make.'Well with that,she jumps up and says,'Jane Doe speaks." The whole place got happy and here I am.     As I reflect,as I so often do,I see Gods hand everywher in my life,at every turn and how he sicked the hounds of heaven on me even though I gave up on Him,He never gave up on me.  Through a chain of events,on October 30,2007,I had my interview with Shepheards Door and my tour.Afterwards I was told I could move in anytime,with that I JUMPED FOR JOY!! Two days later I moved in.For 7 months that in Helen' Perfect World,all of you and the rest of the world,could experience for yourselves.This IS 'LIFE TRANSFORMATION." What i left there with are tools that no-one or nothing can take away from me.   Right now,I am going through some difficult times,that's ok today.I have been blessed to mentor young people and reach out to the homeless in ways that only I know how to do.Yes,I have been there.Yes,I have done that,and Yes I do have the t-shirt.Nothing shocks me anymore.If there's one thing I ahve learned,it is that I have alot to learn. I freely give what was so freely givin to me and that is non-contitional love.I love to share my story of victory,and I love to hears others stories,and I do and it is hard.It's hard to walk away knowing what I know,I feel a bond between each and every person I have encountered and that is alot.It humbles me,inspires me,drives me and at time,it breaks me.I share the hope of Portland Rescue Mission all the time,planting seeds of hope is the least I can do.Portland Rescue Mission is leaps and bounds above the rest as far as I can see anyways,and I look.This is my life,and I dream of the day when homlessness comes to an end,you CAN help that happen.How/ Just get the 'Good Word" out about Portland Rescue Mission.The reality is this.Homelessness today is 'epidemic' my friends.It simply would not be such a "problem' if people would just "embrace" that fact and 'STOP" argueing about it.I find myself defending homelessness more and more at the most im-proptue moments.God has equiped me for whatever He has palnned for me and Portland Rescue Mission was definately my 'Training Ground.' Now,you may think your nobody special,I know the feeling,I want to remind you,as I often have to remind myself and that is this...There is no sin to great and it is never to late,you have not gone to far,You are beautifully and wonderfully made.God has a plan,this is part of it.God goes with me and you where-ever we may go.God loves you and me the same way in spite of ourselves.Today I greet the day with ,'Thank you God for this day and for bringing me with it,I thank you in advance that you have prepared the way for me today that no matter what happens I don't have to drink or drug over it.PRAISE GOD!!" Last,but surely not least,in the interest of time,I could go on,I'm 52 years young and so much has happened.There's alot that hasn't  happened to me to that has happened to countless other's.It is vital for people to be able to tell thier story without being ashamed.I know I can't save the world,there has to be a bigger picture.I just meet folks where they are at,I listen,I hug,smile,I really am glad to see them,my heart hurts for them,the lost and the forgotten.There's alot of hope out there however we need more.Share the Hope.There is hope and there is a place that will help and that is Portaland Rescue Mission.They saved this ship wrecked life and I am so very gateful.Thank You for taking the time to read this.I pray you would take it to heart and share the love.I,like other's, I am always available to speak and to be of encouragement.It's nothing short of a miracle that I am alive,just goes to show God is in the miracle buisness,I'm living proof.Blessings and Much Love,Helen J. Harris

Portland Rescue Mission's decision to not partner with the Dec. 2010 "Queer Quistmas" was a sponsorship decision, not a decision to decline the much-needed and useful contribution of blankets and winter outerwear.  We were willing to accept the donations, but the organizer chose to direct the gifts elsewhere (after taking his story to both TV and web). Fortunately, the donated coats still benefited the homeless people of the community who we serve everyday at Portland Rescue Mission.  Our decision to decline the sponsorship was primarily based on the urgency of a decision (it was less than 3 weeks away) and our inability to provide all the benefits that the organizer/event would require.  We regret the confusion that this issue has created in our local community and the greater community of LGBT concerns. 
Portland Rescue Mission Ministries, Inc.	58493		/users/profile/62300	Carrie M.	General Member of the Public	1	12/05/2010	It's unfortunate the Portland Rescue Mission would turn down a hefty donation because it came from the LGBT community.  Read this article before donating to this organization: http://chn.ge/gMCKeQ
Portland Rescue Mission Ministries, Inc.	39608	1	/users/profile/40554	lmorgan	Donor	5	05/20/2010	This the best organization I know of!  The PRM truly returns to the God given human life "what the locust have eaten".  I only pray that I could live closer so I could volunteer.  The monies I donate I could not give to better organization.  Many, many continued blessings and successes to your organization.
Portland Rescue Mission Ministries, Inc.	39591	1	/users/profile/40537	victoria3	Donor	5	05/20/2010	I learned about this organization back in 2000 when we went to an event at the Portland Expo center around Christmas. I loved that they were a Christian Organization and have been making donations every year since. We give as much as we can, when we can. They really help a lot of people out in all aspects of their lives and I pray that they will continue to gain more donations and support so that they can reach out to even more people in need. God bless all who give to The Portland Rescue Mission.
Portland Rescue Mission Ministries, Inc.	39586	2	/users/profile/40532	jenna5	Volunteer	5	05/19/2010	I love what this organization stands for, and believe in the work they are doing in the lives of men and women.  What I love even more, is the way my life changes, after every interaction with this organization and the people they serve.  When you volunteer, you expect to help someone else.  What ends up happening, is you experience change in your own life, and come away feeling blessed.  I am humbled to be able to serve these people who live a life that is so different than mine.  I look forward all month to helping serve dinner on the last Friday of the month.  I have been enough times that I am starting to recognize people, and get to know them.  I feel like serving them is a small thing, compared to the difficulties they experience on a daily basis.  I am so grateful for the opportunity to serve, and I really enjoy the staff and other volunteers at the Mission as well.  Definitely a worthy place to donate your time and money!
Potluck in the Park	145071	1	/users/profile/191631	staba	Volunteer	5	11/30/2012	I was looking for a non-profit organization to volunteer with for quite a few months and then I finally came across Potluck in the Park. I was so excited to volunteer and have never been happier with the results from a volunteer project! The leaders of the project were so kind and helpful-- and they made sure every single person had a job to do and felt needed. I loved serving those who came out the OBryant Square for a meal and it was so lovely chatting with these gracious people. It was a great opportunity to help those less fortunate than myself and I will be back again soon to participate! Thank you for the wonderful opportunity! 
Potluck in the Park	144745	1	/users/profile/191289	Susib	Volunteer	5	11/30/2012	I have been very fortunate to be associated with Potluck in the Park as a volunteer for a number of years.  This incredible all-volunteer organization has fed those who need a meal every Sunday for 21 years.  Additionally, a Christmas dinner is served each year on Christmas Day.  Our guests do not have to 'prove' they are in need, they just have to show up.  And, every one of them is treated with dignity and caring.  It is a privilege to be able to serve our guests who frequently verbalize their gratitude or thank us for 'giving up our time'.  Wow!  They apparently don't realize that I probably get more from them than I am able to give back.  
Potluck in the Park	144731	1	/users/profile/191274	Jasmine J.	Volunteer	5	11/30/2012	I have volunteered with Potluck for a little over a month now and it has greatly impacted my life. I feel more connected and invested in my community than ever before; I feel energized and inspired by the sheer initiative of all of the supporters; and I personally encourage anyone with a free Sunday afternoon to come down and check us out. It's a great thing when a diverse crowd of people can come together and sit down for a great meal!   
Potluck in the Park	144703		/users/profile/191248	Kelsey C	Volunteer	5	11/30/2012	I was introduced to Potluck in the Park by a friend of mine and ever since, it has been a great opportunity to help people in need. It is really important for me to be able to give back to my community and Potluck in the Park has been an excellent way for me to do so. Im fairly shy so having to interact with multiple people has helped open me up when talking to people I've never met before. The people we serve, the people who run the organization, and the other volunteers are wonderful to work with.
Potluck in the Park	144678		/users/profile/191223	ssswimmer	Volunteer	5	11/29/2012	The people there were very nice and coordinated. While serving everyone was very polite and it was a very efficient system! I had a lot of fun.
Potluck in the Park	144521		/users/profile/191056	Coco2910	Volunteer	5	11/29/2012	Potluck in the Park is a fantastic opportunity for the young and old interested in volunteering and getting to know the city a bit better. I really felt they put my time to use while still making a difference in people's lives. I received numerous thank yous, which further proves how gracious and welcoming this project and community is. I highly recommend this program and i am proud to live in a city where this is possible. 
Potluck in the Park	144519		/users/profile/191054	Emma K. Weinmann	Volunteer	5	11/29/2012	It was my first time volunteering with Potluck in the Park and I was a little nervous going into a new situation like that. But the people running it were awesome! They explained to me and the other volunteers what they needed us to do and why we were so important to the process. It was obvious that everyone who put this together really cared about the people they were helping, it was really inspirational. This was one man in charge, who's name i forget, would stop and chat with all the different people lining up to get food. He would call them each by their first name and ask how they were doing, it was wonderful to see such an honest display of kindness. I had an amazing experience with Potluck in the Park and would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to volunteer and actually help make a difference.
Potluck in the Park	144431	1	/users/profile/190966	Douglas A.	Volunteer	5	11/29/2012	I first volunteered when a friend suggested that I might like to see what conditions were like in a mid sized American city (I am a European ex pat.) I went along and was amazed at the number of hungry and or homeless folk who seemed to just appear on the steps at O'Bryant Sq in downtown Portland Oregon. Now I have been a volunteer for a while, currently serving as a liaison / volunteer co-ordinator between Potluck and a non profit from whom we draw many of our 60 volunteers, who serve as many as 850 hungry folk a week,  and come to see what a difference a simple wholesome meal makes to those with food and housing insecurity. I firmly believe that food is a human right, and hunger a human wrong. Every week folk make an effort to right this wrong, to give aid in a fashion which prsereves the dignity of our guests whilst providing a model of civic engagement for our hardy volunteers. I cannot imagine a Sunday afternoon spent anywhere other than Potluck in the Park, watching folk care about each other a little more.
Potluck in the Park	144413		/users/profile/190949	Joshua F.	Volunteer	5	11/29/2012	I have been consistently volunteering with Potluck in the Park for almost 2 years now. Its the first time I have engaged for such a long time. I come back week after week because of the compassion the other volunteers show to the less fortunate and sense of community that permeates the organization. On a deep emotional level, feeding hungry people makes me feel better about an incredibly complicated and difficult problem. There have been numerous times when I knew, even if in a small way, I touched another persons life. To feel a real commitment to the well being of people in difficult circumstances is why I continue to dedicate my time and efforts to this Great Nonprofit.
Potluck in the Park	144409		/users/profile/190945	ltucker	Volunteer	5	11/29/2012	After just having moved to Portland, OR to attend one of the Universities here, one of my biggest desires was to find community. Through Portland Community College I found out about this WONDERFUL volunteer opportunity with Potluck in the Park every Sunday and I continued to go every single week for months and months. It gave me the chance to meet loving people, help out with the food and planning, and have something to look forward to every Sunday. As I'm working 5 days a week now, it's harder for me to go each week but whenever I get the time to go, there's not a second thought. I've recommended this to many other people and would recommend it to anyone who wants to help others and meet new friends of all different ages.
Potluck in the Park	144408		/users/profile/190944	AdamPiP	Volunteer	5	11/29/2012	I've been volunteering for 4 months and it has been a fantastic experience. Every Sunday, our guests come in and are fed a warm meal, and many of them come to me to thank me for the work I do to help them out. It's heartwarming and touching. The entire all-volunteer community is full of amazing people who give their all every Sunday. I'm amazed at their dedication and I see the results of their work in the eyes and hear it in the words of our guests. Working for Potluck in the Park has been one of the best experiences of my life.
Potluck in the Park	144012		/users/profile/190506	Potluck	Volunteer	5	11/28/2012	I have been volunteering for Potluck in the Park for a couple of years now.  I work, primarily, with the kitchen staff and can't say enough about what a wonderful experience it is!!  The volunteers for the kitchen staff come in every Sunday, quite a few regulars, and some occasionally, to share the experience. It ranges from young to older...a few Sundays ago we had 9 kids sharing their time to feed the needy!  It sometimes amazes us to understand how it all comes together :) and it always does...there are volunteers who prep the food on Thursdays, garner food from various sources around the area, set up the park, coordinate fund raisers...I've heard it called the miracle of Potluck...At the kitchen, we help get the food out to the park to feed anywhere from 400-800 guests, each Sunday, depending on which weekend of the month it is...I love the camaraderie.  We laugh and play as we work to provide casseroles, fresh fruit salad (Julie's specialty she does not compromise and lovingly cuts every chunk by hand from what we garner from the food banks),  baked chicken, sandwiches, milk, fruit, bread.  Our goal is to provide a hot home cooked meal to those in need.  At 21 plus years Potluck is one of the most rewarding ways for me to reach out to those less fortunate, and it's my honor to be a part of it! 
Potluck in the Park	143473		/users/profile/189932	John Pigott	Board Member	5	11/27/2012	Potluck in the Park has been feeding those in need in Portland, Oregon for 21 years. Every Sunday (without fail) for each of those 21 years our community has known that whatever is going on in their lives a hot meal can be found at O'Bryant Square park. This amazing group of volunteers is a true grassroots organization that continues, rain or shine, to help combat food insecurity in our city. As a Board member I get to see all the behind the scenes efforts that go into the acquisition of food, its preparation, delivery, service, clean up, and the constant fund raising required to keep up with growing demand. It is a huge undertaking that only works because of the incredible commitment put forth by our volunteers. I started volunteering 12 years ago when a friend brought me along to the park one Sunday. I never left. The miracle is that it continues to happen each and every week as new people, young and old, discover the joy  of helping our guests enjoy a good hot meal. This is how positive change comes to the lives of both the givers and the receivers in the Potluck community. Please come and see. All are welcomed. 
Potluck in the Park	142435		/users/profile/19662	donscotti	Volunteer	5	11/25/2012	I am most touched when families with children come through the line for a free meal. PIP serves a very broad community of people in need, seniors, veterans, families. As an individual, I can do so little, but teamed with Potluck, I feel I can make a difference.
Potluck in the Park	142343		/users/profile/5918	Claresi	Volunteer	5	11/24/2012	Potluck in the Park believes that a hot meal can do amazing things for a person; that food is a human right and hunger is a human wrong.   Their no barriers, no bureaucracy approach to feeding anyone in need is inspirational.  The Potluck "experience" must be seen to be believed, come on down to O'Bryant Square Park any Sunday at 3 pm and see what caring citizens can do to enrich their community. 
Potluck in the Park	142103		/users/profile/188522	oswald	Board Member	5	11/22/2012	I enjoy serving on the board and bringing my accounting skills to this great organization. It amazes me we will serve close to 27,000 meals this year, never run out of food and never turn anyone away. Our limited financial resources are spread so thin, however we seem to continue to fulfill our mission for the past 21+ years!
Potluck in the Park	142040		/users/profile/188462	Steve DeAngelo	Board Member	5	11/22/2012	My company has supported Potluck in the Park for over 20 years. As a caterer, feeding those less fortunate is a natural extension of giving back to the community. We donate time, resources, food and money to an organization that continues to see the need increase annually. Hunger is a global problem that continually seems to increase. I am proud to be aligned with an organization that helps these people weekly. Learn more at www.potluckinthepark.org

They are located at 180 W Idaho, Ontario, Oregon, 97914. The smiles are great and the is coffee hot with no cost... Good folks with a big heart. The volunteers are super! Stop in and say Hi !
Veteran Advocates Of Ore - Ida	269842	2	/users/profile/358576	Writer	Client Served	5	10/30/2015	I do not think that there is any question about the quality of VAOI. It has opened its doors to our veterans and their families and has stepped up to help, if help is needed. They continue to be there when others are not. They have helped me with food for my family with no questions. They hooked me up with the Vet Center for a problem I had from my deployments and has saved me from the road I was taking and helped me with getting a job. They are good folks doing good work. I thank them for being there for me.
Veteran Advocates Of Ore - Ida	240295	3	/users/profile/326402	FTSE	Professional with expertise in this field	5	03/31/2015	Veteran Advocates of Ore-Ida is all volunteers with smilies in their hearts. It is an organization that welcomes all military members and families. Their office is open each day and do not ask for dues from anyone walking in. They have a working relationship with the Boise VA Mental Health division for tele-counseling and make available a location for veterans too take advantage of counseling without having to travel out of the community. The organization also works with the Vet Center and makes space available in the community for combat veterans and families to receive mental health help. A great group doing their best to help service-members and families. Thank you.

Veteran Advocates Of Ore - Ida	210948	1	/users/profile/273766	Troop	General Member of the Public	5	08/16/2014	Veteran Advocates of Ore-Ida is the only Veteran Support organization that welcomes all that walk through their door with a smile. They greeted me with open arms and made me feel that the service to my country was important.  They participate in many community projects, such as, some in the organization act as mentors to those going through the Veterans Court process. They have also set up in their office a tele-counciling with the Boise VA.  This allows a veteran to get mental health help without having to travel a.ll the way to Boise, Idaho. They charge nothing for their help and have no dues, free coffee and when I was in there they had some snacks... Real good people that just want to help with no strings attached. 
Veteran Advocates Of Ore - Ida	192934	1	/users/profile/251969	tvcc	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/22/2014	The Veteran Advocates of Ore-Ida have helped many Veterans and their families that I know in the Ontario, Or. area who are without jobs and need a helping hand.  They have also helped many vets in this greater western treasure valley area with access to counciling and mental health matters.  The work they are doing to also establish a veterans court here is admirable and I wish them well. I am always warmly welcomed when I go to their office to talk about the problems our servicemen and women are facing. The people at the VAOI are making a difference and continue to do something meaningful in our community.
Veteran Advocates Of Ore - Ida	33790	2	/users/profile/34614	mike7	Client Served	5	03/23/2010	While here VAOI I discovered a whole new arena of giving  than I have known. Not only the vets who are over seas but also with dignity and respect to homeland vets and families experience a warm environment and caring souls who are willing to do their best in helping either by what they can personally do inside the agency or outside in the community. It is a pleasure to see the hand of sincere help assist persons they see and those that are invisible to the eye but close to our heart.I am a Viet Nam Veteran and am awed at the outpouring of giving I am experienced while working here. VAOI has assist myself in need with transportation cost so I could continue to work and not miss because of no gas for my vehicle.
Veteran Advocates Of Ore - Ida	33676	1	/users/profile/34491	marilyn3	Volunteer	5	03/22/2010	I have been in the Vets Advocates office several times. Anyone who walks through their door, is made to feel very welcome and at home. Whether they came in for help, or just to look around..they are greeted with friendly smiles and a warm welcome. They care.I have volunteered there, bought flags there, donated, and just popped in to say hi. I have seen them helping veterans. They are very knowledgeable and helpful, in what they do. Our veterans need their services. They deserve it. They have earned it. I am not a veteran, but I am glad to be a very small part of this organization.
Veteran Advocates Of Ore - Ida	33660	1	/users/profile/34473	pilots-mom	Volunteer	5	03/22/2010	It has been my pleasure to be a volunteer at Veterans Advocates of Ore-Ida for some time now. I pack care packages!  You know, that little box of home comfort from the USA that our military people get a boost from after a long hard days work.  I can't tell you the number of times that I have received thank yous from soldiers who came in and found that box waiting on their bed and I quote,"just when I needed it the most".  It's not just the contents, it's receiving the gift of "yes, we remember you and we care."  Many times they have no faces to go with our signed notes that are enclosed until they are finally able to return home. Whether it's packing a box or sharing a cup of coffee with a WWII Vet, I feel privileged to be connected to all the caring people who make this work.
Veteran Advocates Of Ore - Ida	33640	1	/users/profile/34454	back-from-war	Client Served	5	03/21/2010	I received letters of support from this group and from the school kids and pre-school kids that this organization put together for me and the men in my outfit.

Veteran Advocates Of Ore - Ida	33626	2	/users/profile/34441	iraq-vet	Client Served	5	03/21/2010	I want to mention about some really great support I got from the Veteran Advocates of ore-Ida in Ontario, Oregon, and a couple of my buddies too.  A friend passed on my APO address to the Advocates and they started sending me boxes full of really good stuff we could use while deployed and some really great letters from the kids about how they are thankful we're protecting them  That meant a lot to us.  I told the advocates how much their boxes meant to us and mentioned about 2 of my buddies that didn't get things from home and they sent them boxes too.  Its great to have folks homeside who really care and do things for us.  Thank you - from an Iraq Vet
Veteran Advocates Of Ore - Ida	33624	2	/users/profile/34439	veteran1	Client Served	5	03/21/2010	This organization has gone out of their way to work with many agencies across boarders and around the Nation. They seem to have contacts within the Federal Government, State Government and Local Government as well as private agencies and other 501 c groups to help our U.S. Military Veterans. I have been helped by just going in to their location and sitting down and talking with other Veterans about my issues. Great place to enjoy and a safe place for any Veteran to hang out and not have to worry about them asking for money. They might not be able to help all that walk in but they sure try harder that any other group that I have been to.
Veteran Advocates Of Ore - Ida	33622	1	/users/profile/34438	happyfeet48	Volunteer	5	03/21/2010	I have seen the caring concern that each person who is involved with the Veteran Advocates of Ore-Ida shows toward veterans, active duty military and their families When you walk into their office, you are greated with a smiling face and a feeling of welcome and respect.  They always have the coffee pot on and are willing to listen mo matter how busy they may be.They depend only on donations and they value a dollor donation as much as a $100.00 donation.  They send out personal thank you to every one who donates, no matter how small or large the donation.It is a "safe" place that anyone can go and feel important.The stafft takes the time to listn and then they make every effort to either ulilize community resources or dig into their pockets to help if the need arises. If you love your country, then you will give to the Veteran Advocates of Ore-Ida so that they can help advocate, support and give a voice to all of our men and women in the Armed Forces both past and present.
Veteran Advocates Of Ore - Ida	33621	1	/users/profile/34436	orvet	Client Served	5	03/21/2010	I received great information from someone in the office over my benefits. They said that they could not do the paperwork in the office but for me to contact this person (they handed me a folded paper) I contacted him and got everything worked out. I was surprised to see that they had information from every veterans group on their shelfs. They told me that they were like a hub for information from many sources. I guess this is what you would call a "one stop shop".
Veteran Advocates Of Ore - Ida	33620	1	/users/profile/34435	chris10	Board Member	5	03/21/2010	The Veteran Advocates of Ore-Ida is very active in the community.

Waves For Development International Inc	182823		/users/profile/239701	matthewcatalano	Volunteer	5	10/27/2013	I had a chance to help create a short video about WAVES and Lobitos a few years ago.  My experience with everyone involved in the organization was nothing short of world class.  The people at WAVES genuinely care about their mission, the kids, and continue to keep their long term vision in mind.  It is the combined efforts of organizations like this around thew world that will slowly help plant educational seeds in the minds of the kids that will someday be running these communities.
Waves For Development International Inc	182732		/users/profile/239608	dwhittak	Volunteer	5	10/26/2013	Lobitos is an amazing place! Although it is just a small town situated in the desert, it is a magical place, capable of capturing the hearts of all those who visit. Our stay was limited to just over a week, but we immediately felt welcomed and the whole town knew who we were and why we were there within the first few days. The whole trip screamed adventure  from bungalow style rooms, to riding in the back of 'la bestia', to the viringo who became an instant friend and loyal companion. Not to mention, the children are amazing! Our time with Waves was very well spent, and we have been trying to coordinate another trip down there as soon as possible!
Waves For Development International Inc	175528		/users/profile/179301	Jen_10	Volunteer	5	10/08/2013	My experience in Lobitos with Waves for Development changed my life. Although the mission of the organization is to benefit the community (Lobitos) in which surf travel happens, it truly is a mutually beneficial relationship where I believe the volunteer becomes the most enriched in the end. I returned to the US with an appreciation for developing communities and an intense appreciation for my family. The enthusiasm and values of the people of Lobitos are completely admirable.  
Waves For Development International Inc	133566		/users/profile/179301	Jen_10	Volunteer	5	11/05/2012	I volunteered in Peru in 2011 and this experience has completely changed my life. I feel like I received the most benefit from the experience than anything else.  It is a total game-changer to travel to a third world village that seemingly has nothing and yet the people are perfectly content and unbelievably warm and hospitable to all of the volunteers. This experience gave me a new lease on life. I ultimately came home empowered and motivated to stop feeling sorry for myself and to make some changes within myself. Ever since my return. I've volunteered locally for the organization because I believe so passionately in its mission, but more so in the evolution volunteers experience within themselves. I wish everyone could experience my experience and I continue to sing it through the roof. I am forever grateful to this organization and they are hands down one of the best nonprofits.
Waves For Development International Inc	138815		/users/profile/184897	Seth1	Volunteer	5	11/14/2012	I volunteered with WAVES three years ago in 2009. I am currently writing this in Lima at the beginning of hopefully a ten month stay with the charity. I think this stands as testament to the effect the place has on you. Once you have visited you do not forget it and will likely move mountains to get back!
Waves For Development International Inc	138311		/users/profile/184370	Atamian	Board Member	5	11/13/2012	No better organization to surf and make a difference with.  Very thoughtful in their approach with communities and very few surf sites offer such an experience for the volunteers.  
Waves For Development International Inc	137652		/users/profile/183648	philiphbrownell	Volunteer	5	11/12/2012	Lobitos, Peru.  Hotter than hell one minute, cold as the Pacific rushing into your wetsuit the next.  Don't expect electricity or TP or even water enough to flush the toilet after every use.  Buses may come, or you will be walking, and the unforgetable memory will not be what you experience as cuisine but the satisfaction of knowing what piping in a water supply for the Community Center toilet will mean for the kids going to school there.  You can expect to clean a beach beneath a cliff full of blue-footed boobies, to meet some of the kindest, most generous, caring, heroic people of your life.  Mostly you can expect this place to change you, to wash away the judgment you had on first sight of this town and leave a deep sense of joy at the privilege of having been of service there.  Thanks you WAVES!
Waves For Development International Inc	137617		/users/profile/183610	Leah15	Volunteer	5	11/12/2012	WAVES is an amazing organization that works in collaboration with the local community to create positive change and connection for people and the environment. The team is phenomenal and in addition to the awesome work they do with the community, they go all out to make sure their volunteers are having the best possible experience throughout their stay. I visited WAVES on my own the first time, and had such a great experience so I brought a group of students from my university back to volunteer again the following February. WAVES offers the perfect combination of volunteering, surfing, learning and fun! 
Waves For Development International Inc	137282		/users/profile/183252	adrianaus	Volunteer	4	11/12/2012	My stay in Waves was pretty amazing. We did a participatory video and photography workshop. Waves provided us with our stay and food necesities. We... in exchange taught the kids working at the surf shop how to make a documentary and photograph different type of scenarios. We were there for two weeks and the results were amazing: a 12 minute doc speaking about life in Lobitos for kids of fishermen. Its a portrait of Lobitos life, a little bit of surf and a lot of fishing. This idea was impulsed by Waves who wanted to capacitate these kids with technology and give them another road for them to seek ways to auto sustain themselves. This is the basic idea behind any true help... dont give them fish but teach them how to fish kid of philosophy. 
Waves For Development International Inc	137228		/users/profile/183192	Alexita	Volunteer	5	11/12/2012	WAVES rocks! It really shows how well a good established organization can work together with a local community so that both benefit and advance their mission together! The people in Lobitos are really friendly and the kids are amazing! Amazing experience!!
Waves For Development International Inc	135641		/users/profile/181521	Kevin42	Board Member	5	11/08/2012	WAVES exists to change people's lives for the better.  I used to say that the volunteers probably get even more out of their service than the locals they work with (experiencing new cultures, broadening their view of the world, making socially minded career choices after...)  However, now that WAVES and countless volunteers have been working year-in-year-out with some of the same young people and families for more than 5 years, the impact on their lives clearly rival that of the volunteers.  I know, because I watch the accomplishments of many appear each day on Facebook.  Oh, and surfing?  Everyone loves surfing!
Waves For Development International Inc	135248		/users/profile/181112	Spencer J.	Volunteer	5	11/07/2012	Waves is an unparalleled experience in which the volunteer group significantly benefits the community of Lobitos while at the same time developing an extremely close bond with all other volunteers and most importantly with those of the community. Waves provides an experience that other non profit organizations spend years searching for. Ultimately, WAVES is and deserves to be one of the strongest volunteer programs around, I recommend it to all, pray for its well being, and miss the experiences I shared with Dave and the fellow volunteers - I stand behind waves and their mission.                                                   Sincerely, Spencer

Waves For Development International Inc	133101		/users/profile/178798	Axl E.	Volunteer	5	11/03/2012	An incredible volunteer opportunity that allows you to surf while making a life changing effect on the local people of a developing community. 
Waves For Development International Inc	133048		/users/profile/178747	LMach	Volunteer	5	11/03/2012	I worked with WAVES for 3 month and I found the experience to be so rewarding that I am now looking to return.  With WAVES you really get to know people living and working in Lobitos.  You don't just get waves and get out.  When you paddle out you feel like you know some of the local guys that have come up with WAVES and makes surfing even more fun than it is on its own.  WAVES is sincere in their mission and the more driven its volunteers are the more positive change that can happen.
Waves For Development International Inc	133008		/users/profile/178707	John109	Volunteer	5	11/03/2012	This was a truly great experience where I was able to positively impact a community through teaching English, environmental, and finance classes to children and women.  I could see how much the community valued WAVES - they were very appreciated.  It's such a unique place - Lobitos - and it was cool to be combine the surfing vibe with service to a special group of people.
Waves For Development International Inc	132484		/users/profile/178126	Dave A.	Board Member	5	11/01/2012	I've been involved with WAVES for Development since the beginning.  Each day is a new adventure.  The thing I love most about the organization is the people that get involved from all walks of life.  It's inspiring to see so many people from such different backgrounds and countries rally behind the same cause to use surfing to make the world a better place.
Sanctuary One	309860		/users/profile/401214	elyse56	Board Member	5	10/11/2016	I have been involved with Sanctuary One for over 5 years. I love the diversity of the animals and the wonderful and dedicated staff that cares for them. 
Sanctuary One	177637	1	/users/profile/234207	Patricia82	Volunteer	5	10/14/2013	I started volunteering at Sanctuary One in January. Being an animal lover, I wanted to work with animals who needed it and to help a good cause. It wasn't until I started there that I learned all they did to help animals, people and the earth. I have learned so much and have received at least as much as I have given. Every person I have met at Sanctuary One is an exceptional being who cares about leaving the world better than it was found. The respect for the animals, the earth and for each other is a concept that isn't yet readily promoted in the US. It's popular in many European countries, but we still have a lot to learn. I would love for them to help spread the word about the great work they do!
Sanctuary One	177625		/users/profile/234193	Dan_46	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/14/2013	I am one of the main Veterinarians (large animal) that visits Sanctuary One on a regular basis.  I normally make a volunteer visit once monthly, and every time I visit, I'm impressed with the quality of care that all of the animals receive, as well as the excellent husbandry that is always evident.  All of the animals are treated and loved equally, as I can observe through the interactions with all of the interns and staff.  Sanctuary One is truly a "family".   I'm honored to be a part of this great facility, and hope to be involved for many years to come. A special thanks and deserved recognition also goes to Ms. Sansa Collins (Animal Care Manager).  She is always aware of the status of each animal, and her ability to notice if an animal isn't doing well, as well as her ability to treat those in need of care is outstanding.   Sincerely, Dan Cochren, DVMTalent Equine
Sanctuary One	177594		/users/profile/234160	Kathryn22	Client Served	5	10/14/2013	I got my Nikki from sanctuary one.  We found her in pet finder and contacted them for the process since we live over 500 miles away. They worked with oru local SPCA to completely make sure we'd could offer the right type of home and not take us for our word.  I really appreciated then doing this because so many pets have owners that should have never been able to adopt in the first place. The have a great property and communicate very well.  What an amazing place. 
Sanctuary One	177589		/users/profile/234154	Mardra H.	Volunteer	5	10/14/2013	What lovely reviews!  They say it all, really.   Sanctuary One is a beautiful place in the Applegate Valley full of amazing people dedicated to the comfort and happiness of the animals in their care.   Having volunteered there since February of 2013, my plans are to continue volunteering as long as I am able.   It's a wonderful place to be. They share my values and I believe in the work they do. I am proud to be a part of what they strive to accomplish in this crazy world.It's a great place to do some good.
Sanctuary One	177573		/users/profile/234136	JeanneChouard	General Member of the Public	5	10/14/2013	Sanctuary One is an amazing place to spend a few hours learning about animals and how by helping animals this amazing organization to helping people as well.   This care farm combines the care of animals with therapeutic programs for people facing difficulties such as veterans working through PTSD and juvenile offenders.  Hundreds of local school children also visit the care farm on field trips.  On a farm tour, you will get to meet the care farm's creatures up close and personal.  The intern who led our tour was a recent Southern Oregon University Graduate and shared her knowledge in so many areas.   In these days of corporate farms raising animals in factory farms, Sanctuary One is doing amazing work to raise the public's awareness of the poor life of animals in abusive farms and what we all can do to help them.  There are also domestic pets cared for here that are up for adoption.  The farm is in a beautiful setting in Oregon's Applegate Valley.  Please visit, donate and consider adopting an animal from Sanctuary One.  
Sanctuary One	177424		/users/profile/233976	Missy_Sue	Volunteer	5	10/14/2013	I spent a weekend at Sanctuary One and was blown away. Such a peaceful place full of hope, education and community. As an ethical vegan I am now inspired to start a nonprofit of my own to serve animals and build a compassionate community based on giving, nonviolence and education; just as Sanctuary One has.  Thank you for all that you do!
Sanctuary One	177416		/users/profile/233970	PR M	General Member of the Public	5	10/14/2013	Sanctuary One is a fantastic care farm. I attended Sanctuary One as part of a field trip. The workers and interns are polite, helpful and wonderful to talk to. The animals are sweet and well cared for, and the grounds are beautiful. Once I visited Sanctuary One I realized that it was no small wonder that they are so well loved. Amazing place! 
Sanctuary One	147703	1	/users/profile/195416	apifera farm	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/05/2013	I have adopted two barn animals from Sanctuary One which is how I became acquainted with them. I too live on a small farm in Oregon and help barn animals, but Sanctuary One is a role model for me in many ways. They not only help animals, they help people and the earth. They bring it all together  in a full circle which is what care farming is all about. I have been back to S.One several times to visit and each time I am so inspired, and each time they have created new shelters, new garden beds, new earth-garden experiments are going on, there are volunteers scurry around and everyone has a positive attitude. They help children from the area learn about animals and earth - and caring for them. And they bring in war vets to help farm and garden - healing broken hearts and hurt souls. I can assure you if you support this group, your money is being used wisely. I personally know some of the staff and they are just great. Katherine Dunn / Apifera Farm, Oregon
Sanctuary One	147700	3	/users/profile/195413	Marie Botchie	Client Served	5	01/05/2013	Sanctuary One is in my opinion one of the most valuable Non-Profit resources we have in Oregon.  The education, understanding, and overall commitment to sustainability, kindness, and positive alternative livability sets the standards as high as they get.  Keeping their message simple, focusing on positive change, I hope hundreds of Sanctuaries follow their concepts and it becomes a natural way of life for us all.   My husband and I took their tour after much time had already been spent with us on the phone and through email where the Board and Staff worked with us in answering questions about starting a sanctuary of our own and adopting animals from them.  Sanctuary One is professional and kind, it does not get much better than that. Thank you! Sincerely, Marie Botchie
Sanctuary One	115637	1	/users/profile/157272	G_Ret_Guy	Donor	5	06/18/2012	As a board member for The Allie Smiles Foundation and a lover of animals, I can say that Sanctuary One and the staff are exceptional! Our 'focused giving' model allows us to support wonderful charities like Sanctuary One. We were very engaged in the concept of 'Care Farming' and knowing that Sanctuary One is the only Care Farm in North America solidified our commitment to being involved. Sanctuary One's mission of a synergistic balance between animals, the land and people is leaps ahead of its time. Great karma, great people, great location... All doing good things! We love Sanctuary One and hope you do too.
Sanctuary One	107804	2	/users/profile/146377	The Woolly Sheep	Donor	5	03/10/2012	My interaction with SanctuaryOne has been three fold. They have met my needs as a place for my business to donate a portion of our proceeds and time to, a sanctuary for a feral colony I needed to relocate and  a place to donate and volunteer at on a personal level. The staff at SanctuaryOne is dedicated beyond expectations. As a donor I continue to be pleased at the  financial discipline shown by the organization. The funds are all spent on the animals and improvements to the land that benefit visitors and animal residents. They rely heavily on a dedicated group of volunteers to keep cost down. The staff is also very accommodating to volunteers letting them participate in the activities that are most rewarding to them. SanctuaryOne is an organization that knows what their mission is and sticks to it. My experience with SanctuaryOne has been nothing but positive since my first tour and I'm proud to be a donor and a volunteer. They are definitely making a difference and by my association with them I feel like I'm making a difference. I look forward to my continued involvement.
Sanctuary One	107591		/users/profile/145829	srolandj	Volunteer	5	03/06/2012	Sanctuary One is driven to success by a group of dedicated people who truly care about the organization. For those involved it it truly a labor of love and mission focused. I strongly recommend you visit Sanctuary One, and if you have already taken a tour, please come back and again and again. The physical property transforms almost monthly and the ever-changing rescued animals that are blessed to live at the Sanctuary are always wonderful to meet. The staff and volunteers take their jobs very seriously and are excellent stewards of the resources provided to them.
Sanctuary One	106507	1	/users/profile/143931	Rise G.	Volunteer	5	02/15/2012	Sanctuary One is a calming, fulfilling, and yet energizing place to spend time at.  The staff is so warm and welcoming and not only give you jobs to do but will work along side with you most often teaching you something as well.  I volunteer there as often as I can and never think of it as unpaid work but more the most rewarding time I can spend helping a wonderful organization.  Its a great place for animals to live their lives out and or be rehabilitated and given a new chance on life.  I LOVE it!
Sanctuary One	106330	1	/users/profile/143326	maggiebeth39	Volunteer	5	02/13/2012	The staff at Sanctuary One are amazing.  They take great care of the animals and the land.  Each animal is given the attention it needs for its specific and special needs.  It has come at a time when it is dearly needed.  With the horrible economy, so many animals are in dire need of a sanctuary to heal from neglect and abuse.  It's a blessing that it exists and that it is here in the Applegate Valley.
Sanctuary One	104515	1	/users/profile/140150	BA29	General Member of the Public	5	01/25/2012	The beautiful property, the life-saving work, the wonderful people who serve the earth, the animals and the people who come to visit: Sanctuary One is one of my favorite places to be. Knowing the horrific past that some of the animals have had, and that they now have a safe, life-long home makes Sanctuary One one of the most serene and peaceful places I have encountered.  
Sanctuary One	104227	2	/users/profile/139738	Animal-friend	Volunteer	5	01/23/2012	Sanctuary One at Double Oak Farm is the first care farm located in Southern Oregon.  A care farm provides health, social or educational care services for one or a range of vulnerable groups of people and provides a supervised, program of farming-related activities to ease the stress of modern life.  On 55 beautiful acres in the Upper Applegate Valley, Sanctuary One is not only a care farm but a home to various rescued domestic and companion animals who have run out of life options provided by animal shelters and law enforcement venues.  Lifelong care is offered to each of these selected animals with food, veterinary care and gentle treatment foremost in their welfare plan. [1]The purpose of care farming is to promote mental and physical health by giving people the opportunity to spend time working on the land including animal therapy, crop and vegetable production and woodland management.  I started spending time at the Sanctuary a few years ago to improve my photography skills by taking photographs of the animals being housed there.  I found that I learned much more than photography and benefited from the pleasant hours spent under the oaks observing the growth and change in this magical place.  Each time I come home from visiting the Sanctuary, I bring with me a sense of peace, a lowered stress level and a full heart.

Good Neighbor Family Pantry	258264	2	/users/profile/346748	CTea	General Member of the Public	1	09/18/2015	THEY SUPPORT MEN WHO BEAT WOMEN.  There is a man living on the farm that has been arrested many times for physical abuse and has documented mental, substance, and alcohol abuse issues. They do not tell the volunteers and endanger the lives of the children at their "summer camps" (they don't inform the parents of the dangers either). I believe in helping people, but to turn away a woman and her son that had no money, no work, and no food just because of PRIDE!!! They didn't want to be wrong... They took in her abuser, (who had stalked her to the farm when she volunteered there prior to them taking him in). She needed help badly and he had a job making over $20/hr... but the farm told the beaten woman and her son not to come back. HEART 2 HEART FARM IS THE PERFECT EXAMPLE OF HYPOCRISY AT ITS FINEST... They are willing to screw the innocent over and leave them homeless and hungry just so they don't have to admit that they are wrong.PRIDE AND GREED ARE TERRIBLE TRAITS, AND VERY DANGEROUS IN THE HANDS OF THOSE WITH POWER.  Stay away, do not give them any more power. There are other, better maintained, and HONEST farms in your area (that will not put your family at harm). PLEASE DO NOT COME HERE.

Good Neighbor Family Pantry	237155	7	/users/profile/321532	Tyler12	Volunteer	5	01/22/2015	I have been a part of this wonderful organization since it's founding, and have watched this amazing team feed THOUSANDS of people for pennies.  These guys run one of the most efficient, low-overhead, endlessly giving organizations I've ever come across. They offer fresh produce and incredible variety three days per week to anyone in need, but that is just the beginning.  Good Neighbor Family Pantry partners with local farms and helps teach people to become responsible for their food and nutrition, to begin the cycle of self-sufficiency by taking advantage of community garden space, and other gleaning projects with local farms.  Providing for those in need, while equipping people with the tools to become self-sufficient is one of the most beautiful positions we can take.  I will continue, for as long as I am able, with this organization, helping them give more, reach more, and serve better.  It is truly a cause worth supporting!

We learn what it really takes to have good, nutritionally dense foods.  Sometimes it takes getting dirty; sometimes it takes doing hard manual labor; sometimes it takes raising an animal ethically and humanely; but most of all, it takes a lot of teamwork.  I love the wonderful mix of people that can work together for a short period of time to benefit so many other people.  We always feel welcome and always learn a lot!

People who really CARE about the community, and making sure that folks get plenty of actually healthy food to eat. I am fortunate that I have not needed to use their services, but I do follow them, and personally know a couple of people who have been able to eat better than they have in months after a visit to Good Neighbor. I love them, and cannot sing their praises high enough or loud enough!
Good Neighbor Family Pantry	237101	4	/users/profile/321433	RN01	Volunteer	5	01/20/2015	I saw a family come out to the farm the other day with kids who didn't remember the last time they had fresh produce to eat.  When families come on hard times, they go to food banks who primarily stock boxed, processed foods.  This pantry is unlike ANY other!  They get kids and adults alike in touch with where their food comes from.  They encourage self-help and community involvement.  I'm honored to have my daughter partake weekly in this incredible organization!
Good Neighbor Family Pantry	237099	4	/users/profile/321431	Lizzy2015	Board Member	5	01/20/2015	The founders of Good Neighbor Family Pantry began feeding the hungry in 2013 when a group of farmers decided to band together to minimize waste and improve the availability of produce to those less fortunate. By the summer of 2014, word had spread, and the need for larger equipment was critical. The farmers launched a massive public awareness campaign, including a crowd-funding effort. The community was so excited, they gathered over 250 sponsors in just 30 days, and raised over $32,000 in donated cash, materials, and support. The support from the community allowed them to fix the old equipment they were abusing, as well as purchase a dedicated truck and trailer, more than doubling their volume, and a non-profit was formed. The Good Neighbor Family Pantry, run by those same dedicated farmers, is now providing over 14,000 pounds of fruit, vegetables, and other food items, and feeding over 800 people per month. They work with over 20 local rotary groups to feed those that cannot make it to the farm, and supply 4 food banks with all the produce they can handle. Whether you are looking for a great cause to support, or you could use a little help with food this week, you're welcome here! We ALWAYS need volunteer help, and donations of building material, tools, bags, carts, and/or cash are always welcome!

Their professionalism and ability to keep their finger on the pulse of important independent films (and film makers) ensures their continued success. This organization helps bring an influx of tourists to our small community, thereby helping our small businesses achieve their own success. 
Southern Oregon Film Society	183098		/users/profile/239981	JCarole	Volunteer	5	10/28/2013	The Ashland Independent Film Festival has such a welcoming atmosphere, inviting newcomers into the theater to see Indie Films along with well-seasoned fans and filmmakers. In the gorgeous town of Ashland, everyone comes together over the few days of the AIFF to share many moving movie moments - in every genre of film. At AIFF, new filmmakers are respected in a very holistic way - the festival itself is an amazingly creative endeavor! The AIFF event relies heavily upon grassroots volunteers, whose involvement is equally treasured and honored. I have run into filmmakers while on the street in Ashland, learned about their next film, and started following their creative work. This non-profit organization is incredible. 
Southern Oregon Film Society	168097		/users/profile/223001	reginaw	Volunteer	5	09/07/2013	I'm in my 4th year as a volunteer at AIFF.  The staff is wonderfully supportive and appreciative of its volunteers and donors.  I've worked in the office in a number of capacities as well as a screener.  No matter what the job, from counting pencils to proof reading to reviewing films, I have always been thanked by a staff person.  To me this is so much more important and fulfilling than the vouchers that are offered to volunteers (although that's a nice perk too!). The quality of the films shown is unsurpassed and if not for AIFF many of us would never have the opportunity to see the many top notch documentaries, shorts and features screened each year.   The organization of the festival and the treatment of all involved, from filmmakers to film goers has consistently been professional and seamless.  I can't say enough good things about AIFF!
Southern Oregon Film Society	167634		/users/profile/222499	Louise9	Volunteer	5	09/05/2013	I have worked as a volunteer with AIFF, a local non-profit organization, since 2006 taking tickets, cleaning the theater, etc the first couple of years.  For the past few years  have been a screener of documentary films (80hrs per season) which I have loved.  I have worked as a volunteer for a number of other non-profit organizations.  AIFF is by far my best experience.  The collaborative leadership style, respect and support for volunteers, experience of fun and request for feedback that is used to affect the running of the festival all contribute to making my experience completely satisfying.  I appreciate the way this festival contributes to the life of the Ashland and Rogue Valley community.  The high quality of film makers that participate in this festival is astounding to me.  I use film in my college level classes, workshops and retreats and know the power of film to change lives.  Being part of this festival has been one of my most enjoyable experiences since coming to Ashland in 2006.  This organization has style, pzaaz, heart and hutzpah!!May it continue to thrive in the coming years!!
Southern Oregon Film Society	167484		/users/profile/155542	Marla E.	Volunteer	5	09/05/2013	Firstly, AIFF is a non-profit with heart. The team is warm, empathic, considerate, generous with their volunteers. They also generate an environment of fun & creativity, and a strong sense of community. I, personally, am a volunteer screener. I feel what I do makes a difference, and I am made to feel that by the organizers as well: I contribute to the Festival being as good as it can be. I teach film classes, so I see first-hand on a regular basis how film can change both individuals and groups; movies are change agents! 
Southern Oregon Film Society	114306		/users/profile/155542	Marla E.	Volunteer	5	06/08/2012	I am a volunteer screener at the Ashland Independent Film Festival in Ashland, Oregon. Film is my passion; I teach and facilitate workshops and classes using film. To me, film - feature films as well as documentaries - are agents of change. Many, if not most, films deliver a message which we are able to take in when we watch a movie with conscious awareness. The AIFF brings this possibility to Southern Oregon, where people come from all over to attend. The quality of films and the excellence of the filmmakers who participate are top-notch. Being a screener allows me to bring my skills and talents to help make the Festival a force of change in the world.
Southern Oregon Film Society	167460		/users/profile/222327	tokyorosen	Volunteer	5	09/05/2013	When I arrived in Ashland, OR, several years ago as a newly retired person, I wanted to find a volunteer opportunity that would allow me to contribute while at the same time be enriching for me.  I was astonished to learn that right in my new home town was an outstanding film festival that might want someone who had spent her whole career in the non-profit world.  I walked through the door of AIFF and have never turned back.   Because of the great people who work there, their dedication and commitment to making the Festival the very best in the Northwest, and because the volunteers are treated with such respect--for these reasons and many more that is why AIFF is my absolute favorite volunteer activity.    
Southern Oregon Film Society	167315		/users/profile/222171	HannahKBean	Volunteer	5	09/05/2013	I had the honor of interning for the Ashland Independent Film Festival which turned out to be one of the greatest experiences in my life so far.  Being able to help plan this week long event from start to finish was so rewarding.  For me, it was all of the people involved that made this event so spectacular.  People come from all over to enjoy not only the films on the screen but the amazing staff, volunteers, and film makers.  For years to come I plan to be involved with this film festival.  If you love film, this festival should be on your bucket list!  
Southern Oregon Film Society	115499		/users/profile/157277	DBGreen	General Member of the Public	5	06/15/2012	I have been attending the Ashland Independent Film Festival for the past 5 years and have been extremely impressed with the lineup of films showcased. The panel discussions have been lively and informative and the event is well run. My interest in activism through film has increased as a result of attending these festivals. 
Southern Oregon Film Society	113599		/users/profile/154565	NoelC	General Member of the Public	5	06/02/2012	The Southern Oregon Film Society provides an amazing opportunity for both independent film makers and the public of this little town: we get to watch movies we would otherwise not have access to, talk with their makers face-to-face, and immerse ourselves for 5 days in the thoughts and inspirations of some of the most creative members of our society, and these film makers get to share the product of their work and discuss it with us! 
Southern Oregon Film Society	113572		/users/profile/154537	Grow	General Member of the Public	5	06/02/2012	Ashland Independent Film Festival consistently provides intelligent, thought-provoking, community-building films in a setting that encourages discussions before and after the films.
Southern Oregon Film Society	113547		/users/profile/154502	mamabrownlie	Client Served	5	06/01/2012	The sSoutjern Oregon Film Society puts on a truly amazing event with the Ashland Independent Film Festival.

Southern Oregon Film Society	111706		/users/profile/152101	bhoff	Board Member	5	05/10/2012	I have been involved with the Film Society for over 10 years...volunteer bookkeeper for years...came on the board last year.  I love the exposure to new ideas from the films, relish the visits with other festival goers on what we've all seen, cherish the many volunteers who make the festival the gem it is and greatly appreciate the staff who are the genesis of all these wonderful experiences. We are going through changes now...understanding that change is inevitable in the life of an organization...it's not easy, but will result in a richer experience for everyone involved in the organization.
Southern Oregon Film Society	111672		/users/profile/152053	edmc	Volunteer	5	05/09/2012	I'm so proud to be part of this special organization.  Just knowing that what we do affects so many people in positive ways makes it all worthwhile.  The films themselves change lives with their content, but the sense of community that is evoked each April at the festival when over 80 films are presented in a five day span is the thing that makes the biggest difference for me.  Talking to complete strangers about a film I saw yesterday while standing in line waiting to get in to see yet another, in the theater before a film begins or in a restaurant or a pub after saturating myself with independent film for an entire day, I can't help but to feel that during the five day festival  that Ashland is truly the center of the universe.  There are so few opportunities for us to actually connect as a community, to experience things together and be offered the opportunity to share our experience with one another.  The Ashland Independent Film Festival offers all that.  Volunteering my time for this organization is one of the more fulfilling things I've experienced in my life.
Southern Oregon Film Society	111667		/users/profile/152047	ronmogel	Volunteer	5	05/09/2012	The Ashland Independent Film Festival is one of the cultural jewels of Southern Oregon, bringing together the best of independent film and the warmth and friendliness of a special community. The well organized mix of filmmakers, audience and volunteers makes this event a rare and wonderful experience. It is five days not to be missed.
Equamore Foundation	23181	6	/users/profile/24252	stacyulrey	Volunteer	5	12/01/2009	Wow!  What a wonderful foundation.  Linda and her Volunteers took my class of at risk/low income kids who have been kicked out of other school.... And she gave us a chance.  We now go out to Equamore ranch once a week for about 2 hours a time.  The students are learning to groom the horses, and learn general knowledge about horses.  Linda and her crew has opened up a door of opportunity to these students which they have never had.  Most of my students had not seen a horse in real life let alone touch it. This has motivated my student to read and learn more about horses when in the classroom, which is increasing there reading skills because they have a reason to read now. They are increasing their writting skills because they are sharing there experiences through writting which is increasing there writing skills too.  By working with the beautiful horses they are learning to be calm and interact with there partners and volunteers in appropriate ways.  Equamore has help us all around.  We just wanted to say THANK YOU!
Equamore Foundation	22739	10	/users/profile/23745	horsemom9	Volunteer	5	11/16/2009	I have watched the progress of many of the sad and neglected horses and it makes my heart soar to see the incredible dedication of the volunteers. Every horse has made increases in weight and most heartwarming is the look on their faces..fear begins to dissapate. Equamore is one of the most valuable charities I have donated to..both for the  troubled children who get a chance to bond with these incredible horses and the horses who get to see that humanity does indeed have a heart...
Equamore Foundation	21203	14	/users/profile/22317	cremo831@gmail.com	Donor	5	11/02/2009	We attended an event at Equamore about 3 years ago.  We were so impressed with the caring, devotion and energy of the organization that we assumed a sponsorship and have been making monthly contributions towards the horses' care since that time.  So many animals - so much NEED.  We are truly thankful that there is an organization such as Equamore.
Equamore Foundation	21191	13	/users/profile/22298	Al Ives	Volunteer	5	11/02/2009	I have been an Equamore Foundation volunteer for six years. I have witnessed abused and unwanted horses returned to health and given a lifetime of proper care. These horses receive daily stall cleaning, outdoor and arena exercise, regular grooming, indivual customized diets, and the necessary veterinary services. The Foundation ensures through oversight that once accepted into the Foundation a horse will never be returned and left to a neglectful situation.
Equamore Foundation	21087	16	/users/profile/22197	Dulcinea	Volunteer	5	11/01/2009	After a number of years away from horses I was feeling the need to reconnect, but knowing the great need of neglected and abused horses, I decided to join with Equamore and lend whatever help I could. I now go each weekend and give extra thorough grooming and handling to the horses that don't have regular 'guardians'. I've been in many horse facilities in the Western U.S. as well as all over the south of Germany, and I have never seen a more organized, well-maintained horse facility. The calm, positive energy of the place give horses and visitors alike, a sense of peace and safety here. I am in awe of all that Linda Davis and her passionate, dedicated group have accomplished since establishing Equamore, both for the helpless horses they have rescued, and for youngsters who have found meaning and discipline here, interacting with horses and gaining mutual trust and healing. In my heart I know that there is no better combination than a neglected horse and a neglected child who both need healing - and my hope for Equamore is that they can find the means to move more in this direction in the near future. "Build it and they will come", and Equamore already has everything in place to open its doors to broken children that can be helped by these broken horses - they need only the financial support specific to such an indispensible project. Linda Whitlow, Medford Oregon
Equamore Foundation	21062	13	/users/profile/22176	Ginny Porter	Volunteer	5	10/31/2009	The Equamore Foundation is totally dedicated to providing the highest quality service as a horse rescue provider and Linda Davis, the founder and those who she attracts are of the highest integrity and principles possible. This organization's sole intent is to help the horses and the Board makes the most of every dollar contributed and insures all funding is directed to the care and for the highest good for the horses. This is a "class act" and those of us who have been fortunate enough to contribute to this organization and watch the miracles unfold for the horses at Equamore are filled with gratitude indeed. Ginny Porter, C.P.A., M.B.A.
Equamore Foundation	21025	12	/users/profile/22145	Harry howard	General Member of the Public	5	10/31/2009	In addition to their service in rescuing neglected horses, and occasionally finding homes for them, they have worked with the children who are in care at the Southern Oregon Child Study and Treatment Center (SOCSTC).  These at risk children come to the facility and are supervised in the care and grooming of the horses, which is a form of therapy only those animals can provide.  Horses and children are a special combination, and the benefits of inter action to both child and equine are priceless.Harry Howard CASA volunteer
Equamore Foundation	20963	15	/users/profile/22084	Scott Beckstead	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/30/2009	Equamore Foundation serves two vital roles in Oregon:  they provide direct care to animal in need, especially horses, at their sanctuary. But in addition, they are an important part of the Oregon Horse Welfare Council, a statewide group of concerned groups and individuals dedicated to saving horses and helping horse owners take better care of their animals. In part due to the participation and leadership of Equamore Foundation, Oregon has become a national leader in its programs to save horses and promote animal welfare in general.
Equamore Foundation	20923	18	/users/profile/22043	mollyholman	General Member of the Public	5	10/30/2009	Equamore Foundation is highly deserving of any donor money available for this type of work.  I have been involved with numerous organizations of this type and Equamore is run more efficiently, financially responsibly and with great love and care for the horses.  I can't speak highly enough of LInda Davis and her Equamore Foundation.
Equamore Foundation	20885	1	/users/profile/22003	Marleen Walmsley	Volunteer	4	10/30/2009	Equamore Foundation is an excellent horse rescue facility.  Linda Davis, Director, is a diligent evangelist for horse rescue that creatively brings equestrians together to make a difference in the state of Oregon and beyond.  I have volunteered there for the past year and have observed only the highest standards of care and concerted fund raising efforts that can only come from the heart!
Equamore Foundation	20750	19	/users/profile/21872	RW	Volunteer	5	10/30/2009	The economic downturn has made neglect of horses an even more widespread problem in our area due to the economic downturn. Equamore is the only facility in southern Oregon that will take in  abused or neglected horses. I've seen first-hand what Equamore does with neglected horses. With proper care, nutrition and kindness, malnourished or even starving horses that might fear humans eventually turn into the healthy, happy animals they're meant to be. And Equamore does this on a shoe-string budget. A horse my daughter and I have been taking care was thin and scared when we first started working with her about six months ago. Now she's healthy, sleek and going to a great adoptive home!
Equamore Foundation	20746	19	/users/profile/21869	huacarider	Volunteer	5	10/30/2009	Equamore does everything they can to help rehabilitate even the horses ni the most awful of conditions. Horses that many people would have given up on are given a second chance at a happy life, and many have made miraculous recoveries. Also, Equamore educates many young children in how to treat horses, attempting to teach the next generation that abuse is wrong and eliminate such issues in years to come.
Equamore Foundation	20734	19	/users/profile/21853	Janet Snazuk	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/30/2009	I can not say enough good things about Equamore and Linda Davis.  This organization is probably 30 years old and has always existed for the poor horses who have been abused, neglected or just plain "thrown away".  Linda has had her ups and downs financially, but she has always provided for these orphan horses one way or another.  I admire her spirit, tenacity and overall giving joy and I believe the animals feel it too.  In her care, I have seen nothing short of miracles.  Emaciated, dejected horses come to life again, no horse is too wasted for Equamore.  They believe and so should you. GIVE all you can.
Equamore Foundation	20729	17	/users/profile/21847	Ren Kolar	General Member of the Public	5	10/30/2009	I have been aware of and a contributor to Equamore (when I can) for a few years now.  What an amazing organization.  The work they have done to save horses that were so neglected and abused.  Even when Linda has no more space or time...she makes time and space...all for the love of the animals.  All you have to do is go to the facility and look into the souls of these animals.  They are so beautiful and grateful for their second chance at life.  If I could give more I would.
Equamore Foundation	20720	18	/users/profile/21840	littlegreymare	Volunteer	5	10/30/2009	I have had a chance to observe the Equamore foundation for a few years now, since I board my horse there. I have noticed the rescue horses to be cared for with great attention to their specific needs as well as with kindness. The rescue is very careful about screening potential new homes so that any horse being adopted will not have to endure yet another situation of abuse or neglect. They  also keep an eye on any horses adopted out to make sure that the horses are thriving in their new home for years to come. Any horse that makes it into this rescue is only going to be in good hands thereafter. It is a stellar rescue operation, in my opinion.
Equamore Foundation	20710	20	/users/profile/21830	jinashland@aol.com	General Member of the Public	5	10/29/2009	Well run organization which a large volunteer corp.It has been the only equine rescue organization in the Rogue Valley.Other vally rescue groups take in other livestock.Jackson County Animal Control and the Humane Society depend upon Equamore.
Equamore Foundation	20260	20	/users/profile/21417	nanash	Donor	5	10/28/2009	Th Equamore Foundation is fantastic.In the ten years I've been a volunteer , I have witnessed miracles: Horses who were so afraid that they attacked people or ran away when anyone approached have been calmed and gentled. More importantly, their eyes are no longer vacant.Starving horses have been carefully brought back to health and strength.Horses who've been abandoned because they are lame, or old, or just not wanted anymore have been retrained and are now living happy, useful lives at the farm or with foster care givers.
FOOD for Lane County	152754	2	/users/profile/198226	Mary158	Donor	5	04/06/2013	Food for Lane county goes far beyond most food bank programs to tackle food needs from so many angles;  local food barrel collections, coupons for food donations, local food distributions in various communities including senior home areas, where it is set up like a store, not a hand out feeling for the clients.  The application process for client's isn't demeaning and allows the client's dignity in receiving food. I not only donate food to them, I also have donated 'non edible food' as well, because they also run programs for recycling waste of food that cannot be given as 'food' for their population, helping out the local sanitation with recycling needs as well.  
FOOD for Lane County	152450	2	/users/profile/25300	Peggy Hinsman	Donor	5	04/05/2013	Food for Lane County truly helps those who lack funds for eating in Lane County, Oregon.  In Eugene, many of the road intersections have homeless people with signs requesting help.  Food For Lane County offers a free meal location on 8th Ave. across from the WOW Hall.  Each year I donate $60 to Food for Lane County through Market of Choice and also donate food through the US Mail system.  
FOOD for Lane County	89100		/users/profile/25300	Peggy Hinsman	Donor	5	05/24/2011	Oregon is a state with the highest percentage of people who lack finances for eating well.  FOOD for Lane County does a remarkable job of helping those who don't have enough money to purchase healthy food for their families.  Every month and year I support FOOD for Lane County by donating money at Market of Choice, donating bowls at their yearly fund raiser, and donated food when the post office does a food drive for FOOD for Lane County.
FOOD for Lane County	56731		/users/profile/25300	Peggy Hinsman	Donor	5	11/11/2010	I really appreciate all the work Food For Lane County does for the many families and people in Lane County who are struggling financially.  With the economy the way it is right now, there are so many families and people who are having such a difficult time If Food For Lane County were not doing what it is doing, life would be extraordinarily difficult for so many people in our county. 
FOOD for Lane County	24202	4	/users/profile/25300	Peggy Hinsman	Donor	5	12/16/2009	FOOD For Lane County helps so many families in need and I am very proud to be a donor of this nonprofit organization. Each month I donate money when I go through the checkout line at one of our local grocery stores, Market of Choice.  I also donate a grocery bag full of food for every postal food drive for FOOD For Lane County. And we often send a donation check to FOOD For Lane County each year.
FOOD for Lane County	24486	9	/users/profile/25531	karmon666	Former Volunteer	5	12/18/2009	When we moved to Springfield in 1997 my husband and I lived 2 blocks from the Game Farm Park where Food for Lane County had a garden.  It was nice to become part of the community and be allowed to assist with caretaking of the project.  We assisted in gardening, building structures, giving advice on the irrigation.  We have also been customers of the farm; it is amazing to see at risk kids learn skills and develop pride in what they can accomplish at the farm. Because of these experiences we continue to give to Food for Lane county.
FOOD for Lane County	24266	3	/users/profile/25365	Greg	General Member of the Public	5	12/17/2009	What can I say, except food for: Lane County is about more than distributing food. I can remember a very low period in my life when Food For Lane County played a major part in pulling me out of that dark place. And I have watched them do the same for many others.
FOOD for Lane County	24215	9	/users/profile/25318	Donna	Client Served	5	12/16/2009	Food for Lane County has fed the hungry and always needs more non-perishable items. I have even been a receiver of their gifts of food boxes. If they weren't around, thousands of adults, kids and families would go hungry.I try to donate when I can.I can not explain what a blessing it is to have them around.  And the volunteers who work there are special people who care for others and give of their time.  There have even been school kids volunteering there and earning credits for community service.I think they are the strongest organization in the Eugene area who is very worthy of donations of funds and food.God bless Food for Lane County! 
FOOD for Lane County	24213	9	/users/profile/25314	mrsrandom	Volunteer	5	12/16/2009	Food for Lane County is a wonderful organization, helping anyone who needs it through various programs and access points.

FOOD for Lane County	24205	4	/users/profile/25305	estillwell	Donor	5	12/16/2009	Food For Lane County is a tremendous asset to our our community. When I think of the work they do, I always remember my great, great, great grandfather, William D. Stillwell, who moved to Oregon in 1845 and was very charitable to the folks at Skinner's mud hole (Eugene) who had no food. Below is a brief excerpt from "History of the Northwest, Volume II", page 586:"In the winter of 1846 quite a number of emigrants who came by the southern route barely got into the Willamette valley until their teams gave out; and they themselves were so worn out and ill they could not come over to the settlements, and in many cases were suffering for food. The settlers at North Yamhill contributed ten pack-loads of provisions; and Mr. Stillwell and a son of Chicamen Smith volunteered to take it and distribute it to those who were actually suffering, without pay. "They started in December, a time when all the streams were swollen out of their banks; and not one of them but the Lacrosse did they succeed in fording, having to pack their cargo over on foot logs, or ferry them across on rafts or in canoes, and swim their horses. Sometimes they would not be able to proceed more than a mile or two in a whole day's travel. When they came to the Long Tom, they found a man and his family camping where his team had given out; and they were not able to move on. He told Mr. Stillwell they had had nothing to eat for two days. In reply he said; "You are the kind of people we are looking for. Bring something to carry it in, and I will give you something to eat." After being supplied with flour and meal enough to last them several days, the poor man actually cried, as the relief came so unexpectedly; and he could not pay for it. He had started his son off to the settlements that very morning with the last dollar he had in the world, but promised to pay as soon as he was able. "Never mind," said Mr. Stillwell, "this is for those who have nothing to eat, and nothing to buy it with." "After crossing the stream, they met a company of ten wagons, who still had two or three days' provisions, but were eager to secure all Mr. Stillwell had. Of course he would not sell to them; and they drew their guns and talked of taking the cargo by force. Young Smith kept driving the packed animals along; and he and Mr. Stillwell both cocked their guns, which caused the emigrants to change their minds. So they passed on, making only two or three miles a day, until they reached the spot where Eugene City now stands. After distributing their cargo among the needy, they took the women and children of two families on their pack-horses, the men and boys all walking and started back to the settlements. When they reached Sap creek their provisions were gone; but a party had brought some wheat for seed, which he let them have; and they hailed it for supper and breakfast, but began eating it as soon as it was hailed. They relished it without salt or anything else with it."
FOOD for Lane County	24204	4	/users/profile/25302	Jennifer	Volunteer	5	12/16/2009	I've worked for several of the FFLC food pantries as a volunteer for the Nutrition Education Program through Lane County Extension, and have helped publicize their food drives and programming on my food blog, Culinaria Eugenius.  I have never seen such a tremendously resourceful organization -- they do so much for the hungry in Lane County and could do much more with more resources. To take just one example, the Grass Roots Garden, run by FFLC to provide organic produce for food pantries, and other volunteer/ youth farms work together to improve the nutritional content provided to low-income residents.  I believe the number was 140,000 pounds of fresh fruits and vegetables last year.  I've participated in activities at the Grass Roots Garden as a Master Gardener, and I'm always amazed by the tight ship they run, dramatically productive even with a team of at-risk youth volunteers.  The GRG collects leaves from the city, food scraps, and paper from local businesses and turns it into compost. It serves the community in so many ways!

Madonnas Center	87461		/users/profile/98135	maureen	Volunteer	5	04/27/2011	Although I have lived in this community for years, I was really unaware of the number of teen mothers.  I found out about the Madonna's Center program from a flyer about a benefit golf tournament. I checked it out. I found that a group of people were trying very hard to make life easier for these young parents and their children. This interested me. I was very impressed that the organization, while helping the teens with essential material items,  was really concerned with encouraging the parents to be good mothers and fathers , be independent,  stay in school or  get job training ...benefiting these young families..long term.. I was very impressed working with this group.. non judgemental, loving and very supportive of these young parents.

I am proud to be a part of this organization!

The Madonna Center is a vital community partner for our program and our students and their children. When a new student enters our program, our class members enthusiastically share with her all the ways in which the Madonna Center has helped each of them.  They cite examples ranging from supplying diapers, baby gates, and household items, to having a volunteer meet them at the DMV to help a teen-mom get her driver's license.  Whatever the need or barrier the Madonna Center works to address it for our young parents.  They deliver needed items several times a month directly to our classroom.  The services of the Madonna Center are highly valued  and appreciated by our students.  The Center helps our students to stay in school and be better parents.

FOLKS JUST GIVING TO COMPLETE STRANGERS. IT SEEMED LIKE, NO EFFORT WAS TOO GREAT IN ASSISTING THESE YOUNG WOMAN AND THEIR YOUNG CHILDREN WITH DIAPERS, CLOTHING, WHATEVER THEY COULDN'T GET OTHER PLACES.

Good Samaritan Ministries	317600	5	/users/profile/408741	christinaweber	General Member of the Public	5	10/31/2016	My name is Christina Weber and I am a Participant Assistant for Experience Works, Inc. Experience Works is a Title V Senior Community Employment Training Program (SCSEP). In my time with Experience Works, I have had the pleasure of placing two of our participants at Good Samaritan Ministries. In both instances, the participants were treated with the utmost respect and the training they received has been life changing for them. When I am placing participants, I do my best to discern the best possible Host Agency for the participant. To know that the participants are being skillfully trained to be able to obtain an unsubsidized position is rewarding; however, it is far more rewarding to see the life-changing growth that both of these individuals have experienced from working in a faith-based organization that lives out the ministry of Jesus, not just speaks it. I would highly recommend that if you have an opportunity to donate anything to a nonprofit at this time of year, that your donation would go to this organization who lives out the love, mercy, compassion and heart of the Lord Jesus Christ in an environment of high integrity and truth. Thank you. Christina Weber, Participant Assistant, Experience Works, Inc.

In response to the training and donation-based counseling offered by this ministry, the hurting often become the generous givers of time, talent, treasure as they heal.  Like the Good Samaritan's action, we see open hearts willing to put another first  and build the kingdom of God.  Our friends in Kenya are building with care and compassion.

My husband is going to prison, two of my daughters have been sexually abused by him, I just told him yesterday that I am filing for divorce. So, the fact that I can come and get individual and marriage counseling, from a knowledgeable and compassionate professional, free of charge is HUGE! I am also participating in their DBT group, which is all about dealing with emotions and behavior. It is really helping me to become more aware of what I am thinking, how it is affecting me, my relationships, and my goals.   
Good Samaritan Ministries	315458	4	/users/profile/406781	BethanyS	Volunteer	5	10/27/2016	I first came to Good Samaritan Ministries as a child. My family was involved with training and counseling and I took an eager interest in helping others through watching their examples.

Truly, this ministry is working wonders in the lives of many. 
Good Samaritan Ministries	314038	5	/users/profile/405398	Freda E.	Volunteer	5	10/24/2016	Good Samaritan Ministries helped me to overcome a horrible habit of picking my fingernails and cuticles until they bled. This habit began as a teenager, with worts on my thumbs. I tried to dig them out; by the time I finally had them burned off with liquid nitrogen, the habit was well entrenched. I am now 58 and the only thing that any counselor has ever said was that picking until I bled was like cutting myself and just as serious. Good Samaritan Ministries offered concrete help with a DBT class, which is Dialectic Behavioral Training. I have received respect and great kindness in their beautiful office. I have begun to volunteer; I want to give to others the gift of hope and healing that has been given to me. For the first time in my life, I am not picking; my fingernails are healthy and beautiful.

That is the epitome of the Kingdom of God on earth.
Good Samaritan Ministries	150870	4	/users/profile/201199	laura sue	Volunteer	5	03/10/2013	I was in a terrible mess! My second  marriage was not going well. My husband had left the home. One afternoon we sat on the couch discussing our failed marriage. As I quietly prayed, the Lord reminded me of a woman I had met several weeks before. Her name was Bettie Mitchell. When my husband admitted he didn't know what to do, I suggested we see Bettie for counseling. He was in agreement. Bettie began counseling us. The process was tough but the end result was life-giving. My husband volunteered to help people locally and internationally. He has since passed on to heaven.  My Good Samaritan Ministries volunteer work began as a member of the Good Samaritan Ministries Kenya team. This work inspired me to travel to Kenya. Up to now, I have traveled 9 times to Africa, 3 times to the Middle East and once to Asia ... all to  learn about and support the work of GSM internationally.  As a retired school teacher, passionate about the plight of children around the world, I now serve as Co-Leader of International Education. The Good Samaritan Ministries International Education team meets weekly at the International office in Beaverton, Oregon.  gsminternationaleducation.org Good Samaritan Ministries offers many opportunities for service locally and internationally. Individual counseling is availble on a donation basis. Inspired teaching challenges and moves us forward to freedom.  We move out of victim mentality. We learn to use our gifts and talents, to go the extra mile, and to be a blessing to others. We meet inspiring men and women who live by great faith.  
Good Samaritan Ministries	150836	6	/users/profile/117656	liesa.gilbert	Volunteer	5	03/09/2013	Im a 5-year volunteer at Good Samaritan Ministries, specifically with a group called International Education, whose focus is literacy and education for children (most of them orphans) in 3rd world countries.  Through fund-and-friend-raising events we  (1) tell the story at large  the international research backed by hard, long-term data  that these precious lives are forever changed because they have been given:  (a) the tools to become self-sufficient, and (b) the gift of their own voice; and, (2) we tell the individual stories of childrens lives lifted from total abject poverty and obscurity to become contributing citizens in the development of their own communities. So heres the thing about Good Samaritan Ministries:  THEY GET IT!!!  They get that life is all about your perspective and attitude  within relationships  with your neighbors, spouse, kids; with your in-laws, out-laws, ex-laws; with your fellow workers, boss; with your stuff, like your clothes, car, boat, jewelry, house, and  your money; with yourself; with God.  Enter their very modest facility and you immediately sense that their mantra rings true, that judgment stops at the door.  Good Samaritan is a safe haven where you are embraced irrespective of your condition.  You are free to learn, to keep on becoming, via counseling sessions; long/short-term seminars or group therapy (often interactive); varied weekly activities; become a volunteer and see where you adventurously end up, or, lend your known expertise. Good Samaritans willingness and ability to expend their resources and themselves the mile beyond the extra mile to help the one in need is exceptional, often sacrificial.  It is a HUGE work they do, and the needs are ever-pressing, particularly given the current world-wide economic climate.   But, by wisely applying aggressive time and money management, they seem to cover more bases than otherwise imaginable.   They are the first to admit the impact of their faithful and dedicated volunteers.   Whatever space you fill at this ministry, if you let it, and if you dare, it will challenge you to see yourself more honestly, to question your lifes priorities, and ultimately, the reason for your existence  the purpose of your life on planet earth.  I believe that each of our lives is a story, interspersed with messy chapters.  I often told my own children that our family, each of us, was a story in the making, because whether looking at secular or Biblical heroes, they, too, were all flawed personalities, irrespective of their suggested greatness.   Years ago I had some counseling at Good Samaritan Ministries.  Years later I returned and ended up a volunteer with the International Education group.  Id be hard pressed to find elsewhere the depth of dedication and commitment, such natural intent to intervene  to be my brothers/sisters keeper (Luke 10:25-37), as I experience at and through Good Samaritan Ministries efforts. So what is my story?  From my past counseling, from my volunteering, from attending classes and events at Good Samaritan Ministries, Ive arrived at a place of reconciliation with myself, and theres a real peace about that.   There is always the push and pull dynamic in my life  which is rich personal growth potential  if kept in proper balance and perspective.   You'll find that hanging around with "the people" at Good Samaritan keeps you humble, and if you stay attuned you can't help but expand your horizons, see with new eyes, become more willing, even able, to extend yourself, often simply because of a realigned perspective and attitude!  Im human but Im learning I need to apply more of Gods grace in my life, and to extend it more to others.   I always thought I had a story or two, but Im seeing more and more that I have my own unique story.  At this point, its not a bad read either, but there's new and improved versions up ahead!

GSM is one of the very best Christian NGO's I know of.  I've had the pleasure of talking with their founder, Bettie Mitchell,  and I can say that they reach out to every single person with open arms.  This is a prayerful and brave organization who will not shrink from facing difficult situations, and who reach out to everyone, regardless of their lifestyle. These are Bible loving believers, but you will find many more Christian actions than Christian words here, and they know how to pinch a nickle until the Buffalo screams.

Ballet Fantastique does a wonderful job of integrating classical styles with a modern, theatrical sensibility, and two of the performances I attended included live music, to brilliant effect.  They are also, beyond stylistic prowess, a practiced member of their community and inclusive place of learning.

The staff at Ballet Fantastique welcomed me with open arms and have taught me invaluable lessons about my position within media relations, and also the power a non-profit can have. It takes a team of devoted and passionate individuals to make a non-profit succeed. And Ballet Fantastique has just that.

The instructors are outstanding, and as practicing, professional performers and choreographers, they create an exciting a vibrant environment in which to learn the art of ballet.  Needless to say the academy is the best of its kind in Eugene.  Because it is both an academy and a chamber ballet company, Ballet Fantastique provides unique opportunities for ambitious young dancers to perform in a mix of traditional and creative modern shows with extraordinary prima ballerinas.As a business partner, Ballet Fantastique lacks at nothing.

As a dancer and teacher at Ballet Fantastique, I have recieved amazing coaching about my technique and artistry, and conditioning. I have had amazing opportunities to perform with the chamber company, and have experienced first-hand what ballet fantastique does for dancers who have a passion for dance, but don't have the funds. Ballet fantastique gives 110 percent back to anyone who gives to it. Since I have been with ballet fantastique, It has become more and more organized as well as structured, which is great. I think the organization still has room to improve in this aspect, as far as class organization goes, as many students are not able to predict when they will leave class. As ballet fantastique grows, it will need to be even more organized and planned! It's hard to believe all the things that ballet fantastique is able to do for the community, its students and teachers, and for the arts.

They also make it possible for dancers to participate in professional ballet training and performances while also pursuing a college degree - which I personally think is a truly valuable endeavor.

Cork Forest Conservation Alliance	232443		/users/profile/295982	judymac	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/01/2014	Cork - a renewable resource, a better choice for the environment, and has many uses.  It's more than just a bottle stopper, although it does a very good job at that.  
Cork Forest Conservation Alliance	231610		/users/profile/295184	Jordana W.	Volunteer	5	10/31/2014	I visited the cork forests of Spain with the CFCA this past summer.  It was an incredible experience led by extremely passionate guides.  I am now very cork conscious and only purchase wine sealed with natural cork.
Cork Forest Conservation Alliance	231539		/users/profile/295119	libby.spencer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/31/2014	Often, consumers don't realize the overall impact of how a small purchase can make a big difference in the life of the planet.  For example, a bottle of wine closed with a natural cork is a better choice for the planet than one sealed with an aluminum screwcap or plastic plug.  Every purchase matters and the CFCA illustrates this idea brilliantly.

Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/21/2013	I knew Cork Reharvest two years ago when his manager visited us here in Spain. I live in a small village which focuses its life on using the resources that we can pick up from Cork Forest, specially the cork. I was surprised how this NPO is worried with our problems, despite they are so far from here, and what big effort they are doing in order to show  our places and nature.
Cork Forest Conservation Alliance	180563		/users/profile/237248	Ttoes	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/21/2013	I first learned about the Cork Forest Conservation Alliance and Cork ReHarvest at a Wine Grape Growers Meeting.   The presentation was interesting, enlightening, and very appropriate for a group growing grapes and making/selling wine.  It dispelled many myths about "better" closures for wine bottles.  It was so interesting, I thought it would be worthwhile for the members of my Rotary Club to also hear it.  I was surprised at how many club members also found the presentation extremely interesting and educational.  If you want to learn more about the world's second largest ecosystem and you can help preserve it, I highly recommend a visit to the website - http://www.corkforest.org

Our engineering dept had managed to get a check from the Nevada Water ppl for over $40 K by remodeling all the landscaping.It took me  a while, but I love wine and researched cork recyling and found cork reharvest to be the right group and the perfect fit for Mesa Grill at Caesars Palace.  All 8 Harrahs properties now partake in this program and use While Foods, one of the partners as a drop zone for the corks.

Veterans For Peace outreach to local secondary schools is only one example.
Veterans For Peace, Linus Pauling Chapter 132, Corvallis, OR	280171		/users/profile/370010	Writer	Volunteer	5	02/14/2016	The Corvallis VFP chapter is very active in the local community--making connections with the local sustainability coalition, the men's homeless shelter, and working in tandem with other local peace and justice organizations and Oregon State University.  They have an active truth-in-recruitment effort within the local high schools, and also participate in "Career Day" providing information to high schoolers who are simultaneously being recruited heavily by the military.  They often work with the local branch of the Women's League for International Peace and Freedom (WILPF) to bring in guest speakers/presentations, and they are a co-sponsor of the "Second Saturdays Concert Series for a Better World" which has raised nearly $40,000 in 9 years for local charities.

Volunteer	5	02/13/2016	The Corvallis VFP chapter has been a peace and justice leader in our community for 10 years. They are a highly visible group, participating in parades and tabling at events and fairs. They work to educate the public about the real costs of war in money, people and opportunity costs--the money we can't spend on roads, education, sustainable energy projects, etc. because of the tax dollars spent by the Pentagon. They are also a valuable resource for high school students contemplating a career in the military. VFP's "truth in recruiting" program helps students make that life-changing decision based on facts, not hype from military recruiters.

Veterans For Peace, Linus Pauling Chapter 132, Corvallis, OR	130538		/users/profile/176010	leahbolger	Board Member	5	10/28/2012	Veterans For Peace has been around since 1985 and has a well-established history as an effective, grassroots, membership-driven organization.  VFP is the ONLY veterans' organization whose primary mission is to abolish war, and they do that by educating the public about the truth of war and militarism through the expression of their own stories and experiences.  VFP members are dedicated to peace and justice, who "walk the talk."
Veterans For Peace, Linus Pauling Chapter 132, Corvallis, OR	130472		/users/profile/175945	capeblanco	Volunteer	5	10/28/2012	VFP is an excellent organization. Since joining almost two years ago I have been in several parades, helped counter-recruiting at one high school and at a career fair for area high schools, participated in a panel discussion about the Vietnam period in two high school history classes, and been present as VFP at Memorial Day events. The members of our chapter are dedicated activists for VFP, knowledgeable and articulate, and a pleasure to know and work with.

Volunteer	5	10/28/2012	Due to numerous health issues and the distance from Corvallis, I am unable to participate in many of VFP chapter 132 activities but I know that they have and are making a serious impact on residents in that area. Their motivation to bring Peace and Justice into the community, through the daily Peace Vigil in front of the court house has attracted many community members to participate and  join as well as their yearly efforts to provide homeless men and women winter shelter, access to counseling and providing other amenities that are necessary for their daily needs.  I'm hoping that my health conditions will improve shortly after surgery and that I can once again be a working member of the Linus Pauling Chapter of VFP.  The chapter and members individually have been a real asset to me personally through installing handicapped access in my home and providing transportation to the VA Hospital 70 miles north.  I'm personally indebted to them and appreciate the assistance provided for several years now.

There used to be federal block-grant money for groups like this but Pres. Reagan got rid of that. No cause if more important to veterans than working to make sure that children and grandchildren don't have to go in the military, don't have to fight, kill, and die. This national organization and its regional chapters gets noticed. The struggle is almost impossible, is impossible without money.

Whether it's hearing about Leah being arrested for taking part in a peaceful demonstration, helping keep the Bradley Manning situation in the public eye and other visible actions to remind the mainstream media that we're still warring and occupying illegally - etc.  I believe they have a greater impact per person as the public understands that Veterans know what they're talking about when it comes to military issues.   The Remembrance Rug takes up all my spare time -  or I would be out there with them.

PDXWildlife	322090		/users/profile/415698	Doireann F.	Volunteer	5	01/25/2017	Working for PDXWildlife has been the best experience of my entire life. I was a summer intern in 2016.  During my time with PDXWildlife I learned a great deal of lasting scientific research skills in a fun and motivational way. Both Meghan and Nate are the most wonderful people who are deeply committed and passionate about Giant Panda conservation, this is what makes PDXWildlife such a great non-profit.  They have excellent communication with everyone involved regardless of language barriers or distance. They have been supportive in every way possible, right from my first application email up to present day. PDXWildlife push the boundaries of what can be done under fundraising limitations. Every donation is valued and used to produce amazing results leading to positive and tangible changes in panda conservation. PDXWildlife deserves international recognition and support for their dedication and commitment. I would wholeheartedly recommend PDXWildlife to anyone looking to support a worthy cause. 
PDXWildlife	320985		/users/profile/414091	haileymarrie	Volunteer	5	01/09/2017	PDXWildlife is an amazing program, run by passionate, innovative individuals who care greatly  about panda conservation and its effects. I had the opportunity to intern with PDXWildlife for the summer of 2016 doing behavioral research, because of these experiences I have gained  skills which enable me to perform high quality behavioral research data collection.  Meghan and Nate are wonderful individuals who have dedicated their lives to the conservation of the world's most loved creature, the panda. Meghan and Nate are able to juggle the responsibilities of performing the research, getting new interns settled in Ya'an every three to four months, as well as keeping in great contact with the interns, once they've returned home to the states and the research is ongoing. They do all this while, maintaining a positive attitude, providing a professional experience and expressing willingness to help the interns with anything they need, including reference letters, re-vamping CV's, or life advice. Meghan and Nate give everything they have for PDXWildlife, and are more than deserving of recognition and donations. Words cannot describe their passion for pandas, and conservation, they are two of the most willing, intelligent, kind people I've ever had the opportunity to work with.  Because of my amazing experience with PDXWildlife I hope to work with them again in the future, and see their nonprofit, gain the global recognition it deserves.

PDXWildlife	320939		/users/profile/414006	Lordseal92	Volunteer	5	01/07/2017	PDXWildlife not only conducts crucial research (notably their work with giant pandas that is transforming the approach to conservation breeding) but is actively involved in developing relationships abroad and giving promising young minds a chance to be involved in a career altering internship program. PDXWildlife is an exemplary non-profit that has gone about everything the right way and it shows from the dedicated following they have built, the reputation they have not only in United States but also abroad (particularly in China), and by the work they've done to educate and mentor the future of the scientific community.

From a small and ambitious beginning, they have grown into a efficient organization that produces innovative endangered species research. With publications in both Nature Communication and Environmental Toxicology & Chemistry, the ability to quickly produce high quality results certainly makes them a front runner in a fairly complex field. With what has been accomplished in the previous five years, I am both proud and excited to be part of an organization that prides itself on educating future scientists through internships, and connecting the general public to endangered species research. 
PDXWildlife	288898		/users/profile/379101	pandapanda	Donor	5	05/06/2016	Meghan and Nathan have devoted the past 5 years creating an invaluable internship program that trains budding scientists in endangered species research.

I only wish I could donate more. Keep up the great work!
PDXWildlife	288868		/users/profile/379071	Brynn2	General Member of the Public	5	05/06/2016	I have been following PDX Wildlife and their work and cutting edge research with endangered species. I was also present for Meghan Martin Wintle's dissertation on free mate choice and how it enhances conservation breeding in the endangered giant panda...Fascinating! This is posted on their website and well worth the read! Plus, who doesn't love pandas?
PDXWildlife	288245		/users/profile/378458	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/04/2016	PDX Wildlife is doing important and ground breaking work in the area of large mammal research.  Through their efforts the Pandas are now reproducing successfully in captivity.  This has been so successful that Pandas from their base are now being released/reintroduced into the wild.   Their staff has done similar projects with elephants that have been among a rare few to reproduce and successfully raise young in a captive environment.  We have followed their work and are fascinated and intrigued by their pictures and descriptions of their work.  With the expanding nature of their work now including interns and 'working volunteers' they offer one of the most unique experiences on the planet for those of us who love nature and wildlife.  Keep up the great  work!!
PDXWildlife	288240		/users/profile/378453	Frances A.	General Member of the Public	5	05/04/2016	I have eagerly followed the posts from PDXWildlife about their work with pandas at the Chinese bases and have been impressed by their work. They have offered interning opportunities to young scientists and, though young themselves, Nathan and Meg have already contributed important research involving mate selection, which has contributed to something of a breakthrough in captive panda breeding. I've also found them quite personable and willing to answer my layperson questions with an understanding of both scientist and non-scientist viewpoints, and they have become something of a bridge for those of us who have followed the panda cubs from the San Diego Zoo who have returned to China. I wholeheartedly support PDXWildlife.
PDXWildlife	288181		/users/profile/378395	Karen399	Advisor	5	05/04/2016	PDXWildlife  is one of the best of non-profit, they care so much of the wildlife, they did so many researchs of them to make people know more about and focuse on the endangered species, thank you for what they have done!
PDXWildlife	288160		/users/profile/378375	Anglica R.	Former staff	5	05/03/2016	As a conservation program, PDXWildlife is doing amazing work for the giant panda species. As a program offering internships, they're providing incredible opportunities that are benefitting the individuals who are lucky enough to participate as much as the pandas they're researching.The management at PDXWildlife are in tune with everything that happens under their program, and are always ready to provide their insight, knowledge, and time anywhere it's needed. PDXWildlife works closely with the tight-knit communities at their partnered conservation bases in China, and has worked hard to build and maintain those relationships. Interning here can give you rare, incredible experiences, and supporting this organization can change the lives of people and animals across the world!
PDXWildlife	288153		/users/profile/378369	Danielle94	General Member of the Public	5	05/03/2016	PDXWildlife is investigating the breeding of giant pandas, which is far from being well understood, and other behavioral studies of giant pandas in collaboration with the Bifengxia Research Base in Sichuan, China.  They are surrounding themselves, years after years, with groups of interns who all had excellent backgrounds in various fields of animal studies which is highly commendable as it gives their organization an even better understanding of all aspects of the behaviors of giant pandas.  PDXWildlife, from their collaboration with the Bifengxia Research Base over many years, has established close relationships with the Chinese staff at the Base and earned their respect.  I have been in contact with the staff at PDXWildlife for many years and have followed their extremely valuable work with great interest.  I find that their contribution to the understanding of giant pandas is original and of exceptional quality. Danielle Lemaire
PDXWildlife	288137		/users/profile/378350	charlenejohnson	Client Served	5	05/03/2016	I visited the Bifengxia Panda Base on two separate days with PDX Interns helping me find my way around the base. Though I had been there before, there were many changes and the Interns were very friendly and helpful. They were extremely invested in the research that was being conducted at the New Breeding Center on the panda base. The research is invaluable in understanding captive giant panda breeding and despite the unpredictable nature of the process, the Interns remained patient and enthusiastic. It was clear to me that they were trained well and had gained the respect of the staff at the panda base. I feel very fortunate that PDX Wildlife exists and believe strongly in the important work they are doing with giant pandas.

Excellent and highly-rewarding opportunity made possible by a fantastic organization.
Child Aid	292883	1	/users/profile/383454	RobetraD	Volunteer	5	06/13/2016	A few years ago I began hearing from retired educators about a program called Child Aid and the projects that they were helping with in Guatemala. As a retired teacher/Title I coordinator and reading consultant for the state of Oregon, I was well aware of the importance of a thorough training program for teachers in reading instruction for children. This last year I was able to be a part of the team that went down to help one of the schools that Child Aid is supporting with training for teachers and books for children! As part of a team that painted a village school, I was able to see, firsthand, the minimal supplies that teachers in the Guatemalan schools have. I was reminded of a school in Tanzania, Africa where I spent a month supporting and training teachers, only the teachers in this Guatemalan school had even fewer materials to use! For that reason, it was pure joy to visit the headquarters of the organization and see the cases of books that were to soon to be available to these teachers and students!  It was, however, even more thrilling to have the chance to meet with the training team and see the well organized objectives and lessons and the passion of these trainers! I have had the opportunity to teach many reading classes to teachers throughout the USA, and the thoroughness of the training plans and the ongoing support to the teachers and schools that I saw on this visit convinced me that this is a program that I must continue to support! I might add that the group that I was with was made up of mostly former educators, too. It was their encouragement and enthusiasm for this program that caused me to take an interest in Child Aid! I am most grateful for having had the chance to see the quality of training that is provided to the teachers of Guatemala through Child Aid and look forward to further involvement with them. Sincerely, Bobbi Donnell
Child Aid	281799	2	/users/profile/89705	Roger Capps	Volunteer	5	03/06/2016	I'm the leader of a group of Senior Citizens who have had the privilege of working with Child-Aid in Guatemala a for the past seven years.    Child-Aid is a small organization, home-based in Portland, Oregon, but it is making a dramatic impact on the lives pf many children in Guatemala through the literacy and other programs that it runs.  The role of ourgroup has been to go to Guatemala on an annual basis, spend one or two weeks painting and doing repairs on one of the elementary schools.   It is very gratifying work, knowing that we can accomplish so much,  and add a 'bright spot' to the lives of so many people.   We make life-long friendships with the teachers and on-site staff members while we arethere, as well as with the school children and their parents.    This year we had 18 team-members, each paying their own way for transportation, lodging and materials, so it makes for a very cost-effective endeavor.   The way to gauge our success?    In our first year of doing this - seven years ago -- we had 12 members on our trip.   Without 'advertising' fornew member - just 'word-of-mouth' - this year we had 18 members, all of whom are excited about going back again in November of this year.   A wonderful experience for members of out group, and a real blessing to work with Child-Aid, an organization is doing so much to help the children in Guatemala!
Child Aid	81806	1	/users/profile/89705	Roger Capps	Volunteer	5	03/10/2011	I was a member of a 16 member team that went to Guatemala under the auspices of Child-Aid -- two trips so far, one in 2009 and the other in 2010.   Child-Aid's main purpose for many years has been to deliver books in the Spanish language to the children of Guatemala.   We were the first group that has gone to Guatemala with Child-Aid for the purpose of refurbishing an elementary school, (painting, electrical, plumbing, etc.)   While there, we had the opportunity to observe the high-quality of training that Child-Aid is providing to the teachers, which in  turn will great improve the quality of learning.   It is amazing to see the impact that a relatively small organization can have on the education system of an entire country!    I have become deeply impressed with the quality of the administrative staff of Child-Aid, in Portland, Oregon, as well as the on-site staff in Guatemala.   We are looking forward to returning to Guatemala in 2011, to continue our work with this outstanding organization.
Child Aid	121979	2	/users/profile/166047	Patti B.	Donor	5	09/06/2012	Recently we had a chance to see all the wonderful things Child Aid accomplishes, and it was more than we could have imagined. Child Aid employs local staff whose creativity, drive, and enthusiasm fuels the success of the literacy program in their own communities. Everybodys effort associated with the program (staff, teachers, librarians, parents, neighbors and students) not only accomplishes Child Aids education/literacy goals, but also creates an environment whose grassroots enable enrichment in so many other intangible ways that will be passed from generation to generation in Guatemala helping to end any cycle of poverty.
Child Aid	121230	2	/users/profile/164953	BrendaHunsberger	Donor	5	08/22/2012	Child Aid is doing fantastic work in the area of childrens literacy in many communities in Guatemala.  Their approach, which includes continuous training of their "on the ground" team who then train the teachers and the librarians in the local communities is empowering to so many, and just makes sense.  One of the most inspiring things is seeing the kids excited about reading, then teaching other kids, inspiring them, and knowing that being a donor is only one small (but important!) part of the process, with the big work being done by the staff, teachers, librarians and mostly the kids.  I highly recommend getting involved!
Child Aid	100548	1	/users/profile/123074	LATarbox	Board Member	5	11/11/2011	I have been a board member of Child Aid for more than 10 years.  I am very careful about how I allocate my volunteer time and resources, and I am proud to be a supporter of Child Aid.  I have seen firsthand what a difference our work has made to so many lives, and how far our dollars go in Latin America.  I am also the board chair of a small community foundation, and in that capacity,  I work with a lot of non-profits.  Child Aid is the only organization outside of the non-profits in my community that I work with.  Why?  The impact of our programs, the passionately committed volunteers and staff, and the fact that Child Aid is run in an extremely professional and fiscally responsible manner are why I support Child Aid.  
Child Aid	100343	1	/users/profile/122052	kindurcan	Board Member	5	11/06/2011	I am the father of two children adopted from Guatemala and have been working with Child Aid for a number of years as a way of supporting positive change in the country. I joined the board this year and had a chance to visit the country and see their Reading for Life programs first-hand.  I was most impressed to see how their multi-faceted approach  -- providing books, training teachers and librarians and supporting local libraries -- is changing the culture of education in these communities. Not only are kids getting access to books and vital literacy skills such as critical thinking and problem solving, but teachers and librarians are getting high quality training that will make them better at their jobs. The energy and enthusiasm for learning (and teaching) that I found in the schools I visited was inspiring. It illustrates Child Aid's long-term focus on investing in and empowering local people that I think will pay great dividends in the future.
Child Aid	100281	1	/users/profile/121930	Dan Regan	Board Member	5	11/04/2011	I have worked with Child Aid for the past several years. They have done so much to improve the lives of children. Nothing makes a bigger difference in a child's future than the ability to read, think & dream! Please join me in supporting Child Aid. Thanks!
Child Aid	86210	1	/users/profile/96412	christopher eaton	General Member of the Public	5	04/18/2011	Child Aid is great.  The staff in Guatemala have been tremendous to work with.  The projects are engaging and active and one is able to see that the staff have been very attentive to the communities that they work with.  i certainly would not hesitate recommending Child Aid to anyone!  i have had the chance to observe what they do and the impact they have in communities and each time i have been impressed.   i appreciate that they respect and listen to communities and yet also challenge them in their libraries.  Very impressive!
Child Aid	86050	1	/users/profile/96193	Sherry Miller	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/17/2011	Public schools in Guatemala, particularly in remote villages, have few if any resources. The books I have been able to get from Child Aid to share with some of these schools have been received with a kind of heart-felt thanks and wonder that enhances the power of reading and writing in ways hard to believe. Teachers, earning less than $150 a month, and students coming to school with nothing more than a tortilla for lunch, if that, are amazed by these books and so proud to have them in their school "libraries". They have worked hard to raise a small amount to help pay for them and value them beyond measure. Thank you, John and Child Aid, you are making a huge difference on the ground and in the classroom!
Child Aid	82745	1	/users/profile/91453	Kristin Ostby	Client Served	5	03/21/2011	Our non-profit organization in Guatemala, Esperanza Juvenil, has benefited from the wonderful work of Child Aid in two ways.  First, Child Aid has donated a number of excellent, high quality, hardcover childrens books for our library.  In the context of Guatemala, where it is extremely difficult and expensive to get books for children, this has been a tremendous resource.  Second, our teachers and staff have participated in Child Aids training which has helped them to develop skills to promote literacy and a love of reading with our children.  Over the last five years, we have seen and measured a high rate of improvement in our childrens reading skills and passion for reading.  We thank Child Aid for being a key partner in this effort!
Child Aid	82181	1	/users/profile/90228	Peter  Hinds	Volunteer	5	03/14/2011	My wife and I were part of the 16 member team that catalogued books and painted the inside and outside of a school in 2009 and 2010. We saw how teacher training has helped instruction. We noticed the enthusiasm of children who voluntarily attended a reading program during their vacation time. We were impressed by how the community became involved in the improvement of their children's education. We were very impressed by the Guatemalan teachers trained by Child-Aid and by the entire staff of the organization in Guatemala and in Portland, Oregon.
Child Aid	81986	1	/users/profile/89940	Vince DeGarlais	Client Served	5	03/11/2011	I run a very small non-profit program in an indigenous mountain village in Guatemala, where we have established both an elementary and junior high school.  We began our collaboration with Child Aid last year, when we were fortunate enough to send two of our teachers to Child Aids teacher training program.  Although our teachers are dedicated and want their students to receive a quality education, they are a product of an educational system that recently was ranked 125 out of 133 nations evaluated by the World Economic Forum.  Having never been exposed to books themselves in their homes as a child or at school as part of their education, our teachers lack the necessary skills to teach reading even though they now have access to various materials and resources.  Child Aids programs provide the teachers training in stimulating a desire among their students to read in a culture without the resources or the tradition of reading.  They also focus on techniques to develop reading comprehension, a glaring void that existed in our curriculum.  Child Aids teacher training program has already helped us tremendously in our attempt to raise the level of education in our village.   
Child Aid	81657	1	/users/profile/89495	Richard Saulsbury	Volunteer	5	03/09/2011	I was a member of 16 person volunteer team who, in November of 2010, had the opportunity to work in and observe in a Guatemalan village school in which Child Aid has been working for improved children's literacy. Although the school was then on vacation, The Child Aid program, 'adventures in reading' was underway. We had the opportunity to see a reading program which excited and interested the children. The children were excited to have reading material, which was not available before. The teachers have been trained by Child Aid to conduct the lessons in an active and open environment which seems to encourage participation. I have learned that in much of Latin America there is NO emphasis in school to learn to read for pleasure, partly because there is usually no pleasure reading material available. It looks to me that through the work of Child Aid, some children are getting a new message about the power of reading.  I was amazed at the number of village children who voluntarily attended the classes. 
Educare Africa	320397		/users/profile/412851	MJ W.	General Member of the Public	5	12/22/2016	I am Wirmvem Mengnjo Jude from Cameroon. Mrs Pavla Zakova Laney was by biology teacher during her peace corps service in Cameroon. Since 1996, Pavla has been supportingmany of us from secondary school to university by providing school materials like shoes, books, pens, pencils, rulers; paying school fees, sewing uniforms, paying house rents and electric bills. Since her personal allowance could not satisfy the increasing number of needy and good students, Pavla later created Educare Africa. Through this NGO, she has helped many more students across Cameroon, thanks to the loving care and generous support from many kind donors.I am now a PhD holder and just completed my postdoctoral studies in Japan. I will forever remain grateful to Pavla and Educare Africa for making me what I am today.
Educare Africa	320214		/users/profile/412490	Etienne T.	General Member of the Public	5	12/17/2016	My name is Etienne Tawong. As a peace corps volunteer in Cameroon, Mrs. Pavla was my biology teacher at the then Government Secondary School (GSS) Tatum for 3 years. Before Educare-Africa was born, Pavla had already started helping many students with their school needs like books, school uniforms, school fee, etc. including me. Beyond her acts of generosity was a vision to start this Nonprofit organization Educare-Africa. For me, Educare -Africa was there just at the right time. I reached points where my family could not afford my school fees, and Educare-Africa was my helper.  After graduating from High School, I didn't know where to go, but Pavla, with the help of Donors of Educare-Africa sponsored my training in a computer school as a Computer advanced user, technician and network administrator. This was the right seed planted in me, and I still see the harvest today.  I am just one of the hundreds or thousands of students who have benefited from the generosity of Mrs. Pavla, Educare-Africa and it's kind donors.

I remained stranded at Buea until a beneficiary of Educare Africa decided to equally share with me all he got as support from Educare Africa. Thanks to him, I moved to Yaounde, Started my studies, got to know many very inspiring people through Educare Africa. Learnt to be positive and move forward. i am still to complete my studies. Thanks to all the Above, i am getting successful in business. I now employ "at my level" Four other cameroonians. It is great to know Educare.

Educare Africa	320064		/users/profile/412148	bobkaufman	Board Member	5	12/12/2016	Pavla has put her life and soul into this organization. If it weren't for her it would not exist. She has helped a lot of people.
Educare Africa	320000		/users/profile/412006	jlaneyjr	Donor	4	12/09/2016	I have helped numerous students stay in school and even go on to university. One thing I like about EduCare's operations (and why I keep donating) is that they have an annual check-in with every child to make sure the money is really being used for purpose and that students are making progress. All the money I donate goes to kids. 
Educare Africa	115671	2	/users/profile/157523	vise	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/19/2012	Educare-Africa is doing a great job and i served in the organisation. They are real and have accomplished a lot for so many poor children. I recommend them for any form of support to making change real. I was the country director in Cameroon, now i run a new organisation called Leiyen. We intend to partner with her so they should contact us through our site or email or anyone who needs to make a difference. www.leeiyen.com or can send us a direct email at info@leeiyen.com   join us in facebook or twitter let us make a difference in the world through love
Educare Africa	8886	9	/users/profile/10660	marian angele	Donor	5	08/08/2009	I support this program because the money goes directly to the students and the school and its projects. Moving from Peace Corp worker to lifelong sponser, Pavla's nonprofit is an outstanding example of how cooperation, inspiration and generosity can make a difference in empowering individuals and communities.  Education is the best gift we can give to empower others intellectually, economically, and socially.  She personally meets and interviews students and parents to determines needs, motivation and abilities.  This program can be used as a highly effective and successful model for other educational nonprofits.

She has kept me informed of its continuing growth and the amazing results for its students. I applaud her and her students and all who are part of this amazing adventure in education.

Hope and someone to care enough to take action is a powerful healing for all.  The ripples return to each of us.  Bless all connected with this effort with infinite blessings now and forevermore.
Educare Africa	8713	1	/users/profile/10456	Jennifer Gard	Volunteer	5	08/05/2009	Traveling to Cameroon and seeing the impact of this mission was a truly uplifting experience for me. This program may be small, but its effects are far-reaching, bringing hope, resources and opportunity to students, their families, the schools, and the communities as a whole. Educare Africa is extremely well-organized, efficient, receptive, and their resources are used wisely and conservatively. The Educare Africa students I have met and spoken with are brilliant at encouraging and helping the younger students work hard to study and reach their dreams. They are dedicated to using their education to build up their own communities in insightful, sustainable ways. I couldn't have more regard for the mission's President, Pavla Zakova-Laney, who puts all her trust in God, loves those children, and sees only the best possibilities for them.
Educare Africa	8696	12	/users/profile/10438	Bonnie	General Member of the Public	5	08/05/2009	Educare Africa is a small organization with a big reach.  Pavla's work and energy on behalf of the children in Cameroon is truly inspiring.  It has been a joy to watch this organization grow from an idea into an amazing reality through the efforts of one dedicated woman who has the courage to care.
Educare Africa	8671	13	/users/profile/10412	Feryl	Donor	5	08/04/2009	This is an excellently operated non-profit which has and is, doing much to educate and support young students in an impoverished country.
Educare Africa	8645	12	/users/profile/10380	Debbie2477	Volunteer	5	08/04/2009	This non-profit started when the founder was finished with the Peace Corps.  She realized the need for more help.  If everyone was like her, there would be no more poverty in the world.  Every year she takes a trip to Cameroon to bring school supplies, and other necessities to the schools in the area she used to work at.  The rest of the year she has fund raisers and speaks at schools around the area.  Every penny she earns from her part time job and her fundraisers goes to the students in Cameroon.  I'm really impressed with her dedication.
Educare Africa	8636	15	/users/profile/10368	Sarka Ozcanli	Donor	5	08/04/2009	Pavla Zakova-Laney, the President of Educare-Africa is a vivid enthusiast which always looks for resources to help students in Cameroon. She keeps all supporters informed about her annual trip to Cameroon and about well being of the students, detailed information about spending  and fantastic results. It is always great to hear how many students are able to go to school in Cameroon with Educare's help.
Friends Of The Visual Arts	277006		/users/profile/66446	potterycrone	Volunteer	5	01/18/2016	I want to answer Playswithmudd. I am one of t he founders of the Willamette Art Center. At this time there is only one founder on a board of 7. Without the founders, there would not be  a community place in Salem to  "play with mud". Also, I have been one of over a dozen a volunteer monitors who keep the place open. Without the monitors there would be no Willamette Art Center. They answer the phone, sell gallery pieces, supplies, classes, memberships and studio passes, answer technical  questions and clean up the mess every shift.  For their work, they get a limited number of pieces fired. Their benefit to the center outweighs any compensation. There is only one "founder" on the list of monitors at this time. Monitorships rotate. Those who are interested can get on a list .The Willamette Art Center is the one place I go where everyone is friendly to everyone else. It is the place I go to unwind. If you think the WAC is "cliquey" try volunteering. The Willamette Art Center is working hard to bring the community the benefit of pottery classes for the lowest cost possible. Another organization tried doing the same thing for Salem without volunteers. They closed after 5 years but still use the money making event that the Willamette Art Center's founders started. I challenge "Playswithmudd" to come to the WAC, go to board meetings and make a difference.Unlike "playswithmudd" I refuse to hide behind anonymity. Cindy Nielsen
Friends Of The Visual Arts	60938		/users/profile/66446	potterycrone	Volunteer	4	01/25/2011	The Willamette Art Center, the community ceramics arts center, run by the Friends of the Visual Arts is my home away from home. It offers a place where I can go to do creative work with like minded people and relieve the stress of daily life.  I have been a caregiver for my elderly mother for 4 and half years, as long as the center has been in existence. WIthout the center, I would have burned out from the stress of watching my mother decline and having to become increasingly more responsible for her daily care . The center gives me a purpose and a way to express myself and the satisfaction that comes from working with  my hands. The classes taught at the center offer  a lively interchange of ideas and new techniques. The self actualization gained from my experience on the board of the Friends of the Visual Arts and as a student creating new works in pottery has relieved what would truly be a dreary existence.
Friends Of The Visual Arts	65018	3	/users/profile/71080	PlaysWithMudd	General Member of the Public	1	02/08/2011	Many of the reviews that are posted here are from people who get free studio time in exchange for a minimal amount of "work".  While there is good instruction and the facilities are good, the organization is cliquey and people who aren't accepted by the clique are treated badly.  The board members are also people who founded the organization and they implement many self-serving policies, put their work before the work of others, etc.   In reading the reviews it might be helpful to look at the profile of the person and the "What did you do" to determine the person's affiliation with the Willamette Art Center.  Most people who "volunteer" actually exchange work or chores for free studio time (which is not volunteering).
Friends Of The Visual Arts	62129		/users/profile/67910	Ken J.	Volunteer	5	02/01/2011	The Willamette Art Center in Salem, Oregon has become a great place for many people in Salem.  The center is for anyone who is interested in working with both clay and glass.  It works for artists who are deeply interested in their craft, for those who just want to take a class to find out if it is something they like and even for the family who might want to spend a Sunday afternoon working with clay.  This can be done at a program called "Family clay Sunday".  I have been involved at the WACvolunteering as a Monitor and also making bowls for the 'Empty Bowls" project where we make bowls to be sold at a fund raising sale for  Marion/ Polk food Share.

Several years ago I was given a gift certificate for a class.  I was elated and couldn't wait for my class to start.  The instructor was 1st rate & shared his passion for pottery in a way that made even my wobbly novice attempts feel like potential masterpieces.  I have been happily exploring my creative side at the Willamette Art Center ever since.The Willamette Art Center offers a wide variety of  artistic opportunities for the entire community.  Classes and workshops include: hand building, wheel throwing, pottery painting, glazing, high & low fire, Raku, sculpture, glass blowing... and are offered for every age, from children and young families to retirees.

We started over 5 years ago from scratch with a 'crew' of dedicated volunteers.  Slow and steady has been our moto; increasing classes for all ages and skill levels; offering scholarships to aspiring potters; and, instigating the ever popular Family Clay Sunday which is partially funded by us as our way of giving back to the community.  We also donate to Marion-Polk Food Share by putting on Empty Bowls.  Another big project for us is Artisan's Village at the Oregon State Fair.

Not only is it fun to work with clay, but to be with other like minded people is an experience unto its own.  To be able to sit with other artists - at all levels - and get ideas and get the creative juices flowing is amazing. Since that time I have been able to volunteer my time as a monitor to help keep the Art Center going.  This allows me meet many other artists and the community and help make their "art" experience a memorable one.   I am now serving on the Art Center board and find it very rewarding in learning what it takes to run such a facility.  I have assisted with the Family Clay on 1 Sunday and see the absolute joy on children's faces as they have their own experience "playing in the clay".

With oil now spilling in the Gulf and threatening livelihoods and ecosystems the US Supreme Court needs to take a serious look at a recent Supreme Court case in Belize. A Dutch vessel ran aground on the Belize Barrier Reef and destroyed an irreplaceable and pristine acre. The Government of Belize established that the Reef is living and not property, and the Chief Justice set damages higher as a result. See what I mean about what I am learning? It's also fun to use my visual and logical skills to develop the site. In addition, the office manager, Lauren Ice, is a gem and makes me feel at home and valued in my role in the organization.
Environmental Law Alliance Worldwide - ELAW	38176	10	/users/profile/39049	melanie11	Volunteer	5	05/06/2010	ELAW has given me the chance to volunteer for a wonderful cause.  So far Ive been volunteering since Fall 2009 and it has been a great experience. Everyone Ive met there has been friendly and dedicated. The work accomplished at ELAW is truly beautiful. Check out their website to see their recent victories! www.elaw.org
Environmental Law Alliance Worldwide - ELAW	38167	7	/users/profile/39039	cassie3	Volunteer	5	05/06/2010	Environmental Law Alliance Worldwide (ELAW) is the most ideal place for my internship just after graduation from Environmental Studies Program at University of Oregon. And I will do an one-year intern here (Nov.2009--Nov.2010).First, this is a wonderful opportunity for me to incorporate what I've learned at school into practical work. For example, I practiced outreach knowledge and techniques into the China outreach Program.Second, ELAW is a perfect place to learn about nonprofit operation. It's small and constructed well, so that I am able to learn about different things about all sections in a nonprofit organization: financial,communication, legal assistance, scientific support, office management and administration, outreach and so on.Another example, I attended ELAW's board meeting recently and was impressive that every board member were so engaged!  Personally, ELAW is providing staff and volunteer a comfortable and happy working environment. ELAW Staff all are professional and experienced. They are kind and nice. And they are fun!
Environmental Law Alliance Worldwide - ELAW	38162	5	/users/profile/39035	jakea23	Volunteer	5	05/06/2010	ELAW is an amazing place! That work that is being done here is truly inspiring. I have volunteered with ELAW since fall '09. Everyone that works there has been wonderful, and there is always meaningful work that needs to do be done for volunteers.I would strongly recommend checking out ELAW!!!
Dove Medical	224966		/users/profile/288736	bricklantz	Board Member	5	10/22/2014	As medical director, I am extremely pleased with the staff and volunteers for their compassion, dedication, and expertise.
Dove Medical	221990		/users/profile/285683	K.G.	Donor	5	10/11/2014	Dove Medical is concerned with all women from all walks of life. They encourage and help women make informed decisions.  They have wonderful nurses and staff, and a very warm, engaging environment.  Eugene is very fortunate to have this resource in their city.
Dove Medical	221672		/users/profile/285358	JohnQuigley	General Member of the Public	5	10/10/2014	Dove Medical is a very professionally run clinic that has given great service and medical care for this community. It is a shinning beacon of an example of what this type of medical care can be. Dove Medical is the start of a movement and gives us great cause to consider shutting down Planned Parenthood and save tax payer dollars so that nonprofit organizations following this roadmap can take over! The World and America would be a better place! End Planned Parenthood now!
Dove Medical	220880		/users/profile/284568	Nancy182	Donor	5	10/08/2014	I volunteer at a drop-in center for young people aged 15-22. The other day I was talking with a young couple about whether or not they were getting their needs met. In conversation, I asked them if they had ever been to Dove Medical. Their faces lite up! I know that sounds cliche but they seemed happy to have used their services. They said especially when their daughter was an infant they were very helpful. I was so good to know that as a community member, and donor to the organization, Dove Medical does make a difference in the lives of families in Lane County. 
Dove Medical	220705		/users/profile/284379	grammiebaer	Donor	5	10/07/2014	I've served in various ways with Dove for about 5 or 6 years...sorting donated baby clothes, answering phones, setting up storage units for donated maternity and baby clothing, and now praying weekly with a small group at the center.  We have prayed through the changes that have occurred over the last several years and seen God at work here.  Staff is truly caring, professional, and committed to helping women make a decision that will affect their lives for years to come!  
Dove Medical	219329		/users/profile/282953	mshaffer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/02/2014	Dove Medical is a truly woman-centered clinic. I have worked with the staff for a year now and they prove to be as lovely of a group as you will ever find. They are patient-centered, with hearts of gold for each and every patient that walks through the door. This is a wonderful place to be.
Dove Medical	219244		/users/profile/282873	keltickitty	General Member of the Public	5	10/02/2014	Compassionate, caring and there when you need them most!
Dove Medical	219193		/users/profile/282816	Kay_21	Volunteer	5	10/02/2014	The staff at Dove Medical are very caring, knowledgeable, experienced Christians who give loving support to clients without condemnation.  They don't tell clients what to do, but give them information to make a good decision (which the staff hopes is to continue the pregnancy) and help them see that they have time to think clearly instead of making panicked decisions.  Because Eugene is a very liberal, secular city, Christianity is not pushed on clients, but the staff are ready to present a Christian viewpoint, prayer, or Bible study if clients are open to that. The center also provides parenting classes for mothers-to-be, maternity clothes, and baby items.    Another service it provides is help for post-abortive women in the form of a several-session Christian-based support group.
Dove Medical	219119		/users/profile/282738	switzerjan	Donor	5	10/01/2014	This organization puts its clients as its top priority. They love what they do and help their clients without judgment to make the best possible choice in sometimes difficult situations. Loving and caring to everyone who walks in the door.
Dove Medical	219065		/users/profile/282682	ShirleyA	Donor	5	10/01/2014	The warm and professional staff at Dove Medical serves so many in our community.  A warm enbracing arm of support  in a time of fear and  uncertainty in womens lives.   I am proud to be a donor for the past several years  and know that they steward the funds carefully that are donated to care and help as many as have a need.  An important supportive organization for women in our community
Dove Medical	219052		/users/profile/282669	Zeekie	General Member of the Public	5	10/01/2014	I have learned a lot about Dove Medical and what they can offer to our community. They have a warm and friendly staff who offer women invaluable information to women about their unborn babies. They care for and love each one that is helped and give hope where there may have been none before. 
Dove Medical	219049		/users/profile/282665	Saratogarose	Donor	5	10/01/2014	Thank you for such a wonderful resource to our community! This is an amazing clinic to help women make informed decisions about their unborn child. Warm and peaceful building and a caring staff. 
Dove Medical	219033		/users/profile/282649	PeteTri	Volunteer	5	10/01/2014	Wonderful group of loving and concerned people wanting to help parents make informed decisions about their unborn babies.  Thanks for being here in our community.
Dove Medical	218890		/users/profile/282490	Bev_5	Board Member	5	10/01/2014	I started on the Board of Directors in 1997 and have been with them ever since.  I have watched this wonderful organization grow and flourish by providing excellent service to its patients.  Dove Medical truly is making a difference in the community. 
Cascades Raptor Center	82037		/users/profile/90015	kittyluvsbirdie	Volunteer	5	03/12/2011	Every time I help with a wild bird that is being rehabilitated I think "thank goodness this place is here, or what would have happened to this bird?"  Every bird, including the residents who could not be released, are given the best care.  The staff are extremely knowledgeable and take the time to answer any question.  From my experience everyone appreciates each other and are enthusiastic for the common goal - helping birds.  The rewards are simple but wonderful; knowing that you helped save or care for an animal that needed some help.  
Cascades Raptor Center	81916		/users/profile/89835	hairchoppr	Volunteer	5	03/11/2011	The first time I went to Cascades Raptor Center I couldnt believe how majestic the birds were, and I got to see them up close! I have always been rather afraid of birds, but fell in love right then and there. I wanted more, so I signed up to volunteer. Boy have I learned a lot in 9 months! The facility is well run with lots of volunteer help like mine, and a small staff who can fix up a bird in their sleep. I especially love the hospital, where I am learning to repair broken wings, give fluids and food to birds that are injured, and watch magnificent birds heal and be released back into the wild. I took a class on wildlife rehabilitation, where we learned to give medication and all about disease. It was an intensive 2 day class that was hard and wonderful at the same time.I love being part of a team, even when it involves dirty work like cleaning up the mice and chick barn, shoveling gravel in the cages, and cleaning, cleaning, cleaning up after our birds.Raptors are beautiful creatures, and I am learning more every day here at Cascades. I get dirty, I get mad, I get poo on my shoes. But it is an experience I love. And the birds who get set free make it all worth it.
Cascades Raptor Center	81885	1	/users/profile/89796	reverence	Volunteer	4	03/11/2011	Volunteering at the Cascades Raptor Center  since December of last year has been such an incredible experience for me. I was drawn to wildlife rehabilitation work, not really birds in particular, but I checked out their website and made the contact. Being an organization run by only three staff people and the rest volunteer, it's astounding how much is done by volunteers.It is well-organized and the staff is always open to suggestions and new ideas.I'm a certified bird geek now! The enthusiasm and dedication of the staff is contagious. They are open to questions, so that there is always an opportunity to learn new things on each shift.The team effort of the volunteers downright blows me away. they have an amazing group of people volunteering there.My main suggestion, if there was a way to do it, would be to offer a training as opposed to having volunteers train other volunteers. I feel that the training is variable depending on who trains you. Sometimes I am frustrated with things that aren't done as well as they could be. I feel that it could help if every volunteer was working from the same baseline of training. 
Cascades Raptor Center	81884	1	/users/profile/89795	justme402	Volunteer	5	03/11/2011	If there was ever a place where you can go to be with great friendly people and with folks who know their birds, it's the CRC in Eugene, OR. Not only do they take the time to explain things to you, they genuienly care about everyone there. They accept people as they are and work with them and their strengths. They take a proactive approach to working together and are willing to help you understand how things work in "birdland." Being new to birds, I want to learn and the staff takes the time to help you without judging you.  Specifically, they are there to help you help the birds by showing you how to care for them and how you can make a difference. They work with you and are willing to give you the time you need to learn. In a word they are "Awesome!" 
Cascades Raptor Center	81798		/users/profile/89692	gyrkin	Volunteer	5	03/10/2011	Great place to learn about raptors and to work in a friendly environment..
Cascades Raptor Center	81698		/users/profile/89552	Morgan M.	Volunteer	5	03/10/2011	The Cascade Raptor center is an earth friendly environment for our resident birds, and our visitors. I first came to the Raptor center looking for a fun and educational experience and I received much more than that. I met friendly people, birds, and I had an adventure. If I could re choose where I volunteer, well I wouldn't. From personal experience I know that the Cascade Raptor Center(CRC) recycles everything that we are able to recycle, we compost, and the center, in general, is outside. What I mean by this is that the birds feel the sunshine, the rain, and the snow. Our whole mission is to save and help birds that need our assistance. I believe CRC would be a great candidate for the Green Choice.
Cascades Raptor Center	81691		/users/profile/89543	fibonaccho	Volunteer	5	03/09/2011	I started volunteering at the Raptor Center this year, and have been having a blast! The birds are incredible, the setting is beautiful, and the staff is passionate and committed. I only wish I had found out about this place sooner!
Cascades Raptor Center	81686		/users/profile/89536	Terry	Volunteer	5	03/09/2011	I was running late, but still had to stop to get Zach her treat.  She had grown accustomed to them and started screaming as soon as she saw me get out of the car.  She was the queen and I was her faithful servant-that much we had established.  As I approached she began saying "Thank you" over and over, as was her custom.  You see, Zach was a female Raven who has captured my heart.  Sadly, she died suddenly in January from unknown causes.  When I saw her last she was in an incubator.  I had brought her a boiled egg-one of her favorites.  To appease me, she pecked at it a little, but it was clear she had no appetite.   I preeened her feathers and as I started to leave I told her to get better.  She held my gaze as only a Raven can and I knew this was the last time I would see her.  She died two days later.  I love to volunteer at CRC because this type of relationship with the birds is understood and encouraged.  As a natural consequence the birds receive excellent care because the voluteers have developed bonds with them and are highly motivated to provide the best care possible.
Cascades Raptor Center	37292	6	/users/profile/38024	vulture	General Member of the Public	5	04/28/2010	I came, I saw--and the birds conquered my heart! They are incredibly beautiful and, I think, very wise creatures.  It's a great privilege to be so close to them, and I can see the love and trust between the birds and their handlers.  I once watched a vulture perch on a handler's shoulder to eat its dinner (a vole or something similar).  I couldn't believe how daintily it ate!  The Center is a marvelous educational venue, and I only hope it will be able to expand both its enclosure and its outreach.  It deserves all the financial resources it can get!
Cascades Raptor Center	36774	5	/users/profile/37553	ins99	Donor	5	04/23/2010	My husband and I are avid supporters of Cascades Raptor Center since we visted them 3 years ago and saw the wonderful work that they do.  We have returned to visit every year and send donations throughout the year.  The staff at CRC is always so knowledgeable and willing to share.  We have felt very special when they have brought raptors for us to see outside the cages.  We have a duty to help the raptors that have been harmed and CRC is stepping up to provide that help.  It is one charity that we enjoy giving to often!  Sincerely, Stacie & Ignacio
Cascades Raptor Center	36492	6	/users/profile/37275	anne10	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2010	Cascades Raptor Center volunteers are at every event in town. It is thrilling to watch their educational programs and to watch the faces of the audience, especially the children. As volunteers provide information about the behavior, ecology and conservation needs of the raptors, the bird ambassadors mesmerize the audience. The volunteers are tireless in providing these programs, and their passion for and commitment to preserving these birds shines through.When they release rehabilitated birds, we get to watch. The media are also invited, and people of the community get to participate emotionally in the joy of seeing these beautiful creatures, that would have died otherwise, lift off into the sky. I cry each time I see this and that feeling bonds me to the birds and their future. It commits me to doing everything I can to keep the environment safe for wild creature survival. If one multiplies that feeling community-wide, the Cascades Raptor Center is doing an amazing job to help not only the birds but the environment overall.There is one last part to my experience with them. I thought that I would have time to volunteer in 2006 and was given the initial orientation for volunteers. It is there that I learned about the amazing amount of work it takes to rehabilitate raptors. Everything from raising and keeping a mouse colony in order to provide live food for the raptors to repairing or building cages is done daily, week after week, in order to rehabilitate the birds. I was unable to find the time to volunteer, but my heart is with the amazing people who volunteer at least one day a week, year after year.
Cascades Raptor Center	36468	7	/users/profile/37253	Barbara	Volunteer	5	04/22/2010	This is the most amazing group of extremely dedicated people doing their utmost to both aid the raptors they care for in their rehabilitation, but also in their dual role as educators of the public. They bring birds to public events, a time-consuming effort, in order that people might see these fascinating birds up close, to awaken the urge to care for them to better protect the birds themselves and their habitats for future generations.I used to be able to physically provide time, but running my own business has prevented that recently, so I dedicate time to poignancy art work and creating images for their outreach efforts. This is the single organization that I've donated funds and time to in the past 4-5 years due to the outstanding, dedicated efforts of both staff and volunteers.Not only is their care of the birds they help outstanding, but their efforts to include members and reach out to the community is exemplary as well.
Cascades Raptor Center	36461	7	/users/profile/37244	bfs	Donor	5	04/22/2010	Staff and volunteers are passionately committted to the care and rehabiliation of raptors that have been damaged and unable to return to their habitat without the intervention of experts who can evaluate their chances of survival on their own. The Raptor Center provides rehabilitatation and care for the duration of their stay. If a raprot must remain at the Center, they are expertly cared for and used for education projects to enable the public to become familiar with this species. The center is successful in inspiring a devoted cadre of volunteers who assist with care and raise funds to sustain the Center and its mission. The Center does a superb job in all these undertakings and should be helped and encouraged to continue their efforts on behalf of our precious wildlife.

Linn County Animal Rescue	208042		/users/profile/270726	kris216	Volunteer	5	07/31/2014	I have loved horses all my life and as I can't afford a horse right now, I choose to help all the horses at LCAR.  Everybody volunteers their time, no one is paid so I know they love the horses they are helping.  I have seen the horses come into rescue in bad shape and after loving care given by the volunteers, be adopted out to great homes.
Linn County Animal Rescue	174045		/users/profile/230260	Jmglight	Volunteer	5	10/05/2013	The people who own this rescue have hearts as big as houses. The animals seem to feel at home here, and the facilities are constantly being improved.  I am proud to be a volunteer for LCAR. 
Linn County Animal Rescue	173953		/users/profile/230115	Ginger7	General Member of the Public	5	10/05/2013	I have been lucky enough to visit Linn Rescue in person. They have horses in all stages of life, and those that have been recently brought in show hope in the eyes of each and every horse. They are once again loved and being treated as they majestically should with good food, clean water, clean stalls, fresh grass, and lots of love.  Linn Rescue gets some of the worst cases of abuse, and have so much love for each one that arrives. They have a great bunch of people who work very hard. 
Linn County Animal Rescue	170565		/users/profile/226000	BORO	Volunteer	5	09/19/2013	As a hands on "verified" equine rescue and sanctuary, LCAR is a "place of healing". Abused and neglected horses need a place to heal both physically and mentally, that place is here. Each horse is treated as an individual with individual needs. A group of dedicated volunteers see to the needs of the animals, everything from clean stall to clean horses. The re feeding program that has been developed for the starving rescued equine has a very high success record. Help this very worthy rescue help the horses in need. Its all about the horses.

Linn County Animal Rescue	168863		/users/profile/223835	sweethome10	Volunteer	5	09/10/2013	My husband and I have been volunteers for over 2 years.  We do it because  of our love of animals.  LCAR is a very caring place for the abused and mistreated horses that have been seized by the Sheriff.  Everyone is volunteer and works very hard to help these horses have a better life.  
Linn County Animal Rescue	168314		/users/profile/223198	donnaparty	General Member of the Public	5	09/08/2013	LCAR has provided our community with an extremely valuable service.  This organization and its wonderful volunteers tend to a large number of animals each year.  They take horses (and many other animals) that are in serious states of medical decline and neglect.  The animals are then professionally assessed and a recovery plan is developed and progress monitored.   Once these animals are brought back to stable health and weight they are worked with and assessed.  They often become eligible for adoption.  The animals for adoptions go on to be 4-H horses, companions, trail horses and endless other ventures.  But without LCAR many of these animals wouldnt have a future.  Instead they are able to become healthy, happy and LOVED companions.   OUTSTANDING WORK LCAR!!
Linn County Animal Rescue	130216		/users/profile/175682	klittle	Volunteer	5	10/27/2012	I became a volunteer at LCAR when I moved to Oregon almost 2 years ago.  It is a way of giving back to all the horses I have owned and loved.  No one is paid for anything, work or donations. We get nothing from the county or state to support the horses that are siezed and all the medical and feed is a gift to bring them back to health.  Everyone gives their all for the horses.  Many are permanent residents as they have medical issues, but we give our all to make their lives happy.  It is very rewarding work.
Linn County Animal Rescue	89581		/users/profile/101890	BJRO	Volunteer	5	06/03/2011	Because this organization has no paid employees, 100% of everything donated goes back to the rescued animals. It is great way to know your donation will be used entirely for the reason you wanted to give it, to help the abused and neglected animals. The animals are treated with loving hands on care, each one has its own special needs. Give from the heart and help a "VERIFIED" non profit organization save the lifes of neglected horses and give them a second chance at life. 
Linn County Animal Rescue	39134	6	/users/profile/40082	earthgirl	Volunteer	4	05/16/2010	I was looking for a way to give back to my community when I came across Linn County Animal Rescue's website. The open house gave me an opportunity to tour the faculty. Its very impressive to see so many horses looking so happy and healthy after seeing their before pictures. The dedication shown by the founding members impressed me so much that I decided to become a volunteer. Giving my time to a rescue which is focused on my passion, Horses, meeting like minded people and working towards a common goal; Has been a wonderful experience!
Linn County Animal Rescue	38215	6	/users/profile/39105	awatson	Volunteer	5	05/07/2010	I found out about the Linn County Animal Rescue when my daughter decided to do a 4-H presentation about the rescue.  After attending a volunteer meeting we immediately became volunteers ourselves.  I was suprised to learn that the organization is the only one of its kind in the state of Oregon and they rely soley on donations for funding.  They take in neglected and abused horses seized by the sheriffs department, bring them back to good health, and try to find approved loving homes for them to be fostered or adopted.  These horses often have special needs when they come to the facility.  I have witnessed first hand how local veterinarians, farriers,volunteers and businesses donate their expertise, time and money to help. It is amazing to watch a starved, scared horse come to the facility and realize that it will be cared for and fed on a regular basis.  My daughter and I are proud to be a part of the Linn County Animal Rescue.
StoveTeam International	316674		/users/profile/407900	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/30/2016	What an amazing volunteer experience Stove Team offers!  This group saves lives by establishing factories that build eco-friendly stoves that reduce the need and danger of open-fire burning in homes.  We worked a few days in a factory outside of Antigua, Guatemala, learning to build and assemble the stoves, and then delivered stoves at the end of our week to 5 families.  How rare to make such a significant impact in just a week!
StoveTeam International	312565		/users/profile/403931	scrantz	Volunteer	5	10/20/2016	I was able to work with Stove Team in Guatemala in 2015. It was a pleasure and a privilege to meet Nancy Hughes, the founder and also Marco Tulio, the owner of the factory near Antigua. They are doing impressive work for the people of Guatemala, creating jobs, building stoves for needy families, and working with the community. The trip I was on included half-day Spanish school every day and a visit to a village on Day of the Dead. We assisted at the factory in the afternoons and were able to go along when the stoves were installed in people's homes. It was a memorable trip and Stove team is a admirable non-profit.
StoveTeam International	305302		/users/profile/396542	Nancy267	Volunteer	5	09/18/2016	I helped start StoveTeam International, and we have worked hard to provide safe, affordable, portable fuel-efficient stoves to more than 56,000 individuals in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico and Nicaragua.  We take teams of individuals on a regular basis so they are exposed to the need in the rural communities.  Stoves can be donated for only $50.00 and change the lives of families.  Please visit our website at www.stoveteam.org to see the multiple videos. 
StoveTeam International	216371		/users/profile/279859	Nancy180	Volunteer	5	09/22/2014	This summer I spent a week with a wonderful group of people - volunteers, employees, entrepreneurs, lovely, happy, proud and hospitable Guatemalan people, and the one in charge, the one with the vision - the one who is a true inspiration, Nancy Hughes. Together we worked to help Marco Tulio, another big visionary, build ECOCOMAL stoves to fill orders of an ever-increasing demand. We also worked at building a bamboo stick constructed house that will add to Marco Tulio's repertoire of grand ideas. This is truly a phenomenal endeavor. This nonprofit gets my vote!!! Nancy
StoveTeam International	216135		/users/profile/163062	Rocky R.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/21/2014	StoveTeam International not only provides technological solutions with health and ecological benefits, they build local level employment via their stove factories. With a dedicated and competent staff, they have been a leader in the clean cooking revolution.
StoveTeam International	205304		/users/profile/267445	chica58	Volunteer	5	07/07/2014	We worked in the stove factory helping with 2 main tasks.  The factory was very busy trying to fill an order for 600 stoves, so our help, although we did have a learning curve initially, was beneficial.  The thought that my hands filled stoves with pumice for insulation and my trowel smoothed out the concrete top of the stove and that someone, somewhere in Guatemala would be using this exact stove soon, was heartwarming.  We also helped with factory expansion by helping to construct a cabana where the factory owner dreams that one day visitors will stay while experiencing stove making.  We also made a visit to a home where they cooked on the ground, learning about the challenges of  trying to cook tortillas in the rain.  We provided this family with a fuel efficient stove in exchange for their effort to help us understand the challenges of the open fire.  The overall experience was well rounded and intimate.  I definitely will want to return for a similar experience.
StoveTeam International	196117		/users/profile/256403	lynnewintermute	Volunteer	5	03/21/2014	I have just returned from a Stove Team trip to Oaxaca and Nochixtlian Mexico, what a wonderful experience.We were building a Stove Factory in a small town that will serve the surrounding villages.I learned how to stucco the way it has been done in Mexico for hundreds of years ( and it was a great upper body workout!). We worked hard but had lots of time for interesting experiences, visiting villages to introduce our stoves, visiting ruins,churches, even a little shopping.Great food and great company on this very well planned trip. This was my 4th Rotary related international trip and it was the best, can't wait to go on another!

Volunteer	5	12/08/2012	I was one of the student coordinator through the University of Oregon Alternative Spring Break program that traveled to Honduras with StoveTeam. It was one of the most memorable  experiences of my college career. I think I can speak with the entire group when I say that. Not only were our hosts, Annibal and Rosanna, the most hospitable, friendly, warm people I've ever had the chance to meet, but the cause is such an important one and it truly felt like we were making a difference in other peoples lives. Empty your pockets, go with them to Honduras. Once you meet these people you will never turn back!
StoveTeam International	143227		/users/profile/189666	Linda Carnine	Volunteer	5	11/27/2012	Having just returned from San Miguel de Allende, Mexico, I want to applaud the StoveTeam in combining a wonderful travel adventure with the opportunity to leave a little something positive in the country you have visited as well.  Our volunteer work was very satisfying, helping families in relatively remote villages use the ecocide stove (developed by STI) to not only save 40% more wood, but provide smoke free burning and much less danger for burning children.  The nights in the charming city provided outstanding cuisine and entertainment as well.  A perfect  combo.
StoveTeam International	141805		/users/profile/188194	lyalicia0	Volunteer	5	11/20/2012	StoveTeam International is one of the most amazing organizations I have ever worked with!  They have a great cause that helps improve health, safety, and sustainability.  All of the people I worked with on their team are inspiring and hard working.  StoveTeam has touched many lives.
StoveTeam International	137763	1	/users/profile/183764	MariaFCB	General Member of the Public	5	11/12/2012	StoveTeam brings people improved health and safety. It is highly admirable how they utilize modern wood stove industry innovations to help people dependant on fire as a basic life need. They were open to offer of volunteer help and quickly found a way for high school students to participate and be helpful. They made arrangements convenient for participants and extended every kind of assistance available to include the group's offer to help. 
StoveTeam International	132363	1	/users/profile/177997	Patti14	Volunteer	5	11/01/2012	Stove Team has provided volunteers with exceptional opportunities to facilitate the delivery of energy efficient stoves to families (who were cooking on open fires) in Mexico and Central America.  The opportunity to help build a locally owned factory in-country is an incredibly powerful experience.  The model that Stove Team International has created is a sustainable design that will impact the environment and individual lives long into the future.  I am a proud volunteer and hope to continue volunteering when the opportunity arises again.
StoveTeam International	131659	1	/users/profile/177236	aviatorbdm	General Member of the Public	5	10/31/2012	The work Stove Team does is invaluable and incalculatable.  This is a simple concept but can make an enormous impact on peoples lives.  Keep up the great work!
Playwrite	314934		/users/profile/406283	obtauro	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/26/2016	Let me tell you, the work that PlayWrite, Inc. does for this community is so very valuable. "Youth on the edge", i.e. those that are served by PW and its offerings, are bursting with creative energy, charisma and strong, unique voices. PlayWrite gives these young people a safe, playful environment wherein they can further hone their voices and points of view. Priceless, for sure. Keep up the great work, PlayWrite! Thank you. 
Playwrite	313995		/users/profile/405355	pc7291	Advisor	5	10/24/2016	I want to extend a kudos to the members of the PlayWrite company.  My students participated in a PlayWrite workshop.  Each of these students had their own story to tell, but no one had ever taken the time to dig deep in to that story.  Each of the mentors worked with these students to find their voice.  Several times students came to me and said this is too hard, but each onf them continued throguh the whole process.  At the end they felt accomplished and heard.  8 weeks later, they are still talking about this experience and that they are happy that they did not quit.  I would recommend this to any group that works with at risk youth.  The students see themselves in a new light.
Playwrite	194262		/users/profile/253810	Wapiti	General Member of the Public	5	02/13/2014	I recently attended a performance by students of Playwrite in Portland, OR.  For me it was such an inspiring experience with stories that are so real, written from the heart of at risk students about their lives and acted out by volunteer professional actors.  Inspiring yes but also heartbreaking at the same time.  Bravo to all the people at Playwrite who are giving these kids an opportunity to feel valued and show them that they do have gifts to offer this world.  Bravo!  
Playwrite	102041		/users/profile/131960	getsmyvote	General Member of the Public	5	12/08/2011	The first time I saw a live PlayWrite performance, I was blown away.  It's incredible what these kids write when they've been given a safe and supportive creative space to express themselves.  It's like watching healing happen onstage.  Beautiful, beautiful work!!
Playwrite	89128		/users/profile/30118	steve6	Board Member	5	05/24/2011	PlayWrite is a wonderful nonprofit that works one on one with kids at the edge. During a two week workshops students write a short play composed of characters that can only be inanimate objects or animals.  The students then direct professional actors in their loosely autobiographical work.  Seeing their work played out in front of them, students are helped to move past the issues holding them back.  In many cases the creative energy tapped into to create the play open the floodgates on the river of life.
Playwrite	29075	7	/users/profile/30118	steve6	Board Member	5	02/18/2010	PlayWrite provides a great opportunity for youth by giving them voice and a creative outlet to work through hardships. The coaches know how to encourage them and when to push just a little to let them tell their stories using inanimate objects and aminals. I love watching the youth introduce their work and how they react seeing it brought to life by professional actors and musicians.
Playwrite	32246	10	/users/profile/33036	bpaul	Former staff	5	03/02/2010	As a coach, I can state unequivocally that this program has an effect on every writer that participates in the workshop.  The result varies per student, but one consistent effect I've seen is a noted increase in self esteem and willingness to put themselves "out there" in the world.  The insistence by the program that the art they produce be emotionally connected also works deeply and mysteriously with the writers.  I could use phrases like "release of embedded trauma," or "a gentle yet effective catharsis" -- but these phrases are too clinical, and yet not all-encompassing enough.  The writers are helped, emotionally.  That's the best way to put it.  Every one of them is helped emotionally when they work through one of our workshops and see their art on stage. Also, I want to say that this is some of the most challenging, exacting, and exciting work I've ever done.  The skill set it takes to be a writing coach in this program is vast, and the amount of intuition and on-your-feet flexibility needed can be mind boggling.  The veteran coaches at Playwrite are masters of a rare and enviable skill, make no mistake.
Playwrite	29785	10	/users/profile/30778	mezz	General Member of the Public	5	02/22/2010	I was invited to see the staged production of ten one act-plays, written by students from the Portland Night High School as they participated in a program with PlayWrite.As a teacher for thirty-six years, what I witnessed was a transforming experience for the audience, the student writers and the members of PlayWrite.  The depth of emotion, the crafting of scene and word to convey feeling and understanding, the reflection of perspective, all within a coherent story line was overpowering.  In extended discussions with the students and the actors after the performance, I came to understand the impact of the PlayWrite program on the growth and development of the students that had been involved.  The stretch of imagination, the accumulation and assembly of vocabulary, the bond between writer and actor, all represent a powerful lifetime experience, especially for the students, which will shape and guide their future education and life.The students in the Night High have been described in various terms over the thirty-year existence of this award-winning School.  The best one I know is the one that described them as having been left for dead on the road of education.  The Night School has acquired a reputation for developing or arranging for life preserving techniques in learning.  Its several year association with the folks involved with the PlayWrite Program is one of those major, life-sustaining situations.At a time when all the regular resources for public education have narrowed sharply, it is enormously important that programs like PlayWrite receive support from organizations like the one you represent.  Its influence on the lives of future generations can be clearly observed.
Playwrite	29737	11	/users/profile/30733	corbett	Volunteer	5	02/22/2010	I live in a rural area of North Central Washington state where I practice law and work with youth at the Alternative High School.  A friend who is on the PlayWrite Board asked me to donate some legal services to the organization.  Through this work, I learned about the amazing work (miracles really) that Bruce and his coaches and talented Portland area actors perform with youth, many of them at the fringes, in Portland.  I attended the December plays and was blown away by the ability of this program to release emotional angst in a safe and supportive environment while providing an amazing experience to encourage further creativity and to foster confidence in a lost and marginalized population.As a result of the experiences I have seen with youth involved with PlayWrite in Portland, I am working with the arts council in the area where I live to try to bring Bruce and his magic to the disenfranchised rural youth where I live.  Unlike therapy alone, by combining a safe exploration of life experiences and feelings with creative expression and the support of talent in the local arts community, I truly believe that this organization reaches and transforms the core of some young souls who otherwise might be lost to us and to themselves.I cannot say enough good things about the dedication of this staff and the work that they are doing.
Playwrite	29329	11	/users/profile/30357	barb123	General Member of the Public	5	02/19/2010	I look forward to attending each performance I can.  The creativity of the shared stories is amazing and the volunteer actors are wonderful at making the characters come to life.  I am impressed by the great support the kids receive and their obvious pride in being an author and a director of their own work!  Speaking to my seatmate at one performance, I asked him (a teacher) if he noticed a difference in students after they had participated in PlayWrite.  He emphatically said Yes!,he certainly did.  This is my favorite nonprofit I wholeheartedly support.
Playwrite	29085	12	/users/profile/30129	amg1219	Board Member	5	02/18/2010	PlayWrite has a transformative effect on the kids involved. To watch their faces and body language change during the performances and to hear their comments afterwards is amazing.   The plays can pierce your heart with their intense emotions.
Playwrite	28937	6	/users/profile/29982	pema	General Member of the Public	5	02/18/2010	I wish I'd had Playwrite when I was a teen. Writing is one thing, and kids have to do it all through school. But when you get coached by playwrights to get your guts onto paper, and then see them stand up on stage and walk around, talk back to each other, and essentially get out of your head and into the world, you get to see how powerful you are, and how controllable your fears and issues are. Playwrite does transformative work. Congrats to the teens who take their expression to the stage.
Playwrite	28926	12	/users/profile/29971	megan3	General Member of the Public	5	02/18/2010	I recently had my first Playwrite experience. It is an amazing program.  I was very moved to see the work that the children that had so bravely shared.  Their  stories  were touching and profound and I respect the struggle and feelings they must have experienced in the process of writing the work.  I applaud all those involved, and believe that letting our youth process their experiences is not only healthy and transforming for those involved, but also for our whole community.  I do not know any of the writers, but I was proud of every one of them. I donated that night and know that this program needs to be funded richly!

Carter Reservoir Mustangs Inc	306134	4	/users/profile/397402	Sagerider	General Member of the Public	5	09/22/2016	I feel that if one takes the time to read the Carter Reservoir Mustangs Inc mission statement, it would be so clear as to why to preserve the integrity, health and blood line of this "special herd" is so important and a much needed worth while cause! I am very familiar with  mustang herds in the Surprise Valley area  since 1993, and particularly familiar with the Carter Herd since early 2002. So I feel I have a very clear understanding of  the negatives of not protecting these herdsI hope anyone and everyone  that reads the mission statement will agree that this work and objects need to continue for the protection and preservation of the Carter Herd as well as other herds of "wild mustangs" that are so much a part of our heritage!  This can be done by our donations!

Faith Community Nursing-Health Ministries Northwest	43774	7	/users/profile/44651	kathy51	Volunteer	4	06/12/2010	I became involved with NWPNM as an instructor of the beginning parish nurse courses. I have also attended national conference once.  This organization empowers nurses to provide faith based nursing care to their faith communities. The recipients of this care are assured that the care is supported by their faith beliefs.  The nurses can also provide explanations of the care needed and offer spiritual support.  Training of volunteers from the faith community is also part of a parish nurse's role.  These volunteers are able to reach out to those who may be lonely or have other needs. Nurses provide health promotion information such as how to manage administration of multiple medications, management of stress, and blood pressure control.  They may also do helmet fittings, provide information about immunizations, and promote exercise through walking groups.

Faith Community Nursing-Health Ministries Northwest	43358	7	/users/profile/44192	annettepn	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/09/2010	When I was nine years old, I made the two most important decisions of my life.  I accepted Christ as my savior and decided to be a nurse.Fifty years later, NWPNM gave me the skills to combine these passions in a formal way that increased my value in each field.  As a certification acknowledged by the American Nurses Association, I gained respect in my field.  As a Christian and as a nurse, I have learned new ways to aide people in difficult times in their lives. I have been challenged academically and personally to be a leader, and with their training, a more effective person. I always know I can find a colleague there with experience to guide me as I serve.

Pet Peace of Mind	317858		/users/profile/408989	conleyshannon	Board Member	5	11/01/2016	There are no words for the comfort a loving pet can give you in your final days.  Pet Peace of Mind gives individuals the resources to remain with what is often their primary companion and source of hope.  This is a priceless gift to have at the end of your life and an organization well worth supporting.
Pet Peace of Mind	313061		/users/profile/404432	Scott153	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/21/2016	I was lucky enough to grow up in the country and always was around pets.   They became my passion in life and I'm blessed to work with pets and people who love them every day.    The older you get the more you understand that person/pet bond.   I can't think of anything stronger than knowing that scruffy mutt is going to be beside you.    I give thanks every day for the things that Pet Peace of mind can do for both the pets and people who love them.   What a wonderful gift to give someone in the security in knowing that your "kids" will be cared for and placed.   We see stories all the time but how precious time and comfort is and that we have to help others live a life surrounded by love.   Thank you PPOM for making such an impact on clients lives.   
Pet Peace of Mind	312434		/users/profile/403801	Jessica308	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/20/2016	One of the most amazing relationships in life is that between pets and their owners. I get to see it every day. In addition to interactions with my own pets, as part of my career in the veterinaryfield I am witness to the enormous importance of the bond between pets and humans. This bond has been scientifically shown to keep humans healthy by lowering blood pressure and enhancing immune system function by reducing stress in our lives. I know from personal experience that cuddling my purring kitty or playing with my silly dog helps me when life sometimes seems overwhelming. I can't even imagine the concerns I would have about their care if I were incapacitated in some way. This is where Pet Peace Of Mind come in and helps those who have been diagnosed with a terminal illness and are in hospice care. They make sure the pet stays with the patient, is cared for during their illness and then is placed in a loving home once that person passes away. What a noble cause.
Pet Peace of Mind	312128		/users/profile/403486	bk063082	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/19/2016	Pet Peace of Mind (PPOM) is the most incredible, innovative charitable organization I have seen in a long time.  Their program is not only 100% charitable, but it is also 100% volunteer based.  There is passion behind this cause.  Not many people consider what may happen to their pets as they age.  PPOM keeps people and pets together through all of life's transitions.  What most impresses me, is the sustainability of the turn-key model.  Dianne McGill and the board of directors are interested in giving people/hospitals/hospices the means and the way to be successful to reach and help as many people and pets as possible.  I as a veterinarian truly believe this focus on how important the human animal bond is...is the wave of our health future.  It has been proven over and over that people heal from illnesses and diseases faster when they are bonded to a pet.  Quality of life is improved.  I cannot think of very many more noble organizations that Pet Peace of Mind.
Pet Peace of Mind	312049		/users/profile/403404	dollydog	Donor	5	10/19/2016	Pet Peace of Mind is a fantastic program!  We never thought about what would happen to our dogs if we got sick and couldn't take care of them.  We donate because we want to be sure hospice patients can keep their pets with them until the end and then have the pet go to a good home instead of ending up in a shelter. We've supported the program for about a year and they have always done  a great job using our donations.  We really like getting the thank you notes with stories about the pets that were helped with our money.  Keeo up the great work!
Pet Peace of Mind	311842		/users/profile/403198	SueD	Volunteer	5	10/18/2016	I wish I had known about Pet Peace of Mind in 2007 as I was working with Hospice and my mother was passing away.  I didnt have the capability of taking care of my mothers loving dog and I didnt realize how important it was to Mom. Although I didnt have a resource for help caring for Annie (dog) I found a good and loving home with someone my mother knew. Although, this was a relief to me I know my mother would have been so much happier to have been able to visit with Annie and have her at her side as she passed.Then I found out about Pet Peace of Mind.  Although I have not used them directly I have had the opportunity to help two people that I loved with the knowledge I have about the importance of the pet bond at the end of life because of Pet Peace of Mind.The next two experiences are intertwined in a matter of two months in 2013: my brother was very ill and in Nevada; and a dear friend was terminal here in Portland. I was caring for my friends cat, Lily, as her owner was in hospice.  At the same time my brothers condition worsened and hospice was called in. Luckily I had my very own Pet Peace of Mind friend and neighbor here in Portland.  I was back and forth from Portland to NV and my friend cared for Lily when I was out of town.  Thank goodness my friend was able to help out, she groomed, fed and loved the cat in my absence and the most important thing she did was take Lily to his bedside. Lily would spread across his body and soothed him during visits.  As soon as Lily arrived and spread out lovingly across him he relaxed.  He was so comforted by her just snugging up to him at the end.My brother's experience was similar. Hospice had been with him only a couple of days before he passed on.  He loved his pets as much as our mother did.  His beloved dog was sleeping  at his side by the fireplace and his cat crawled up and sprawled across him and purred.  Although he was not awake he was comforted by those two loving pets.
Pet Peace of Mind	311434		/users/profile/402786	Writer	Donor	5	10/17/2016	Pet Peace of Mind is such a valuable organization. Its the only nonprofit that has recognized the tragic absence of support for hospice patients regarding their companion pets and put into action programs to fill this gap. Since its inception in 2009, I have supported Pet Peace of Mind with donations and design services. During these years I have been so impressed with their endless compassion and highest integrity. Please contribute to Pet Peace of Mind so they can continue helping hospice and palliative care patients keep and care for their pets.
Pet Peace of Mind	311279		/users/profile/402619	ktgreene	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/17/2016	I see daily the impact Pet Peace of Mind has on patients and families. The service keep patients with their animal companions during their end of life journey and it is a type of support that no human can provide a patient.  Our caregivers are so thankful for the transportation support because they do not want to leave their loved one. The patients are grateful that Columbus Hospice recognizes the special bond they have with their pet and the support we give to keep them together. Pet Peace of Mind improves the quality of life for our patients!!!
Pet Peace of Mind	311050		/users/profile/402386	viper19692	Donor	5	10/15/2016	I am a girl that was fortunate enough to have grandparents that loved animals. I learned this love from them. They are now both gone, but their love of animals lives on in me. When I learned about Pet Peace of Mind I was thrilled because it does what I wish could happen for every pet/person pair; they are together until the end. They provide money and services for pet people who are at their most vulnerable and they provide the peace of mind that only comes from truly knowing that their pet babies will be well cared for after they pass. It is a privilege to be able to support this program because they show me each month how my money is helping people and pets. They are accountable, responsible and dependable.
Pet Peace of Mind	310873		/users/profile/402210	Terri82	Board Member	5	10/14/2016	Our hospice has the honor and privilege of offering this wonderful program to our patients and their pets for over 6+ years.  We have witnessed the importance of pets in the lives of our patients.  The Pet Peace of Mind program provides pet care to those who cannot provide services on their own.  We cannot imagine not offering the program at our hospice.  The program provides an extra layer of care to those who need it most.  I am honored to be a founding board member of this wonderful organization.
Pet Peace of Mind	289982		/users/profile/380253	A.Plowman	Board Member	5	05/15/2016	When I learned a program existed to help hospice patients keep their pets during what can be an emotional transition, I wanted to get involved. My family was fortunate we were able to keep my grandma and her dog, Snuggles, together during her time with hospice, while also giving her peace knowing Snuggles would go on to live with my mom after she passed away. Not everyone has this peace of mind. Often times, they have to say good-bye to their best friends because they are no longer able to care for themcreating unnecessary suffering for the patient and their pet. Pet Peace of Mind inspires me because the work they do helps pets remain with their pet parents, in their loving home when they need each other the most.Please consider supporting Pet Peace of Mind so they can continue providing hospice patients with financial assistance (e.g., medications, food, supplies for their pets) and training volunteers to take special care of their pets during these challenging times (e.g., taking them on walks, to grooming appointments, and for check-ups with the veterinarian). 
Pet Peace of Mind	282752		/users/profile/372916	Bob_99	Board Member	5	03/18/2016	As a veterinarian I've had the privilege of witnessing the magic connection between pets and people throughout my career. Perhaps nowhere in my experience is that special bond more important than at end of life for elderly people in need. Often a hospice patients only companion is their pet. Pet Peace of Mind sees to the needs of these pets throughout the hospice process, maintaining the love and support provided by four legged family members. At end of life Pet Peace of Mind re-homes the pet and thus begins another bond between pets and people. Please support this worthy cause.
Friends of Family Farmers	120151		/users/profile/163386	Abby N.	General Member of the Public	5	08/08/2012	I had the privilege to work as an Advisor on a visionary project FOFF were attempting to fund. I was deeply impressed with the teamwork, positive energy, community building, and professionalism this group brought to the table.  As a consumer who votes with my dollar and truly cares about the quality of my food, I am eager to support such an important organization as Friends of Family Farmers!
Friends of Family Farmers	113047	1	/users/profile/153846	DancingRoots	Professional with expertise in this field	4	05/26/2012	As small farmers for over 15 years, when we heard of this group we thought, "finally!" Finally there is an advocate for small scale, direct-market farmers who are concerned about protecting our Earth, the importance of local food systems and the long-term viability of farmers. The Farm Bureau essentially ignored us & didn't take us seriously, and they certainly didn't represent us at the state legislature. Friends of Family Farmers works for those of us who tend the land as well as the growing population of folks who want to know the source of their food and to know it was grown with love and care. We are extremely grateful for the work of FoFF.
Friends of Family Farmers	111262		/users/profile/151482	Olivia H.	General Member of the Public	5	05/02/2012	This organization plays a vital role connecting people and ideas back to the land.  They truly are Friends of Family Farmers!
Friends of Family Farmers	111222		/users/profile/151405	Janie M.	General Member of the Public	4	05/01/2012	This organization does a great job of connecting people and organizations. I love the InFarmation workshops they hold. I've learned a lot from attending. Thanks, FoFF!
Friends of Family Farmers	111197		/users/profile/151342	Martha12	Volunteer	5	05/01/2012	Newspaper headlines about Mad Cow Disease, eColi outbreaks, food product recalls, factory farming, inhumane treatment of animals, "pink slime" ground beef used in school lunches attest to the serious problems in the US food supply today.  Friends of Family Farmers advocates for Oregon's small farmers producing food in a healthy and environmentally responsible manner. Along the way, it works to educate eaters about the myriad challenges to farming and to a safe food supply. FoFF goes to the Capitol to lobby for legislation that is making an impact on the food we eat and the rules that govern agriculture in the state. It has carved out an important role to play at a time when the US food system is in need of drastic reform and family farmers face huge challenges.
Friends of Family Farmers	111195		/users/profile/151340	JanRo	Volunteer	5	05/01/2012	Friends of Family Farmers does SO much for local communities that it is difficult to know where to begin. One VERY successful project was changing the Oregon law for jam/jelly-making & pickle-making. These items are now MUCH more accessible at Farmer's markets because of the efforts of FoFF. They also supported the founding of an Oregon State Bank last year in Salem. This would have helped not only family farmers but also small, local businesses. I am sure that they will continue with this effort next year. Their monthly newsletters provide information on upcoming events and links to various "farmer friendly" sites. Someone recently told me that FoFF was a national organization because it is so well-run and making a difference.
Friends of Family Farmers	111186		/users/profile/151330	Darleen V.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/30/2012	As an individual who was raised and now own a family farm; it is so exciting to have an organization that is helping us have our voices heard in Oregon!  Friends of Family Farmers, thank you for helping law makers see the perspective of farming from the small farm community.
Friends of Family Farmers	111174		/users/profile/151317	Caitlin B.	Volunteer	5	04/30/2012	Friends of Family Farmers embodies a method of community building in which culture, food and connection are pivotal. This practice is incredibly important to the well being of all communities, and each month at the InFARMation event that they host, I see it changing our local community for the better. As a volunteer, I have never felt so supported and personally enriched by a non-profit. The community connections that I have found through FoFF have changed my life, I would be lost without these women and the greater community that they have built. 
Friends of Family Farmers	111166		/users/profile/151308	kendrak	Board Member	5	04/30/2012	Friends of Family Farmers (FoFF) has grown to be the state's largest organization representing family-scale agriculture in Oregon.  The FoFF staff is a team of organized, creative and passionate people who are driven to ensure that family farmers can remain economically viable while not compromising the environment, the welfare of the animals or the quality of lives for their neighbors. I am honored and humbled to be part of such an amazing team of people. I believe that the climate for family farmers in Oregon is a better as a direct result of the work of this great organization! 
Friends of Family Farmers	111163	2	/users/profile/151305	Judith Y.	Volunteer	5	04/30/2012	Were all stakeholders in food and agriculture policy.  And Friends of Family Farmers is a grassroots organization that takes food responsibility seriously.  Comprised of food advocates, concerned citizens and farmers, the non-profit works to foster an approach to agriculture that not only respects the land, but also treats animals humanely and sustains local communities.Friends of Family Farmers supports regulations to prevent the environmentally unsound practices of corporate farms.  It promotes sensible policies and environmentally responsible regulations that allow Oregons family farmers to run successful enterprises while providing safe, fresh and nutritious food for all Oregonians.  The organization protects socially responsible and sustainable family scale agriculture, and offers its services to communities desiring to organize and advance socially responsible farming or build healthy local food systems. Most food travels long distances to reach our tables. Friends of Family Farmers encourages food shopping closer to home. The practice of eating food grown close to home minimizes our carbon footprint while supporting local food sources and revitalizing the local community.  Hundreds of farmers leave the land every week. This loss forecasts a bleak local food future. Friends of Family Farmers serves as a conduit and advisor to young farmers seeking to be good stewards of the land. And staff and volunteers provide educational meetings, classes and programs promoting consumer awareness of important land use, environmental and economic issues.
Friends of Family Farmers	111158		/users/profile/151299	Harriet F.	Volunteer	5	04/30/2012	Friends of Family Farmers works to support not only the livelihood and health of family farmers but the entire community.  The health issues related to access and availability of whole, healthy and affordable food has been paramount in our national dialogue but what is often overlooked are the small farmers that allow for this access.  Small local farmers can serve small local communities that are often overlooked by large corporate farms given to commodity cropping and export.  By the same hand, however, small family farmers do not benefit from the economies of scale or subsidies that many large corporate farms enjoy and, thereby, fall short of the support they need to prosper.  THAT is where Friends of Family Farmers shows its greatest strength by advocating for farmers, both as a friendly support and on the legislative level doing the work that small farmers are often too busy to engage in.  As a volunteer and strong supporter I can think of very few other organization that work to address the issues of food access, health and farmer advocacy quite so brilliantly.  It has been, and remains, and honor to work with them.  
Friends of Family Farmers	111157		/users/profile/151298	allea.martin	Volunteer	5	04/30/2012	Friends of Family Farmers is one of the most well-organized, creative, and effective non-profits I have come across. I discovered them when a friend invited me to an InFARMation session. These sessions happen every month. FoFF invites speakers from all over the region to discuss issues that affect both farmers and consumers. Whether it's Farm Bills, raising urban chickens, food labels, or CSas, the topics are always fascinating, and their website is a great resource for further research. No other group is doing as much great work to support our farmers and to help consumers become more educated and connected to the food system.  Thank you, FoFF, for helping to make me a better consumer, cultivator, and member of our community.
Bags of Love	286629		/users/profile/376699	LaDonna_B	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	God Answers Prayerinfo@bagsofloveinc.orgI was in bed stuck and depressed and didn't want to get up.  I had no desire to shower or get dressed.  I made myself make my husband's dinner but that was all.  He didn't understand me sleeping 20 hours a day and neither did I.  This went on for 3 months.  I was so discouraged I cried out to God many times 'This is not your plan for me, help me find a reason to get up with a purpose or an interest.' My Pastor's Mother asked me to go on a tour of 'Bags of Love.' I learned later they fill bags for children in crisis one Bag of Love at a time for newborns to age 17.  In these bags there is toiletries, toys, books, clothes, warm coats, gloves, hats, scarfs, and homemade quilts.  I had toured Bags of Love a year earlier without any interest at the time.  I wanted to please my Pastor's Mother so I said I would go.  The tour was exciting this time.  It was my time.  They offered me Tuesdays 10-12, and I could do that. Now I had my reason to get up and get dressed.  After my first Tuesday afternoon, I found out almost all of the volunteers were also 2 hours a week. I knew I needed more, I could do more.  The more I showed up the more they entrusted me with duties.  I felt needed and depended on and I had a purpose.  They were so grateful but how could they know they had done more for me than I had for them.  Now I was volunteering on Wednesday 12-2 and on Thursday 10-2, working fund raisers and helping teach Teen Challenge girls to sew and learn home and job skills.  God answered my prayer and led me to 'Bags of Love.'  I now also help Campus Life Middle-schoolers on Tuesday nights with life challenges.  Recently they had an all nighter and Fall retreat with I attended as a counselor. I'm 64 years old and I love my life.  I'm a late bloomer.  Thank you God for having patience with me.  This is all a part of the plan for my life.  Thanksgiving in coming up this week, I am one thankful person.
Bags of Love	228814		/users/profile/292496	rindy111	Volunteer	5	10/28/2014	I joined Bags of Love over five years ago and have acted as Secretary and Operations Director for that time period.  It as been a rewarding experience knowing that what I do helps so many children in crisis.  Everyone is a volunteer--no paid staff--so each person plays an important role in making Bags of Love reach as many children in our community as possible, whether it is sewing bags and quilts, filling bags or delivering bags, serving on the Board, or helping with fundraising events.  Our donors and sponsors play an important role, as well.  It really is a community effort on behalf of local children in crisis.  I enjoy meeting and working with all the people who devote their time, energy, and dollars to this wonderful non-profit organization.
Bags of Love	228774		/users/profile/292458	sgaudia	Volunteer	5	10/28/2014	I have volunteered at Bags of Love for almost three years and it's one of the best experiences of my retirement. All of the volunteers are selfless and give generously of their time and energy.  Founder Di Barrong is an inspiration to me, and she has truly made a reality out of a powerful vision. Bags of Love helps our community's kids in crisis and nothing could be better than that.
Bags of Love	228753		/users/profile/292434	Debbean	Volunteer	5	10/28/2014	I have been volunteering for a couple of years for Bags of Love. What a great organization. These bags are for kids that are in need. We fill home made bags with home made quilts, toys, toiletries, coats, underwear, socks and school bags.  It amazing how much need there is in the community!! I'm glad to be a part of it.
Bags of Love	228747		/users/profile/292426	Becky11111	Volunteer	5	10/28/2014	I began with Bags of Love five years ago and have watched it grow from a one room operation to our present warehouse.  Our volunteer  list has grown as well as the  number of agencies we serve and the donations.   My own involvement has grow from six hour a week to ten or twelve.  It has been exciting to work with a truly wonderful enthusiastic group of people and to see the gratitude of the agencies we serve.
Bags of Love	228734	1	/users/profile/292412	Dibar	Volunteer	5	10/28/2014	Very well organized charity that helps kids in our community.  They do a fabulous job and have a great group of volunteers that work hard and are truly committed. It is a pleasure to be there.
Bags of Love	228729		/users/profile/292406	kathryn31	Volunteer	5	10/28/2014	I am proud to be a part of this wonderful organization. 
Bags of Love	228718		/users/profile/292397	C_Lavender	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/28/2014	I have enormous admiration for the work Bags of Love does for traumatized and abused children.  From the many big-hearted volunteers to the Board to the Founder, Di Barrong, it is an unparalleled organization.  Love and compassion imbues everything they do and hope to do.  My thanks for their contributions to children in our community,
Bags of Love	228714		/users/profile/292393	bagsofloveinc.org	Volunteer	5	10/28/2014	This organization is a wonderful asset to our community. I truly enjoy the time that I spend with the other dedicated volunteers. 
Bags of Love	228706		/users/profile/292384	e.keizer	Volunteer	5	10/28/2014	I heard of Bags of Love through a friend about a year ago, and I'm so glad I did! I was so impressed by their immaculate warehouse and shelves of quilts and clothing - but most of all I was impressed by how much love really does go into making a bag. Everyone at the organization is a volunteer - I was amazed to see how carefully all the contents of each bag were assembled. It's heartwarming to know that there is a child in need on the other end of that bag crammed with toys, clothes, sleepwear, and school supplies. This is definitely an organization worth giving your time to.
Bags of Love	212472		/users/profile/275490	JamieStacklie	Board Member	5	08/27/2014	I was first introduced to Bags of Love in their early years and have watched this organization grow from one small room of supplies to a large warehouse serving hundereds of children in our community.  One thing that has never changed - it is an ALL VOLUNTEER organization!  How many non-profits have you worked with that can say that?  With a very supportive and active Board of Directors, to the amazing Executive team, along with the always dedicated weekly volunteers, this group has one mission - to help children in crisis, one bag of love at a time.
Bags of Love	208813		/users/profile/271560	Rob_30	General Member of the Public	5	08/06/2014	I follow this charity from afar due to a friend associated with the organization. That disclaimer aside, just look at the long list of charities in the area that work with them. Clearly they do good work, and have the support of many other effective charities.
JOIN	134585	5	/users/profile/180430	Tammy30	Client Served	5	11/06/2012	JOIN helped my daughter and I more than anyone could imagine.  After a DV incident with a roomate, we ended up in our car, broke because I had just paid rent before getting locked out, when all seemed bleak, an outreach worker showed up where we were parked, and 4 days later my daughter and I were in our own apartment. Working full time I was still not able to afford move in costs, join took that barrier away from me.  I OWE JOIN a very heart filled THANK YOU!
JOIN	125864	2	/users/profile/25291	ct	Board Member	5	10/16/2012	Join is an incedible link to our homeless individuals in Portland. They stretch every dollar as far as it can go and it is amazing what they accomplish. Saying no isn't an option, they find a way. Wish more non-profits could be as productive as Join.
JOIN	24191	2	/users/profile/25291	ct	Volunteer	5	12/16/2009	Join is an organization that does amazing things and continues to do amazing things at all hours of the night and day.  Their objective is to end homelessness and they make every effort to help those who are homeless find subsidized housing and a new start to life.The staff at JOIN are there for every kind of person solving every possible problem that comes up.  JOIN staff quickly become family and that is the definition of commitment.If there were more groups in this country like JOIN, things would be a little easier to handle.
JOIN	121114	1	/users/profile/164799	singshannon	Board Member	5	08/20/2012	JOIN partners with people experiencing homelessness and helps them rebuild a system of support to move forward on their journey of recovery.  The staff do this through developing authentic relationships with the people they serve, their friends.  The feeling of non-judgement, partnership, empathy, understanding, and support permeates the space at JOIN and spreads throughout its community.  JOIN's approach is unique in Portland and their success is proof that peoples' lives can change when we create space for them to heal.  It is the perfect vision of how I would like to see social services provided-- one where everyone is treated with dignity and respect for the simple fact that they are a human being.
JOIN	120584	1	/users/profile/164004	Elizabeth59	Volunteer	5	08/13/2012	I have been volunteering with JOIN for two years.  I can't say enough good things about them.  After a career in social services, I am so impressed by the JOIN model, which is so heart centered.  It's all about relationships.  Relationships with each other; the volunteers; the folks who drop in at The House in need of a warm smile, a friendly face, a place to rest, a bite to eat, a shower.  You know when you have the fortunate experience to have an encounter with a person who is completely genuine, warm and kind?  How you walk away feeling seen, acknowledged, and with your heart a little more open?  Well, that seems describe all of the JOIN staff, particularly the young Jesuit volunteers.  It's not an US and THEM model.  Rather the model is It's all Us, and let's do what we can to help our brothers and sisters.  And they do.  Watching it in action is amazing, and gives me hope.
JOIN	94112	1	/users/profile/108695	Orion L.	Donor	5	07/20/2011	I don't have a lot of money, but I like to share what I have with JOIN because I feel like they make a real difference in the lives of homeless families, WHILE the same time working on the root causes of homelessness. I know their director Mark Jolin for two decades has been a key player in Portland's efforts to make ending homeless a priority. When I've gone to JOIN, I've seen homeless parents and children and other individuals being treated with respect, trading barter work for locker use and showers and laundry, playing with their little ones in the lovely children's area, and getting referrals, resources and other support. Also I like supporting JOIN because they have a very unique model of sending outreach workers into homeless camps to build relationships with the marginalized folks there, and then works directly with landlords to get folks into housing. The combo of direct service and systemic change is hard to find, and JOIN does it really well.
JOIN	93836	1	/users/profile/108200	PWittwer	Volunteer	5	07/13/2011	   I've been a volunteer with JOIN for over four years.  I always look forward to being there because, even on difficult days, I'm inspired by the dedicated staff, volunteers and "folks" JOIN serves.  JOIN has cultivated a strong sense of community and it works.    I've watched this small non-profit struggle to meet growing challenges but not lose their integrity and quality of service .Their mission is different from many organizations helping the homeless.   Instead of providing temporary services,  they focus on   long lasting solutions.  They  believe in "housing first"  and then work with individuals and families to gain stability and self-sufficiency.     In spite of the challenges, JOIN's statistics are commendable.  They spend 87% of their budget on program expenses and less than 7% on administration. Last year they housed almost 500 individuals, including families, and they show an excellent retention rate.  I'm proud to be part of the JOIN community.                                         
JOIN	93782	1	/users/profile/108110	alpNP	Volunteer	5	07/12/2011	I started volunteering at JOIN when I was in high school and they were in a small house off St. Francis park. After nine years away from Portland I am back volunteering again. In those nine years JOIN has gone through two buildings, created many new programs and hired many new staff but they have held on to the spirit and integrity that makes them such a wonderful organization.  The work they do to help people find housing is rooted in a deep respect for people and for community and it shows in how they treat both volunteers and the folks they work with. It also shows in their tremendous housing outcomes. 
JOIN	93763	1	/users/profile/108082	casemanager10	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/12/2011	Through my role as a case manager in Multnomah County I have worked with JOIN numerous times.  They have really made my clients lives better by providing them with furnishings and much more.  The staff are always very friendly and helpful which makes my job easier and the experience for the client really exciting.  It has been an honor to work with JOIN and I hope that it continues to grow so it can serve even more families in Oregon.
JOIN	93490	1	/users/profile/107602	JGibbs	Volunteer	5	07/06/2011	JOIN is a wonderful organization that focuses on building relationships with its folks (they don't refer to them as clients). They understand each person has their own story and that each person's situation is different. They work with people on an individual basis, finding what help and resources  suit that person best, unlike other housing organizations that place people in categories and help them on the basis of that.  Their housing-first approach allows for people to get off the streets first before attempting to kick bad habits and addictions, providing them with the security and support that is needed.  JOIN maintains a consistent presence on the streets, building trust and relationships amongst those outside while reaching out to individuals in need of help (physically going out and finding them) that may not know where to find it.  JOIN really is a remarkable organization and I have never seen a more dedicated staff. 
JOIN	24248	1	/users/profile/25350	Chris B.	Board Member	5	12/16/2009	I became aware of JOIN through Marc Jolin, the executive director.  He invited me to take a look at their work.  That was 3 years ago.  I was then, and continue to be, in awe of the work that gets accomplished there.  I think because the staff and board focuses on personal relationships rather than broad policy, they are able to effectively identify what will really help folks in the moment, and get them to that place.  I have never worked with another organization that has as much spirit and dedication.I am currently on the Board Of Directors, and am also very impressed with the low overhead and the focus on getting resources to the folks they serve versus the organization itself.
JOIN	24046	5	/users/profile/25159	kjblake	Board Member	5	12/14/2009	Join is an exceptional results-focussed organization with amazing placement and retention rates for such a small orgainzation.  The philosopy is simple and works to assist individuals and families in the Portland Area.I am a Board Member who has contributed significant volunteer hours to this enterprise.
Lighthouse Farm Sanctuary	306111		/users/profile/397376	ellie_hurley	Volunteer	5	09/22/2016	Lighthouse is a peaceful, wonderful place for people of all ages to volunteer. They really emphasize community, so there's always a place for every volunteer. The animals are so wonderful and clearly well-cared for, and the experience of serving them is both humbling and more rewarding than you can imagine. Lighthouse is one of the best organizations I've ever volunteered with. 
Lighthouse Farm Sanctuary	306032		/users/profile/397297	NancySidley	Volunteer	5	09/22/2016	Lighthouse Farm Sanctuary is one of the most beautiful places on earth. I have been involved with them for about a year & my life has changed profoundly. The caretakers are so loving & consider all of the residents as family. They take the time to nurture each resident & treat them as individuals. Every time I go there I feel a sense of calming that is unlike anything I have ever experienced. The caretakers make it very easy to become a volunteer, even if you have never stepped foot on a farm before.They are also very kid friendly. Lighthouse Farm Sanctuary is the premier nonprofit in Oregon. I highly recommend it. 
Lighthouse Farm Sanctuary	306029		/users/profile/397296	mcarchdesigns	Volunteer	5	09/22/2016	I've been with Lighthouse Farm Sanctuary for over a year. While looking for a sanctuary to help I immediately fell in love with all the residents. I was moved in a way that I didn't know was possible and my bond and friendship with everyone and the residents continue to endure. Lighthouse Farm Sanctuary has changed a lot over the last year but the only constant is LHS's commitment to its residents. The residents are not only fortunate to have found refuge but are also family. I am confident that anyone who decides to stop in for a visit will be filled with the same joy that I was filled with which is why I do my best to make it in every weekend. This review wouldn't be complete without a little shout out to Cracker Jack Lamb my best bud who's full of character and full of surprises as are all other amazing and colorful residents at Lighthouse Farm Sanctuary!
Lighthouse Farm Sanctuary	305987		/users/profile/397255	M B.	General Member of the Public	5	09/21/2016	I recently went their yearly fundraiser. Such a great group of people who truly care about these animals and give them a loving home. The animals all looked very healthy and happy. I'll be going again soon! 
Lighthouse Farm Sanctuary	305985		/users/profile/397253	Melissa323	Board Member	5	09/21/2016	This place is MAGICAL. I have volunteered at multiple sanctuaries and I like them all, but this place won my heart and dedication- I've been volunteering there since Feb2016.  The animals are loved and well cared for and it is a wonderful community of people. There's no other sanctuary that I have been that allows you to be right in with the animals all the time (that's the magical part). I highly recommend volunteering there- you won't regret it!
Lighthouse Farm Sanctuary	305983		/users/profile/397251	sbala	Volunteer	5	09/21/2016	Great sanctuary run by a committed people who are also involved in spreading the message of veganism. I always enjoy a visit, whether for a work party or hanging out with the animals.
Lighthouse Farm Sanctuary	305976		/users/profile/397244	Lena_1	Volunteer	5	09/21/2016	It's a great place run by amazing people! They really care about the animals and give a wonderful home to those who have nowhere else to go!
Lighthouse Farm Sanctuary	305973		/users/profile/397241	eeyore77	Volunteer	5	09/21/2016	The caretakers at Lighthouse farm Sanctuary are some of the most caring and dedicated people I have ever met.  The residents who call the Sanctuary home are obviously well cared for and living their lives in safety and comfort.  Their well being is obviously of utmost importance.  It is a very peaceful place.
Lighthouse Farm Sanctuary	305957		/users/profile/397227	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/21/2016	Lighthouse Farm Sanctuary does great work on behalf of farmed animals.
Lighthouse Farm Sanctuary	305950		/users/profile/397220	Jenifer N.	Volunteer	5	09/21/2016	This is such a well loved sanctuary. The Jakubisin family is such a caring couple. Upon arrival you willbl be greeted by big smiles and an honest hello, how are you? You are welcomed to come visit the animals or if you feel like lending a much needed hand you can sign up to volunteer. I love that veganism is encouraged and they show so much respect to the animals by asking you not to bring any animal product on the premises. The animals are well loved and are free to roam in a safe good sized farm. Our family loves this sanctuary. We have made a few great animal friends and sadly a few beautiful souls who are no longer. We would love to see this sanctuary maintained for years to come. 
Lighthouse Farm Sanctuary	305935		/users/profile/241973	Beldav	Board Member	5	09/21/2016	An amazing sanctuary who care for over 180 animals who have nowhere else to go. By spending time there, it is plain to see that each and every one of these animals is well cared for a loved. 
Lighthouse Farm Sanctuary	305934		/users/profile/397205	s.c.vegan	General Member of the Public	5	09/21/2016	I've never had the pleasure of visiting Lighthouse Farm Sanctuary, but I have gotten to know a little bit about one of the people running the place. I believe they are working very hard to make Lighthouse the best that it can be, and do everything in their power to care for the animals in their charge. Thank you Lighthouse Farm Sanctuary for being a voice for the animals, and a safe place for them to live out their days! 
Green Empowerment	152462		/users/profile/133207	Ogden	Donor	5	04/05/2013	This is an organization which has been recognized as doing so very much with very little. Clean water and rural electrification are critical to improved conditions for impoverished communities. 
Green Empowerment	102342		/users/profile/133207	Ogden	Board Member	5	12/15/2011	I am continually amazed at how much the organization does to bring electricty and water infrastructure to the most marginalized communities in the world.
Green Empowerment	140467		/users/profile/186647	Bridget5	Donor	5	11/16/2012	Green Empowerment has all the elements I value in a nonprofit.  Their green energy projects in third world countries promote sustainability, economic development and train local workers. Green Empowerment is the best sustainable development program I know of.  
Green Empowerment	139962		/users/profile/186113	Christine Ch	Donor	5	11/15/2012	Green Empowerment carries on the legacy of Ben Linder -- a remarkable, dear young man who gave his life to help poor Nicaraguan villagers have basic electricity through sustainable micro-hydro.   Green Empowerment has taken the creativity and integrity that was Ben and brought excellent projects to more and more people.    They partner effectively.  They are the Best.
Green Empowerment	102983		/users/profile/136453	Eli_	Board Member	5	01/06/2012	I began working with Green Empowerment through their service learning trips. I traveled with them to Nicaragua (solar water pump) and Philippines (microhydro). They have a great, sustainable strategy and are incredibly efficient - working with local groups and fundraising from a variety of sources. They are also wonderful to work with. Check them out!
Green Empowerment	102956	3	/users/profile/136356	joeldippold2	Donor	5	01/06/2012	As a former Peace Corps volunteer, I am excruciatingly conscious of how hard it is to implement a successful development project. Money doesn't correlate with success. Great ideas don't correlate with success. Overwhelming need for the project doesn't correlate with success. What seems to work most reliably is to keep the focus on the human relationships that underpin the technological and logistical aspects of the project. I am such an enthusiastic supporter of Green Empowerment because I feel they are one of the rare organizations that really get it--that development isn't about rolling out some shiny new mechanical marvel, but about methodically building up the social preconditions for success. 
Green Empowerment	84334	1	/users/profile/93523	Pumpkin	Volunteer	5	03/30/2011	Green Empowerment doesn't just provide renewable energy and clean water in the most  remote places of the world, they also improve the environment in the process. That's why I chose to volunteer at their offices once a week. I love the people that work there, so committed, creative, well traveled and multilingual.
Green Empowerment	81488		/users/profile/89231	breesemci	Volunteer	4	03/08/2011	I was impressed with Green Empowerment's mission and work, and the inspirational impact it has had through projects and partnerships around the world. Additionally, the staff are committed, engaged, and highly capable. I think overall it is a powerful organization with a lot of potential.
Green Empowerment	81475	2	/users/profile/89214	Michael R.	Board Member	5	03/08/2011	I have been involved with Green Empowerment from the start and am always amazed how much we do to further electrification and potable water, as well as watershed restoration in the most impoverished sections and communities in the world, subsistence or under $1/day in income.   Green Empowerment itself is a medium size NGO- 8 staff, 15 regular volunteers, 8 Board members.  But the model for Green Empowerment is to work with and through technical NGO partner organizations in the countries in which we work.  This is key to Green Empowerment's values of sustainability, local leadership and social justice.  As our partners in the various countries have a collective 400-500 staff, it means that Green Empowerment can have an outsize impact.  It is not a surprise the Portland Monthly recently chose Green Empowerment as the NGO able to do the most with the least.
Green Empowerment	81472		/users/profile/89209	XanderPander	Board Member	5	03/08/2011	What I like about Green Empowerment is that it is lean and mean.  It does a lot with a little, meaning most of the donated funds go to the work in the field.  They believe in capacity building of local partners and  networking partners for sharing experiences and technology.  Renewable energy is not only green, but it is sometimes the only choice rural communities have for power generation.  The staff are wonderful - hardworking, passionate and dedicated.  I feel privileged to be part of this organization.
Green Empowerment	66363		/users/profile/72537	Kathy	Volunteer	5	02/10/2011	I enjoy being part of an organization that not only provides appropriate, sustainable technology (wind, solar and micro-hydro) but also  "walks the talk" on community empowerment by partnering with  local NGOs and helping to organize community management of these systems! Green Empowerment also trains and connects government officals in many countries on sustainable energy, clean water systems, biogas and cookstove progress for rural communities so that knowledge is shared and best practices promoted. Impressive.
Green Empowerment	65523	1	/users/profile/71612	Craig G.	Volunteer	5	02/09/2011	What impresses me about Green Empowerment is their focus and effectiveness. They are focused on providing two essentials to those in need: clean water and electricity powered by renewable energy. They are effective because the projects they drive are run through partnerships with NGOs in the target countries and the local community owns the resulting electricity and water projects.
Ancient Ways	137339	1	/users/profile/183310	maudie	Donor	5	11/12/2012	Ancient Ways is a non-profit organization that helps empower women in Zimbabwe and helps make it possibe for all children to attend school.  One of its projects was to donate portable sewing machines to women, who were then able to sew school uniforms for selling - thus allowing their own children to be able to attend school.  My son has traveled to Zimbabwe with Ancient Ways and helped rebuilt huts.  Ancient Ways does good work!
Ancient Ways	137111		/users/profile/183070	bradyhowe	General Member of the Public	5	11/11/2012	I have been involved in Ancient Ways for 13 years and have witnessed the amount of success they have had in implementing their programs in Zimbabwe and Oregon.  With a small budget AW has been able to help a great deal of people.  They are amazing at spreading the messages of those in need and have the ability to truly help people.  Though their focus might be on the children, they also work to empower women and help build or rebuild communities.
Ancient Ways	137066		/users/profile/183022	ron97333	Donor	5	11/11/2012	I am so impressed by the tremendous impact this small nonprofit has, positively impacting the lives of over 2800 people in Zimbabwe.  I hope you'll join me in supporting them.
Ancient Ways	136909		/users/profile/182858	helen.six	Board Member	5	11/10/2012	This is a great non-profit group to support, that has been helping several villages in Zimbabwe for over 15 years by building wells, toilets, huts, paying school fees and supplying much-needed medical supplies and services through their health clinic. An efficient organizational structure has been developed over the years to channel donations to the areas most in need, be it school fees, medical supplies or food. I urge you to support this very worthwhile grassroots non-profit. 
Ancient Ways	135377		/users/profile/181238	drplasma64	Volunteer	5	11/08/2012	Like many here in Oregon, I was introduced to Ancient Ways via its Zimbabwean-style marimba classes in the Willamette Valley.  As I got more involved with the organization, I realized what a wide scope of integral services Ancient Ways is providing (wells, toilets, hut repair, education, community center and more) to the rural Zimbabweans whose music I've come to appreciate so much.  I particularly value supporting the programs for children.   I love showing my 9 year old daughter, a junior girl scout, pictures of her sister scouts that we help sponsor in the Girl Guides through Nhimbe for Progress, and the Zimbabwean kids at school.   Its hard for a 9 year old to understand the lives of people half-way around the world- that they are often hungry, don't have clean water to drink, can't always afford to go to school, and don't even have enough underwear.  When my daughter sees the kids' smiling faces singing, dancing, playing, and learning,  just like she and her friends do here, then it's easy for her to see that Zimbabwean kids are fundamentally just like her, despite cultural differences, and she can begin to imagine what it would be like if she faced the hardships that they do.  For me, Ancient Ways is not only a means to help others, but also a platform to teach the values of compassion and empathy to my children, a demonstration that people around the world have more similarities than differences, despite their backgrounds and living conditions; and a way to show my kids that we can all make a positive difference in the lives of others; empowering both us and them.
Ancient Ways	135373		/users/profile/181231	Jess37	Donor	5	11/07/2012	I have been consistently impressed by this nonprofit.  They have been working in Zimbabwe for many years, create programs that the local people are requesting, and update those programs as needed to make sure they remain effective and useful.  As excellent way to directly impact the lives of children and families in Zimbabwe. 
Ancient Ways	135309		/users/profile/181175	arquam	Volunteer	5	11/07/2012	Here in Oregon, Ancient Ways has introduced many to Shona marimba music and art.  In Zimbabwe, Ancient Ways provides community health education and sponsors students so they may remain in school.  These projects serve rural villagers who would otherwise have little to no access to these programs.
Ancient Ways	133433		/users/profile/179151	KD2012	Volunteer	5	11/04/2012	Ancient Ways builds a bridge between Zimbabwe and the Willamette Valley in Oregon by allowing us to learn and perform its music, meet visitors from Zimbabwe, and focus our individual and group energy into helping people from that country.  
Ancient Ways	133383		/users/profile/179095	vanosisi	Volunteer	5	11/04/2012	Ancient Ways has helped me in my life by bringing people together, both by creating opportunities to share music as a player and also as one who loves to listen,as well as by creating a link to reach across the world to others in need.  I am always so grateful for Ancient Ways and the people that have come together with this common interest.  There is a unique appreciation for humanity, plain goodness, and effective work on the ground in Zimbabwe.  The people there are part of our organization too and make our lives so much richer.
Ancient Ways	133373		/users/profile/179083	StevenK	Volunteer	5	11/04/2012	Ancient Ways is made up of great  people and great projects!  I have had a close relationship with Ancient Ways since its inception and watched it grow, grapple with hard times, and come to the front always moving forward innovatively overcoming the odds.  From spreading the Shona music here in the states to helping preserve it  and nurture the people in Zimbabwe, Ancient Ways stands out as an organization that walks its talk.  Having been to Zimbabwe more than once I have seen the positive change that Ancient Ways has brought to their lives.
Ancient Ways	132956		/users/profile/178644	kuzanga	Volunteer	5	11/03/2012	I have been playing music with Ancient Ways for many years,  and everyone there is like family. We all work together and play this beautiful music , and are sending help while we play.  
Ancient Ways	132421		/users/profile/176295	DebbyV	Board Member	5	11/01/2012	I have been a supporter of Ancient Ways since 2006 and was delighted to have the opportunity to join the board in 2009.  With extremely low overhead, Ancient Ways works in two areas of Zimbabwe to support a health center, keep children in school, build wells and much more.

Petros Network	223677	1	/users/profile/287425	4honugirl	General Member of the Public	5	10/16/2014	Petros Network is filled with generous people -- touching lives as extended hands... as most of us who cannot physically be there to help, encourage  support or uplift people in need without this ministry.   They bless others with their time, energy, and spirit pouring out from their own hearts to fill others with love and with courage to learn, grow and achieve more than one could image.  Petros Network is managed with integrity, speaks truth and empowerment to lives of those who may not otherwise receive support -- an incredible combination.
Petros Network	223658	1	/users/profile/287407	Illia H.	Volunteer	5	10/16/2014	I have watched this ministry grow and have admired the work they have done.  In partnering with Petros I get to have the best of two worlds, Kingdom building and something near and dear to my heart, empowering others.  I LOVE that they have empowered the local community to be self sufficient, I love that because of this wonderful organization the forgotten and often overlooked segment of this community has been empowered....widows and orphans!   I admire Petros for not only providing for soul projects but also for everyday needs .  I am so excited that this Fall I get to be the hands extended figuratively as I participate in the Medical/ Dental Mission.  Our time and resources are very valuable, and they are many things we can contribute to, be assured that Petros Network is the real deal.  My investment  of time and resource is well spent and has eternal benefits.
Petros Network	223523		/users/profile/287273	conveinence.of.chritianity	Donor	1	10/16/2014	Self serving individuals looking to build their own wealth, only motivated by their personal agenda.Let's see the numbers. Not for Profit should be just that. Being in the ministry can be very profitable for some. 
Petros Network	223518	1	/users/profile/287267	Jenny72	Donor	5	10/16/2014	My family is very thankful to be able to support Petros network.  It's the next best thing to being on the front lines and traveling across boarders.  Petros seeks to empower the local people, so the work they begin during their visits continues well after they are gone.  We were able to sponsor a church plant last year and look forward to doing more.  I am honored to say that I know many of the volunteers and stewards of this organization.  They are genuine, loving, they believe in what they are doing, God centered, phenomenal people.  The work of the Petros Network reflects the heart of God.  
Petros Network	223516	1	/users/profile/287265	SarahDanielle	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/16/2014	My husband had the opportunity to travel with the Petros Network back in 2012. As a employee of a current non profit myself we were amazing with how giving and passion the Petros network has been in the lives of those around them. They enter into communities and offer support, training and love to all those they come in contact with. They are an organization that is changing the way we work together on a local level as well as internationally. They truly use all of there resources and energy to serve in a way that compels other to join in. I am a better friend, mother, daughter, sister, leader and community member due to Petros Network continually shifting my focus onto those in need. 
Petros Network	223458	1	/users/profile/287207	SusanI	Donor	5	10/16/2014	I have supported the Petros Network since its inception.  Why?  The people involved are people of integrity who use the funds exactly how they say they are using them.  Often charitable organizations use much of their revenue for overhead, but the Petros Network uses funds to help those they say they are going to help.  I have also know people who have gone to Africa to help in the work, and they pay their own way.  That says so much about the commitment of the people involved.  I will definitely continue to support Petros.
Petros Network	223450	1	/users/profile/287196	gr8work	General Member of the Public	5	10/16/2014	My son and daughter in law participated in this ministry several years ago.  They returned with amazing reports of what God is accomplishing through this ministry.  Hundreds, if not thousands, coming to faith in Christ, and new churches being planted!  The assistance and teaching this ministry is giving to the church in Ethiopia is making a huge difference, and is worthy of financial and prayer support!
Petros Network	217646	2	/users/profile/281185	Bobgumu	Volunteer	5	09/26/2014	I have traveled to Africa ten times with Petros Network and have seen the organization from every side. I have never seen a greater return on investment anywhere. The work that is being done through Petros Network is almost beyond description. It is the work of carrying the gospel to the last dark corners of the world and shining the light of Jesus into those dark places.  It is Matthew 28s call to the Great Commission being carried out in living color. Entire areas are turning away from witchcraft and to salvation in Christ. Widows and orphans are being cared for in an ever increasing measure. Widows are being trained to run their own businesses, and much, much more. Even Government officials have noticed differences in their communities and have personally told me that crime rates have dropped dramatically since Petros Network began ministering in the area.Working in unity to see the unreached become the reached is what Petros Network is all about.  
Petros Network	216041	2	/users/profile/279485	pjoels	Volunteer	5	09/20/2014	As a personal contributor and 2x participant on trips, I can honestly say that this ministry does what it says and accomplishes far more than can be imagined.  The level of integrity, the quality of indigenous leadership, and the scope of vision cannot be matched.  If you want to be part of a ministry that changes the world spiritually, socially, and economically, partner with Petros Network.
Petros Network	216027	3	/users/profile/279474	CatA2	Volunteer	5	09/20/2014	From the beginning this ministry has been about spreading the gospel and making disciples.  I love their commitment to equipping those who are called to ministry, promoting organic growth within their own country.    The work they do with redemptive lift, that comes along side the making of disciples, is powerful in changing lives not only on earth but in heaven.  I have been to Africa with them, I have seen it in action. The leaders of this organization continue to give unselfishly and give all the glory to God.   It is my pleasure to serve with them.
Petros Network	215983	4	/users/profile/279428	Doug36	Volunteer	5	09/20/2014	I have watched this ministry for five years and have the deepest respect for those who are leading it.  They have a deep concern and respect for the people they are working with in Ethiopia and other countries in that region.  I know that the work they do there costs them deeply in time, person discomfort and monetarily.  They have focused on encouraging local leaders and taking very little of the credit.  They have also been completely transparent with all the funding.  Their stated goal is to find where God is working and then go and support that work however needed.
Harmony New Beginnings Animal Rescue	317744		/users/profile/408880	Carol_Harlan	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/31/2016	If owners cared for their animals like Harmony New Beginnings cares for the animals people throw away, there would be no need.  Couldn't ask for people to love and care more than they do.  Every animal that comes through Harmony's care, is given the very best to allow them to improve and thrive, and feel the love of a human's care.  I can't express how awesome these people are.  They go above and beyond for every living creature.Thank you for taking care of those without a voice of their own.
Harmony New Beginnings Animal Rescue	317587	1	/users/profile/408730	Diannasalser	General Member of the Public	5	10/31/2016	Best rescue facility ever!!! I have seen animals that have been severely abused and neglected brought to this facility and the care they have received has brought them back to a healthy and happy, trusting state and they can be placed in a forever home. God bless these people. They truly care about the animals and are very good at what they do.
Harmony New Beginnings Animal Rescue	317252		/users/profile/408427	Jeffalso	General Member of the Public	5	10/31/2016	Harmony New Beginnings is the most responsible and productive rescue that I have ever visited or known about. They are constantly upgrading the rescue  (often at their own expense) to provide safe, warm and proper housing for each variety of animal rescued. They engage the community in education and caring for the animals. They provide veterinarian care, activity and a loving home for all animals rescued. The animals are not only rescued but restored to health and a positive lifestyle. This rescue has the best reputation of any I have heard. They have promoted such a positive attitude toward rescues in our area! I would contact them (before any other agency ) if I knew of an endangered animal or was looking for a pet. 
Harmony New Beginnings Animal Rescue	314290		/users/profile/405654	Writer	Client Served	5	10/25/2016	I am writing as someone who had no experience with a rescue before.    With that said,  a few months ago I adopted a dog there.  I found Joy to have an extremely passionate,  kind heart towards animals as well as being  someone who goes the extra mile for each animal in her care.   She provided documents and medical records for us and discussed  the known history of the animal  I adopted.   She also talked with us sharing info about his specific personality and help with how to make his transition go smoothly.  Wonderful family and great rescue!  
Harmony New Beginnings Animal Rescue	313997		/users/profile/405357	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	10/24/2016	Harmony New Beginnings Animal Rescue is rune by some of the most compassionate  people I have known in my lifetime.  They recover their rescues.  I guess the best statement I can make about HNBAR would be my desire as an animal in need to wind up under their care.  I pray they can keep up the fantastic care.
Harmony New Beginnings Animal Rescue	312630		/users/profile/404007	Teresa100	General Member of the Public	5	10/20/2016	     I am honored to have an opportunity to write a review for Harmony New Beginnings Animal Rescue. They are the example that all rescues should follow.     The animals that are fortunate to get to HNBAR get amazing care. They are evaluated, given veterinarian care, socialization,appropriate housing and food. Love lots of love, did I mention love? I have visited the rescue and it is very clean and well maintained.     I rescued a kitten from HNBAR. My kitten arrived with the necessary initial vet care. She was spayed, chipped, had her first shots and had been wormed and treated for fleas.I was impressed with the education and follow up I recieved. My veterinarian was very impressed with the condition of the kitten and that the rescue had sent a reminder about the next vaccines being due. I cannot donate a lot but if I do I recieve a reciept. The level of professionalism and operating practices of this rescue is exemplary.Teresa Clifton
Harmony New Beginnings Animal Rescue	312584		/users/profile/403960	Mary474	Board Member	5	10/20/2016	I believe the work this rescue does is outstanding for animals in need and compared to a lot of organizations in this space that I've worked with, they are the most dedicated, most diligent and the easiest to work with.  They truly care about the animals and work hard to make sure animals are cared for and restored to good health.  They are also very diligent about finding the right foster homes and forever homes for each animal based on needs and temperament.  I loved what this rescue was doing so much that I offered to be a Board Member.
Harmony New Beginnings Animal Rescue	307174		/users/profile/398497	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	09/30/2016	I can't say enough good things about Harmony New Beginnings Animal Rescue. I spoke with the lady who runs it in regards to a situation with my daughter where her horse was ripped away from her, when the two people who were caring for her horse called off their wedding and went seperate ways. We were given a week to find a place to board him. Unfortunately we were unsuccessful in the time period and her horse was sent across the state to live with another family because the person living on the property wanted a clean break from anything that reminded him of his ex. Heart broken my daughter stopped riding and refused to even touch another horse. The lady who runs Harmony New Beginnings Animal Rescue was so gracious to extend and open invitation to meet with my daughter and have her come love on the rescue horses. Her words truly came from a place of a deep love for animals. She believes in educating the future generations as how to properly care for animals. I can't say enough good things about this rescue. Very compassionate people who truly love what they do. 
Harmony New Beginnings Animal Rescue	303780		/users/profile/394948	johnaheintz	Donor	5	09/12/2016	I have been following Harmony New Beginnings Animal Rescue for a few years now. I am constantly impressed with their strong commitment to these abused animals. I have followed rescues in which I was certain the outcome was going to be tragic only to witness miraculous recoveries! This was accomplished by the sheer devotion, dedication and determination of everyone at this amazing sanctuary. 
Harmony New Beginnings Animal Rescue	124339	2	/users/profile/169177	Carolyn22	Donor	5	10/03/2012	I can't say enough about this rescue. I found them when helping find homes for three senior horses in the 'kill pen' at a WA auction. I asked Joy to help find a WA rescue, and when no one had room, Harmony New Beginnings stepped up (even though they were barely open, having just completed the 501C3 filing and approval process).  Since then I have seen them come to the rescue of horses, donkeys, dogs, cats, goats!   I haven't visited (I'm in AZ) but I hope to one of these days.
Harmony New Beginnings Animal Rescue	124280	2	/users/profile/169111	trishab	Donor	5	10/02/2012	I have followed Harmony New Beginnings Animal rescue for over a year now.  I am a proud doner. Because I know where all the money goes.  I have personally visited and have seen the love and kindness this rescue gives to each and every one of there rescues.  As a matter of fact I am the proud owner of two beautiful Donkeys she rescued.  I love them with all my heart.  When a animal is saved by HNBAR They are given everything they need to survive.  I highly recommend with my whole heart. Sincerely Patricia Beck.
American Tinnitus Association	149865	2	/users/profile/199846	Linda177	Donor	5	02/23/2013	One could reasonably say that tinnitus isn't a terribly sexy condition and that tinnitus fundraising must be a tough job.  And that's probably true.  But although tinnitus won't kill you, it can make your life miserable and your mental health a wreck.  I am a tinnitus sufferer and supporter and what ATA provides for me is support, ideas for products to help me manage my symptoms and notices about local tinnitus sufferers' meetings.  I am proud to support their mission and their research for a cure.
American Tinnitus Association	91606		/users/profile/104875	Daniel	General Member of the Public	4	06/22/2011	I was recently diagnosed with Meniere's disease and nocturnal tinnitus is one of my symptoms. While initially discouraged and seeking another diagnosis that would let me hope that it would be a temporary condition, I am starting to use coping skills I learnt through the ATA. I find them very helpful and always ready to answer to my questions. I just wish they had a local chapter in the Northeastern US.
American Tinnitus Association	91046		/users/profile/104020	engels	General Member of the Public	5	06/16/2011	Let me start by saying that I have been suffering from Tinnitus for quite some time.  When  my audiologist told me that there was an organization who's sole purpose was to provide information and help for this affliction, I didn't waste any time in logging on to their website.  From the first email a few years ago, the staff at ATA have been very helpful in answering questions and providing information on services and products that help in coping with tinnitus.  Something that sets this organization apart from most others is their uncanny ability to keep things personal.  By that I mean that the ATA has always maintained a level of professionalism that one would expect from a non-profit organization, but they have always made me feel like they were a small, local group of professionals.  They have been responsible for helping me in many ways, from info on relaxation techniques to help me get through the rough days, to obtaining my sound pillow which provides needed "white noise" to help me sleep better at night.  They have fielded many phone calls and emails from me, helping me to find specialists in my area, give me info on current research projects, and linking me up with a support group that recently started up in my area (who knows how long I would have gone before discovering it on my own).  They are upfront about letting you know that, while there is not yet a cure, their ultimate goal is to find one.  The annual Tinnitus walk has been a great way for me to get the word out to others, and also do my small part in helping to raise funds for research.  
American Tinnitus Association	90999		/users/profile/103960	starscm	Volunteer	5	06/15/2011	I have served as a board member of the American Tinnitus Association, and currently help as a volunteer.  I have always respected how the staff and directors of this organization realized that the old mission of being an information and support organization had been superceded by the advent of the internet, so the organization was retooled from the ground up to pursue the ultimate mission for a health-related organization -- to cure tinnitus.  The ATA devised its "Roadmap to a Cure" to show the scientific pathway we intended to follow.  It overhauled its website to focus on raising funds and other resources for tinnitus research.  And the ATA did these things without losing the communication and compassion skills that have made this organization the lifeline for many people suffering from tinnitus.   The ATA leverages its staff to fulfill many functions at the same time.  Through skillful planning and preparation, volunteer efforts are channeled into the most productive avenues -- for example, the Advocacy department first was the prime mover to encourage research by the Dept. of Defense into tinnitus, and then allowed for volunteers such as myself to offer our services as unpaid consultants to the DoD on funding research proposals.  Finally, the ATA is a good steward of donations -- they make a budget and stick to it, and never lose focus on the organization's mission in the process.
American Tinnitus Association	90242		/users/profile/102866	Paul C.	Donor	5	06/09/2011	As the husband of a severe tinnitus sufferer, I can attest to how difficult this affliction can be. Like many millions of other sufferers, my wife struggles each day to live a normal life despite the persistent noise that only she can hear. As maddening as the noise can be, it's equally maddening we know so little about how to silence it. The American Tinnitus Association is one of the few entities that gives hope to tinnitus sufferers and their families. They are advancing research into cures and enlightening policy makers in Washington, D.C. Importantly, ATA also raises awareness about tinnitus among the general public and they provide forums where those suffering from it can gather to discuss treatments and coping mechanisms. 
American Tinnitus Association	89753		/users/profile/102201	Bob C.	Client Served	5	06/07/2011	The ATA has been there when I have needed them in the past.  I first ran across them online when I was searching for info about my tinnitus, and then followed up with them for more information.  They sent a great info packet and I did wind up sending in my membership money.  I figured it was a pretty good deal, and I was right!  I have been happy with the magazine (Tinnitus Today) and get some good email updates as well.  I am hoping that our support will lead to a cure soon, and the research that the ATA funds (and helps get the Gov't to fund!) seems to be getting closer and closer.  I hope to one day be able to enjoy "silence" again.
American Tinnitus Association	89558		/users/profile/101847	Allen	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/03/2011	The ATA fiercely advocates for increased public awareness of tinnitus suffering and provides resources and quality information for those that seek help for their tinnitus. I am impressed by the dedication from this organization in raising the bar for funding of top quality research towards finding a cure. They provide essential support and advocacy on an individual, local, and national  basis. Support for the tinnitus community is unparalleled.
American Tinnitus Association	89391		/users/profile/101585	Mark w. Church	Client Served	5	06/01/2011	I first developed Tinnitus 11 years ago.  It came on quickly and I sought medical treatment from my ENT doctor within the week.  Following an exam, I was told that my ears are fine and that I had something called Tinnitus.  I knew nothing about Tinnitus and asked what couldbe done for it.  I was told nothing, I was told to go home and live with it.  I paniced at the thought of living with this sound intrution 24x7, 365 days a year.  I was in great dispair and became very anxious and depressed.  I frantically search the web for a magic elixer or therapy to stop the ringing.  I ran across the ATA website and they had a support line which I called.  I explained my situation to the support person and she could sense the panic in my voice.  She started by reassuring me that things could be done to alleviate the symptoms and she also told me that they were working hard with researchers all around the world to solve this problem.  She did not offer me a cure but she did offer me hope.   And hope is a powerful thing for someone at the end of their rope.  With the help of the ATS, I've learn to live with my Tinnitus and utilitze many of the coping techniques suggested by them.  Had it not been for me stumbling across there website 11 years ago, I'm not sure the story would have ended so well.   I'm a big advocate of the ATA, they do very important work.  
American Tinnitus Association	89384		/users/profile/101570	Gary	Board Member	5	06/01/2011	The American Tinnitus Association has been a lifesaver for hundreds of people over the years. Tinnitus can be a devastating malady for those who suffer with it day and night. A good analogy for what tinnitus may be like for some is to strap an electric hair dryer to your head and turn it on and leave it there for the remainder of your life. Sounds unpleasant. It is.  I have had tinnitus for 18 years and it changed my life. I look forward to the day when a cure is found. ATA is funding research projects every year. It takes money to fund these projects and that is where the public needs to help. If you can spare a few dollars, or many, go to www.ata.org and contribute. Almost 50% of soldiers are coming back from the wars with tinnitus... they need your help too. 
American Tinnitus Association	86778		/users/profile/97253	Barbara D.	General Member of the Public	4	04/22/2011	My experience with the ATA has been a positive one.  I was diagnosed with Subjective Tinnitus in November of 2009. For the first three months, I felt completely isolated with my condition until I joined the ATA. I dont regret one moment of that decision. Their support site has allowed me to not feel alone in my struggle to cope with the noise in my head. Whether its been one month or 25 years, living with Tinnitus is never easy. It challenges us in ways that others cannot imagine. Its maddening, as one friend quoted. Talking with others on the ATA support site has given me hope for the future. Im most impressed with the people who work for the ATA. They consistently have a presence on the support site with updates on meetings and the latest news on research and tinnitus treatments. The staff has also been most accommodating to me with prompt responses related to any questions or concerns. Its comforting to know that this organization is fighting for us every day. Im proud to be a member of the American Tinnitus Association.
American Tinnitus Association	86137	1	/users/profile/96308	Walter H.	Donor	5	04/18/2011	The ATA is globally the most effective tinnitus patient association, providing support and research funding. As a long time donor of the ATA research fund, I have been delighted to see their overall shift towards medical research in the past years. Nevertheless, support and patient information remain important  it also ensures that an organization remains 'connected' to its constituency so I am happy to see that ATA retains its integrative view. The staff has always been willing to listen to my ideas and suggestions, and some of their volunteers are known for giving tinnitus support on various online forums.
DVSD - Domestic Violence Safe Dialogue	308482		/users/profile/399862	Gradgurl20	Volunteer	5	10/06/2016	I became involved with DVSD because of my interest in restorative justice. The criminal justice system falls short of providing for the needs of both offenders and survivors. DVSD and their restorative justice approach offer healing for both offenders and survivors. It's a massive step in the right direction towards reaching prevention of domestic violence and breaking the cycle of learned behaviors that are earmarks of domestic violence. I am proud to be a part of this incredible process!
DVSD - Domestic Violence Safe Dialogue	231948		/users/profile/295506	Mary320	General Member of the Public	5	10/31/2014	Excellent organization that has done some amazing things to help break the cycle of domestic violence and also helps not just the victims but also the offenders.  Fantastic program. I'm so impressed with what they have accomplished so far.
DVSD - Domestic Violence Safe Dialogue	231360		/users/profile/294954	George39	Donor	5	10/31/2014	 I have heard positive results about this program.  I especially appreciate the offender being brought into the equation.  That would appear to hopefully have good consequences for the victim and offender maybe breaking the cycle. George0
DVSD - Domestic Violence Safe Dialogue	230533		/users/profile/294161	bearbear	Volunteer	5	10/30/2014	I witnessed the effects of this program on an individual.  It was, for her, lifechanging.  Because this is an organization that takes a more personal approach with the goal of empowering the survivor, it worked for my friend.  I have contributed to it and will again and have volunteered on a limited basis.  
DVSD - Domestic Violence Safe Dialogue	230477		/users/profile/294106	portlanddad	Donor	5	10/30/2014	Creating an atmosphere where both victims and offenders can ask questions of each other with the help of a facilitator has had great results.  An organization that i will support.
DVSD - Domestic Violence Safe Dialogue	230465		/users/profile/294096	jbpdx	Donor	5	10/30/2014	The use of survivor impact panels in the field of domestic violence is a great idea.  Glad to see it being adopted.
DVSD - Domestic Violence Safe Dialogue	230460		/users/profile/294092	jb1966	Donor	5	10/30/2014	Fantastic organization, doing innovative things in the field of domestic violence.
DVSD - Domestic Violence Safe Dialogue	230269		/users/profile/293916	LeslieMast	Donor	5	10/30/2014	Amazed by their Survivor Impact Panels. Terrific program that I will continue to support
DVSD - Domestic Violence Safe Dialogue	205330		/users/profile/267474	Anita24	General Member of the Public	4	07/07/2014	I can't speak to any personal experience with the group, I'm fortunate in that respect.      I have known of their technique from the beginning and believe it is a wise and caring approach.  Exceptional for the abused to hear from victims without the interpersonal dynamics of it being the person they actually abused; and exceptional for those who suffered abuse to tell what it felt like to people who need to hear it.
DVSD - Domestic Violence Safe Dialogue	204029		/users/profile/266053	scottyD	Donor	5	06/26/2014	This has been a favorite organization of mine to donate to for years. They have been actively working in the domestic violence community for years. It has been amazing to watch them grow steadily over the years. 
DVSD - Domestic Violence Safe Dialogue	204021		/users/profile/266046	portlandmom	Donor	5	06/26/2014	I found out about DVSD years ago and have always been impressed with the care and knowledge that they have for both survivors and offenders of domestic violence. One must heal both parties, not just one side, if a difference is made.  Highly recommend them.

I am thrilled to know the amount of community support in sending care packages to our heroes serving on foreign soil. I am honored to be a part of it!
Marine Corps Family Foundation Inc	136954		/users/profile/182906	akress	Volunteer	5	11/11/2012	I began volunteering for Operation Santa when my son was serving tours in Iraq. He is home now, but I continue to volunteer by making "Santa Socks" and filling them for whatever platoon I am assigned.  I am but one tiny cog in a much larger volunteer effort but I feel that making the "Santa Socks" by hand I can personally shake the hand of each Marine who receives one. It is my personal thank you to them and although we have not met I respect and value their service!
Marine Corps Family Foundation Inc	119132		/users/profile/161980	nickelja	Volunteer	5	07/23/2012	I started doing "Operation Santa" last season. It was such a wonderful experience and it was truly amazing to see the number of community members get involved. The Marine Corps Family Foundation does an excellent job with setting up programs that show the Marines and their families that we have and will never forget them! OOH-RAH!
Marine Corps Family Foundation Inc	118647		/users/profile/161344	Jean13	Volunteer	5	07/17/2012	Marine Corps Family Foundation has some wonderful programs. My favorite is Operation Santa. I started in 2005, and it has been a fantastic experience each year. The number of stockings and Marines we cover has grown, as friends have stepped in to help. (My friends bake so many cookies, that one year, we got a thank you note from an Army Unit that the Marines shared their cookies with!) I love the opportunity to give back, and work on gathering the supplies throughout the year... Christmas and the Marines are a constant presence. And most important, while I know the Marines appreciate the goodies and Christmas, I truly believe I get far more back from participating! MCM has made this easy to do, and a joy throughout the year.
Marine Corps Family Foundation Inc	118528	2	/users/profile/161197	Mary Lou M.	Donor	5	07/16/2012	I love to make baby items for the Marine Corps Kids Foundation.  This is a trusting and worthwhile organization and I can not find a better place to donate my items to.  I appreciate what all of our service men and women do and have done for us.  
Marine Corps Family Foundation Inc	118512	2	/users/profile/161178	Connie15	Board Member	5	07/16/2012	The Marine Corps Family Foundation and Marine Corps Kids have made supporting our deployed Marines and soldiers a mission of support, compassion and patriotism.  Hundreds of volunteers create and give to the many projects to support deployed troops in war zones.  Marine Corps Kids volunteers have found a very unique way to give back..creating and delivering special packages to the new babies of deployed Marines and soldiers.  I am proud to be working with such great people and with Delia Igo who coordinates the Marine Corps Kids project.
Marine Corps Family Foundation Inc	118377	1	/users/profile/161012	Karen I.	Volunteer	5	07/14/2012	I am proud of making things for Marine Corps Kids. It is a way for me to make at least a modest attempt to try and give back to our brave heros and their families. In a way,  I feel I am sharing in a happy moment in their lives. The projects that the other volunteers make give me additional inspiration.  In war and in peace, the Marines have being doing their Toys for Tots program for those in need. All in all, making things for their kids is truly a priviledge.
Marine Corps Family Foundation Inc	104408	1	/users/profile/139999	Comfort & Joy	Volunteer	5	01/24/2012	This is an AWESOME organization with HUGE impact for our dedicated soldiers! We've been doing this for about 7 years & each year we are SO GLAD that we do!!! Just got a great Thank You note from the Sgt. of the platoon of 30 Marines that we sent over 400 lbs of Christmas to! SO heartwarming, that it makes us cry! The helicopter unit shared some of what we'd sent with other smaller bases that don't receive much and they were all very grateful. We sew stockings, pillowcases, and spend time gathering an assortment of survival items, fun stuff & food, healthy snacks, etc and include phone cards for them to call home for the holidays, Christmas  cards for each.  It is definately a cause worth supporting in any way that you can!!! Christmas is so much more SPECIAL & MEANINGFUL, since we have been doing this with the help of others.
Marine Corps Family Foundation Inc	100522	2	/users/profile/122922	Margaret23456	Volunteer	4	11/11/2011	Each year in the fall, a new Division of Marines are deployed out of Camp Pendleton, California. These are young men as young as 19 years old, strong, determined, dedicated volunteers with a purpose. They are the epitome of those same young men that joined the Marine Corps after the attack on Pearl Harbor and although they have heard stories of how Vietnam era veterans were treated upon their return, that did not stop them from going to Iraq or Afghanistan. Over and over you hear their reason for going, "for my country, to fight there so they don't come here and hurt my family." This is why we volunteer for Operation Santa. To provide these Marines a reminder that we haven't forgotten them, and to send them a little bit of Christmas from home. We provide a few creature comforts, like Hand and Toe Warmers for those frigid nights while on patrol, where they have to keep their hands on their weapons in case of an attack. Batteries for their electronics what little they have, there is no PX at the  Forward Operating Base, in the remote mountains of Afghanistan to buy new ones when theirs run out. Toothpaste, deodorant, baby wipes is what they use to wash up while in the field and again they have to hope they have enough to last until they go to the rear. In addition to this we send Pillowcases, they don't have pillows, but they use them to store their dirty clothes and use them as a pillow. Lip balm for chapped lips from the cold winds that whip down from the mountains, and Emergen-C vitamin supplement powder they can add to their bottled water to help maintain their immune system that is taxed from sleep deprivation and the sheer exercise of carrying their weapons, ammunition, and protective gear sometimes over 100 pounds while climbing steep hill and mountainsides. Packets of Hot Chocolate or coffee, and a granola bar for them to consume during their few and far between down time. So what is a little fundraising and time spent packing a gallon storage bag filled with a home-made Christmas stocking, a hand made Christmas card from the local elementary school or Girl Scout troop, wishing the Marines, a safe and Merry Christmas, with the above mentioned items compared to what these men and women are doing for us. This is why we volunteer, to give each and every Marine and Sailor a little bit of home. Connie Riecke, the director of the Marine Corps Family foundation, tirelessly works to help each and every one of us Coordinators ensure these Marines get Christmas stockings. She advises with fundraising ideas and acts as a troubleshooter if there is a problem with the vendor. We have been active with the Marine Corps Family Foundation, Operation Santa program since 2007 when our two sons were deployed to Iraq at the same time. They both have since gotten out of the Marine Corps, but we are committed to supporting those that have taken their place in the theater, and we hope to continue to do so for many years to come.

Child Centered Solutions	88089		/users/profile/98934	Freddy H.	Volunteer	5	04/29/2011	Since 2005, Child Centered Solutions (CCS) has helped give a voice to children in Oregon. From directly representing children to coaching attorneys, to creating the Children's Bill of Rights, CCS helps children who are stuck in the middle of families in conflict. The work CCS does is not glamorous. It's necessary. So many children feel powerless, stuck between fighting parents without many people to turn to. When the children do find advocates, frequently those advocates are not well-trained in understanding the children's special needs. CCS strives to provide resources to educate both children and those in a position to help them. With CCS's help, more children in Oregon are growing up happy and healthy, while fewer children are suffering the negative and destructive impact of family conflict. Child Centered Solution is a great organization and can use all the help it can get.
Child Centered Solutions	88073		/users/profile/98918	Hammer	Volunteer	5	04/29/2011	The time volunteering  at Child Center Solutions was the most pleasant working experience so far. At CCS i was able to further understand the value of helping others. This is a great organization aimed at helping the victims of divorce, the children. Along with a sense of accomplishment i was able to learn a lot from my enthusiastic co-workers.
Child Centered Solutions	88061		/users/profile/98903	jcm.gop	Volunteer	5	04/29/2011	As a volunteer at CCS, I was happy to work with a group so focused on the well being and needs of children during such a stressful process. Too often parents focus on their own wants and needs during divorce proceedings, CCS rightfully focuses the attention back on the children affected by the family conflicts.  
Child Centered Solutions	88008		/users/profile/98841	cg0090	Volunteer	5	04/29/2011	I volunteered for Child Centered Solutions after I graduated high school. I saw first hand the impact the organization had on families and children in need of support during difficult times. When I volunteered at CCS, attorneys provided pro bono services for children involved in custody battles. It was reassuring to realize that there are organizations whose sole mission is to be the voice of a child who might have been forgotten about during a difficult family time. Although CCS does not provide legal representation anymore, their resources for parents and professionals offer advice and strategies for parenting plans, communicating with the child's school and expectant behaviors of the child during a family conflict. 
Child Centered Solutions	87631		/users/profile/98363	pbenmay	General Member of the Public	5	04/27/2011	Having seen Child Centered Solutions in action I have been impressed with what they do and how they handle themselves.

Child Centered Solutions	87362		/users/profile/98022	Will	General Member of the Public	5	04/26/2011	CCS fills a critical niche for families going through difficult times. Not only are they there to provide the various documents and paperwork required during such a period, but the care and child-centric focus they also provide is outstanding.
Child Centered Solutions	87042		/users/profile/97614	Jennifer H.	General Member of the Public	5	04/25/2011	Child Centered Solutions helped my family and I get through some very tough times. They are always willing to share a smiling face and are quick to answer any questions we have. I always get quick responses to any emails and phone calls I make. I will definitely use CCS if I ever need to again and definitely will be sure to recommend to anyone else who is getting divorced and wants to help their family. 
Child Centered Solutions	86960		/users/profile/97510	WingMen P.	Board Member	5	04/25/2011	The best charities are the ones that look to break the cycle of repeated problems.  Often those that are involved in conflict at a young age are the ones that find themselves in similar situations in adulthood.  Child Centered Solutions is striving to break this cycle by reaching children as they battle through their family's conflict.  Children need a voice and answers just as much as adults.  CCS has taken on the large and ambitious role of getting that voice to children and those that interact with them on a daily basis.
Child Centered Solutions	86817		/users/profile/97303	pwatts	Volunteer	5	04/22/2011	Child Centered Solutions provides critical resources to children and families during periods of extreme conflict. The materials that have been authored and compiled by Child Centered Solutions, are designed to educate families and professionals on how to mitigate the impact of the crisis on children. Materials are also provided to the children to help them process what is going on within their families.
Child Centered Solutions	86682		/users/profile/97121	amflowe	Board Member	5	04/21/2011	Child Centered Solutions helps parents and professionals give a voice to children.  Community education, traning seminars for judges, lawyers, and other professionals, and the published Children's Bill of Rights are direct examples of the work Child Centered Solutions accomplishes on behalf of children who experience family conflict. As a "bonus" parent to two wonderful step-sons, I am honored to serve as a Board member to this valuable organization. I had always been a supporter of the mission of Child Centered Solutions, however my support and interest reached new heights when I became a "bonus" parent in 2008.   Children need a voice when they are caught in family disputes. I have seen first hand the assistance and training that parents and professionals receive from Child Centered Solutions. Children in our community benefit from the mission and work of this organization.  In countless ways, our community is better as a result.
Child Centered Solutions	86670		/users/profile/97108	katiejeremiah	Board Member	5	04/21/2011	Child Centered Solutions is a great resource for any families who are going through conflict, whether it be divorce, or other transition.  It educates families so they are able to communicate with their children and give them a voice.  The children's bill of rights is an excellent tool, and empowers children who otherwise get lost in conflict, and holds adults accountable for their behavior.   Child's Bill of Rights:As a child, I have the following rights and I need you, my Mom and Dad, to respect these rights: 1. The right not to be asked to "choose sides" between my Mom and Dad 2. The right to express, or not express, my feelings. 3. The right to have a unique relationship with each of my parents without the other making me feel guilty about it. 4. The right to freely and privately communicate with both my Mom and Dad, and not to be asked questions by either parent about the other. 5. The right to be treated as a person and not as a pawn, possession or negotiating chip. 6. The right not to be expected to be a spy or messenger. 7. The right not to hear either Mom or Dad say bad things about the other. 8. The right to have my life change as little as possible while my Mom and Dad work out their problems. 9. The right to have my own life and remain a child. 10. The right to expect you to be my parents, not my friends. 11. The right not to be expected to be my parents' confidante or companion. 12. The right to have what is in my best interest protected at all times. I agree:                                Thank you. I love you both.

The Project has helped many of my students with academic, behavioral and attendance struggles to venture outside of their comfort level and "try". Helping to turn their "I Can't" into "I Can". The Shadow Project is an amazing opportunity that has been provided to my school and district and I hope that other Special Education programs will have opportunities to be a part of this nonprofit. 
Shadow Project	183549	1	/users/profile/240461	cmarquar	Volunteer	5	10/28/2013	I've been working with The Shadow Project for over 5 years. I've seen tremendous growth amongst the students that have taken full advantage of all it has to offer. Some of the huge successes are: turning a complete non-reader into a recreational reader, encouraging kids to attend school, helping families-in-need 'purchase' presents for one another, teaching math skills through an economy-based system of behavioral accountability, motivating students to become more independent, helping to reassure kids to make it through tough academic periods, and, this year, granting kids more explicit knowledge and autonomy over self-correcting their negative behavior. 
Shadow Project	183518		/users/profile/240429	Hooty46	Donor	5	10/28/2013	As a volunteer and a donor, I am impressed with how each dollar is spent in helping children with learning disabilities. The amount of children that benefit from this program is impressive, but more could be reached with increased funding. It's an amazing organization that is spearheaded by a dedicated and ambitious leader, Christy Scattarella. 
Shadow Project	182804		/users/profile/239681	tobeoract	Donor	5	10/27/2013	The Shadow Project has done an amazing job of understanding the needs of special education students and their school environment.  With this understanding it has created a program that fits with the current school structure and inspires students with disabilities like ADD and dyslexia. The Shadow project is a catalyst that helps further the outcome of success in school and life for these children.
Shadow Project	181764		/users/profile/238493	Jeanine E.	Donor	5	10/23/2013	The Shadow Project is amazing!  I have known Christy since our boys were in kindergarten and they are now 25!  Both of our boys struggled in school.  Christy started the Shadow Project because she wanted to help other children that were struggling in school.  Christy's passion for her work is why this nonprofit has grown over the years and has helped so many children...  And, thanks to Christy, it will continue to grow and continue to help many children long into the future!
Shadow Project	181711		/users/profile/238438	Julie150	Donor	5	10/23/2013	How often doing you really know your dollars are going to the source, and that the organization is making a difference. As a donor I want to be assured that my money is well spent. The thank you card I received from one of the children in the Shadow Project program touched my heart and alleviated any doubt about the effectiveness of the program. The child who was featured on the card said because of the Shadow Project they could read and for the first time did not feel dumb. To change the way a child sees itself is as much of a gift as learning to read. Christy and her organization have my respect, praise and admiration.
Shadow Project	181689		/users/profile/238418	LDWUPM	Volunteer	5	10/23/2013	The Shadow Project is very dear to my heart, as my sister created it after her son Alex experienced learning disabilities.  They found little help in the public school system so proceeded to create a non profit that could provide tools for those students in need. All the hard work has paid off as now so many children have benefited from these efforts. I have seen first hand the changes in my nephew and have avidly followed the shadow project's remarkable efforts through the years. This feisty non profit started with one mother and grew until it had it's own board and many, many fine volunteers and donors over the years.
Shadow Project	181568		/users/profile/238297	Heather.Benson	Board Member	5	10/23/2013	I worked with The Shadow Project on a probono project to help with their digital marketing strategy and I fell in love with the organization. Now, I'm serving on the board and working with The Shadow Project team behind the scenes. It is amazing to watch the impact this nonprofit has on the Portland community, giving teachers the tools to help children with learning challenges get excited about learning! 
Shadow Project	181403		/users/profile/238129	Tim_37	Board Member	5	10/23/2013	 The Harvard Business School Association of Oregon (HBSAO) measured the social return on investment of The Shadow Project back in 2011.  Its findings revealed that for every dollar invested in the program, there is greater than a tenfold return to society.  This was the greatest return ever measured by HBSAO.   The program encourages children with learning disabilities to set goals, builds self-esteem, and teaches deferred gratification through goal setting exercises.  It changes how kids view themselves and changes how they view school.  The program is also replicable and consistent with the State's educational goals.  It's great to see this small nonprofit started from a mother's effort to encourage her son's learning take off like it has. 
Shadow Project	171654	1	/users/profile/227275	LyonsPDX	Board Member	5	09/24/2013	The real impact on our learning challenged children is remarkable and measureable. The Shadow Project program is now expanding to additional school districts in east Multnomah County that serve more lower income families. With more expansion and growth more children will be served. They will find hope, confidence, and success in school and life. The outcome is living lives with more independence and personal success, not failure.

Hatch Innovation	4498	37	/users/profile/6216	Rosemary Forester	Client Served	5	05/07/2009	Springboard Innovation is to me the greatest gift that any of us would-be social change-agents could have.I was a 'student' in Springboard's Local Agenda program. It is a content rich, very supportive program. Those leading the program drew on their various experiences including:- experiential course design, non-profit founding and going through the Local Agenda program themselves. When we were fumbling and bumbling around with vague ideas I witnessed Amy Pearl, Executive Director, time after time, collapse those ideas into short, firm pictures.  What a joy to us.  Paul Osterlund, a Local Agenda graduate, was able to identify with us when we gritted our teeth in the most difficult part ... having to learn to stand up infront of others and verbalize what motivated us to embark on the journey that would lead us to found non-profit organizations.   Springboard took us step-by-step through a process that is necessary but so hard to do on one's own.  The support of a cohort group is invaluable.  There's nothing like watching other people go through the same difficulties that you are grappling with and come out with detailed projects at the end.  Throughout the process the Springboard staff, Board members and advisers were there to give us support.  I'll bet alot of us were delighted and surprised that we accomplished what we did by the end of the course. We found talents within ourselves that we never knew we had.  We simply would not have done that without Springboard.  It gave us the courage to keep on keeping on.I would say that at this topsy turvy time of our lives, when we are 'It', if we ever want to see the kind of society about which we dream, Springboard is a model that needs to be copied many, many times over.

Hatch Innovation	4472	35	/users/profile/6192	Steph	Client Served	5	05/06/2009	Springboard Innovation has created a completely innovative program, Local Agenda, to support everyday folks in developing a vision and then a business to promote social change. They have taken this concept to an entirely new level by developing a "social stock exchange", ChangeXchange, to obtain seed funding for these new business ideas.  I took the first Local Agenda class and am now a "launcher' on ChangeXchange.  Amy has inspired me to think in a completely new way and has mentored and supported me every step of the way.  I cannot say enough good things about this organization and what they have done for me.  Portland is very lucky to have this gift.
Hatch Innovation	4468	37	/users/profile/6188	John D Brown	Client Served	5	05/05/2009	My first exposure to SI was attending the first forum.  It was like walking into the answer to a big prayer, or a bunch of smaller prayers for the support and development of Rooms for Peace.It was quickly recognized that there was a beautiful match between Springboard Innovation and Rooms for Peace, and Amy and crew made it so easy and comfortable and welcoming to join as one of the Changexchange projects.I would be happy to talk at length about this support.  Until SI came along, creative social profit grass roots projects had no road map or champion.  That has all changed.  I hope many many more of you will choose to let Springboard Innovation bring your ideas to the surface, support their development, and launch them into the world.  Amy and her team are social change angels!
Hatch Innovation	4461	30	/users/profile/5918	Claresi	Client Served	5	05/05/2009	I thought I was a creative thinker until I met the Springboard team. Stop grappling with your existential angst and take this class.
Hatch Innovation	4154	33	/users/profile/5897	sallyreb	Client Served	5	04/27/2009	Springboard Innovation offers those interested in social profit work support, guidance and opportunity that are not available anywhere else. Springboard Innovation truly supports community led community change! I participated in the Local Agenda workshops, a series of classes that help those interested in developing new ideas for sustainable social profit projects.  I would highly recommend the Local Agenda workshops. To read more about the Local Agenda workshops see this site - http://www.learninginnovation.org/LocalAgenda.phpI also have attended a number of the Social Innovation Forums.  These events highlight current projects or programs in the community.  The Forums are a great place to make connections with others.  I am most excited about the ChangeXchange, (www.thechangexchange.org ), an online tools that allows new social profit projects to list their projects and for members of the public to support these innovative, sustainable projects though small (or large!) donations. You can support social change with just a $5.00 donation.  Give it a try!

Hatch Innovation	3988	29	/users/profile/5741	LauraP	Client Served	5	04/24/2009	Springboard Innovation is an amazing new organization, offering the missing pieces needed to bring innovation to the masses - from the masses!  It has a variety of components, from training "everyday people" to identify the issues that they are most passionate about, to helping them imagine, create and fund solutions to address the core problems. SI leads people from the idea of be the change into the reality of their own lives, for the good of their communities.  The idea of taking social entrepreneurship from the exclusive few to the mainstream is exhilarating, the power will be massive!
Hatch Innovation	3928	33	/users/profile/5686	paul.osterlund	Client Served	5	04/24/2009	I think Springboard Innovation brings to regular people some of the best curricula, training and web resources that let people like me see a way to get from a problem to a solution.  I retired from my professional career and was potently influenced by the work of Springboard, so that I create a social venture called Abundance Farming Project.  AFP enables subsistence farmers in developing economies to offset the impact of water scarcity and increase food crop yields, using a starch-based biodegradable superabsorbent soil amendment, distributed through established NGOs. While that is a mouthful, my point is Springboards work enables people to make a difference in a powerful way that they would not be able to do on their own.  Their Innovative Cities model is a pathway for citizen led social ventures supported by needed infrastructure with cities. With Springboards newest capacity building tool, ChangeXchange, (www.thechangexchange.org ) emerging social ventures as well as established non-profits, who want to develop sustaining strategies, can list their projects for seed funding and for connecting with a broad base of supporters who invest in the social value returns, in $5 shares.  Springboard Innovation provides tools for citizen led social change that can be implemented on a large scale, city by city, and a wonderful opportunity for grassroots philanthropy with ChangeXchange.
Hatch Innovation	3902	25	/users/profile/5664	Peg	Client Served	5	04/23/2009	I have taken the Local Agenda Course, a series of workshops that support new social entrepreneurs.  Here are some thoughts that I have about what the course offers that I haven't found elsewhere and why I think it is a fantastic and worthy organization to support.  Each workshop spoke to the spark inside me that is flickering on the verge of ignition and has empowered me to keep on working toward my goals of 'doing good' and 'making a difference.'  The workshops were a container for me, a place where I could be fully present to what it is that keeps pulling at me to be born.  The format of the course series has a beautiful way of providing support that is both respectful and nurturing. We are doing difficult work trying to bring forth powerful ideas and these workshops honor that and encourage us to work hard and dig in.  I am very appreciative of the opportunity to have been a participant.
Portland Animal Welfare Team	113378	1	/users/profile/154290	thaddeusb	Volunteer	5	05/31/2012	I`ve come to Paw team recently, and being unemployed I have some flex time That I feel that I could put to use and help out a great organization.I  feel that there is such a need for their services in our community ,regrettably the need far outweighs the resources to help all of those in need.I  know that Paw team is grateful for all of the people that do take time out of their weekends to help and do what they can.That is why I`m a little taken back by some of the reviews that some of the so called volunteers.In particular the people that say they just stood around and didn`t do anything for the first hour.This is interesting,for there is so much that needs to be done.Especially the days of the clinics.Like I said I`m new to Paw Team, and I`ve always had a full day.Maybe if these people might leave the break room, put down the donuts and/or coffee and see on their own what they could contribute or help with.Believe me there is never a shortage of the help that we need.In closing for anyone that wants to give back to our community, this is an excellent organization to do that .As I do,you will get back so much more than you give , Thaddeus Byrne ( grateful volunteer)
Portland Animal Welfare Team	112523	2	/users/profile/153159	Community is everything	Volunteer	5	05/21/2012	 I recently found out about paw team and fell in love with there mission almost right away. I have been in a situation myself where I was unable to provide the kind of care I wanted to for my dog and because of that I believe her life was cut short. I know the pain and struggle of loosing your job and then having your animal get sick right around the same time, it's awful. I felt like the best way to honor my girl was to get involved with a group that helped people in my situation so that's exactly what I did. Paw team has given me a unique way to honor my girl and connect with others in a similar situation. I feel blessed to share their stories of hope and see such an important service be given to those in need. Thank you paw team, if only I had found you sooner.
Portland Animal Welfare Team	112374	1	/users/profile/152931	Bently	Professional with expertise in this field	1	05/18/2012	The review from the attorney was VERY HELPFUL!  I looked on the Oregon Corporation website as suggested and saw that the information about the structure of PAW Team was absolutely accurate and a cause for concern.  But then I took a step further and looked up the listed partners with the PAW Team and that was VERY INTERESTING!  Safe Dogs by the River is composed of Wendy and Chelsea, the two people who are the "members" that control the PAW Team AND draw a salary!  So are they inventing partners for grants!? Highly suspect!  I will not support this organization.
Portland Animal Welfare Team	111404	1	/users/profile/151684	Done with PAW	Volunteer	1	05/04/2012	I just got an email asking for volunteers at the next clinic.  My last experience was so bad I am not volunteering again.  I had to show up at 8am on a Sunday morning only to sit around for an hour with nothing to do.  So I am not doing that again.  But my comment is more to the inacurate content of the email the Paw Team sent me.  It states that they have had 3 clinics this year and served 100 animals at each.  This is an NOT TRUE.  I volunteered for their first large clinic in March where we served 70 animals, not 100.  They February clinic was not at the new location and served 20 animals.  i cannot speak to the April clinic since I won't volunteer again.  From what I have read on this site, the structure is at the very least questionable.  What I know from personal experience, the organization is not honest.
Portland Animal Welfare Team	111013	2	/users/profile/151087	Barbara deManincor	Advisor	5	04/28/2012	As a co-founder, I have been involved with the PAW Team since it's inception.  I know first hand the amount of energy and creativity contributed by the administrative staff, the board, and the volunteer doctors and support staff.  The stories of the animals and caregivers that come to the PAW Team for help are compelling.  I fully support the mission of the PAW Team and encourage anyone who understands the nurturing, healing relationship shared by people and animals to confidently donate time and/or funding to this organization. 
Portland Animal Welfare Team	110998		/users/profile/151069	traesin	Volunteer	5	04/28/2012	I have volunteered at many of the monthly clinic.  It has been a great experience for me.  I love what this clinic can do, I only wish that it could do more.  The need is great out there for this type of place.  If you can only donate time or money to one place, this is it.  If your not sure, come to one of the clinics and see what is being done to help out our four legged friends.
Portland Animal Welfare Team	110385	1	/users/profile/150269	John H	Donor	2	04/20/2012	There is something wrong with this organization.  The web site states they have large monthly clinics yet every time I tried to volunteer for one it was cancelled. I think they barely had half the number of large clinic claimed.  It is a great mission but they are not doing it. I have no idea where my donation was used but I know it was not used for the purposes I intended to help.  I will not be donating again to this organization.

Portland Animal Welfare Team	108852	2	/users/profile/148142	afergu	Board Member	5	04/03/2012	I have volunteered for PAW Team for over 4 years and have seen the organization grow tremendously to meet the equally growing need for services in our community. Because I believe strongly in the mission of the organization and greatly respect the work that was started by the founding members and board, I have become more involved as a Core Team volunteer and in late 2011, became a board member. PAW Team is emerging from a transitional, growing period as a strong organization, well suited to meet our mission and have a great impact on the homeless and extremely poor of Portland. I'd like to address some of the inaccuracies mentioned in a previous review, for clarification of the record: PAW Team is indeed a membership organization, as detailed in our bylaws. The founders hired Cindy Cumfer, a well-respected non-profit attorney in Portland who has authored 7 editions of the "Non-profit law in Oregon" book. Cindy was consulted by the founders when they began the process of adding a larger Board of Directors and paid staff in 2009. Cindy recommended and set up the organization as a membership organization at that time. There are currently 3 members, 2 of whom founded the organization; only 1 is paid staff, the Executive Director, whose dedication and incredible work ethic are admirable and beyond the call of duty. There are a number of "Core" volunteers who handle primary day-to-day operations, clinics preparation, and follow-up with clients. A larger base of volunteers fill the many roles needed for our successful monthly clinics, at each of which we see around 100 companion animals and their people. The Board of Directors retains ALL powers of oversight and any other financial and accountability issues, including oversight of the Executive Director; this and a wealth of other information is provided to all Board Directors in a comprehensive Board Director Information Packet (including bylaws and detailed financial reports). The commentor below may have been misinformed; I personally have the aforementioned packet, have read it all, and can attest to the clarity and transparency of all relevant information that a board member would need to know, as well as the willingness of the members and Executive Director to answer any questions and communicate openly with the Board and volunteers. I am excited about PAW Team's future, am thrilled to be a part of it, and am thankful for the compassionate and hard-working staff and volunteers who have put so much into realizing the mission of this great organization. The biggest payoff is hearing our clients' stories. They are so grateful to PAW Team for caring about the bonds they have with their companion animals; many of them would not be able to properly care for or keep their companion animals-- a vital part of their lives-- without the services, medications, and education that PAW Team provides.
Portland Animal Welfare Team	108152	3	/users/profile/147197	Janna N.	Volunteer	5	03/22/2012	I have volunteered with PawTeam for about 18 months. The organization does amazing work and is a great place to volunteer. Clinics are busy and well organized and so very needed in our city. On average we see 100 pets at each clinic which is an amazing feat! I have always found the "people in charge" to be open, honest, compassionate and always open to suggestions on ways to improve how the clinics are run. The clients we serve are wonderful and so grateful for the help that we are able to offer them and their pets. You don't have to be a vet to help with the clinics and it is rewarding. If you are looking for an animal type volunteer experience this is a great one to work with. 
Portland Animal Welfare Team	108135	2	/users/profile/147162	boardmember6	Board Member	5	03/21/2012	PAWTeam is a sound and thriving nonprofit. It is not flawed, structurally or otherwise. Quite distinct from having any sort of "control" or "oversight" problems at all, the organization has in fact been admirably  managed and operated past a series of difficult obstacles, financial and administrative, including by overcoming a recent inexplicable attempt by newcomers to derail its forward progress. PAWTeam's exemplary leadership extends well out into the Portland veterinarian community and beyond, its strength arising directly from its core, founder Wendy Kohn, who was the first person to recognize and confront a critical need in the Portland community - that of obtaining accessible veterinary care for low income and homeless citizens - by creating a rich network of professionals and laypeople committed to betterment in both animal and human welfare. PAWTeam is and has been a powerful force for social change in our city, a trajectory that will not be thwarted simply by some personal bitterness voiced by the disgruntled and vocal few.

I can honestly say that my time with them has been the most rewarding of my life! I was going to say that I have made amazing friends, but they are so much more than that---they are FAMILY. As I said in my provious review, raising a puppy is an emotional roller coaster, but I am so excited and feel extremely privilidged to be able to raise my next puppy starting this summer.  I thank God every day for bringing this amazing group of people into my life :-)  If you have the opportunity to become involved, in any way, you will not regret your decision.
Canine Angels Service Teams	140035		/users/profile/186153	KBrewer	Volunteer	5	11/15/2012	Canine Angels Service Teams  - I cant say enough wonderful things about this group.  They have dedicated their lives to raising and training canine angels for children and young adults with special needs - and ask for nothing in return.  As a puppy raiser I have ridden the emotional roller coaster of getting a new puppy, watching him grow into a great dog, turning him in for advanced training, and then the pleasure of presenting him to his child and experiencing the joy he brought to the child and changes the dog has brought to the childs life since.  As usual, I have tears in my eyes as I write this :-)  Words cannot express all that Canine Angels Service Teams does for these children and young adults.  What an amazing group!!

Orion is the perfect dog for both my son and our family!  The staff and volunteers of Canine Angels are very caring and have continued to help us along the way.  Team Training was such a wonderful experience for our whole family.  We learned so much!  With Orion by his side, Joseph is more confident and self-assured.

She is a wonderful dog, as this is my 3rd service dog i feel that I am an expert on how the dogs are Trained.  CAST was very responsive in listening to me on exactly what I needed my service dog to do for me.  All of my needs were met and my dog does everything I need her to do and she was ready to learn even more as we got to be partners.  I would definetly recommend CAST if you are looking for a service dog, social dog or PAL.  The dogs are well trained and well loved.  The training program you go through is geared to the clients being served.  CAST remembers that you are the client and they are providing a service and they answer and meet your needs.

The follow up after our initial training sessions  have been especially appreciated.  We are a Canine Angels Assisted Service Dog Team.  My teen with cerebral palsy is now more confident and is looking forward to certifying at the next level.  We love that Canine Angels have created mentorships for our teens with disabilities.  The Puppy Raisers and Volunteers at each event that we have attended have been fantastic!
Canine Angels Service Teams	140083		/users/profile/186246	Shanna H.	Client Served	5	11/15/2012	Canine Angels completely changed our lives for the better. Our PAL pup has not only become a complete part of our lives, but of our family as well.  My daughter went from being a relatively shy girl, to a young lady filled with confidence, with a large part of her recovery and growth placed upon our Canine Angels pup.  
Canine Angels Service Teams	140064		/users/profile/186222	kc72	General Member of the Public	5	11/15/2012	Very impressed with how this org runs & how they help kids with special interest.   Parents of special needs appreciate you.  
Canine Angels Service Teams	139939		/users/profile/186087	Jennifer174	Volunteer	5	11/15/2012	My husband and I have been looking into being puppy raisers for a service dog organization for the past couple of years and after looking into many went on the recommendation of a friend and volunteered to be puppy raisers for canine angels.  We are now on our second puppy and have been thrilled with the experience.  The staff has been incredibly generous with their time and gone above and beyond to make this process easy for us.  Turning a dog in for advanced training that has been with you everywhere for over a year is definitely hard, but getting updates and pictures has made the process easier.  Knowing that my girl is happy and learning makes it all worth while.  I have also had the opportunity to meet some of the families and children who have received a service dog from canine angels and am amazed at the difference these dogs make in a child's life.  We can't wait to see the difference that one of the puppies we raise will make in a child's life thanks to Canine Angels.
Canine Angels Service Teams	139883		/users/profile/186031	Janet54	Volunteer	5	11/15/2012	August 20, 2011 I volunteered to be a puppy raiser for Canine Angels. They arranged the pickup at Liberty Lake, WA so I would not have to drive all the way to Oregon. I raised & trained Disco for 13 months after that and throughout the process I was in monthly contact with these folks. They were available if I had questions or concerns and when I turned her in for Advanced Training, they arranged a pickup for her 85 miles from here rather than having to drive 950 miles out to Grants Pass. Since the turnin, I have chatted with the head trainer, Sandy, and she assured me that all was fine. I have only met 1 person out of their personnel, but through phone calls & E-mails, I feel like I know them. They are doing exceptional work matching these beautiful dogs up with children who really need their companionship. Please consider these folks for the Great Nonprofit Award. Janet W.

Hundreds of volunteers work to put together an important summer event for the city. There is no charge for admission to the event and it provides great entertainment for thousands of citizens and its visitors.

Portland is a great city to visit outdoor events such as the Festa Italiana.   Fun to meet up with people and spend the evening enjoying a little wine and people watching. Free to get into and the prices for food and wine are reasonable.  Viva la Festa

I have served as boad member, publicity director,parlamentarian,and cureently coordinate the production of the Festa Brochure.The involvment is certainly rewarding as we strive to share the beauty of the Italian culturte with the local community.
Festa Italiana Association Inc	29944	4	/users/profile/30935	chatten	Volunteer	4	02/22/2010	Festa is a chance for a lot of people, Italians and "wanna bes" like me, to mingle and mangiano in downtown Portland. What I like about the annual Festa is the fun, and the scope ... everything from a Mass to kick the event off well and respectfully, to Opera students performing in the square (Pioneer Square, or Piazza Pioneer for the weekend) to food, fun and the pleasure of sharing Italian culture with anyone who happens by. The committee is very responsive to feedback; in 2010 it's restructuring the entire restaurant deal in response to concerns that Festa had lost a step on food quality. It's now adding a Green committee to improve that aspect of the public event .. something all groups NEED to do. I'm pleased to be on the host committee this year and look forward to seeing what will happen when we adopt "festa verde" (Green Festa) ideals ... how many plastic cups can we NOT add to the landfill! And still serve a bout 30,000 folks over several days of summer fun.Ciao and Grazie
Festa Italiana Association Inc	29682	4	/users/profile/30689	4bologna	Board Member	4	02/21/2010	Festa Italiana Association is a hard-working, enthusiastic group that puts on an extremely popular event taking place in Portland's "piazza", Pioneer Square, every August. Tens of thousands of people eat, drink, dance and enjoy camaraderie under sunny skies and starry nights. I really enjoy some of the "auxiliary" events like film night and the bocce tournament that lead up to the main event. Sometimes I wish Festa were more Italian and less Italian-American, especially when it comes to the entertainment and food.
Festa Italiana Association Inc	29535	5	/users/profile/30551	tsxvrom1	Volunteer	5	02/20/2010	The Festa is held in the Portland city square downtown and draws locals and visitors estimated at about 30-40 thousand over a 3-day period.  Entertainment covers all ages from a puppet show to an Italian dance band.  It is a fun event with never an altercation or fight.  The mood is festive but family friendly. There is no charge for admission.
Festa Italiana Association Inc	29387	4	/users/profile/30412	lirabelle	Volunteer	4	02/19/2010	This is a great time to meet new people and then see them again year after year.  Many are now considered friends.   Its a quaint, fun event that the whole family can attend.

You do not have to be Italian to have fun at this event just have an interest in good Italian food, wine and non stop Italian entertainment.  Something for the entire family. Each year I run into old friends, relatives and meet several new people.   Portland is such a beautiful city and August in the Square is hard to beat.  A great day for all.   And it is Free.
Festa Italiana Association Inc	29371	6	/users/profile/30397	shireen	Board Member	5	02/19/2010	My involvement with Festa Italiana is an immensely rewarding experience.  As a non-Italian who loves Italian culture, participation in this organization is teaching me a lot about Italy plus has helped me to meet many of her sons and daughters who live in Portland and beyond, as well as develop my own leadership skills.  When I first started with Festa back in 2005, I was welcome with open arms. I am very proud to serve on the board of an organization whose mission involves putting on a cultural celebration every year, to make the culture more accessible to the greater community, through personal engagement and education.
SMART (Start Making A Reader Today)	312260		/users/profile/403614	Gail70	Volunteer	5	10/20/2016	I have volunteered with SMART for ten years, five years as a reader and five as a site coordinator. This is a great program! Each child reads twice a week for 30 minutes per session.  Once a month the children get to choose 2 books to keep. Volunteers read for an hour with the same two children for 30 minutes each, all year. It is so rewarding to see these kids grow as readers and people. This is a fabulous literacy program but it is also a mentorship, relationship building program. I have seen kids walk into our room having a rough day and 30 minutes later they leave with a smile on their face. Good times!
SMART (Start Making A Reader Today)	312254		/users/profile/403609	Jody37	Volunteer	5	10/19/2016	I love being a reader and volunteer because it allows me to give to my community without giving a ton a time.

I love this program! Nothing better than an excited child coming through the door, a smile on their face, marching over to the books to select the day's choice & settling in beside you to read it. When I first started, I was amazed, and sad, at how many children weren't read to at home and/or had no or few books at home. We make a difference and, yes, it does take a Village....these children are our future! Get Involved, Become A Volunteer!

SMART (Start Making A Reader Today)	304855	1	/users/profile/396044	Writer	Volunteer	5	09/15/2016	I have been a SMART reader for nearly a decade.

SMART (Start Making A Reader Today)	304826	1	/users/profile/286028	fkukla	Volunteer	5	09/15/2016	I have been a SMART volunteer in Oregon for 5 years and love it! It's so enjoyable for students as well as the volunteers.  As a volunteer, you can see the progress of the kids on a week to week basis. It's so enjoyable remaining friends with the kids that you've read with years ago - they will always remember that you were their SMART reader. SMART is one of the best nonprofit organizations I've had the privilege of being involved with.  If you enjoy working with kids (preschool - 2nd grade), I highly recommend that you consider volunteering for SMART.
SMART (Start Making A Reader Today)	34264	3	/users/profile/34762	audrey4	Volunteer	4	03/31/2010	It was so much fun being a reading mentor with the Oregon SMART program. It was great to see how excited students would be for their reading time! I only wish I had known about the program sooner. I volunteered during my last two quarters at the U of O and would have loved to help more kids discover the joy of reading.
Alagille Syndrome Alliance	128323		/users/profile/173474	cterrio	Client Served	5	10/24/2012	My daughter, Kassidy, was diagnosed on March 10, 2006, with stage IV neuroblastoma when she was 6 years old.  She has undergone several doses of high dose chemo and transplant, radiation, and antibodies.  We travel to Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in NYC.  After 6 years of doing so, we have run out of travel funds.  Miracle Flights for Kids is paying for our next trip!  We are so very grateful to them for helping not only our family but so many others.
Alagille Syndrome Alliance	121682	1	/users/profile/165554	Taricia B.	Client Served	5	08/30/2012	My son was diagnosed with Alagille Syndrome in 2009. The lists of facts and figures on the internet was terrifying. I could only find one charity specifically dedicated to ALGS, but it was based in the USA and I am from the UK. I was desperate for up to date information so I dropped them a line to see if they could send me some. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that their service extends world wide. I receive regular newsletters, I am able to access their message boards, I freely chat with people all over the world on facebook and have made some of the best friends I have. Most of whom I shall never meet, but who the alliance has united. Dealing with a rare disease can make you feel isolated, uninformed and helpless. The Alagille Syndrome Alliance provides facts, support, research grants and anything else they can think of to ease the lives of those connected to this disease, with a view to one day eradicating it completely. I will be forever grateful.
Alagille Syndrome Alliance	120435		/users/profile/163801	patti e	Client Served	5	08/11/2012	We were devastated and scared when we learned our newborn son had a rare liver disease.   In 1995 there was almost no information about Alagille Syndrome (ALGS) on the internet.  Finding the Alliance gave us hope.  With their help we were able to connect with other ALGS families, learn more about ALGS and find doctors familiar with ALGS.   Our 17 year ALGS journey has been so much less of a struggle because of the friends we have made and the support we have found through the Alliance.

It was great to have a diagnosis, but what did it mean???  The Alliance was the first place I ended up.  I was able to get key information for the care of my daughter.  I learned about CHOP and the annual Gehman picnic.  We attended the symposium in SanFrancisco.  We made freinds for life.  It is a community where you can go for support and ask questions.  What a blessing it has been.

But as I did research I found this Alliance became my go-to for updates, questions and most importantly, finding others to connect with!! I love the growth charts the Alliance has provided because they are more accurate than the standard charts for baby boys. I also love that my family gets to participate in our first Alagille Syndrome Awareness walk this year and I would have never known about it had I not connected with families in the Massachusetts areas. Great group and I'm so happy to be a part of it!

Alagille Syndrome Alliance	118068		/users/profile/160577	ckennedy	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/11/2012	As a life science professional with the goal of developing treatments for patients organizations like the Alagille Syndrome Alliance are the key to bringing new treatments to patients. The alliance is not only focused on supporting patients and families in managing their condition but also focused on helping the life science community understand this disease and working together to provide funding for research and supporting research in many other ways. Often times it is organizations like the Alagille Syndrome Alliance that act as the collective voice of Alagille patients and families across the country that help make new therapies a reality.
Alagille Syndrome Alliance	118064		/users/profile/160573	spogrebinsky	Client Served	5	07/11/2012	Thanks to the Alagille Syndrome Alliance we were able to find a lot of relevant information when our daughter was first diagnosed.  They helped to connect us with other families in similar situations.  Also, since Alagille is a rare disease, it was very important to connect to the right doctors.  They were very helpful in finding the right doctor for us.  Every four years Alliance organizes the Symposium for the families.  It is a very informative event where they pull medical experts and families together for multi-day informational sessions.  From what I heard, it is very rare to have such an active Alliance for a rare condition.  Thank you for all your help.

My husband found a dog that he fell in love with and I downloaded the application, as well as emailing to set up a time to meet the dog.  I was told that I needed to wait a week for an adoption fair and that there were several families that would all be their to adopt the same $300 Puppy.  Hi to the human society and do a dog good.  We will be.
Oregon Friends of Shelter Animals	293149	3	/users/profile/383727	Jessie32paws	General Member of the Public	1	06/16/2016	Avoid this place like the plague! They are unethical, defamatory, greedy and corrupt. They prey on kind-hearted people who only seek to help God's creatures. They disguise themselves as a "non-profit" rescue, but feel free to take a look at their PUBLIC tax records...I will attach a link. They have recently filed a lawsuit with one of their adoptors over puppies that were born from the dog that was adopted. They also slandered the husbands name even though he had nothing to do with the adoption and had never met them nor stepped foot in their facility. Irony, he works for one of their sponsors! They supposedly didn't know the dog was pregnant, which I find to be complete rubbish. If you are a legit rescue who is in this ALL for the welfare of the animal, wouldn't a full health screen be your number ONE priority, ESPECIALLY if you are adopting the dog to a family that may have NO experience taking on that task!!! Let's get back to that...WHY would you sue the adoptor for the adoption fee of what each puppy would grant you, had the adoptor been willing to put forth the birthing of the pups and the 8 weeks(!!!) it took taking care of them until suitable homes were found, and then just release them back to OFOSA to make a PROFIT? It seems greed motivated to ME! PLEASE do research on this organization (term used loosely because they seem very disorganized) before adopting a pet or donating to them!!! DO NOT use their Facebook page as a reference because I know for a FACT that they have deleted negative posts! Mine was one of them. They only want you to read the "good  stuff". https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/200003876

Oregon Friends of Shelter Animals	188878	1	/users/profile/246519	AbbyU	Volunteer	5	11/19/2013	I volunteered wuth OFOSA and it truly changed my life for the better and I could not imagine life without the people and animals of OFOSA. We are nearing our 100th foster (we do dogs and cats) and I have logged just over 350 volunteer hours since February 2013 (it is now November 2013), so it is no secret that I enjoy my time at OFOSA. I have been on one transport to Southern CA, and even though everything that couldve gone wrong did(with even the vehicle breaking down), it was one of the most influential things i have ever done with my life. PS. For those of you upset that OFOSA goes down to CA, just realize, they go out of their way in the COMMUNITY as well. They also pull from Bonnie  Hays and drive to Eastern oregon just to pick up animals from rescuers when there is a need. OFOSA takes on medical cases, from proken pelvises, bones, extreme cases of cherry eye, and any animal that needs help and that they can get. They also take owner surrenders when space allows. There is definately no rescue or shelter anything like OFOSA that I have ever heard of. I had been a volunteer for OHS before this, but within days of being at OFOSA, I knew I was making a bigger impact there with my time than I would ever make at OHS.  So, if youre looking to volunteer, donate, foster, or adopt, I strongly reccomend OFOSA.

I still go in  just not every day as I used to. I know that this rescue started to slide side ways however the founder took back the reigns. The rescue was founded on healing the broken animals that nobody wanted. It is getting back to it's roots. A fire and hire took place. Think OFOSA is getting back to the basics.
Oregon Friends of Shelter Animals	156672	7	/users/profile/207804	Miley F.	Client Served	1	04/29/2013	II adopted a dog from them about one month ago and have some major complaints.1. The adoption fee was substantially higher than many others in the area. At the time of adoption I justified it because they seemed to really care about the animals and their foster placement, so this wasn't a deal breaker. They also included the spay/neuter in this fee.2. Had I known that the facility they do their spay and neuter surgery in was a run down old house with obviously unsanitary and unsterile conditions, I NEVER would have agreed to adopt or have them spay our puppy. I questioned it upon arrival but unfortunately didn't have the good sense to turn around and walk out, because...3. They gave my puppy an internal infection during her spay surgery, which then led to a mass on her belly that eventually ruptured, causing more infection, not to mention $300 more in bet bills. When I called OFOSA the not-so-friendly woman who answered basically said they wouldn't do anything about it and as soon as they finish spaying, they release them medically and can't assume responsibility for any complications. Please do not support this organization!!
Oregon Friends of Shelter Animals	111232	7	/users/profile/151424	feline1234	Volunteer	1	05/01/2012	Their mission statement has now changed. Instead of fostering young kittens and cats in homes they are now storing them in pet stores and cages. Many of these felines have been brought in by other states and not from our own community.  Many of our own community kittens and cats are dying because of this. Not to mention they are no longer a rescue/foster but more along the lines of a puppy mill/feline mill. Many of these cats and kittens are not getting the social skills and love from a home before going to a new home, not to mention some are even sickly. Money now speaks louder then caring love form OFOSA.

Oregon Friends of Shelter Animals	102841	1	/users/profile/136041	lclieben	Volunteer	5	01/04/2012	I was invited to learn about and work with OFOSA through a friend.  He knew I had recently lost my dog after 16 1/2 years and was trying to decide if or when  I wanted to get another dog.  It was a tough time, he suggested I would enjoy working with foster dogs, helping them get healthy and comfortable in a home setting.   I wasn't sure, but my first foster, Palmer, was a great little dog with demadex mange.  He was so sweet and smart, but not getting selected at the adoption events.  He was in my home for over 3 months and in that time his skin healed and hair filled in, he gained weight, learned a handful of tricks.  By the time he found his forever family, it broke my heart a little and I cried as I let him go, but still I am happy for him.  He has a wonderful home on the OREGON coast.  He goes for walks on the beach almost everyday and is the light of his new pet parents life.  So I signed up for another foster and then another.  Finally, my ninth foster was just too perfect and like so many OFOSA volunteers before me, I failed!  I adopted my 9th foster myself, making me a "foster failure", but a rescue success.  Now Sputnik and I welcome new fosters into our home together and I think she does as much as I do to help these wonderful deserving animal prepare for a happy new life.  I would recommend this experience to anyone.  It is fun, fulfilling and make a big difference for very deserving animals.

Coming from Germany, where solar is very common because of the financial incentive, I was surprised to find so much enthusiasm for renewable energy because of environment reasons here in the U.S. The leadership at SolTrekker really is at the front of that enthusiasm and passion.While building the bus from a old RV shell, they were very committed to research and installing the most sustainable building materials available, not just to the idea of being green, but to put it into practice.I feel sure that the free education they do at schools without much money is helping to make the students more educated about conservation and efficiency and inspiring them to make actions that will provide solutions to climate change and environment destruction.

He tours and instructs children from low-income and diverse student populations about renewable energy and environmental sustainability in our public school system. This is a socially responsible non profit and they deserve our support.
Soltrekker	37234	7	/users/profile/37965	wendy-hall	General Member of the Public	5	04/28/2010	I was fortunate enough to be part of a small tour, led by Ty Adams, of the SolTrekker RV. We were guided through all of the intricate details of how they refurbished the RV to be powered by solar energy, including insulating with old blue jeans! They are clearly passionate about what they do, and serious about imparting what they've learned and making it accessible to all, including kids. I have not gotten a look yet at their waffle cart, but I am pleased at this new venture they have created in order to bring in more funding. They are so creative!
Soltrekker	37193	4	/users/profile/37928	shackleton	Volunteer	5	04/27/2010	SolTrekker is an admirable non-profit in that it founds its mission in awareness and education.  With the aim of making renewable sources of energy more accessible to individuals of all social classes, the organization strives to educate those in need.  Ty has gone to great lengths to promote sustainability by incorporating visual examples (such as the sustainable bus and its individual functions) for students and adults.  Also, the goals remain particularly precise, in that the local community remains the highest priority.
Soltrekker	37162	6	/users/profile/37903	astadtlander	Board Member	5	04/27/2010	I joined SolTrekker to assist in helping others become more aware of renewable energy and its potential to help solve the challenges of climate change and resource wars. I think the biggest strength of the organization is that it is unique and generates a lot of attention and inspiration. I'd say the biggest challenge of the organization is fundraising.
Soltrekker	37143	8	/users/profile/37889	adlock2000	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/27/2010	Help students gain experience working in food service industry and in customer service. Great non-profit, help the environment and students.
Soltrekker	37137	7	/users/profile/37885	allison3	Board Member	5	04/27/2010	This organization does amazing things. While I've been involved in many background things, the partnership with PPS has been invaluable. SolTrekker inspires people to be more sustainable!!  This organization has provided invaluable lessons and education to my students and they are really moving forward with their goals due to their work and interactions with SolTrekker. We never would be where we are without it.
Soltrekker	36693	9	/users/profile/37477	ted-gleichman	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/23/2010	SolTrekker, with its beautiful fully-renewable eco-RV, combines the best of both worlds for students and teachers:It provides the excitement of a field trip, with presentations that students love.  And it brings that excitement to the school door, dramatically simplifying logistics (and reducing costs!) for teachers and schools.The simplicity and elegance of seeing renewable technology in such an accessible way touches students deeply, and gives them a learning experience that they will carry forward.
Oregon Humane Society	193776		/users/profile/253122	AKatt	Donor	5	02/04/2014	I've been a donor to OHS for about seven years and knew about the good work of adoptions, but until I took a tour of the shelter, I had no idea about how much the organization does! The stories of lives saved are truly inspirational. I have since adopted a cat who had been brought in injured. Other shelters might not have been able to save her, but the folks in their animal hospital took a chance and saved her life. I'm so grateful for all OHS does!
Oregon Humane Society	193723	1	/users/profile/253035	baures	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/03/2014	The Oregon Humane Society has proven to be an invaluable resource for Jackson County Animal Care and Control.  They provided an extremely thorough and professional review of our program, in addition to sending professionals to our shelter to train our staff.  By implementing the recommendations they made, we have greatly improved our live release rates and reputation in our community.  They are always willing to lend a helping hand when called upon.  In short, Oregon Humane Society is a first-class organization.
Oregon Humane Society	193718	1	/users/profile/253028	Bsquare14	Client Served	5	02/03/2014	I adopted my dog Brodie from OHS and my cat Ozzie. I found the staff and volunteers to be very knowledgeable and caring towards the pets. I also liked that they offered continuing support for me and my pets if I should need it. A good clean shelter with one of the highest save rates in the country. A ++!
Oregon Humane Society	193630		/users/profile/252898	Screeeeen	General Member of the Public	1	01/31/2014	Over my strenuous objections, the Oregon Humane Society adopted an expensive kitten ($150) to two 18 year old boys (one of whom is my son) who lack a steady source of income. The cat will stay with the other young man, who will love the cat but also provide it with a steady source of second-hand pot smoke.  Way to go Oregon Humane Society. Ending petlessness, two potheads at a time.
Oregon Humane Society	151973		/users/profile/202986	Sowkindseeds	Donor	5	04/02/2013	OHS is truly dedicated to animal welfare. I always feel my donation is well spent and much appreciated, not matter the size. Love the people there and the facility. Have visited some other Humane Societies around the country, and while all were good, OHS is the best!
Oregon Humane Society	60307	1	/users/profile/65518	morgandlw	Volunteer	5	01/18/2011	As an OHS volunteer, I would like to say that OHS does an amazing job in engaging and empowering their volunteers, providing a most rewarding experience.  By doing this, they have a huge amount of volunteer involvement which reduces employee expense and provides a more caring environment for the animals.  As a donor and volunteer, I appreciate their use of volunteers and their amazing marketing and management-all of which contributes to a very high adoption rate. I think the Medical learning center was also a stroke of genius for the shelter, the animals, and the training of vet students.
Oregon Humane Society	60239		/users/profile/65410	cat-vol	Volunteer	5	01/17/2011	I have been a donor for several years and a volunteer since 2008.It is truly inspiring to see the dedication of the staff at the facility; their goal, and that of the volunteers, is to provide excellent care and findgood homes for all of the animals that come to OHS.  There is no time limit for an animal's stay at the shelter.  If it takes 6 months or more to find a home for a special needs pet, that animal will receive the best medical care and socialization until he finds his perfect person.Some animals come to the shelter with serious medical conditions, both injuries and illnesses; the medical staff treats the animals, who  then spend recovery time in foster care.  It is gratifying to see injured or neglected animals blossom into healthy, happy pets
Oregon Humane Society	60203		/users/profile/65374	Lou Chapman	Volunteer	5	01/16/2011	I am a 10-year volunteer and donor and can attest to OHS' focus on animal safety and care.   Volunteers are supported by training programs as well as hands-on mentoring.  Working with animals is rewarding in itself, and the staff at OHS is appreciative of volunteer efforts.   OHS has a good reputation with Portland and Metro population.  Many animals have been given second chances because of OHS' commitment.
Oregon Humane Society	60077		/users/profile/65213	jmhonse	Volunteer	5	01/14/2011	I've been with OHS as a volunteer and a donor since 1998.  My long-term committment is primarily due to the way this organization is run and operated.  It's efficient, runs with a lean staff in comparison to the number of animals they are able to care for and place (with a strong volunteer base) and makes financial decisions that hit home and sit well with me.  They are always the animal welfare organization that other shelters/rescues and law enforcement turns to for help with taking an overflow of animals and helping with large scale rescues, which wouldn't be possible if not managed soundly.
Oregon Humane Society	60044		/users/profile/65172	LoveOHS	Donor	5	01/13/2011	I am a donor as well as a volunteer. From the start, OHS has been the best investment that I've ever made with my charity contributions.  OHS is a visionary facility always looking forward to implementing concrete, realistic goals. It has extremely talented leaders who have assembled an equally gifted staff. In 2010 alone, OHS adopted out over 11,000 animals.  Donor dollars are allotted carefully.  Emphasis on animal care is always the top priority.  I've never encountered a more deserving nonprofit and plan to continue to support them to the best of my abilities.
Klamath Bird Oservatory	36908	7	/users/profile/37670	darkmirage	Volunteer	5	04/25/2010	I participated in local bird walks led by KBO volunteers shortly after moving to the sw Oregon area in mid 2009.  I have since volunteered to be a leader on some of these walks and have continued to participate in walks led by other volunteers.  The KBO staff are well organized and a pleasure to work with.  I have also recently volunteered to edit their newsletter.
Klamath Bird Oservatory	36879	9	/users/profile/37647	lisa17	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/25/2010	I worked with the Klamath Bird Observatory (John Alexander) prior to the official development of KBO. I have donated money at the fundraisers and am always so pleased with the people behind KBO and their efforts. As a Wildlife Biologist for the BLM I have used their publications in analyzing for certain activities and what the implications on birds may be (the science that supports it). John Alexander and his superb staff are always a pleasure to work with, open to partnerships, protect birds and their habitats through monitoring, research, and education/outreach. and
Klamath Bird Oservatory	36744	9	/users/profile/37533	goose	Board Member	5	04/23/2010	Provided guidance in organization, management development, strategic planning, product development and fund raising from inception until January 2010.Saw the organization develop scientific prowess, develop tools to help manage bird habitat resources, become a local and national community leader and contributor, build a strong management team and achieve close to $1million in grants.
Klamath Bird Oservatory	36741	8	/users/profile/37531	bil	Donor	5	04/23/2010	The Klamath Basin is a fabulous arena for the observation and scientific study of many, many migratory birds. This often includes endangered species and endangered habitat.Klamath Bird Observatory is the premier organization in southern Oregon and northern California for avian ecology.The organization is very community friendly and socially responsible with strict adherence to the principles of good science.Personally, even though I have BS and MS degrees in Biology, I have learned much and developed a stronger appreciation of the modern dinosaurs, birds.
Klamath Bird Oservatory	36697	7	/users/profile/37484	Anna	Former staff	5	04/23/2010	I was trained to band birds by KBO in the fall of 2005. I learned to take data, camp in cold beautiful settings, wake up at ridiculous times, organize equipment and generally work as an effective field biologist. KBO provided a small stipend and a gorgeous little field cabin as well as access to their head office in Ashland, OR. I worked hard and I learned a lot. After KBO, I was able to translate my skills into other bird jobs.I am graduating with a M.S. in biology this May and I would not have been accepted for this program without my years of field experience. I am grateful to KBO for helping me get started!
Klamath Bird Oservatory	36423	6	/users/profile/37213	suzanne5	Volunteer	5	04/22/2010	Klamath Bird Observatory runs a wonderful program for grade school children.  They have a classroom presentation to prepare the kids for the outdoor activies--teaching them about birds and bird scientists (ornithologists).  The next day, the kids are in the field where they observe mist netting; are taught to use binoculars; and go on a bird walk where they identify species (if older than 3rd grade) or identify birds by type of beak (if in 3rd grade).  We count the numbers of birds and after the walk, the leader has the students calculate simple statistics.  I'm impressed that they use real words like ornithologist, statistics, and species and don't

Klamath Bird Oservatory	36387	6	/users/profile/37175	Joey	Donor	5	04/21/2010	Have had and continue to have great educational outings dealing with migratory bird conservation.  I receive their newletter and am completely impressed by the quality and level of expertise this group consistantly shows in their research and conservation ethics regarding migratory birds and environmental conservation as a whole.  They are energetic, creative, inclusive, humble, hard working individuals who believe in their cause.
Klamath Bird Oservatory	36374	6	/users/profile/37164	Melissa	Former staff	5	04/21/2010	I loved working for this organization. The staff is dedicated to the mission of conservation and education.  Everyone I worked with put in volumes of time and concern into their work.  The organization has received a lot of recognition in the bird science and education realm with few staff members.  They continue to be very successful in spreading their mission!

Friends of the Children-Portland	153596	2	/users/profile/98417	AnitaC	Donor	5	04/08/2013	My husband and I are very impressed by the successes of Friends of the Children. Upon coming into the program in kindergarten or first grade, each child is guaranteed a mentor for the next twelve years. At the Friendraiser each May, we hear about the accomplishments of children in the program. FOC has a high percentage of children who stay in school, avoid teen parenthood and stay out of the criminal justice system. Last summer I volunteered for the summer reading program and was very pleased to observe and be a small part of a well organized program that helps at-risk children.
Friends of the Children-Portland	87678	2	/users/profile/98417	AnitaC	Donor	5	04/27/2011	I'm a supporter of Friends of the Children. As a parent and former teacher I appreciate the stability and support a group can add to a child's life. Having a long term "friend" who can help both academically and emotionally makes a huge difference for children who do not have a strong support system.
Friends of the Children-Portland	88178	2	/users/profile/99067	Carolyn L.	Donor	5	04/30/2011	My husband and I have been amazed to hear about the impact Friends of Children has had on the children in the program.  We attend the annual fundraiser for FOC and listen quietly to the stories of each child.  They have been the given the chance they never had...the chance to learn and grow into people who will go on to not only succeed but to contribute their vast array of skills to the betterment of our communities.  Friends of Children knows that we can't afford to lose these kids-the leaders and dreamers of our future. 
Friends of the Children-Portland	88100	2	/users/profile/98945	John	Volunteer	5	04/29/2011	Friends of the Children works.  It has demonstrated results which clearly show the program keeps kids out of jail, avoiding pregnancy and finishing high school to become productive and self sufficient members of our community.  I have yet to see any other program targeting "at-risk" youth with such results.  
Friends of the Children-Portland	88086		/users/profile/98930	Lori	Volunteer	5	04/29/2011	I have been a volunteer and board member for Friends of the Children Portland for 8 years.  This organizations delivers in a very real fashion.  Kids in the program avoid the justice system, avoid teen parenting and graduate from high school ready to become productive members of our society.  A Harvard lead study indicates a 7X return on every dollar invested in Friends.  There is no better investment than our youth.  Friends WORKS!
Friends of the Children-Portland	87999	1	/users/profile/98829	Patrick Scott	Donor	5	04/29/2011	I attend several charity events.  This event is the one I most look forward to attending.  Over the years, I have met the most wonderful people with the best interest of the children at heart.

Friends of the Children-Portland	87682		/users/profile/98416	Tim Cannell	General Member of the Public	5	04/27/2011	A good friend and strong supporter of Friends of the Children introduced me to this program five years ago.  Since then I have been able to make small contributions to this program and am always absolutely amazed at how many children are helped  and steered into being productive contributing members of society.  Most if not all  of the children in this program have come from backgrounds that predict failure for them. Those children are able to succeed because of the mentoring they receive. I feel it is one of the best if not the best program to help children out of a dead end area of society into achieving a useful and full filling life. 
Friends of the Children-Portland	87545	3	/users/profile/98253	DonC	Donor	5	04/27/2011	It is easy for me to see why Friends of the Children has been recognized as a model organization in the field of childhood development. My own background helps me recognize the challenges that result from a childhood with an unhealthy or unwholesome family environment.  My observations have shown to me the importance of positive intervention and continuous support for such a child, starting at an early age. The success of the Friends of the Children approach is readily seen in the children presently in the program as well as graduates who are grown and are achieving success as adults. The keys appear to be these:1st -  A comprehensive method of operation, evolving over time,   resulting in an outstanding record.2nd -  A staff and mentors (Friends) with a single-minded obsession to make it work.3rd -  The support of the community.  Educators, schools and colleges, committee members, donors, volunteers and the business community have all joined in to assist FOTC in the effort.4th -  The love for all children as exemplified by the efforts of the entire organization. My choice has been to make Friends of the Children the very core of my giving.  It makes me proud to do so. Donald W. Carlson - (retired from business)
Friends of the Children-Portland	86398	1	/users/profile/96714	Mark Chussil	Advisor	5	04/19/2011	(I'm writing as an Advisor to Friends of the Children - Portland. I'm also a Donor, an incoming Board Member, and I'm a professional with expertise in a related field.) I have watched Friends of the Children through several lenses. FOTC looks great through all of them. 1) I was on a volunteer team from the Community Partners program of the Harvard Business School Association of Oregon. We quantified the "social ROI" [return on investment] that FOTC generates, for society as a whole and for the individuals who go through the program. We estimated that FOTC creates a benefit for society and individuals of seven times its cost. That is awesome. 2) I have gotten to know key executives at FOTC. I've seen first-hand their dedication to the children and to operational excellence and integrity. 3) And I've seen many of the children currently in the program. You would never know they come from such at-risk backgrounds. FOTC's care and guidance has given these kids an awesome opportunity to become happy, prosperous, well-adjusted members of society, and has given our community citizens who will play a positive role in our future.
Fences For Fido	152304		/users/profile/203346	cjax00	Volunteer	5	04/05/2013	What if you had to spend all day tied to a tree by a chain?  In the sun, in the rain.  Fences for Fido builds fences and takes dogs off thier chains.  They build fences so dogs can run free and provide dog houses so the pups are out of the elements and have a safe place to sleep.
Fences For Fido	136030	1	/users/profile/181925	Concerned Community Member	Volunteer	4	11/08/2012	This is a nonprofit that really makes a difference and uses volunteer time to directly impact the lives of others. The fence builds are touching and may leave you with tears of joy. We just got new neighbors and it turns out that they also volunteer with Fences For Fido and have a super sweet dog that they adopted from them! If you are looking to do some hands on life changing  work for some deserving pups (and sometimes other animals) then this is the place for you. If you don't have the time to get hands on and build a fence that's okay, I am sure they will gladly accept whatever donation you are able to give, they are absolutely worth it and are doing life changing work that you can see and be a part of. This group is accountable and you can be sure every ounce you donate is going  directly to changing lives. Fences For Fido is pure love and compassion in action!
Fences For Fido	127596	2	/users/profile/172666	Lovey Love G.	General Member of the Public	5	10/21/2012	Fences For Fido are miracle workers in my opinion. As a dog lover, I had watched several dogs changed for several years, to guard a business near me. Neighbors including myself tried with no avail to get rescue organizations to help in this dire  situation.When I heard of this group, they were called. They came immediately and began their work to unchain what turned out to be 5 dogs scattered around the property. Some were hidden in dark, muddy areas surrounded by bushes and work trucks. Most were isolated from each other. Puppies and two of the chained dogs were relinquished and adopted out. Dogs remaining received their own fenced yard with dog house, bedding, straw over muddy areas, toys, treats and several return visits by the volunteers who had fallen in love with these dogs. All were spayed and neutered. Some had extra vet visits for their health. It has been a year since FFF began helping the "Railroad 5" and their tireless efforts still continue to this day for these 5 dogs. Fences For Fido and their members exemplify to me, that helping dogs doesnt stop at food, water and shelter. They are raising the standard for truly helping dogs. This is the way it should be and I am glad to see this first hand. They have changed the lives of Gordo, Nike, Dodger, Tryke and Shanaenae, and hundreds of others and changed my life too.

Fences For Fido	127428	2	/users/profile/172485	Meredith O.	Volunteer	5	10/20/2012	FFF makes a difference in the lives of dogs and their families in a matter of hours - you can see it happen before your eyes and it's so rewarding to be a part of.  I have been on fence builds and I also adopted a wonderful dog whose family was a FFF recipient, but ultimately chose to surrender their dog.  We love our silly, wonderful boy - even after years of being tied up outside and uncared for, he's adapted amazingly to being an indoor dog who comes to work with me, goes to daycare, and interacts daily with other dogs and people.  Without FFF we never would have found this wonderful boy, and he would still be tied up outside on a short chain with poor shelter.  The organization is all volunteer and the passion the volunteers have is contagious.  It's fun to volunteer and again, it's an incredibly rewarding experience.
Fences For Fido	127418	2	/users/profile/172474	Pam_22	Volunteer	5	10/20/2012	I have been building fences with Fences for Fidos for almost a year now. I do one build a month, and I look forward to those Saturdays so much! The work is rewarding, and all the great people I have worked with are so kind and friendly. This is an amazing charity with real, caring dog people. I am so proud to be associated with Fences for Fidos that I became a monthly donor, too.
Fences For Fido	127401	1	/users/profile/172452	Cindy45	Volunteer	5	10/20/2012	I wanted to volunteer for Fences For Fido but I work on the weekend. Then about 15 months ago, I responded to their plea on Facebook for someone to foster a Mama Cat and her 7 kittens. I contacted them and became a foster parent for Fences For Fido.  I am AMAZED every time I foster a dog or cats (usually kittens) for Fences For Fido because usually the animal is in need a more than the usual medical care.  They never bat an eye at the cost; they just want any surrendered dog to heal physically and heal mentally.  If ever I have a need for a particular foster, such as special food, or a dog coat etc, all I have to do is let that need be known and usually within hours someone steps up and fills that need.  I found my niche in the volunteer world at Fences for Fido as a foster parent and they are supportive and loving to me and anything I think my foster needs.  This charity started from the hearts of a few and has blossomed into the hearts of the community. 
Fences For Fido	127400	1	/users/profile/103597	SueH	Volunteer	5	10/20/2012	It is incredibly rewarding to volunteer with Fences For Fido.  FFF makes a huge difference in the life of a chained dog in just a few hours time.  A fence goes up, thanks to generous donors and eager volunteers, and the chains come off.  Hearing family children squeal with glee at being able to play with their dog is incredible.  Seeing the gratitude on the faces of the families is heartwarming.  Watching the dogs become re-energized with life is amazing!  Please keep donating to this powerful organization.  One dog at a time, FFF makes a difference for dogs, children, families, neighborhoods, and entire communities!
Fences For Fido	90735	1	/users/profile/103597	SueH	Volunteer	5	06/14/2011	The more volunteers I work with at Fences for Fido the more I truly admire and respect the work of this group.  All volunteers, with 100% of donated funds going to make life so much better for dogs.  I've seen sad, dirty, bored, hurting, dejected dogs literally transform into happy, active, playful beings once the heavy chains are unclipped from their necks.  Many times the love exists between owners and dogs, but money, skill, know-how, or something equally straightforward to resolve is all that stands in the way of setting dogs free from a chained and miserable existence.  Check the FFF website to learn more.  www.fencesforfido.org  
Fences For Fido	112525	1	/users/profile/153159	Community is everything	Volunteer	5	05/21/2012	I LOVE what this group does. I have only been on a few fence builds and helped with some events but they will forever hold a huge special place in my heart for the kindness and compassion they show  the Dogs they free!
Fences For Fido	90878	2	/users/profile/103800	murfalan	Volunteer	5	06/15/2011	Fences for Fido is an amazing organization. I drive 300 miles to help build fences for dogs that need to be released from the chains that bind them. I do it because it is something I can do that will really make a difference in a dogs life. The people who volunteer are wonderful, they love dogs and truly appreciate and nurture the human canine bond. Check out their website at www.fencesforfido.orgThey are really a great non-profit and all donations go directly to the dogs!
Friends of Outdoor School	169248		/users/profile/224304	Loam	Client Served	5	09/12/2013	I wrote this to the school district at the end of a week at Outdoor School in an attempt to explain why they should save the program.  It's a bit long, but the more people can learn about the program, the better. It is 11:00pm on Thursday night, and here I sit at Outdoor School.  The 6th graders are long in bed and the high school students are foregoing sleep yet again to make tomorrow extra special.  Im a 6th grade teacher, a former ODS student leader, and a former ODS 6th grader.  I fight for this program for my students because I believe in it.  I get to watch my students who struggle in the classroom become successful here.  I get to watch my students learn to open up to new experiences and new friendships.  I believe in the difference it makes for my students and for these high school students.  All week these sophomores, juniors and seniors have given all their energy to make sure my 6th graders have an unforgettable, educational experience.  Outdoor School is truly unforgettable - more than 20 years ago a couple high schoolers known as Squirrel and Etiole made my week amazing.  Ask around at a gathering and anyone who grew up in Portland will immediately tell you their memories - what camp they went to, who the student leaders and staff were, and what they remember.  Yes, we remember how cool it was to hang out with high school students when we were so young, and we remember singing songs and putting mud on our faces, but the learning goes much beyond that.  I still remember that it was 6th grade and Outdoor School behind my understanding of vertebrates and invertebrates, exoskeletons, oxbows and pH.  I still remember that the girls in my cabin taught me to dance and befriended the insecure, shy me.  I have as many memories of that week as of the rest of my grade school years combined.  I fight for this program because of the memories it makes and the relationships it builds. Beyond the 6th grade, the change it makes in these high school students is amazing.  I know that being a student leader helped me grow in my confidence and strengthened my belief that I should be a teacher.  I know that these high school students I see before me are students I want to see leading my community in the years to come.  This week they have left behind the comforts of home; their friends, their families, their cell phones, their computers, their iPods and they have come to share their energy and enthusiasm with these 6th graders to make sure that a group of 12 years olds they have never met have the week of their lives.  They are thoughtful, compassionate, selfless, open, creative, enthusiastic, ambitious young men and women.  They will spend the next weeks catching up on their schoolwork and their sleep.  They will try to explain to their peers why they are different; they will try to explain to their families how they have grown up this week, and the words will never be enough.  They are inspired to become teachers and scientists, actors and nurses, but confident that they can be successful in whatever they choose.  I fight for this program for my 6th graders, but I fight for this program for these students as well. The staff here will continue to work after the high school students head back to bed.  In addition to teaching a full curriculum in a day on their various field studies, they mentor the high school students and evaluate each of them.  They build their confidence and help them grow into the best leaders they can be.  The staff live on site for about 6 months a year, and sacrifice many of the comforts of home as well as sleep, privacy and quiet time.  They are enthusiastic and easy to work with; adapting to different high school student leaders, different 6th graders, and different teachers each week.  They do dishes, they comfort homesick kids, they make up songs, and they constantly strive to make Outdoor School better.  They are knowledgeable and creative and always full of energy.  Many of them will move on from this program to become teachers, some will continue school in the sciences, some will move in a completely different direction, but all will contribute to making our world a better place.  I fight for this program to support their sacrifices. My week at Outdoor School will reinvigorate me as a teacher, as it always does.  I will have a better relationship with my students.  I will refer back to this week on a regular basis, discussing adaptations and habitats, and reminding them to learn with the enthusiasm and curiosity they showed in the forest.  Together we will build on the community we developed this week, looking beyond ourselves and our lives to improve the world for everyone.  It is so hard to put into words the difference it makes for all of us.  My students will get off that bus in a few hours exhausted, dirty, and grinning from ear to ear, ready to share this unforgettable experience with anyone who will listen.  Not enough of my tax dollars go to education, and Id like the ones that do to go into this program. Every 6th grader should get to experience this program, not just those whose parents can afford to pay. 
Friends of Outdoor School	169000		/users/profile/223998	Dzankwa	Volunteer	5	09/11/2013	I saw children's lives changed  time after time both high school students and the grade school students they were teaching and mentoring. Connections were made between students who weren't even talking when they arrived, and studies they thought they had no interest in came alive and learning became an exciting adventure. I saw high school students arrive afraid to talk leave full of self confidence and a belief that they really could do things well. For some students it was their first experience at being successful at anything, 
Friends of Outdoor School	168986		/users/profile/223959	AlexHorsey	Board Member	5	09/10/2013	I've had the honor of experiencing this program through several different lenses. As a sixth grade student, I jumped into Outdoor School knowing close to nothing about it. All I knew to expect was a week in the woods with some kids I had been going to school with for just over a month.  The experience I had that week is one I will never forget.. I had never gone to summer camp, and this was my first time sleeping in a cabin, smelling kinda funny, and getting dirty on purpose. It was liberating, in a way. Four years later, I packed up my bags and fulfilled a promise I made to myself back in sixth grade..to return as a Student Leader. The second I stepped off that bus, I knew I was home.  I spent five weeks (I intended six, but unfortunately a conflict with my grades and schedule during my senior year did not allow for my final week.) over three years  out at Camp Namanu, the same site I explored back when I was a newcomer.   While I do still remember plenty of environmental facts (mostly about soil, which is what I taught during my time there.) and beautiful, meaningful songs, what I will remember the most about Outdoor School is the culture of radical inclusion.  No matter who you are, Outdoor School is a place for you to be exactly who that is.  Or, if you're not who you want to be, Outdoor School can be a safe place to be that person you're striving towards.  That's what appealed to me in sixth grade, and what kept me sane in high school.  I always knew that no matter what I was going through, that week of Outdoor School was waiting for me. Now, a 2013 graduate, I'm no longer eligible to serve as a Student Leader.  However, I've moved on to serve as Friends of Outdoor School's first youth representative board member.  I'm excited to shape this role into what it may look like, and even more excited to see what other people will do with it.  
Friends of Outdoor School	168976		/users/profile/223947	mordecai	Volunteer	5	09/10/2013	Everything I know about community, leadership, and civic duty can be traced back to this program. As a sixth grade student, Outdoor School was a place that made me feel like I could be an example for my peers. It provided a safe environment for me to learn and grow, free from all of the distractions that modern life has to offer. As a high school volunteer, I realized the positive impact I could make on the community. 
Friends of Outdoor School	168974		/users/profile/223944	s.rice.wohelo	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/10/2013	Outdoor school is an interactive and rewarding way for children to experience the outdoors. They not only learn facts about the environment, but they also build an appreciation for nature. Outdoor school should be a part of every child's experience growing up.
Friends of Outdoor School	89920		/users/profile/102447	theamazingseal	Volunteer	5	06/08/2011	As a continual volunteer, I saw the good this program does. Children learn not only environmental skills, but are exposed to a different way of life. I am certain that this program is one of the reasons Portland itself is an exceptional place to live. 
Friends of Outdoor School	89870		/users/profile/102373	EleZou	Board Member	5	06/08/2011	Friends of Outdoor School works to create a lasting future for a program essential to the education of our students.  Lives are changed, skills are learned, and people are inspired. I have worked with the staff who are savvy about fundraising as well as passionate about the cause.  Resources are used wisely, and much of the work is done by volunteers. I am honored to be a part of this wonderful organization.
Friends of Outdoor School	23139	7	/users/profile/24199	Kristin	Volunteer	5	11/30/2009	As a student leader for Outdoor School, I got the chance to experience the positive changes a week of outdoor school can make not only in the lives of the sixth graders, but in the lives of the other student leaders as well. I grew up in a school district that did not offer outdoor school to its sixth grade students and therefore didn't have any idea about the program at all. Not until my junior year of high school did I really get involved with the program. I was a four time student leader and every week I went out changed me and made me into a better person. I was able to mature and learn how to become a better leader and role model. I learned how to push myself outside of my comfort zone and really find who I am as a person. The sixth grade students I had the pleasure of working with made me realize how much my volunteering made an impact in their lives. My most memorable experience will always be when my first week one of the girls in my cabin told me that after coming to this week of outdoor school that she learned it is ok to be yourself and that your true friends will like you for who you are. Sometimes I feel like I learned more from those kids then they could ever learn from me. Outdoor school made such a positive impact in my life and really helped me to become the person that I am today.
Friends of Outdoor School	10465	14	/users/profile/12341	jake2goat	Volunteer	5	09/17/2009	I was a student leader (volunteer) at outdoor school 6 times during my high-school tenure. I had always known I was going to come back as a student leader as I was practically raised at summer camps but nothing I ever experienced was comparable to being a volunteer at outdoor school. I cannot put into words how important outdoor school was for my maturity and I cannot possibly explain how much I miss it. After every week I would have at least four kids talk to me about how much outdoor school had changed their lives, saying things like "I never knew that science could be so much fun" or "I never knew that I could be such a leader" or "I will never forget this place". Outdoor school is an incredible education program, not only in academics, but beyond anything else, outdoor school is an education program about community. Everyone who I have ever worked with/taught to at outdoor school left that week feeling more able to handle the responsibility of being a global citizen, and that is something that I personally will never, ever forget.
Friends of Outdoor School	10238	16	/users/profile/12106	Blossom	Volunteer	5	09/11/2009	Friends of Outdoor school provided the opportunity for me to be a student leader for outdoor school with sixth graders, which was such a great gift to me. As a student leader I gained lots of confidence that I didn't have and came to believe that I am capable of doing great things. Learning to lead, teach, and speak in front of other was something I believed I couldn't do, but outdoor school pushed me out of my comfort zone and taught me that I am capable of overcoming these fears.I love the family-like environment of outdoor school, I love the new things I get to learn there every time, I love the friends I make, and I love the accomplishments I come home with which help give me confidence for the years to come. Outdoor school gave me challenges, than helped me step by step accomplish these challenges so that I learn and gain confidence in myself. I have also been very inspired at outdoor school. I am excited to try new volunteer opportunities and have a learning attitude towards the things I do. I continue to volunteer at camps where while I teach and lead other I myself learns many good life lessons. As an art lover I have made a maple leaf out of metal in my jewelry class as a special memory of a time when we were walking back with the sixth graders and staff from field study and the maple leafs were flowing down all around like snow flakes. Than in calligraphy I made a magical art piece containing the words from the Magic Penny song which is the special song we sing at outdoor school, that piece won the first place award for the student calligraphy in the Oregon State Fair. In my case, as a shy Ukrainian girl, my outdoor school experiences made such a positive difference in my life. I carry so many special memories that I have gained there. Everyday I give to others because outdoor school has given me the opportunity to see the reward of living unselfishly. It has also taught me better child management tools which I get to use with my younger siblings. Outdoor school has truly planted a handful of positive seeds in me which are growing day by day benefiting myself as well as others.
International School	187816	1	/users/profile/244909	spanishparent	Volunteer	5	11/04/2013	The International School is wonderful place for children to learn another language. More importantly, to me, is that they learn another culture as well. The students interact between language tracks so they learn about Spanish, Chinese and Japanese traditions throughout the year. Adding to the richness of this experience is supportive teachers, small classes, PE, Art and Music teachers and an involved parent community. When my child arrived in Kindergarten, he wasn't reading in English. He is now reading above grade level in both languages and can easily converse with native speakers in Spanish! 
International School	186845		/users/profile/243853	nicolelwood17	Client Served	5	10/31/2013	The International School has already exceeded our expectations and we have only been in school a few short months! Our daughter was not doing well in her neighborhood school and was asked to repeat Kindergarten. We took the opportunity to give her a completely different chance at feeling successful and it has paid off. She is interested in learning and enjoys going to school everyday. We cannot be more happy with TIS! 
International School	183059	1	/users/profile/239964	Anonymous13	Volunteer	5	10/28/2013	The International School in Portland, Oregon teaches students the love of learning.  When approaching a subject, the kids are encouraged to simultaneously think independently and gather input and ideas from others, voice their ideas and consider others' perspectives, give something a try and embrace constructive feedback.  By doing so, they become global citizens  proud of their own accomplishments as well as the successes of those around them. 
International School	89236		/users/profile/101165	Daniela Brod Cargill	Client Served	5	05/25/2011	My son is in Kindergarten and he has learned to speak and write sentences in Chinese as if it is the most natural thing! He is also learning to add and subtract double-digits.  His dad and I are English-only speaking Caucasians, so I think some of his success comes from the fact that he is aware he is learning something we don't know! I am thrilled with the skill and professionalism of his teachers....and the sincere love and care they show my son every day.Daniela - mom

International School	54806		/users/profile/56650	languagemom	Board Member	5	10/18/2010	This is now my older daughter's 6th year at TIS (she started when she was 3 years old).  I'm still astounded at her mastery of Spanish conversation and her total comfort reading complex material and doing math and social studies homework in Spanish.  My youngest daughter is in her 3rd year of Mandarin immersion and is now learning to write characters.  What an incredibly rewarding learning experience they each are having!As a parent, I am impressed with the skill and dedication of the administration and teaching staff.  As a Board member (my second year), I am impressed with the all-volunteer Board's dedication and willingness to set sights on the long-term interests of the school.
International School	52231		/users/profile/53102	chichioya	Client Served	5	09/12/2010	My daughter started in the Japanese track one year ago. With no previous exposure to the language and no native speaker at home, we were curious to see how she would do. Her experience at The International School has been phenomenal. She speaks Japanese fluidly, speaking to her teachers, her classmates and even their parents only in Japanese. She is excited to go to school each day and comes home excited to tell us about things she has made and the things she has learned. The spirit of inquiry and intellectual curiosity that is natural at her age is encouraged and nurtured by her teachers and the curriculum.
International School	52119		/users/profile/52951	tismom	Client Served	5	09/10/2010	My daughter just entered 1st Grade in the Spanish Track.  The school has a great atmosphere, and the implementation of an IB primary years program encourages a healthy learning style.  After only one year at the school our daughter is comfortable speaking Spanish, and has also been exposed to the Chinese and Japanese cultures in the other tracks at the school.The teachers are enthusiastic and motivated, leading to motivated children.  Involved music, art and PE programs.  Also found an involved group of parents who go above and beyond to support the school.

We've been at the school for 8 years so far, and expect to continue to be for another 8 years!The teachers have been wonderful - caring, supportive, pushing the kids to achieve far more than they would at most other schools.  The expectations are high with two languages!  Our experience is that some supplemental English reading and writing practice at home seems to be necessary to keep up with English skills especially in the upper grades.  However, the experience and growth of learning/experiencing other cultures and exiting 5th grade with a command of two languages is too great to pass up!
International School	52012	1	/users/profile/52819	mollycnm	Client Served	5	09/08/2010	My elder daughter started 3rd grade today and her sister 1st. This is the start of our family's 6th year at TIS. We have had the most amazing learning experience at TIS. My girls are fully immersed in Mandarin Chinese language and culture while at the same time being exposed to Spanish and Japanese languages and cultures. They are getting a true global education. The school recently implemented the International Baccalaureate Primary Years Program which is an inquiry based teaching method across all 3 langauge tracks. They learn the same topics in their target language as the other tracks and can then discuss them in their common language, English, outside of class. It has been phenomenal. It is very fun to go to places where mandarin is spoken and watch the amazment and dare i say disbleif that my daughters speak chinese so fluently and without accent.The dedication of the teachers and staff at TIS is heartwarming. They truly belive in the mission of the school and love teaching our children. The community of parents is strong and cohesive and we all work together to continue to better the learning environment and show the teachers how much we appreciate them.I highly recommend the school to other families!
Lost Valley Center Inc	37051	6	/users/profile/37813	cameron2	Volunteer	5	04/27/2010	Since getting to Lost Valley at the end of last year, i have been continuously astounded by the ingenuity, creativity, and passion of the folks here! So many come here to learn some about Permaculture, EcoVillage Design, and sustainability, but end up learning so much more. All too often folks that come here end up becoming teachers themselves, by coming as learners and doers, and realizing that they have so much to share and such an amazing place to do it. The land here is magical, the facilities are great and are constantly evolving towards more sustainable design and practice. I have been traveling around for a few years now studying and looking for places that i can do some of the things that lost valley offers, and they seem to have it all in one spot. Thank you LVEC for welcoming me into your community, and i hope that the readers of this get to experience the magic of this place as well!
Lost Valley Center Inc	37005	6	/users/profile/37773	botanista	Board Member	5	04/26/2010	I am proud to be a member of this community.  I came as an intern and have remained as a community member because I believe in the service that Lost Valley is providing to the world.  Here we have an opportunity to live and work within the context of an educational center focused on empowering individuals to experiment with new social and environmental paradigms.
Lost Valley Center Inc	36872	6	/users/profile/37640	omshantiom	General Member of the Public	5	04/24/2010	The Lost Valley Educational Center has a vastly knowledgeable staff and is the perfect setting for students to gain a very in-depth understanding of both permaculture techniques and a realistic, first-hand experience in the challenges of eco-village living. I would highly recommend the LVEC's Permaculture program to anyone searching for intense, hands-on education in the creation of sustainable agriculture and communities.
Lost Valley Center Inc	36866	6	/users/profile/37636	theone	Client Served	4	04/24/2010	It was a great experience! The people were very friendly and I learned a lot in the class. Thanks guys!
Lost Valley Center Inc	36865	6	/users/profile/37634	bec	Client Served	4	04/24/2010	My experience here at Lost Valley has been great! The variety of teachers and people at the community really help with learning potential. The teachers really know their stuff and have tons of experience in many different fields. If you want to learn about permaculture in a landscaping way, you've got it! What about properly managing forested land, that as well. Different types of gardening to experiment with. What about social permaculture, or how to apply different methods in dealing with yourself emotionally or pushing yourself into a healthier relationship with others. Would you like to build a community or ecovillage?? There are people here that have the knowledge and resources to give to your answer or direct you to a great source. Running a non-profit?? Same. The broad spectrum of information gathered here can serve you in any array you would like to focus your life.  However, because Lost Valley is a turn-key property the buildings need major help, especially to be more ecological and economical for the community and non-profit. THerefore, funding is needed. This organization has so much to offer and I feel like a good boost would create a whirlwind of movement in the right direction for this area and the world as a whole.  Good food, great people and an honest drive to move themselves and the planet forward in a positive, alternative fashion that our current structure does not offer. Check out Lost Valley, it's worth it. And help them out!!!! You won't regret the outcome your help would invigorate.....  Blessings. R.
Lost Valley Center Inc	36571	8	/users/profile/37363	bob92	Former staff	5	04/22/2010	I had a great experience as an intern. There were many exciting projects on the land. Other interns and myself had fun working with lots of different plants and a wide variety of useful tools. I continue to visit the land at this permaculture center and see the contributions that myself and many others have made over the years.
Lost Valley Center Inc	34520	6	/users/profile/35376	wes1	Volunteer	5	04/02/2010	As an intern at Lost Valley I have worked in several departments beginning in the Garden, kitchen, working with SASS and with the land crew and now with the Camassia Institute as the teaching assistant intern. I've really benefited from the opportunity to explore the different intern roles here to discover the one that most fit my interests. Working with the Camassia Crew has been amazing for me. I spend lots of time with the students and the instructors of our courses and I've really familiarized myself with the material. As I dive deeper into observing teaching styles, I've really begun to hone in on my own. I also work with the website, marketing and other office work making this internship very well rounded. Lost Valley has definitely provided me lots of chances to grow myself.
Lost Valley Center Inc	34469	7	/users/profile/35324	kari-j	Client Served	5	04/02/2010	I first came to Lost Valley in the fall of 2008 to teach at a movement retreat called "freEmotion." I'm a performer and writer by trade.  I hadn't been to LV before that event, but at the time, I was becoming more interested in permaculture and alternative modes of living.  I pretty much fell in love with the place.  In the fall of 2009 (a year later), I took the plunge and put all of my worldly belongings in storage in Portland to come intern at Lost Valley.  A few months later, I also took the winter PDC course.  Six months have gone by, and I'm still here, finishing up my internship and considering staying on as a resident.  It's a wonderful place to learn more about permaculture, sustainable living and ecobuilding. It also seems to be a crossing point for unique, intelligent, talented people.  Between the other interns, the residents and the students who are constantly coming and going, I've definitely made some connections that I feel blessed to be able to carry forward in life.  I guess I can speak to this place from the multiple perspectives of an event teacher, an intern, and a student.  In all of those regards, it has the capacity to be a life-changing place. I'd definitely recommend spending some time at Lost Valley Educational Center.
Lost Valley Center Inc	26829	9	/users/profile/27850	Christina	Board Member	5	02/01/2010	Lost Valley has made a huge impact on my life.  I have known about Lost Valley for a long time through my interest in Permaculture.  I decided to move there in 2008 after returning to Oregon after months of traveling after graduating college.  I became the Kitchen Manager and resident of the community in March 2008.  During my time there I was able to help start a co-op and create stronger alliances with local farmers and producers.  We already produce much of our fresh eggs and produce on site.  We are now over 80% local, with most fresh foods coming from within 10 miles.  We were also able to glean and preserve thousands of pounds of local fruits and vegetables, and used various methods of preservation to hold onto this bounty throughout the lean winter months.  In 2009, another local group started the Dexter Lake Farmer's Market, and the Lost Valley Kitchens were a big part of the market.  Every weekend we brought loaves of freshly baked breads, jams, cinnamon rolls, teas, coffees, and other artisan goodies and value added products which created more interest in the Co-op and more local connections with our community and the local community of Dexter.  To cap off the season in 2009, the kitchen hosted a four day Permaculture and Food Skills Intensive.  During this course we taught beekeeping,  cheesemaking, beer brewing, wine making, artisan cob oven baking, cultured foods, and food preservation (drying, canning, smoking, curing, brining, fermenting, and more).  It was a very popular course, and we'll be happy to add it to the regular course offerings through the Camassia Institute (the official Permaculture Educational institute on our 87 acre living/residential "campus").  Besides being able to delve deeper into permaculture and how it relates to food, Lost Valley has been a blessing in so many ways.  I've met so many amazing people from all over the world who want to learn about creating a more sustainable new culture and planet, and here we come together as a community to make this reality.  It is a very special place and I am proud to serve as a board member to help Lost Valley continue to serve it's mission for another 20 years or more to come.
Lost Valley Center Inc	26632	4	/users/profile/27639	communitarian1	Former Volunteer	5	01/30/2010	I completed a year long internship learning about Permaculture and Land management.  The experience was highly enlightening and completely hands-on.  The teaching was extremely quality and I consider it an invaluable learning experience.  Anyone with interest/experience in Permaculture would benefit from studying under one of the NorthWest's elder Permaculturists, Rick Valley.  I loved the entire culture at Lost Valley, from the daily work to the community gatherings and intern meetings.  Along with the other interns, staff, and LV residents, there were daily meals with vegan options, which was great.  The land upon which the Education Center lies is absolutely beautiful in a setting of old doug fir and Oregon White Oak.  There is a large Camas meadow around which people taking classes camp.  There are several gardens and a creek that runs through the property.  It is a great place with amazing people who have so much love and positive vibration to offer the world.  I recommend visiting or taking a class if possible...or if you have the freedom and time--do an internship--you won't be disappaointed.

I became familiar with the organization when they saved a baby calf not even a DAY old. The poor baby had never been loved, and had already been pierced and set up for auction as veal... This organization came to the rescue and saved the precious calf. I followed his status hourly! Sadly the calf didn't make it but he was at least able to feel love even for a short while. I see how happy these animals are in their updates and videos. The people here truly love the animals. No part of the animal (fur, feathers, eggs) are used for profit. they just let the animals be loved and FREE!  I hope to one day visit and be able to show the love to the animals as well!

I enjoy their newsletters and updates and especially appreciate their community events. Thank you NCAP for all you do to make our world safer for our children. 
Northwest Center For Alternatives To Pesticides	73598		/users/profile/80429	Thomassonc	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/23/2011	As a physician, I am very concerned about the impact of pesticides on our health.  From Parkinson's disease to learning disabilities in children, pesticides have grave impact.  Some like DDT banned for over 40 years are still detected in the breast milk of 93% of American women .  I've come to rely on and refer to NCAP's excellent resources and advocacy to make our world a healthier place!
Northwest Center For Alternatives To Pesticides	72434		/users/profile/79193	Suzinn	Donor	5	02/21/2011	I have been a donor to NCAP for many years and trust them to look out for our interests and to inform communties how to best provide healthy altrenatives to the rampant use pesticides.  I've changed my own habits after reading articles in their newsletter and website.  I've been impressed with their dedication to bringing real facts about the dangerous use of pesticides all over the Northwest and believe that every region of the country needs to have the same level of awareness.  I proudly post a NACP "Pesticide Free Zone" sign in my front garden for all to see!
Northwest Center For Alternatives To Pesticides	72417		/users/profile/79174	Anna Kilker	General Member of the Public	5	02/21/2011	I live in Central Texas and live a hectic life just like everybody else.  I make the best effort I can to stay informed about what is affecting our environment and I find ways I can change my life style or influence others.  NCAP is incredibly informative and keeps me informed.  I am certainly not going to learn from the usual media available, the usual TV and radio stations don't even try to help people learn what is harmful and in their own homes.  I hope that some day I won't walk in to places that sell me my groceries and plants, selling aisles full of poison.  I was in a big store yesterday to buy bird seed.  I felt so helpless seeing people trying to decide what poison they would buy to use on their lawns and in their homes.  Most people are not informed of the dangers they expose themselves and loved ones when they use these poisonous products.  And not to mention the environmental damage these products unleash on the environment.  The NCAP needs all they help they can get to educate Americans.  If only it was affordable to make a public announcement daily that all people could hear; it would help them make better choices.  I was just saying to my husband how incredibly insane it is that people have access to so much poison.  And I hate to say it but most people don't read or follow instructions, and it makes these easily available poisons much more dangerous.  
Northwest Center For Alternatives To Pesticides	72412		/users/profile/79170	Candye	Volunteer	5	02/21/2011	NCAP is a great organization trying to improve our environment and the health of our nation.   Their goals can help protect so many aspects of our environment and food chain.  Thank you NCAP!
Northwest Center For Alternatives To Pesticides	68702		/users/profile/75067	Carrie	Volunteer	5	02/15/2011	I first learned of NCAP while working for Pesticide Action Network in San Francisco in the 90s. NCAP was a member of our steering committee. When I moved to Eugene OR, I immediately called the organization to offer my volunteer services. I have always been amazed by what this organization accomplishes with such a small staff. NCAP is even more relevant to my life now that I'm raising a family in Eugene. I am especially appreciative of their work related to pesticide-free parks and their Healthy Kids, Healthy Schools program. I'm grateful for NCAP's efforts to reduce the pesticides that are used where my children play and go to school.  I have referred many people to NCAP as they provide the public with valuable information on alternatives to pesticides in the home and yard.
Northwest Center For Alternatives To Pesticides	63036		/users/profile/68920	John M	General Member of the Public	5	02/03/2011	I first came across Northwest Coalition for Alternatives to Pesticides a number of years ago.  As a Landscape Professional I was looking for accurate information on the products I was considering applying.  I have been informed and am able to reply with confidence and factual data to those who question the safety of these products.  It is also wonderful to hear about and be a part of a movement that is involved in changing our world!  I am a proud supporter of this organization, despite the fact that I live on the other side of the country.  I wish I could find an organization such as this here.
Northwest Center For Alternatives To Pesticides	62198		/users/profile/67986	Steve S.	Volunteer	4	02/01/2011	NCAP is a small organization with a big reach.  The Coalition (now Center) has been involved in many aspects of pesticide research, application of research to specific programs areas (such as pesticide-free public parks and schools), crop-specific work (especially with potatoes in Idaho), and legal action in conjunction with other organizations, especially focused on threats to endangered fish species in the Northwest. This organization accomplishes a lot of good things with a small staff, and has to scramble for funds (grants, memberships, donations) along with a myriad of other organizations. I am very grateful for the work that NCAP does to protect salmon and to assist growers in making the transition to organic or at least less-pesticide-intensive production.
Northwest Center For Alternatives To Pesticides	62109		/users/profile/67892	wderyckx	General Member of the Public	5	02/01/2011	I have admired the work of this wonderful team for  30 years.  NCAP has  consistently displayed an uncanny talent for identifying the biggest  threats to publilc health and environmental quality posed by pesticides and then  finding community based leverage points to effect possitive change (ie, reduced pesticide use).  NCAP has succeeded in applying it's guided grass roots approach to stopping agent orange spraying on  public and private forest lands in the Northwest,  getting dangerous pesticides out of schools,  achieving pesticide free public parks,  improving aquatic habitat by holding federal agencies to enforce the law, and many other situations.   I'm trying to think of my favorite accomplishment of this wonderful non-profit but have not exactly succeeded - I have two favorites.  Reducing pesticide use in potato production:    NCAP demonstrated to the world that an environmental organization can take a proactive approach to reducing pollution by working with potato farmers and agricultural science community that supports them to introduce biologically sound alternative cultural methods,  in this case growing green manure crops that improve soil health and reduce disease pressure.  NCAP devoted years of patient dedication building the key relationships,  securing funding for research and field trials,  organizing field days, educating farmers,  policy makers,   and the general public all of which eventually resulted in a huge reduction of pesticide use along with improvements in crop quality and farm profit.  This is good work and serves as an inspiring example of how to effect possitive change by working with the people who are actually involved in the situations that toxic pesticides are used.  My other favorite of NCAP's many laudible accomplishments is their long leadership in providing technical and legal information regarding pesticides to the public.  NCAP has always a huge and well organized library and has served as a wonderful resource for reliable information through its publications, it's website, and by responding to direct inquiries.  This is a team that does it's homework and empowers the public with good information and, when appropriate, with grass roots organizing and action.  Good people doing real good work in a vital area of concern - NCAP dearly deserves our support. 
ReFIT, Remodeling for Independence Together	208120		/users/profile/270800	huckleberry	Board Member	5	07/31/2014	Sometimes you have to be talked into things that are good for you and for me, it was a great growing experience from volunteer to committee chair to board member. I have no words for how important ReFIT has become in my life. It is my community service, it humbles me and touches my heart to see how not just the clients' families are changed, but extended families, neighbors and friends as well. For these individuals, their disability impacts their safety, connection to their community, self esteem, emotional well being, etc, etc. and ReFIT doesn't just install a ramp or grab bar for them, they give them access to all those things.
ReFIT, Remodeling for Independence Together	207497		/users/profile/270164	Pillus	Donor	5	07/28/2014	Refit is an amazing organization to be associated with and my company has donated many items to help people stay in their homes. I have the honor to know many of the volunteers on both a personal and professional basis and integrity abounds with these individuals.  I find it so amazing that so many different people within the building industry are able to come together with a single goal in mind and that is to make someone's life more comfortable. BRAVO to Refit!!

I commend them for the dedication of their board members, their volunteers and their donors.  ReFIT ROCKS! .... Candy 
ReFIT, Remodeling for Independence Together	206249	2	/users/profile/268637	Patte48	Client Served	5	07/16/2014	ReFit helps families with disabled family members to be able to stay in their homes.  My husband had a major stroke and I found out about this remarkable organization from a neighbor who's daughter volunteers there.  We live in a very old home that has one bathroom that is extremely small, with a very large bathtub.  We could not bathe him without alot of shuffling and trying to get his legs over the very tall side of the tub which took two people to do and extremly painful for him.   They came out with several contractors to figure out what could be done.  ReFit remodeled the bathroom and it is beautiful, with a completely tiled walk in shower and ADA toilet.  Everything now has grab bars and is designed for him to be able to bathe and take care of all his personal grooming. I can not say enough about this wonderful organization from the first phone call to them, to all the volunteers, contractors and all of the other people involved until the completion.  Everyone was so nice and caring, helpful with all our questions, and I can't thank them enough to allow us be be able to stay in our home.     
Indigo Rescue	193161		/users/profile/252306	fkawai	Volunteer	5	01/27/2014	I started fostering for Indigo Rescue from Jan 2012.  Their mission of saving/rescuing animals is very clear.  I find Heather Hines, founder and executive director to be very focused on the best care and goal oriented to each and every animal which is very refreshing.  Neither does Heather nor I believe in shortcuts for the care of animals. The veterninary care that the fosters receive is superb.  Feels wonderful to find a like minded organization.
Indigo Rescue	193003		/users/profile/252078	Kat_7	Volunteer	5	01/23/2014	I started volunteering with Indigo in January of 2011 during my Junior year of high school and started fostering for them in August of the same year. I cannot tell you how much working with these people and animals has impacted my life. Both the dogs I have fostered with Indigo are/were fearful dogs. Neither one gets aggressive when fearful - Indigo does have those too - but they could not be cared for in a shelter environment. That's how Indigo gets all their dogs, they could not be cared for in a shelter for whatever reason. All of these dogs live in foster homes, which means they have families, they interact with humans every day and they live like a dog should. The foster home isn't always the best place for them, but that isn't what the fostering is for. It's to give them as normal a life until we can find them a home that will last them forever. And there is nothing better than seeing these dogs grow, helping them and growing with them, and finding them a home. It isn't easy, but it is the most fulfilling thing I have ever done. The only thing I love better is seeing the community that this builds. We have volunteers and fosters still in middle/high school all the way up to retired and everywhere in between. And every single person is determined and devoted to find these dogs homes that will last forever, no matter how long it takes or what problems the dog may or may not have. And we will never, never give up.
Indigo Rescue	192987		/users/profile/252056	Lindagillen	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/23/2014	I moved from Alaska to Oregon in 2005. We wanted to make a difference. Help animals.  We came in contact with Indigo Rescue. We started fostering dogs. The relationship quickly grew to volunteering at Indigo Ranch. I also began training as a handler. In time, after much training and learning, I became a general supervisor for the ranch. Which I did, plus 90 to 100 hours volunteer on top of that. While I Returned to Alaska, I still remain active with indigo rescue. Heather Hines is at the helm of this organization. What I know to be a fact of everyday life for heather is that she NEVER EVER gives up. To her it is 24/7. All day and all night. Just her never stopping is an inspiration. I have respect for the drive she shows and gives every single day.  Her te at the ranch is strong, educated and devoted. Nothing that came easy.. It takes time and dedication to find that perfect balance. Take the time to see for yourself. My heart remains at the ranch, where I enjoyed some of the best days of my life.  Remember the dog boarding allows for more rescue work. 
Indigo Rescue	192985		/users/profile/252047	tubameister	General Member of the Public	5	01/23/2014	I'm a staunch advocate of adopting rescue dogs, and have done so all my adult life. When I encountered Indigo Rescue, I was impressed far beyond any I had encountered in the past. All the volunteers are crystal-clear about their mission, which is to ensure that the right pet is matched with the right family. In addition, as indicated by their name, they make sure that animals most in need of help are given what they require; in performing this part of their mission, their motto is "never, never, never give up." And they don't. In my opinion, Indigo Rescue stands head and shoulders above all the rest of the pet rescue organizations in the Portland, OR metro area.
Indigo Rescue	182645	1	/users/profile/239515	Carol Moore	Volunteer	5	10/26/2013	I have volunteered with this organization for a decade and am impressed with the whole-hearted dedication of its volunteer corps, director, and board. This effective rescue group has saved the lives of thousands of dogs and cats during the past ten years, and does it on a shoestring budget. Innovative and proactive, it's a great group.
Indigo Rescue	106349	1	/users/profile/143368	celticknot56	Client Served	5	02/13/2012	Indigo Rescue is one of the best pet rescue organizations I have ever had the pleasure of working with.  Not only do they rescue pets but they also have a "Cage Free" boarding facility as well as training classes.  The owner, Heather, takes great pride in what she does. We adopted a small dog from Indigo several years ago. We had to go through an interview, a dog meeting & a home inspection. We passed with flying colors & I could not have been more happy with the effort she put into making sure we were the right fit for the dog (NOT the other way around)  She has built her success from the ground up and will continue to go far beyond anyone's, even her own, expectations.
Indigo Rescue	103016	1	/users/profile/136534	Kristen7	Client Served	5	01/06/2012	I love Indigo Rescue! When I was looking for a dog they made sure that the one I ended up with was the right dog for my lifestyle. I have had him for 5 years and will look forward to adopting from them again when we are ready.  They are dedicated to their dogs and make sure that if you ever have questions or need help to give you advise.   If you are someone that is looking for a lifetime friend and want help making sure that you choose the right dog or cat then they are the best non-profit animal rescue group to go with. 
Indigo Rescue	102999	3	/users/profile/136487	MatchingPeopleand Pets	Volunteer	5	01/06/2012	In response to the prior review submitted by "David", this man told us he was going to drown his dog's deaf and blind Australian Shepherd puppies and we believed him because it wasn't the first time. His dog continues to have deaf and blind litters of puppies because it is a genetic mutation common in this breed. We offered to spay his dog and take the puppies and when he stopped returning our calls we feared he had already drowned the puppies so we reported him to the county. That REALLY made him mad! They ended up making him license his dogs. Too bad. Our job in this case, like every other case, is to do the right thing for the animals. If that isn't what David wanted, well, bummer for him. He needed (still needs) to do the right thing and spay his dog to prevent the birth of more deaf and blind puppies, but he was too greedy to do it.
Indigo Rescue	87782	1	/users/profile/98548	david	General Member of the Public	1	04/28/2011	i had an awful experience with this organization.the rescue followed through on not one single committment it made to me and the pups, then had the cheek to report me to animal control on false pretext .consuming most of one saturday for the officer and most of the morning for me verifying the truth of my claims.My story checked out and i was thoroughly cleared of any of the false charges and rumors laid by this organization in their complaint. The leader of this outfit is Heather Hines ; a very pushy and indiscreet woman who will promise one thing and do another. if you need to place a donation or an animal; based on my experience i would offer you the advice to look elsewhere.

As a foster youth, I was determined to insure that this did not happen to other kids in care. The President of the Coalition became my key advisor for the project and connected me to the people I needed to know to change policies at the state level. With the Coalition's support, I presented my project to the Oregon Child Welfare Advisory Committee and then helped them rewrite policies around face to face contact between caseworkers and the youth on their caseloads. After college I returned to the Coalition as a Board Member and continue my advocacy work today to make foster care better in Oregon.

Treasure Valley Childrens Relief Nursery	232721		/users/profile/296291	Jeanne38	General Member of the Public	5	11/03/2014	There is such a push in Oregon for quality early childhood education so that our most disadvantaged youngsters can enter school ready for kindergarten. In our community, TVCRN is a tremendous resource, focusing on youngsters social-emotional skills and building their sense of self so they are ready for academic learning. According to the state, the typical Oregon kindergartner arrives at school knowing very few of their letters and letter sounds, and thats worrisome. But, if that youngster also isnt able to sit still, doesnt know how to share, is a hitter or biter, or wont stand in line, his kindergarten teacher will spend all her time on classroom management issues, and wont have the time to focus on academics. The fact that Relief Nursery parents receive home visits so they can be ready to be parents of kindergartners is important, too. The Relief Nursery is a great concept and TVCRN is a great Relief Nursery.

Many of these babies and their families would not get this type of support without the Treasure Valley Relief Nursery as we are learning that all children need a loving nurturing environment to keep their little brains healthy and in turn they will become healthy loving adults. The staff at our Relief Nursery are all trained to handle any situation that arises out of this population and our community is truly blessed to have this program.

We believe wholeheartedly in the mission of TVCRN and are honored to  partner with them in our community!
Treasure Valley Childrens Relief Nursery	226247		/users/profile/289985	Barbara191	Donor	5	10/24/2014	Making warm and soft snugly quilts and receiving blankets has been a fun and creative challenge for our sewing group, "The Wonky Weiser Quilters".   As a former educator of young children, I appreciate the work this group does in the nursery.  Encouraging the communities to participate through volunteering, making donations of items to either be used in the nursery or share with family members, or selling items at the annual quilt show and sale has been brilliant.    Kathie and her staff are always positive and encouraging, whether speaking to potential family clients or donors.  We look forward to creating more items for next year's sale and show!
Rinehart Clinic	205097		/users/profile/267190	MarthaAnne	Professional with expertise in this field	1	07/03/2014	 Published in Willamette WeekWritten by NIGEL JAQUISS________________________________________Harry Rineharts House Of PainA century old clinic is at the center of debate over Oregons prescription opiate epidemic. lede_4034(scroller)IMAGE: Christopher Onstott       Tags: opiates, Harry RinehartFrom its perch on a steep hillside in Wheeler, Ore., the Rinehart Clinic offers a view of the timeless battle between the Nehalem River and the Pacific Ocean.When the tide flows out, water rushes toward the Pacific through the Nehalem estuary, where shrieking osprey hunt salmon and marooned trees washed down from the Coast Range create a natural sculpture garden on the bay shore.  BAY WATCH: The Nehalem River estuary meets the Pacific Ocean at Wheeler, which bills itself as the waterfront town with the million-dollar view.IMAGE: Christopher OnstottTwice a day, the power of the incoming tide reverses the Nehalem, and the rising saltwater blankets the estuarys flats, submerging the blackened stumps of old pier pilings that line Wheelers waterfront like an addicts teeth. To some residents of Wheeler, a Tillamook County town of 414, what happens inside the Rinehart Clinic is also a daily miracle. Dr. Harry Rinehart, like two generations of his family before him, cares for the sick in this coastal region, regardless of their ability to pay. His patients, often wracked with despair, poverty and pain, are those other doctors refuse to see.    LONG-DISTANCE HEALING: Dr. Harry Rineharts grandfather and parents served arthritis patients from all over North America at the 100-year-old Rinehart Clinic. Now, opiate addicts drive long distances to the clinic. They come from Astoria, Seaside, Lincoln City and even Portland, Rinehart says. These patients will tell you they cant get seen anywhere else.IMAGE: Christopher Onstott  He treats everyone with compassion and kindness, says Leila Salmon, a Manzanita city councilor and member of the nonprofit Rinehart Clinics board. Hes willing to do everything he can for every individual. Dr. Rinehart is a saint.Not in the eyes of law enforcement.  At 11 am on May 16, nine agents from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration raided the Rinehart Pharmacy, which is adjacent to and owned by the Rinehart Clinic. DEA officials had persuaded a federal judge to issue a warrant based on red flags regarding the prescribing practices at Rineharts clinic. When finished, the agents carried out dozens of files and stacks of other documents detailing the pharmacys inventory and handling of controversial opioid pain medications such as morphine, methadone and OxyContin. The DEA declined to comment. Oregon leads the nation in the abuse of such drugs, federal statistics show, with the states rate of prescription drug abuse 39 percent higher than the national average. Law enforcement and health-care officials are desperately fighting what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has termed the deadly epidemic of prescription painkiller abuse. More Americans die annually from drug overdoses than auto accidents, according to the CDC, and most overdoses are related to prescription drugs. The problem is worst in small towns such as Wheeler, already beset by the challenges much of rural Oregon faces: high employment, low educational attainment and-over the past decadeskyrocketing prescription drug availability. When pain pills are easy to get, the supply feeds a black market. Addiction to pain meds often leads users to heroin, which is cheaper than pills. The high number of heroin overdose deaths in Oregon, experts say, is directly related to the flood of pain pills doctors have unleashed. Last year, Oregon doctors prescribed 100 million pain pillson average 25 for each person in the state. And federal records show Rinehart is one of the top prescribers of opiate meds in Oregon, even though hes never been certified in pain management. The conflict over Rinehart and his clinic is part of a national battle, one as powerful as the clash of tide and river in Nehalem Bay. Theres a lot of debate about when and whether opiates are appropriate, says Dr. Mark Bowman, chief of emergency medicine at Tillamook Regional Medical Center, where many of Rineharts patients end up. And theres a lot of debate about how best to treat pain patients. Bowman declined to discuss Rineharts practices. All the scrutiny makes the kinds of patients Rinehart specializes in treatingchronic pain patients and opiate addictsless appealing to other physicians. Rinehart, 68, is unfazed by the DEA investigation, which could lead to civil sanctions or even criminal charges. Hes been in the cross hairs of local and state officials for years, and no one has been able to hang any violations on him. Rinehart casts his work in moral terms, saying his commitment to medicine and treating the people of his community is a calling stronger than the clergy. A lot of doctors discriminate against pain patients and addicts, he says. That seems wrongthat if you get a certain diagnosis, you cant be treated. Gale Taylor, a former chief financial officer at the clinic, says she thinks Rineharts desire to preserve his familys history has clouded his judgment. Hes carrying on his parents legacy, Taylor says. Thats his pride and joy. But somewhere along the way, he lost sight of what hes doing and why hes doing it.    A HAPPY PATIENT: The Rinehart Clinic serves many low-income patients, even spending $5,000 a year to subsidize their transportation. Dave Wheeler Dave Gomez, seen here waiting outside the Rinehart Clinic for a ride, says he was paralyzed in a trucking accident in 1986 and has been a patient at the clinic for 15 years.IMAGE: Christopher Onstott  From Portland, travelers approach Wheeler on Highway 101. On the Nehalem Bay side, the Wheeler Marina rents kayaks and the Tsunami Bar & Grill provides most of the towns eating and drinking options. No traffic light or stop sign halts the traffic on 101, but most days its a trickle. A string of antique and gift shops lines the main street. One large storefrontthe former Wheeler Pharmacyremains papered over, four years after a prescription drug scandal shut it down (see The Pharmacy, at bottom). Economic conditions in Tillamook County are dismal. The countys population of about 25,000 is significantly older and poorer than state averages. Wheeler residents are even worse off: Census data shows that median household income is $31,000, about 60 percent of the average Oregon household. You can hide poverty in the city because there are so many people, says Ellen Boggs, CEO of the Rinehart Clinic. But you cant hide it out here. In 1913, Dr. Harvey Rinehart came to Wheeler from Portland to serve workers and their families at what was then, according town history, the largest sawmill on the West Coast. The townnamed after Coleman Wheeler, the great-grandfather of State Treasurer Ted Wheelerwas booming: A railroad hauled in logs even before Highway 101 existed, and canneries lined the waterfront. A year later, the mill closed. The doctor and his wife decided to stay. They ate a lot of blackberries and clams that first winter, Harry Rinehart says of his grandparents. Family doctors in the early part of the 20th century often developed specialties. Some created their own recipes for tonics to purify the blood. Others favored the use of leeches for bloodletting. Rineharts grandfather focused on developing remedies for pain suffered by the workers who toiled in the forests. Harvey Rinehart developed an arthritis injection, a treatment that continued under his son, Dr. Robert Rinehart, and his daughter-in-law, Dr. Dorothy White Rinehart, also a physician.  FAMILY MUSEUM: Mementos from earlier generations of Rinehart physicians, including Harry Rineharts parents, Drs. Robert E. Rinehart and Dorothy White Rinehart, are displayed in the Rinehart Clinics waiting area.IMAGE: Christopher OnstottThe Rinehart clinic became a destination for medical tourists. Even with the decline of timber and fishing, Wheeler thrived in the 40s, 50s and 60s partly due to the Rinehart Arthritis Clinic in the center of town, according to the citys history. People came from around the country to take Dr. Rineharts miraculous cure. That he would join the medical profession was never in doubt for Harry Rinehart, who graduated from the University of Oregon Medical School in 1972. After a stint as a military doctor, he bought a clinic in Prineville in Central Oregon in 1982. But as his parents aged, Rinehart decided to return to Wheeler. In the 80s, Wheeler was depressed. High interest rates crippled the homebuilding industry, which in turn decimated the logging business. Fishing was also on the decline. Wheeler began to resemble a ghost town, an emptied-out community that once supported two grocery stores, two drugstores, a bank, a movie theater and its own K-12 school. The Rinehart Clinic was barely surviving. Rinehart converted it into a nonprofit so it could seek tax-deductible contributions. The clinics annual Sand Dollar auction is one of the social events of the summer for wealthy retirees and second-home owners on the North Coast. Last year, for its centennial celebration, the clinics auction raised $100,000an extraordinary accomplishment in such a sparsely populated area. Most years, the regions most powerful politician, state Sen. Betsy Johnson (D-Scappoose), takes to the stage to exhort the crowd to open their wallets for the Rinehart Clinic. Johnsons family foundation gives at least $5,000 every year. A lot of people appreciate the work hes done to provide health care to people with low incomes, Manzanita Mayor Garry Bullard says of Rinehart. There are a lot of people who have been served by him and are worried about what will happen when he retires.    WHEELERS PILL HILL: The Rinehart Clinic, which has 27 employees, and the adjacent 50-bed Nehalem Valley Care Center are the town of Wheelers biggest employers.IMAGE: Thomas Teal  Rinehart, already past retirement age, shows no sign of slowing down. He took up scuba diving at an age when most people are joining AARP. He hunts elk, forages for mushrooms and still pilots his Zodiac inflatable boat in search of crab. Hes fearless going over the Nehalem River bar, Boggs says. He has even been known to dump people out of the boat when hes doing it. Rinehart strides around the clinic like a vigorous grandfather: His snowy white hair and red-tipped nose are the clinics weathered face, and his booming voice its soundtrack. Rinehart is old school, dressing for work on a recent day in a blue blazer, cuffed gray-flannel slackssecured by a belt and suspenderspolished brown brogues and a neatly knotted tie with a miniature-duck pattern over a pressed blue-and-white checked shirt. Hes a schmoozer, wandering the clinic with a mug of black coffee in hand and a stethoscope slung over his shoulder. Hes also a lively and prolific writer, whose quarterly newsletter bears titles such as A While in the Life of a (Now Old and Fat) Country Doctor. The Rinehart Clinic is housed in a low-slung, clapboard-sided building owned by the Nehalem Bay Health District. Thick plate glass separates a receptionist from the patients who sit in a cramped waiting room dominated by a wall-sized map from the 1940s. The map is dotted by pins showing all the places across the U.S., Canada and Mexico where patients traveled from to visit the clinic. The clinic serves 3,000 patients and, according to its tax returns, generated $2.3 million in revenue in 2012. Nearly 60 percent of those patients had household incomes of less than $23,850, the federal definition of poverty for a family of four, and more than a quarter of them had no insurance. As medical director, Rinehart earns a salary of $168,000. The clinic offers urgent care, mental-health counseling, and in keeping with Rineharts aggressive approach, engages in experimental treatments such as injecting severely depressed patients with ketamine, more typically used as an animal tranquilizer. That unusual use of the drug has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. But Rinehart is best known for his work with addicts and chronic-pain patients. Hes a very caring person, says Deborah Burr, 60, of Nehalem, whos been seeing Rinehart for arthritis pain for seven years. Without him, I couldnt work. Trinidy Richardson, 36, a roofer from Astoria, says cyclic vomiting syndrome made his life hell for a decade. Hed wake up vomiting and miss work, making it difficult to support two daughters and a girlfriend. I went to the emergency room 89 times in nine years, Richardson says. I saw several doctors throughout that time. They all said they couldnt help me. In March 2013, Richardson went to see Rinehart, who put him on a regimen of vitamins; antidepressant and anti-anxiety medications; and methadone, an opiate, for his pain. Richardson says the vomiting ceased. Hes a godsend, Richardson says of Rinehart. Hes been my savior. Other doctors in the area, such as Dr. Rex Parsons, whos practiced in Tillamook since 1983, are less enamored of powerful prescription pain meds. Chronic pain and addiction often co-occur, says Parsons, who declined to discuss Rineharts prescribing practices. Without the ability to identify and treat addiction, the use of high-dose opiates is often misdirected, inappropriate and harmful. Of the clinics nearly 3,000 patients, Rinehart treats 300 for chronic pain, and another 100the maximum allowed under federal lawfor an opiate addiction he treats with the drugs Suboxone and Subutext. Rinehart sees most of those patients in group settings. Thats an unusual approach, one that state Medicaid officials say is legal, provided all patients get their vital signs checked and consult with Rinehart On a recent Tuesday, Rinehart saw three addicts simultaneously. A woman with a bold magenta streak in her hair told Rinehart she was worried about an upcoming gall-bladder operation and the possibility she might get hooked again on pain meds in the hospital. A sad-eyed Garibaldi construction worker, who nervously adjusted his hat bearing the logo of Stihl chain saws, says he relapsed recently after his ex-girlfriend moved his son to Oregons South Coast. Another woman says shes trying to regain custody of her daughter after relapsing and being jailed. She shows photos and a brief video of her daughter on a pink smartphone. Adorable, says the woman with the magenta hair. Rinehart spends a few minutes listening to his patients, then renews their prescriptions; most head to the adjacent pharmacy, which his clinic owns, to have them filled. Although he sees up to 10 patients at a time in his groups, Rinehart says his motivation for doing so is patient well-being rather than increased revenue. He says patients support each other and hold each other accountable.  Patients like it, Rinehart says. Almost all of them will tell you they really benefit from being together. But were not herding cattle here. We are making sure all their issues get addressed.    DEFIANT DOCTOR: Dr. Harry Rinehart says theres a double standard in the crackdown on opiates, which were traditionally given primarily to terminal patients. Why is it OK to treat people if they are going to die but not if they are going to live?IMAGE: Christopher Onstott   A 2013 report from the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration found that Oregon has the highest rate of opiate abuse in the nation. Nobody is sure why. One explanation is that Oregonians, who pioneered Death With Dignity and medical marijuana, are predisposed to palliative measures. We were in the forefront of the movement to recognize peoples pain, says Dr. Jim Shames, the public health officer in Jackson County, and we just went a little too whole hog. For more than a decade, Rinehart has faced concerns over his prescribing practices. In 2006, the Oregon Board of Medical Examiners investigated him after multiple complaints but decided to take no action. Getting cleared by the medical board did not end suspicion of Rinehart among law enforcement. Perry Sherbaugh, chief of the Nehalem Bay Fire & Rescue District since 2009 and a police officer in Tillamook County for 17 years before that, says some officers pushed for the Oregon Department of Justice to investigate Rinehart, but nothing came of it. Former employees also complained to the DOJ about Rinehart in 2011, but again, nothing came of those complaints. We know that the clinic prescribes a lot of pain medication, and weve seen overdoses related to it, says Tillamook County Sheriff Andy Long. He says its impossible to know how much drug-related crime is tied to the Rinehart Clinic. Rinehart says his chief nemesis is Tillamook County District Attorney Bill Porter. Law enforcement sources say Porter has made Rineharts prescribing practices a focus of his attention. Porter declined to be interviewed for this story. The DEA, however, is the most formidable adversary Rinehart has yet faced. The federal agents who showed up at the Rinehart Pharmacy on May 16 were armed with a search warrant that, for the first time, publicly documented suspicions that had long hovered over the clinic. In its warrant, which is based in part on information an anonymous former pharmacy staffer provided, the DEA cited the prescribing practices of the physicians at the Rinehart Clinic, including early filling of prescriptions, questionable medication combinations, out-of-state patients and a high volume of prescriptions written. (Rinehart is the only full-time doctor at the clinic.) Rinehart calls those concerns ridiculous. He claims that he has significantly reduced the amount of pain medication he has prescribed over the past year. Still, in the face of the federal investigation, hes defiant. Hardly anybody else on the coast will treat these patients, he says. He says he has urged his chronic-pain patients to find other methods of coping, such as better diets, more exercise and greater social engagement. Rinehart says the crackdown on prescription opiates is in some ways misguided. Some people just dont feel the treatment of chronic pain is appropriate, he says. Rinehart says the crackdown on opiates is hypocritical given that only 2 percent of Americans are addicted to them while 30 percent have issues with alcohol. He also notes that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs sold over the counter, such as Advil and Aleve, cause more than 16,000 deaths annually in the U.S., about the same number as prescription opioids. Wheres the outrage about Aleve? he asks.   On June 15, Rinehart made a rare trip to Portland to give a talk to a group of naturopaths about pain medication. He cautioned his audiencenot to quit prescribing pain meds, but to put their assets in trusts to protect themselves against lawsuits. Some critics question whether part of Rineharts support for pain medication is financial. Pain and addiction patients are loyal customers of his clinic, and with the clinics ownership of a pharmacy and position adjacent to a nursing home, hes got a vertically integrated business. Rinehart lives in a $1 million home on 1.4 ridgetop acres purchased by his grandfather. His 3,200-square-foot shingle-and-log home above Manzanita has a breathtaking view of the Pacific and Nehalem Bay.  But Rinehart insists his motivation has never been money. Rather, it is simply a different attitude about how to treat pain. Rinehart has tried to retirehe stepped down as medical director when his clinic celebrated its 100th birthday last year, but the doctor hired to replace him didnt last. Rinehart retook the reins and is again searching for someone to take his place. One thing is for sure: The century-long run of a Rinehart heading the clinic will end with him. Rineharts son works in the coffee business in Portland, and his daughter is an FBI profiler who works in Virginia. His clinic also faces threats beyond the DEA investigation. The Affordable Care Act has given previously uninsured patientsabout 25 percent of Rineharts clientelemore choices. And competition is growing. For years, there were few alternatives to Rinehart in the 49 miles between Seaside and Tillamook. But in 2012, Adventist Health, which runs the Tillamook Regional Medical Center, opened a clinic in Manzanitanext to the driveway leading to Rineharts home. Rinehart says hell keep soldiering on. Hell do so alone. His wife of 30 years, who was a nurse at his clinic, recently filed for divorce. He plans to continue carrying on his familys mission, moving implacably like the Nehalem River, even if the tide shifts against him. Our goal is to be here for the next 100 years, he says. To take care of all of the people in need.    THE PHARMACY  IMAGE: Christopher OnstottFederal Drug Enforcement Administration agents did not need a map to find Wheeler when they served a search warrant at the Rinehart Pharmacy in May.Thats because they have been there before. In 2010, the DEA and state officials shut down the Wheeler Pharmacy after determining that an employee was distributing pain pills without prescriptions.  When agents took inventory of the tiny pharmacy, they came up more than 18,000 tablets short of methadone and 2,600 tablets short of oxycodone, two opioid pain relievers. To put those numbers in perspective, Wheelers population is 414. The owner of the pharmacy at the time, Jeffrey Collett, was fined $15,000, and a technician went to jail. Collett did not respond to WWs questions. Dr. Harry Rinehart was not named in that case, but the Wheeler Pharmacy operated in close affiliation with Rineharts clinic. Many of Rineharts patients filled their prescriptions there. Rinehart says he required pain patients to count their pills in front of him to show they werent overconsuming or selling them. Thats a policy he put in place after 2006, when the Oregon Board of Medical Examiners investigated (but didnt uphold) allegations that Rineharts prescribing practices were leading to abuses by patients. BME investigations are not public record. Some patients could not account for their pillsand so the pharmacy helped them out of a jam. Patients told me that if they were short [of pills], they could just walk into the Wheeler Pharmacy and get pills without even being charged, Rinehart says. When the Wheeler Pharmacy closed, a new pharmacy, called the Nehalem Bay Pharmacy, opened next to the Rinehart Clinic. It soon failed after a technician was arrested there for stealing morphine. In 2013, the Rinehart Clinic bought the Nehalem Bay Pharmacy. That allowed the clinic access to a federal program providing drugs at the governments deeply discounted costan attractive proposition for a money-losing clinic. But the Rinehart Pharmacy soon fell afoul of the Oregon Board of Pharmacy, paying a $5,000 fine last year for sloppy practices, including selling a filled prescription to the wrong person and improperly disclosing an individuals confidential information. And then, last month, the DEA came back to town.

Rinehart Clinic	127587	1	/users/profile/172654	Dick4	Client Served	1	10/21/2012	I have been a patient at the Rinehart Clinic for 8 years.  In the first several years, I felt that I had found a "home away from home."  The staff in the front office was friendly and within a short time, we were all on first name basis.  Since the federal grant and the change in staffing due to hours and with the number of part-time staff, especially in the front office, I have become disenchanted, to say the least.  I have found the wonderful and fantastic medical personnel poorly served by the front office.  I have asked for assistance three months running to see a cardiac doctor and I was told that an appointment would be made.  Three times over 2 months I asked and was ignored.  I have waited four or five days for renewal of meds, sometimes getting to the point where I begged for my meds.  I have been treated rudely on occasion by front office people.  With the retirement of Dr. Rinehart, I shall go elsewhere.  The Clinic, once a model of kindness and warmth is no longer that Clinic I knew 8 or even 4 years ago.  It's sad.

Rinehart Clinic	58984		/users/profile/63291	Singer	Professional with expertise in this field	1	12/20/2010	The Rinehart Clinic is a Federally Qualified Health Clinic and is the poster child for misused government funding. Although the administration, medical director and the board proclaim a worthy mission in practice they all fall far short of their stated goals. Incompetence, arrogance and a lack of respect for employees and standard business practice are reflected in a large turnover rate as well as a budget shortfall.  Check carefully before you consider a donation to this clinic.
Rinehart Clinic	58741		/users/profile/62796	Venus	Professional with expertise in this field	1	12/13/2010	I have a substantial amount of experience with non-profits and I am familiar with the high level of accountability that goes along with the management of a non-profit. The management of this non-profit falls well below the accounting standards of most non-profits.I know that there is a considerable amount of financial waste at this institution. I know that there are long periods of time that the CEO will have no responsible employee in place for thanking donors or even depositing funds into the bank account. I know that they are experiencing a substantial budgetary shortfall due to overspending which they then make up for by above average layoffs and firings. Their unemployment insurance payments must be through the roof. Waste is routine here. The CEO is completely incompetent in managing a business and a budget and the board of directors turns a blind eye to obvious fiscal problems and irregularities.

Bend Spay and Neuter Project	286943	1	/users/profile/377015	Gwenn_L	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	Why does the Bend Spay and Neuter project leaves paw prints on my heart? When I was younger we had a female kitten named Miss Hiss. She was a beautiful long hair calico that my daughter and I got from a kid giving them away in front of a grocery store. The little boy was most sincere in his sadness that if he couldn't give the kittens away on that day that his Dad would be taking them to the 'pound'. My daughter and I were compelled to give the little kitten a good home. As she got older I knew we had to get her spayed or we too might have to find homes for baby kittens and there were SO many in need of homes at the Humane  Society already. Getting her spayed was the right thing to do but we didn't have the money to pay the vet. I heard about this new organization, The Bend Spay & Neuter Project, that provided free spay and neuter to those who were low income and that they didn't make you fill out any humiliating paper work or financial forms. If you brought in your pet they would help. It was a great way to both get the kitten spayed and teach my daughter the importance of getting it done before the first litter of kittens came along.  Since then we have had several pets that have received services there including vaccines. We have watched the clinic grow over the years and are so impressed with their success. They have provided almost 45,000 spay and neuter surgeries since they opened. Whenever me or my daughter hear someone say they can't afford to get their animal 'fixed' we always tell them to go the clinic, it's the most affordable place in Central Oregon to go. We can't imagine what it would be like without them in our community. They even have a pet food bank so no dog or cat goes hungry. We help them as much as we can by talking about them and their services, donating cash, and putting their promotional materials in our local donut shop. We love the Bend Spay and Neuter Project and encourage you to give to them too by going to http://www.bendsnip.org because kittens don't belong in a box in front of the grocery store.

Overall, I was very impressed to see how efficiently blueEnergy uses its resources and how large an emphasis is placed on metric-based evaluations of project effectiveness. With regard to its administration, blueEnergy is focused on project documentation; building local capacity in terms of staffing and educational initiatives; and developing projects that are accurately tailored to the needs of the communities it serves. Moreover, the group is quite progressive in its efforts around information management and communication. The significance of these factors cannot be understated, as they are absolutely fundamental to its goals of delivering LASTING energy, water, and sanitation solutions in Nicaragua.
blueEnergy	190040		/users/profile/248115	aus10syb	Volunteer	5	12/06/2013	****I will continue to support blueEnergy as a donor in the years to come because i know first hand their mission continues to build future capacity while simultaneously achieving a remarkable impact for end users*** I volunteered with blueEnergy in January 2012 to design, built and install a 100 watt solar energy system for an off-grid Nicaraguan family. Additionally, I interned with blueEnergy during the summer of 2012 in their San Francisco office working on business development and fundraising.   
blueEnergy	189967		/users/profile/248028	brian.wenzl	Donor	5	12/05/2013	I've been a donor of blueEnergy since almost its inception, and have followed the organization's progress closely.  In contrast to many organizations, blueEnergy takes a long-term approach to development, and understands that short-term, immediate impact is oftenshort-term impact.  Their deep commitment to the communities they serve stands in stark and powerful contrast to the "soccer ball flashlight" style of project that gets a lot of attention but delivers little real, lasting value.
blueEnergy	124312		/users/profile/169146	Jactive	Volunteer	5	10/02/2012	In May 2012, I participated as a volunteer in the installation of a solar powered cellphone tower in a small Rama Indian village on the Rio Kukra, about 40 miles from southwest from Bluefields, Nicaragua - where blueEnergy is located.                                                                                    This was a fascinating experience, as I had a chance to witness the convergence of modern technological innovations with traditional rural lifestyles, and to see how the availability of cellphone communication can have a positive impact on the social connectedness and economic activities of the village with the outside world.                                                                                                                  I have also been a donor to blueEnergy for the past few years.  I recommend this organization highly.
blueEnergy	1245	1	/users/profile/2150	benhym	Volunteer	5	08/26/2008	I was drawn to blueEnergy by its unique local approach in development. While so many actors choose instead to build a turbine and leave forever, blueEnergy had a training curriculum, a permanent presence, and most importantly, manufactured and maintained turbines locally. It is touching to see an organization that can involve itself in so many fronts, without losing focus of the key energy milestones it was created to service. Particularly touching was a training seminar in which 9 operators received diplomas, invited their families, and returned to their communities where they were then capable of servicing problems that may occur with the turbines. Instead of relying on Western return trips, local training provides both a feeling of social ownership and pride, as well as a transfer of technological know-how. blueEnergy is innovative, entrepreneurial, and most importantly, working for people who desperately need them.
blueEnergy	1242	7	/users/profile/2146	Bruno	Volunteer	5	08/26/2008	I volunteered in blueEnergy for five months from December 07 to May 08.As soon as I discovered blueEnergy in 2006 I have been fascinated by this NGO, who fully integrates solutions for development in one of the poorest region of the world. Indeed blueEnergy not only provides cheap energy using renewable energy systems in remote communities of Nicaragua, but also creates local employment for building these systems. Moreover, blueEnergy spread skills, training both its own workers and community operators for running energy systems. Environment, better life conditions, education and employment are linked together.My role was to start blueEnergy's studies about water. Water is an important issue on the east coast of Nicaragua, where basically no one has access to a drink water delivery network. After many meetings with specialized NGOs and studies of different appropriate water technologies, blueEnergy started the production of the Biosand Filter, a point-of-use device that can significantly reduce the contamination level of water. Volunteers and employees of blueEnergy have been specifically trained by CAWST (Centre for Affordable Water and Sanitation Technologies). Back in France, I keep working on the water topic : new volunteers run the filters production in Nicaragua, and I try to find funds to support the water project. Our goal for the next months is to have new training session for being able to produce more efficient filters and test them. Then the filters will be installed at blueEnergy's workers to see if they really fit the needs of the population. Finally, a pilot project will be to implement the filters in a remote community, after having trained this community to water and hygiene issues.blueEnergy has such a good intern organisation that it is easily possible to keep working for projects from France. I find it very exceiting to be able to work for development from France in my daily life.
blueEnergy	1090	3	/users/profile/1978	mwk	Volunteer	5	08/20/2008	I chose to work with blueEnergy because of their commitment to real, positive change over the long haul. blueEnergy provides sustainable electricity to rural populations that would otherwise rely entirely on candles and diesel generators, but they are dedicated to doing so in a manner that will remain viable for generations. This is achieved through a strong emphasis on education, training and local ownership. All of blueEnergy's wind turbines are manufactured by local residents in Bluefields, Nicaragua and installed in outlying communities with the support and integration of leading members of those communities. Each community nominates a community operator who receives hands-on training and is responsible for the upkeep of their community's energy system. As a result of this method and the history of blueEnergy as an organization, strong personal relationships are developed between community members and blueEnergy staff and volunteers while simultaneously empowering communities with ownership of their energy systems.  The volunteers in Bluefields work side by side in the workshop with local laborers and share experience, meals and friendships everyday. On trips to the communities, blueEnergy staff and volunteers are welcomed into individual homes and integrated into the fabric of the community for the duration of their stay.  The long standing relationships that have been established by local staff and long term volunteers in both the outlying communities and in Bluefields itself, have created a strong foundation of trust and respect for the organization. As a result, new volunteers are welcomed to the region with open arms and are able to immediately accomplish positive results that would take independent operators years to achieve. For example, I was recently investigating the possibility of harvesting locally grown bamboo for use as a building material, but had no idea where to start.  The director of blueEnergy Nicaragua suggested that I start by talking to an old family friend who had some experience working with bamboo. As soon as I met with him and explained my position within blueEnergy, he offered to give up his weekend and accompany me, at his own expense, to a bamboo cooperative located a few hours up the river. His willingness to do so was based entirely upon his previous positive experiences with blueEnergy and his trust in our ability to achieve lasting results.
The International Wildlife Rehabilitation Council	192012	1	/users/profile/250647	Diane101	Volunteer	4	01/03/2014	I have been a member of the IWRC for 2 years now and the people I have met through this organization have been well-rounded in this field.  The board of directors members have been very helpful to me and are quite dedicated to this organization.  Coming from a veterinary background myself, I was a bit skeptical at first as to the content of their courses, hands-on labs and conferences but have to say that the science based approach and content was VERY satisfying.  They have been nothing but helpful with me, guiding me in my volunteering work.  The quality of speakers and topics at their last conference in BC, Canada was very thorough.  I have always had feedback when renewing my membership, when registering to courses and to get my grades from online classes.  My next challenge with them is to pass my CWR. 
The International Wildlife Rehabilitation Council	192007	1	/users/profile/250637	HDBucky	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/03/2014	I have been a member for almost 15 years and of all the organizations that are available for Wildlife Rehabiltators, IWRC is the ONLY one that is 100% science based.  That means that every class that is offered online or in person and every symposium that they host is reviewed for content, so all information taught is the most up-to-date and best, safest practices in the field of wildlife rehabilitation.    Many other organizations do not go this extra mile and therefore much of what else is presented in this field is anecdotal and potentially unreliable, and can be misleading; unknowing wildlife rehabilitators may be ill-informed by another organization.  But not IWRC, I always know that I can trust any presentation or publication backed by IWRC.  In addition there staff is professional, respectful and reliable.  I highly recommend IWRC to all wildlife rehabiltitators, in my opinion it's one of the only organizations in this field that can be trusted for professional training, expertise and helpful staff.
The International Wildlife Rehabilitation Council	191717	1	/users/profile/91206	Mary.C	Client Served	5	12/27/2013	I've been a member of this organization for I think ten years or so. I love their magazine which has many great articles on wildlife rehabilitation. I wrote an article about squirrels for their magazines ten years ago or so. I hope to be able to make it to the next symposium. 
The International Wildlife Rehabilitation Council	102683		/users/profile/135128	WL Rehabber	Client Served	1	12/28/2011	I've been an on and off again member of IWRC for years. I was a member of IWRC around 2000-2005 and did not renew my membership for several years, and then decided to renew again in 2010-2011. I do have to say that IWRC is lacking in what it offers it's members. They do have a great mission and are a very small non-profit but I feel like a member who pays about $50 per year, really does not receive anything in return. Every now and then I may receive a member newsletter via email, but usually the information is not useful for me, and I am a currently active wildlife rehabilitator. IWRC seems to have lost its focus in the past couple of years. Around 2004 it seemed like they were focusing mostly on wildlife training, offering both in-person and online courses, and they even started a new certified wildlife rehabilitator program. Since then, it seem as if the CWR program is no longer in existence, and their training seems to have gone downhill. They do not offer as many in-person classes and they claim to be producing new online classes but it's been YEARS and not much has change d in terms of training. It looks like thye are now more focused on being more 'high tech' and 'online' with its new website, which to me doesn't offer anything useful. I don't think i'll be renewing my membership anymore.
The International Wildlife Rehabilitation Council	84363		/users/profile/93561	falconer	Professional with expertise in this field	2	03/31/2011	IWRC has a great mission however I feel that they do not offer much in terms of membership. I feel that out of all the non-profit orgs that I belong to, IWRC appears to not do so much. I've been a member for a couple of years now and it looks like their training and certification program is at a stand-still and they don't offer as many in-person classes like they used to. I may think twice before renewing my membership again.
The International Wildlife Rehabilitation Council	38236	5	/users/profile/39126	randie	Board Member	4	05/07/2010	In my experience, IWRC is a hard working organization that will not give up. We have a terrific new ED that is tenacious and dedicated.Her commitment and energy make it fun to be part of the organization.We are putting on a incredible conference in Albuquerque in October, our web site is going to be stupendous and we now have our journal online.I would like to suggest that anyone who has any problems with IWRC to leave your name and number or email and as a board member I will personally respond and discuss any issues you may have.Hope to hear from you.
The International Wildlife Rehabilitation Council	38078	7	/users/profile/38916	disgruntled-member	Donor	1	05/05/2010	Although this organization has been around for 30+ years, their staff and board of directors seem to not know what they are doing. Regardless of numerous attempts to get in contact with staff/BOD they never return calls. If you apply for membership, you receive nothing confirming that they received the funds. Very dissatisfied with service and the customer service I have had recently (April 2010) was HORRIBLE! I would not recommend becoming a member, at least not now. It used to be a much more organized non profit -- not sure what happened. According to them, they've had a change of staff -- no excuse!

Highly regarded in our community, the Relief Nursery sets the gold standard for how a non-profit should co-exist in a community with other non-profits, businesses and community members.  As a long-standing local business owner, I am proud to support the Nursery and my employees have also always enthusiastically supported the Relief Nursery
Relief Nursery Inc	312953		/users/profile/404326	AllisonCo	Volunteer	5	10/21/2016	Relief Nursery is a wonderful organization that has a profound and lasting impact on some of the most vulnerable children and families in our community. The staff at Relief Nursery are truly remarkable and provide a positive experience for all families and children. Relief Nursery's comprehensive array of early intervention services strengthen families in many different ways, from their therapeutic preschool, to parenting classes and outreach services. Relief Nursery parents and children know they are deeply respected and cared for from the second they walk in the door.

Pan African Sanctuary Alliance	311013	1	/users/profile/402350	Anonymous1000	Donor	5	10/15/2016	I'm a dedicated supporter of the Pan African Sanctuary Alliance. I am very impressed with their commitment to both the welfare of the primates in the sanctuaries and the conservation of wild populations. I would encourage anyone to visit PASA's website, learn more about them, and consider making a donation to help primates in Africa.
Pan African Sanctuary Alliance	311004		/users/profile/402339	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/15/2016	PASA is an amazing organization. They have a unique role - using their international network to support their member wildlife centers across Africa. As we lose thousands of wild great apes every year, organizations like PASA need our support more than ever. 
Pan African Sanctuary Alliance	281107	2	/users/profile/371130	RHogan	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/29/2016	As one of the sanctuaries that founded PASA Ape Action Africa has been involved with the organisation from the very start. Since the outset Pasa's role has been to support the sanctuaries and although the activities its undertaken has changed over time it's purpose remains the same. Without PASA the sanctuaries would not be unified and not able to share knowledge and expertise and would not have access to a network of support.It's essential that PASA can continue to support and keep together the sanctuaries.
Pan African Sanctuary Alliance	280745	2	/users/profile/370697	Writer	Board Member	5	02/23/2016	The 22 sanctuaries that comprise PASA are extraordinary because despite great difficulties (such as elusive funding, shortage of space, and not enough time to do all the things they would like) they have created safe and supportive communities for thousands of orphaned apes and monkeys that they have rescued from terrible conditions. The dedication and passion of the people who work there has to be seen to be believed.PASA sanctuaries show that every individual primate is worth caring for. Not only does this mean that the sanctuaries provide a high ethical standard and boost welfare efforts in the country in general, but also they provide an invaluable base for conservation efforts. For example in Uganda  Lilly Ajarova is the director of the Ngamba Island sanctuary for chimpanzees. As a researcher and conservationist working with wild chimpanzees in Kibale National Park, I repeatedly find that collaboration with Lilly's teams is helpful at all sorts of level - including the work that Lilly's group does on assessing and protecting the wild chimpanzee population in the Hoima area.The care and conservation problems are different in every African country, so what is needed is local expertise with deep experience in that particular area. That is what PASA sanctuaries provide; and through the PASA alliance, the sanctuaries support each other in their missions of rescues, support and hope. Go PASA!
Pan African Sanctuary Alliance	280720	2	/users/profile/370668	Mstumpe	Board Member	5	02/22/2016	I have served in multiple capacities,  volunteer,  committee member and board member.  It is  a terrific organization with passionate people playing a key role in  conservation in Africa.   Our member sanctuaries are top notch and make such a huge impact on the lives not only of the animals in their care,  but also of their cousins in the wild. 
Pan African Sanctuary Alliance	280517	2	/users/profile/370412	JoanCThompson	Volunteer	5	02/18/2016	As a volunteer for PASA, I've been able to see the great work it does up close. Africa's great apes need help if they are going to survive  and PASA is doing amazing work- together with its member organizations - to protect them and their habitats. PASA provides support, training and, in emergencies, crisis funding to a network of wildlife centers in 13 countries in Africa. Supporting PASA contributes to both direct care and to strategic planning and programs that support primate conservation and welfare. 
Pan African Sanctuary Alliance	279757	2	/users/profile/369724	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/10/2016	I can't recommend this organization highly enough! PASA first came on my radar when I researched ways to help out great apes in Africa. This organization is essentially an alliance of 22 primate sanctuaries across Africa. It provides accreditation for the sanctuaries, financial support, outreach, staff training and helps facilitate animal rescues and special projects. Because PASA functions solely FOR these sanctuaries, it is a very task-driven, goal oriented organization. Which makes it a very safe, reliable choice when it comes to donating. They frequently work with the local communities to support livelihood alternatives and conservation education. This is key to making any sort of impactful change in the world of animal conservation and PASA really understand this. I've found the people behind PASA to be an extremely dedicated and effective group of individuals. They are primarily primate experts and seasoned non-profit professionals that care very deeply about bringing aid to Africa's threatened primates. Their website is a great resource for any and all info about primate conservation in Africa. I really believe that without PASA, the primates of Africa would be much closer to extinction . 
Ocean Blue Project INC	274632	1	/users/profile/364085	Writer,	Professional with expertise in this field	5	12/18/2015	I had the amazing opportunity to do an internship at OBP as an international student at Oregon State University (OSU) from Brazil. In this internship I could learn about bio retention cells by doing an awareness map of green infrastructure at OSU. I could help in a restoration project grant writing that helped me to improve my writing skills. Finally, I learn to have more confidence, and develop interpersonal relationships by helping with the Annual Willamette River Clean Up, and doing outreach at the Corvallis Farmers Market. I could work with great people that added a lot to my personal and professional life. I just have to say thank you Ocean Blue Project !

I have seen many, well organized, successful clean up events occur on entirely volunteer involvement. It is clear that Richard sincerely wants to leave this planet a better place for future generations and he welcomes all participants who share those goals. I am often happily surprised by the level of philosophical diversity that I see in the volunteers that show up to these events. Many different people come together, and have a good time cleaning up waterways, planting trees, and learning about the local environment and waterways that they may have never noticed if it weren't for the efforts of the Ocean Blue Project. 
Ocean Blue Project INC	303873	1	/users/profile/395029	Chao	Volunteer	5	09/13/2016	I had an opportunity to intern at Ocean Blue Project this summer. I got to learn about map building and making video tours using ArcGIS and Google Earth. I have also gained experience on grant writing and event outreach. Working with Richard, the founder of the Ocean Blue Project, let me understand the concept of every little parts matter. Every stream matters, doesnt matter how small the stream is, because they will eventually flow into the ocean. If we want to clean the ocean, we have to clean the streams as well. Overall, it was a fun and meaningful experience.

Most importantly, I am very grateful for Ocean Blue Project's efforts to provide solutions that are essential to sustaining life on this planet and to educate the youngest members of this planet. Our children are the future and I think Ocean Blue Project has a very good understanding of this. I look forward to learning more about how to work with nature to clean up the mess we have created in our waterways.

We love our new dog, yes, but what this review is really about for me is the people that made it happen. We met our new dog first when she was with her SDRO foster mom, who graciously welcomed us into her home and talked with us for over an hour (we kept thinking of questions!) about the dog's behavior, likes and dislikes, interactions with other dogs, etc. Once we decided we liked her we got to do a two week trial before making a final decision. During this time, it was determined that she needed some vet care, including a tooth extraction, and SDRO paid for it since we hadn't adopted her yet. They set everything up through their vet and it was absolutely seamless on our side. The Foster Coordinator kept in touch with us during the whole process - checking in to see how the dog was fitting in, answering our questions, making sure things went OK at the vet, etc. When the two week trial was over, the Foster Coordinator asked us if we had decided to keep her, but I never felt pressured at any time. Both the dog's foster mom and the Foster Coordinator made sure we knew that if it wasn't a good fit the dog could return to her foster home at any time. Happily, it was a perfect fit and we could not be more in love! Once we let the Foster Coordinator know this we had the final paperwork in our mailbox in a day or two, along with a full vet history on the dog and a very nice note thanking us for giving her a forever home.  I know this review is long, but this organization deserves to be gushed over! They are amazing people who are making such a meaningful difference for these poor dogs who often have no one else. Thank you, thank you SDRO!
Senior Dog Rescue of Oregon	236246		/users/profile/320057	Kristina17	Volunteer	5	01/04/2015	After adopting a senior dog who quickly became my cherished constant companion, I began volunteering at SDRO.  The volunteers of SDRO provide critical resources for the many wonderful senior dogs who are abandoned at a very vulnerable stage in their lives.  The organization is committed to the health and healing of these older dogs, and making the right match between canine and human.  One of the great policies of SDRO is the two-week temporary adoption that allows the opportunity to make sure the fit is right.   The officers of the group are very responsible in directing every possible dollar toward the care and proper placement of the dogs.  I am proud to be a volunteer for SDRO because of their wonderful work helping senior dogs find their forever homes. 
Senior Dog Rescue of Oregon	204935		/users/profile/267004	Susan314	Client Served	5	07/02/2014	We adopted 3 dogs from Senior Dog Rescue and they have been absolutely wonderful!   They got back to me when they said they would and made the adoption process as easy as possible.   They also did everything they could, including all shots and dentals, to make sure that the dog was ready to be adopted.   I can't say enough about this great organization!   I love my dogs!
Senior Dog Rescue of Oregon	204933		/users/profile/267001	Ange C.	Client Served	5	07/02/2014	Very surprised to read the previous review.  I've adopted and fostered several dogs for Senior Dog Rescue of Oregon.  I've also adopted dogs from other organizations in Oregon.  None were as helpful, careful or thorough as SDRO.  I received complete health & history info on all my dogs.  One even received luxating patella surgery (both knees) at no cost to me.   Dogs in foster homes are provided w/ food, vet care, grooming - there is even a FREE certified trainer to answer questions or help w/ any problems.  Their adoption fees are very reasonable considering the dog is completely gone over by a vet- all shots, spay/neuter, dental, etc.   I will adopt my next dog from SDRO!  The dogs are fabulous: so loving for all they've been through. I like that all dogs are in foster homes soa very complete report is available for the adopter.      
Senior Dog Rescue of Oregon	204932		/users/profile/267000	Karin E.	Volunteer	5	07/02/2014	This charity is dear to my heart - rescuing and finding homes for senior dogs who are just asking for a second chance. My last two dogs have been seniors, and they couldn't make better companions. My current shih tzu is 19-20 years old. I help with the sdroregon.com website and also with their petfinder page. I find the staff and board members of this charity to be very responsive and hard-working people, who all volunteer their time and energies and open their own homes to fostering and adopting. I've worked closely with three staff members and all are dedicated to the goals of this nonprofit.
Senior Dog Rescue of Oregon	189268	1	/users/profile/246985	tessanaeye	Volunteer	1	11/25/2013	I signed up to foster, but I was pressured into keeping the dog.  I have had the dog for 22 months now and have been begging for background information on her to deal with her many health problems.  My requests have been ignored.  I have asked them to take the dog back.  They say they have no place for her, although, their Facebook page has offered new dogs since.  I told them I needed them to take the dog back before I had a complete collapse as I am also dealing with a mother in the advanced stage of Alzheimer's.  I was told my message would be forwarded to the board.  That was over a week ago.  It has been a nightmare.  These are the worst kind of pet lovers, the kind that are heartless towards people. I can not say enough against them.
Big Brothers Big Sisters Northwest	235442		/users/profile/319004	Aaron_Kirk_Douglas	Board Member	5	12/13/2014	My first little brother was 12 years old and in foster care. Today he is 21 and beginning his third year in the U.S. Navy. I could not be prouder of his beginning success in life considering the many obstacles he faced as a young man. Today I mentor his six year old brother. We've become part of the family.  I have been a volunteer with the organization for eight years and have never met a finer group of people dedicated to helping our community's at-risk youth. My own experiences as a two-time mentor have been eye-opening and life changing!  In addition to volunteering, I have served on the organization's Ambassador Board for eight years, and on the Board of Directors for not quite a year.  Oregon has an on-time high school graduation rate of 68%--the nation's second worst. Students mentored by Big Brothers Big Sisters have a 95% rate of on-time graduation from high school. It's a program that makes a lifetime of difference for our area's children. Big Brothers Big Sisters Columbia Northwest was voted Oregon's #1 most admired nonprofit for 2014 by 500 of Oregon's top CEOs in a survey conducted by the Portland Business Journal.

I am matched in a school based program, and meet my Little Sister, "Maya" once a week at her school during her lunch/recess.  I have found the staff to be very professional, helpful and knowledgeable.  I would recommend Big Brothers Big Sisters to anyone who wants to really make a difference in the life of a child!  
Big Brothers Big Sisters Northwest	87332		/users/profile/97989	ThomasL	Volunteer	5	04/26/2011	I have been matched with my Little Brother, "V", since November 2010 in the School-Based program. In this program, V and I meet up once a week during his lunch/recess time at school. During those time, we either go outside and play basketball or throw a football around (something he and I have been practicing on as we're both not great at this). When it's raining, we stay inside and usually play Uno or checkers - both of which allow him to focus on an activity while opening up little by little each week. Overall, it's been great seeing him have a good time and look forward to our outings. It's also helped me with my patience and to stay up-to-date on the world of a 4th grader.

Big Brothers Big Sisters Northwest	85730		/users/profile/95744	jntcrocker	Volunteer	4	04/14/2011	My "Little Sister" is in 5th grade, and we have so much fun together.  I am a busy professional with two boys at home, but look forward to seeing her.  We do fun things like crafts, attend events, go to movies, cook, make jewelry, take pictures and attend events sponsored by Big Brothers Big Sisters Columbia Northwest.  She has not had an easy year though; her grandmother died two months ago, and one of her siblings has a serious drug problem.  The family as a whole has benefitted from the referrals to social service agencies in the area to help them with grief counseling, free legal advise, and AlAnon.  My Little Sister amazes me, she always tries to see the best in people. We laugh and hang out  together and sometimes the best thing I can do is listen and be there for her.  Thanks for the opportunity!
Big Brothers Big Sisters Northwest	84759		/users/profile/94122	Leslie	Donor	5	04/04/2011	I am excited to become a "Big" with Big Brothers Big Sisters Columbia Northwest.  This organization serves an 8-county region covering Northwest Oregon and Southwest Washington, providing caring mentors who really make a difference in the lives of the children they mentor.  I believe passionately that we really can change lives, one child at a time, and that the experience of bonding with a caring adult mentor outside of the child's immediate family has a positive effect that will change that child's life.  I'm proud to support Big Brothers Big Sisters Columbia Northwest and urge you to join me!

The staff are all very knowledgable about Parkinson's and if they don't have the information you need, which is highly unlikely, they know where to refer you to obtain the answers you require.  All staff members are a joy to work with....all very caring and supportive.  I have personally been involved with PRO for three years and have been assisted by them many times.  They are invaluable to all people living with this disease.
Parkinsons Resources of Oregon	194103		/users/profile/253582	Kevin80	Volunteer	5	02/10/2014	Hi My name is Kevin Mansfield.I was diagnosed with Parkinson's in 2001. All my Dr. told me was that I had Parkinson's and to come back in 6 months. I had no idea what it was or anything about this daises .I started to look on line and that was to overwhelming so I started to look for other help. I found Parkinson's Resources of Oregon and  started to ask questions. They answered all of my questions and asked me if I would like to go to a support group and about two months latter one was formed. One year latter I became a Facilitator and still am 12 years latter. PRO has a very good staff that will help you in any way they can. They have a wonderful lending library, support  groups all over Oregon and SW Washington.  They go to health fairs to give out information to many newly diagnosed   people that do not know where to turn. They have a great conference on time a year where they bring in Doctors, and other professionals to help us understand some of the feeling we are having as well as problems we may be facing.  Some of the great services they provide are: Education Programs, Lending Library, Support Groups, Exercise and/or Speech Classes, Social Services. 
Parkinsons Resources of Oregon	189324		/users/profile/247079	TwoofFab4	Volunteer	5	11/25/2013	After my diagnosis of PD in January, 2008, I was referred to PRO as a place to find out what I would be facing.    I found out !!   PRO is an excellent resource for education and support for PD patients and their families.   The short version is this  ---  I can either be VERTICAL or HORIZONTAL in my approach to my future.  Horizontal is giving up & sliding into the couch cushions.  Vertical is daily exercise, attending & helping facilitate support groups, helping fund raise, trying to eat right & get sleep as best as I can...Being involved in my life as much as possible.   PRO has helped me develop the courage to do these things.         "I can't stop the waves from breaking, but I can learn to Surf !!"      John Watson

After attending two fundraising events, I realized how compassionate the staff was about their cause, and also how important PRO is for the PD community.  I decided that I wanted to be a part of this, so I became a volunteer for PRO.  It has been more than 6 years since I found PRO, and I couldn't be more proud to be affiliated with such a wonderful organization.  My family has found support when needed, whether it be a listening ear or education on how to live the most positive life with Parkinson's Disease.  Thank you to the PRO staff for always going above and beyond for those you serve!

At the time, it was a one woman show, Holly Chaimov was the Executive Director doing everything!  Over the years, I have watched Parkinson's Resources of Oregon grow into an incredible organization with wonderful, caring staff that touch many lives.  I am a Personal Trainer who works primarily with people with Parkinson's. So many of my clients benefit from the services provided by this great organization.  The resources run the gamut from education, one on one work with clients helping them navigate the disease, Aware in Care, and Support Groups.  As a co-faciiltater of a support group sponsored by PRO, I've seen the difference it can make!  If one of my clients hasn't heard of PRO, I always put them in contact with one of the staff.  I can't say enough good things about Parkinson's Resources of Oregon.
Parkinsons Resources of Oregon	162248		/users/profile/215369	Greg South	Client Served	5	07/09/2013	I was diagnosed with PD  in 2004. After the shock of the diagnosis, I spent two years in denial. However, I joined an exercise class geared specifically for people with PD,started by Nancy Nelson dba PDEX.  When I attended the first class, it was a real eye opener. As I viewed my classmates and their various stages with PD, and heard them using terminology related to PD that I wasn't familiar with, it made me aware that I basically had  little or no understanding of this disease at all and I had already WASTED two of the most important years of learning about PD. Through PRO, I was able to obtain numerous books and attend several PRO sponsored lectures and conferences presented by some of the top people in the their field of research. The staff at PRO is just amazing. They are very knowledgeable, bright and upbeat!  If you have been recently diagnosed with PD, PLEASE contact PRO today. They can and will help you realize that you can live a productive life with PD. NOW GET GOING, Please!

Having had family members with Parkinson's disease gives me a deep understanding of the needs of not only the client, but their families and caregivers as well.  The services provided by Parkinson's Resources of Oregon reach deep into the community, providing much needed support and guidance for those affected by this disease. The staff is amazing, and the entire group is focused on providing the best support possible for the people they serve.

What a wonderful use of volunteer's time & it doesn't take much to make a difference in the life of a kid by sorting donated clothing into bins that will be later be packaged according to a specific child's need and distributed by schools and agencies who spot a need in the children they serve. I brought home a few items this week to repair - 4 new fleece novelty throws that needed hemmed and 2 pieces of brand name clothing that needed stains removed. NCO stirs a desire in me to do more for them but it's hard when you are there only 2 hours a week! 
Northwest Childrens Outreach	225977	1	/users/profile/289727	HatLady	Volunteer	4	10/24/2014	I have volunteered at NCO for several years.  This is a wonderful opportunity for an individual, family or group to give  back to the community.  NCO provides clothing, shoes, diapers, hygiene items, toys to children in need.  Volunteers pack bags for children that have been screened by a social agency to assess their need.  First time volunteers are usually surprised at the number of bags ordered each week and how many items are donated, sorted and sent back out for each child.  The need is mind boggling!   Volunteers come every week and work together to prepare the donations and assist other volunteers in packing bags for children age 0-18.  If you want to volunteer, there are several tasks to do, something for everyone from filling bags, sorting, replacing batteries, moving bins, etc.  I have been making hats and gloves for four years from donated yarn and sent hundreds of hats out in the community.  There are many ways to volunteer and  help our children at Northwest Children's Outreach, I enjoy the company and the tasks!
Northwest Childrens Outreach	225975	1	/users/profile/289725	KathiK	Donor	5	10/24/2014	I've known about this amazing organization for a couple of years. As I've learned more from my friend who is a long time volunteer, my husband and I decided to make a commitment to give monthly donations for the next year.  Learning that not one person is paid by this organization and over 96% of all donations go directly to children living in poverty has strengthened my resolve to continue support. We do not live in the area but may find more ways to be involved. The dedication of the volunteers, and their length of service to NCO is truly amazing.

Northwest Childrens Outreach	221988	2	/users/profile/285681	Jamber55	Volunteer	5	10/11/2014	Volunteering at Northwest Children's Outreach has changed my life as well as the lives of children in need. About 2 1/2 years ago, I learned of NCO through a friend that told me they needed children's coats for the winter. I thought I was going to just drop off some donations. Little did I know I would be immediately enthralled with the operation and would soon be deeply committed to NCO. The center coordinator took me on a tour of the center and I learned that NCO is an all volunteer organization (not one person, including the board members, gets paid) whose mission is to "Stand in the gap between poverty and caring agencies with resources to help children." A week or two later, I took my teenage daughter to volunteer. We began by sorting, organizing and filling shelves to be ready for packing orders. A few days later, we were there to fill the orders the care providers place for their young clients. It felt so special and rewarding to pick clothing, outfits, toys, books and stuffed animals for each child on the list. I found myself picturing the children as they opened their bags full of all these things, the joy it would bring them and the relief it would bring to their parents knowing their kids had clothes to wear to school. It is heartbreaking to hear the stories the care providers tell us of the children they work with. Teens living in cars, mothers with babies they can't buy diapers for, households where both parents are working multiple jobs to try to pay for health care for a medically challenged child. It is also heartwarming to hear of how NCO impacts those kids and parents in such a joyful and positive way. Kids who now feel confident going to school because they have clothes that fit, teens that now have  warm coats and blankets to stay warm in those cars they live in, children that receive their first toy or stuffed animal and can't put them down and the child that was so happy to have a pair of shoes that she never took them off (not even to sleep) for three straight days!  It's now been about 2 1/2 years and we spend every moment we can volunteering there. It is a wonderful organization doing great work right in the community we live it. I love that NCO is making a direct impact on the lives of children.

It's not just that NCO serves children in poverty that draws me. The draw is multi-facetted. The desire of this all volunteer organization is to demonstrate Christ's love in tangible ways--firstly, by providing clothing, toys, books, etc. to children in need. Secondly, by enabling agency workers to know they have a resource where they can obtain much needed items for their young clients. Lastly, by giving volunteers a place to join others in making a huge difference in the lives of local children. Sometimes, I am not sure who receives more benefit the clients or the volunteers as both are blessed by NCO. Years ago my first point of contact with NCO was in the role of donor. I dropped off some teen clothing as I'd heard this organization had need of clothing. I knew very, very little about this nonprofit. When I walked into the warehouse I was struck with the enormity of the work being done. This group was changing lives one bag of clothing at a time!  Since that first encounter I have volunteered many hours and in many capacities. I have sorted donations, filled orders, assisted the site coordinator, been the site coordinator, transported  huge donations, shopped for needed items, answered telephones and emails, and most recently have become a reluctant board member. My initial reluctance to become a board member evaporated during the first board meeting. The board members are like minded. The focus is entirely directed toward meeting the needs of children, agency workers, and volunteers. All members hold the same position--serving God by serving others. Others include one another and that is refreshing.  So, it is with great pleasure I encourage you to volunteer at and donate to Northwest Children's Outreach--a local nonprofit giving to local children. Please take a look at northwestchildrensoutreach.org.  
Northwest Childrens Outreach	188400	1	/users/profile/245817	jeedl	Volunteer	5	11/12/2013	Northwest Children's Outreach (NCO) is an ALL volunteer organization. Not one person receives pay for work at this great nonprofit enabling 96 cents of every donated dollar to go to items given to children who have serious economic need. NCO gives to children through almost 200 caring agencies who serve them. Agency workers order for specific children and pick up ordered items and deliver to the families they serve. So far, NCO has served over 220,000 children in the Oregon and SW Washington.  As a volunteer I have heard many stories from agency workers regarding the impact NCO makes in the area. "If I have a toothbrush and a bar of soap, I can clean my hair, body, and teeth and feel ok about going to school"-from a teen boy as recounted by his agency worker.  "Because you get things from NCO for my kids I don't have to steal clothes from -----, anymore"-from a mom who had one more strike before returning to prison for good as recounted by an agency worker who serves her family. I could fill the space provided for this review and more with true stories of lives changed as the result of receiving much needed items from Northwest Children's Outreach. As much as children are served by NCO, volunteers seem to be even more blessed as demonstrated by their dedication. Some have been involved as long as the nonprofit has been in existence--about 13 years.  Please take a look at northwestchildrensoutreach.org. to become more acquainted with Northwest Children's Outreach. what they do, and how you can help.

Assistance League of Greater Portland	145236	1	/users/profile/94519	alpdxnews4u	Volunteer	5	11/30/2012	Homeless youth are those youth between the ages of 12 and 21 who lack a stable residence and are living away from their parent or guardian.  They are living in shelters, couch surfing with friends, seeking shelter in vehicles or abandoned buildings or sleeping on the street.  They have no address or identification documents and no parental assistance in financial matters.  They may have lost or severed contact with their parents or extended family.  This is their description from the Oregon Report, Living in the Shadows, published in 2005.  Assistance LeaguePortland is striving to help these students stay in high school by providing them with new, appropriate clothing that fits.  In 2011-2012 Assistance League member volunteers clothed 338 of these students attending class in the Beaverton School District.  Additionally, elementary school age students in the Beaverton and Hillsboro School District are provide new clothing that includes:  a warm jacket; two pair of jeans and tops; six sets of socks and underwear, a shoe voucher, dental kit and an age appropriate book.  Member volunteers give their time to work in the chapter's two shops, Thrift and Consignment, write grants, speak to local groups to raise awareness and hold major fundraising event.  This organization has NO paid employees, everyone is a member volunteer.
Assistance League of Greater Portland	84988	2	/users/profile/94519	alpdxnews4u	Volunteer	4	04/07/2011	Assistance League provided new clothing for 801 children in grades K-6 attending school in the Hillsboro School District and 315 children in grades K-2 attending school in the Beaverton School District 2010-2011.Additional Assault Survivor kits are distributed to seven area hospitals so victims can leave their clothing have something to wear home.  Washington and Multnomah County Children Services give each child leaving foster care a Life Story Book created by members of the chaper for each child to take their own history with them to their permanent family.With the homeless and unaccompanied high schools students in the Beaverton School District, Assistance League provides job interview clothing.As a member since 2004, I can not think of a better way to give back to the community.  The member volunteers of this organization believe in what they are doing and demonstrate their commitment through volunteering in our shops and supporting our fund raising events.Considering the need in the community there is much more that needs to be done.  We hope to attract more member volunteers for our organiztion and additional financial support from the community.

Last year alone, over 2,600 children in need received brand new school clothes. And, that is just the tip of the iceberg! We also prepare kits for victims of assault  who need to leave their clothing at hospitals for evidence. Then, we make Life Story Books for children leaving foster care and going to permanent families. These precious books are the child's personal history. We also partner with Janus Youth at Cordero, a residential treatment facility for young men. Please visit our Thrift and Consignement Shops to find some amazing one-of-a-kind bargains!                            Please

World's Children	187754	1	/users/profile/244836	ehaupt	Donor	5	11/04/2013	I'm sure that there are many wonderful charities in our world, but none of them are more caring and compassionate than World's Children. My family and I have been sponsors for over thirty years. We have watched the little children evolve from homeless, starving street waifs into fine young adults with skills that will enable them to lead successful and happy lives. World's Children is a true charity--only a very small percentage of donations is used for administrative costs. The Director and his wife have dedicated their lives to this cause.   I know that my money will be used to help the neediest children in the world.  I just wish I could give more! 
World's Children	187593	1	/users/profile/244619	Kim_116	Donor	5	11/02/2013	We have been sponsoring students through WC for 20 years.  We started by having our 6th grade Sunday school class sponsor one girl in India as an opportunity to reach out beyond themselves.  Over the years we have seen our girls graduate or move on and are currently sponsoring 4 girls, 2 of them in graduate school.  We are very blessed by being a part of this organization.  The staff are very friendly and organized, making us feel like we are one big family.  The funds are meticulously accounted for and handled, and they definitely know how to get the most bang for the buck.  They are intimately involved with the homes in which they have sponsored children, taking a very hands-on approach to management, definitely from the heart.  Not only are they concerned that the minimum sponsorship is paid for the most number of students, but they go above and beyond in inquiring, defining, and providing funds for extra needs - needs that for those of us in America would NOT be considered extra.  Our communications with the office in Oregon are handled professionally and promptly.  Regular newsletters keep us informed and interested in the service(s) provided by WC.  A relationship between us and our sponsored girls is fostered by the staff in every way possible.  We get endearing, heartfelt letters from the girls often and their sentiments expressed are extremely touching.  We are provided excellent, regular progress reports and pictures in addition to personal cards and letters from the girls.  The monthly sponsorship fee is very reasonable, the service provided is organized, trustworthy, and vital, and the atmosphere set by the staff is professional, sincere, and confidence-inspiring.  In partnership with WC, we feel we really are making a difference in these girls lives.  We have never regretted the money spent or the confidence we have placed in WC to use that money wisely.  We have placed Worlds Children in our will in order to make sure our girls continue to have the money they need to continue their education.
World's Children	187461	2	/users/profile/244479	skk64	Donor	5	11/01/2013	 We began as sponsors through Worlds Children in 1976, and have had many Indian daughters over the years.  Each year their photographs arrive and we see how they have grown and matured.  Their letters give us a special connection that we look forward to.  Twice we personally have met David Proviance (the executive director and son of the founders).  The stories he tells of the lives of the street children before they were rescued by the various homes are heart-breaking, and his passion for helping the neediest of children is inspiring.  David doesnt just sit in an office, but has made many trips to India visiting the homes and making sure that our money is well spent.Recently we were able to help provide funds for an Indian couple to build a new home for 50 children who used to live on the streets.  Videos on the website show us the joy of the boys and girls as they moved in. 
World's Children	187425	1	/users/profile/244439	Lworthington	Volunteer	5	11/01/2013	Many years ago, I was going to India to be part of a wedding party and would have some free time on my hands. I reached out to the many listserves I was on, asking if anyone knew of an organization helping orphaned children in India, AND that would be willing to speak with me during my stay and possibly give me a tour of an orphanage so I could see for myself how the children were cared for, and how the organization interfaced with the admin or each orphanage.  I met David Purviance in India, who provided a wonderful experiential learning opportunity by meeting with me for 2 days, dropping me at one orphanage per day, and allowing me to just be with the children and learn from the administration how they cared for the children during the day. It was amazing and touched my heart. Upon my return to the US, I was a changed woman. I knew I had to get involved, but I was not sure exactly how. I contacted David again and let him know I wanted to go back to India, I wanted to raise a little funds for a service project, and I wanted it to be with World's Children. I was permitted to get involved with 5 orphanages in the area where I was going, and interview staff, admin, and some children. I spent several weeks doing that, and what I learned was quite amazing. World's Children not only provides for the basic needs of a child, but they ensure their emotional, educational, and health needs are met as well. They celerate each and every child's birthday! They help them go to college! They build water wells, clean toilets, dorms, school buildings, and kitchens. They teach them to sing and dance and pray. In these orphanages the children are really happy. It is truly wonderful to see an orgnaization with such passion for what they do. The staff are incredible testimonies in their Loving Service Consciousness approach to life.  I joined the Board of Directors a few years later and was just as struck by the integrity on the inside of the organization. They provide 80% of ALL their funds directly overseas. That is an amazing feat, if you understand anything about organizational overhead costs. This means that all of their salaries, admin costs, office suppies, etc, etc, add up to about $20% of budget! As a previous Executive Director, this is very impressive. Be assured that your donations are going to serve the Highest Good of the children and their orphanages. If you are seeking a greta organization to support, this is the one for you! You can choose to support a child, a home, a project, a garden, purchase a cow, or a lovely birthday party. You choose how to be involved. I like that.
World's Children	186992	1	/users/profile/243998	Uber	Donor	5	10/31/2013	We joined World's Children when our two daughters were young - which was at least 36 years ago. We wanted our children to learn about other children who led different lives.  We started with dear Usha who grew up and left the program. Over the years we have increased the number we sponsor to four. Our daughters now have their own families and each family sponsors children through World's Children. The children write lovely letters and are so appreciative to have this chance in life. The staff is like family that can easily be contacted by email or a phone call. The love that Dave and Jean feel for these children spreads to all of us in their long informative letters. They are concerned about every aspect of the child and know many of them personally.  Because of World's Children many with little hope find a caring place in which to grow and learn.  
World's Children	172977	1	/users/profile/229006	pspiger	Donor	5	10/03/2013	I first learned about Worlds Children over 10 years ago when my wife and I traveled throughout India with the director and his wife.  We have been back several times since!   We visited many of the orphanages where the sponsored children live.  With out the monthly sponsor money most of these children would be living on the streets, begging for food.  We saw happy thriving children with compassionate loving staff members providing food, housing, education and clothes.  So little goes a long way in India.The Worlds Children staff is highly efficient and effective in delivering the needed funds and in managing a very complex supervisory system.  I am amazed at how well they maintain contact with orphanage administrators, the children, and each donor.  Every detail from food/nutrition, clothing, birthday recognition, education and housing is well managed.  A growing element of Worlds Children is education with over 100 children receiving scholarship funds to attend college.  Vocational training is also important and an emphasis is being made to help make each and every children "self sufficient".  
Bethel Education Foundation	196743		/users/profile/61440	Alicia A.	Board Member	4	03/30/2014	Serving on the Board and as a volunteer for this Foundation has been time well spent for me.  I love the  impact we make in student education by being able to directly support their classrooms.  Our grant program has grown by leaps and bounds in the last several years.  In 2013 we awarded almost twenty thousand dollars to classroom teachers/staff which was only possible due to the fantastic support of our community!! Please contact us directly for any financial information, we are excited to share our success!Email:  finance@betheleducationfoundation.org Phone:  541-687-1445orWrite to:  4640 Barger Dr, Eugene, OR  97402
Bethel Education Foundation	193579		/users/profile/252843	AdminBethel	Professional with expertise in this field	1	01/31/2014	I've volunteered to help raise money for the Bethel Foundation in the past, but became concerned when I was asking questions about where all this money was going.  It really appears they raise far more than what is given out to our local schools. They have been unwilling to provide reports on where the money goes, is it going into salaries for the staff or into a trust for future use?  At this point I would discourage others from donating until they provide this information.
Bethel Education Foundation	190978		/users/profile/249307	JenniferJacobsonBethelk12	Professional with expertise in this field	4	12/16/2013	Being a new nonprofit is an exciting and challenging venture.  Knowing that you are working for the enrichment of opportunities for children in your community is a fulfilling and rewarding experiencehowever, not without its challenges.   I would like to thank Ms. McLeod for her comments on how we could better improve access to our financial information. Due to her suggestions, we will be adding a financial section on our website, as well as, making sure donor guidance sites are updated with our latest information.  I would be remiss to not acknowledge our efforts to communicate Ms. McLeods request for information.  Email was given as the form of contact with our board of director president taking action by emailing an apology this past summer with the explanation that the initial person contacted for information was no longer a Bethel Education Foundation board member.  Our foundation does not qualify to complete a 990 form due to amount of funds stipulated by IRS rules, therefore, there is not one available.  We did attempt twice to email financial information that we do have to Ms. McLeod several months ago with no response.  Perhaps a spam blocker caught our communications and Ms. McLeod did not see them. We are pleased to announce that just this week we will be awarding nearly $20,000 to local educators and that we consider it a privilege and honor to be an organization founded by a group of passionate and dedicated volunteers to enhance and enrich the lives of the students who live in the Bethel School District.  We would love to share with you the great things being done by Bethel Education Foundation, our exciting plans for 2014 and into the future, and tell you how you can join us and watch us grow!

Bethel Education Foundation	189310	1	/users/profile/247061	Miss D.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/25/2013	I have received a grant from this organization. They were more than helpful and awarded the grant with so much enthusiasm! They even had the high school band following them around to award the grant! The benefits that come from this organization and go directly to our kids are immeasurable! Way to go BEF! I can't wait to see the results for this year! 
Bethel Education Foundation	189123	1	/users/profile/246866	Teacher71	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/23/2013	I am a Bethel teacher who would like the community to know that the Bethel Education Foundation is run by an upstanding group of committed parents.  For one moment do not doubt that every penny (Minus a small percentage for administrative costs such as bulk postage and printing costs for campaign mailings) doesn't go where it's supposed to.  Which is Into as many classrooms as possible!  Just ask any Bethel teacher . . . we will tell you, the Bethel Education Foundation is a committed, dedicated partner to each and every Bethel school.  Without the BEF many of our kids would have missed out on books, field trips, technology, and curriculum (plus much more!).  Do the research yourself, go to the BEF website, talk to Bethel teachers or administrators.  Then take a turn at making a difference; make your donation to the BEF and help Bethel schools.
Bethel Education Foundation	189122	1	/users/profile/246865	TeacherLady	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/23/2013	My experience with the Bethel Education Foundation is extremely positive.  They make themselves present and available in our district school buildings constantly.  They put in countless hours as VOLUNTEERS (most are parents of students in our district or school board members) to make the program successful.  They truly care about Bethel students and families, and want to ensure that Bethel students have the resources necessary for a successful education. Thousands of dollars have been put back into our schools and invested in our students due to BEF's tireless efforts.  Every penny goes to Bethel students.  Unfortunately state education funding is not adequate for maximum student success.   The BEF has filled so many funding gaps through grants.  As a teacher in the district, I can honestly say that our students and staff would be without adequate resources, if it were not for BEF.  Last year the BEF granted over $17,800 in resources for our students and schools. These resources included technology, books, field trips, gardens, instruments, clubs, learning centers, classroom supplies, and many other necessary educational tools.  Without funding from BEF, Bethel students would have to do without these valuable resources.  This year nearly $20,000 in grants will be put back into classrooms and schools for Bethel Students.    All of the information about BEF is public, and available upon request.  This is a credible organization that helps hundreds of students each year!  Teachers and Students of Bethel ask for your support of BEF.
Willamette Animal Guild	150052		/users/profile/200072	garyinEugene	Client Served	5	02/25/2013	I just wanted to say thank you to everyone there at WAG for the fine jobyou did on our sweet kitty Bella. After she was spayed last week therehave been absolutely no problems with her recovery. No bleedingwhatsoever. She has recovered quite well and has returned to her curiousself. Thank you for taking care of her so well. It means a lot. I willrecommend your services to anyone who needs their pet spayed or neutered. Best regards, Gary Marullo
Willamette Animal Guild	149180	1	/users/profile/198736	Lisa214	Volunteer	5	02/09/2013	I've been volunteering for WAG off and on since, well, before there was a WAG.  I've volunteered for a lot of spay/neuter clinics, having been Local Host for the Oregon Neutermobile.  The clients see WAG's reasonable fees and, I hope, understand how important it is to have their pet spayed or neutered because of the health benefits to the pet and the reduced population of unwanted pets.  What they can't appreciate as much as I do is what loving care every animal gets at WAG.  Animals that are young or any kind of elevated risk get one-on-one care both before and after surgery.  I often get drafted to hold a kitten for a while when we're busy.   The clients also don't get to see how much needs to be done to get a clinic like this up and running and keep it running.  It's done mostly by volunteers with a mission, plus staff, lots of whom started out as such volunteers.  I can't recommend it too highly, to clients, volunteers and donors.   If you want to help animals, I don't know where you could get more "bang for the buck."
Willamette Animal Guild	149172		/users/profile/198739	candace123	Client Served	5	02/09/2013	Extremely competent and compassionate staff. I sing their praises, and a friend also took her dogs in and was so happy I referred her to them.
Willamette Animal Guild	149171		/users/profile/198737	Lyllian	Client Served	5	02/09/2013	WAG is providing a great service to our community and pets. I had a feral cat I finally caught and they were able to take her on standby which is so helpful because it's hard to make an appointment when you don't know when you'll catch the cat. Price is very affordable and she was spayed and given her vaccinations. Thank you WAG for helping me with Babygirl! Her first litter was her last :)
Willamette Animal Guild	30015	10	/users/profile/31004	lori1	Volunteer	5	02/23/2010	WAG has been a godsend for people like me in animal rescue and for community members that cannot afford the high prices of most veterinarians.  I also volunteer with them and it is one of the days of the week I really look forward to.  They are a great group of individuals who are not only providing low cost and HIGH quality spays and neuters, but they truly are all animal advocates. That is not something I can say about all vet care professionals.  Thank you WAG for all of your hard work to make this happen and to be an inspiration to us all.  When we finally do make a dent in the overpopulation problem in our community, you'll be the first I will salute!
Willamette Animal Guild	29980	6	/users/profile/30745	emily4	Volunteer	5	02/23/2010	Thank goodness for WAG.  In a community that is so overrun with thousands of animals with no place to go, we were sorely lacking in affordable spay and neuter resources.  Before WAG opened in the community, the sole low-cost s/n clinic in our area was operated by the City of Eugene.  Having taken one of my own dogs there for a spay, I know first hand that the volume of calls they were getting was such that it is not unusual to have a three month wait to spay a female dog.  In three months, a dog could get pregnant and bring a litter of puppies to term.  While they did a great job with my dog, it was impossible for one small clinic to keep up with the demand in an area that has been economically depressed for decades.  The folks at WAG care about animals first and foremost.  They do high-volume, low-cost spay/neuters in a professional environment, and their staff bring years of experience in the veterinary medical field AND with rescue.  They are uniquely qualified to address the needs of feral cats, in particular, and are a wealth of information for community members concerned about what to do with the feral populations in their own areas.  I work with a local rescue, Save the Pets, and we would not be as successful as we have been without WAG.  We take many, many animals to WAG for their s/n surgery at a lower cost than at a private vet clinic.  That savings translates into our group being able to help a higher volume of animals or to be able to spend the money we save on animals who need other costly medical treatment, which we would not be able to afford if the bulk of our medical budget were going toward simple spay and neuter.  Personally, I was so impressed with WAG and with their staff that I decided to become a volunteer there myself.
Alliance for a Healthier Generation Inc.	117081	4	/users/profile/159272	Peggy Johns,	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/28/2012	The Alliance for a Healthier Generation is a national organization that is truly making a difference in childrens lives.  With their singular focus to turn the tide on childhood obesity, they have assembled an outstanding staffwith a can do attitude.  As the health education and wellness administrator for one of the largest school districts in the U.S., I can emphatically say the quality of the Alliances free products/service that I have received from this nonprofit has exceeded my expectations.  And to my delight, the response to each of my requests from any staff member is always, absolutely!  With schools across the nation feeling the strain of this economic downturn, this organization has created a system of support at no cost to help all schools establish a culture of wellness.  While the Alliance encourages baby steps, they also recognize all levels of achievement through their success stories and other recognitions.  And most importantly, their on target framework was recently validated through the Weight of the Nation report, book, and television series.  When reading through the book, each recommendation had the fingerprints of the Alliances social-ecological approach to reduce childhood obesity.  I am fortunate to have the resources of this outstanding organization and believe they need to recognized for all they have accomplished!

Through these years, my school, community and county has improved tremendously. Through the help of the Alliance I have noticed differences in the students and staff members' attitudes toward health.   Our school's BMIs have dropped and our activity levels have increased.  The Alliance paid for our entire county's health workshops for 4 of these years to train representatives from each school on how to improve physical activity,  physical education, employee wellness, and much more.   We owe a ton to the Alliance and will continue to work with them for many more years to come.

We have worked very hard at creating a healthy place for our kids to learn, live and play with the help of the Alliance along the way.  We have made policy changes regarding wellness, created new playgrounds for safe play, purchased salad bars that are introducing students to fresh fruits and vegetables, implemented walking clubs and brain breaks and after school intramurals for more physical activity along with many other positive changes.  The attitude and environment of our school and little town is changing.  Wellness is becoming a well known word, when three years ago no one was quite sure what that word looked like.  We are very grateful to the Alliance for the part they have played in this change.  Their ongoing support and resources have helped to make many of these changes possible for our kids.  Thank you Alliance for partnering with us to create healthier students, one step at a time!
Alliance for a Healthier Generation Inc.	151679	2	/users/profile/202528	Forthekids47	Donor	1	03/26/2013	This organization uses its children to present an image that they are helping people.  They really just use the money to line the pockets of their top leadership.  More money should be going to support the kids and their efforts instead of in leadership travel, personal cell phone reimbursements as well as work cell phones, and lavish spending on many of New York's boutique hotels, just to name a few.  The question should be asked of what is this organization really doing to combat the obesity epidemic! Currently they are just riding on the coat tails of the First Lady's successful Let's Move Campaign.  I won't be contributing again and I would encourage others to really ask the tough questions of this organization!  This is a direct failure from the CEO on down.
Alliance for a Healthier Generation Inc.	117293	2	/users/profile/159506	Dorchester1	Client Served	5	06/29/2012	I'm 18 years old and used the Alliance's guidelines to make my school healthier. I wrote an article in my school's newpaper about how the junk food in the vending machine needed to go and then I mentioned the Alliance and the program that can help schools. After two years, we finally got a vending machines that are healthier and I just graduated feeling like I helped to make a difference in my school. Thanks, Alliance for a Healthier Generation!
Alliance for a Healthier Generation Inc.	117206	2	/users/profile/159413	jwiles	Volunteer	5	06/29/2012	This organization has helped our school become a healthier environment.  Our students and staff are both more aware of the importance of healthy eating and exercise.  The healthier generation has definitely made our school a better place.
HOPE Animal-Assisted Crisis Response	287139		/users/profile/377219	PetrasFriend	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/23/2016	HOPE Animal Assisted Crisis Response is the only "comfort dog" organization recognized by our local Emergency Management structure.  They are professional, kind, caring, organized and invaluable!  
HOPE Animal-Assisted Crisis Response	213995	1	/users/profile/277210	jbhev	Volunteer	5	09/08/2014	HOPE has enabled me to combine my love for helping people and my passion for working with dogs.  Having something to offer - total non-judgmental love and acceptance - when words are not enough can come only from our wonderful dogs.  Working with my dog shows me a goal to work toward.   Each time we go out I am more impressed with just how much good a dog can do in a single interaction with a hurting person.  
HOPE Animal-Assisted Crisis Response	213869	1	/users/profile/277079	Nick45	Volunteer	5	09/07/2014	HOPE dogs heal the hurt.  In the aftermath of a mass shooting, I've seen first hand the pain and anguish of the survivors.  I've also seen that pain and anguish moderate as one victim quietly sat on the floor and stroked the head of my golden retriever.  This is just one example of the work of HOPE.  There are thousands and thousands more.  These dogs bring comfort to victims of crises and disasters.  They also provide comfort to the first responders as well.  And, all at not cost to those they help.  
HOPE Animal-Assisted Crisis Response	213865	1	/users/profile/277074	clipdin	General Member of the Public	5	09/07/2014	The dedication and professionalism of this group is amazing! Not only do they deploy their teams as quickly as possible to areas of need (natural disasters, aftermath of shootings, etc.), but during their 'down-time' they constantly recruit and train their members in all aspects of the process.  In this way they have professional communication and work in tandem with the emergency crews on-site as opposed to getting in the way and delaying the urgent need at hand. Even working on a shoe string budget this group continues to roll out top-notch people with extremely well trained dogs who work in such a professional manner in the midst of such turmoil. God bless these people!
HOPE Animal-Assisted Crisis Response	213863	1	/users/profile/277071	Carole24	Volunteer	5	09/07/2014	I am a new member of Hope Animal-Assisted Crisis Response. I am being deployed for the first time to the Washington Navy Shipyard 1 year anniversary next week 9/10/14. The efficiency and organization of furnishing us with the necessary information is outstanding. They have a team leader without a dog that is assigned to teams with dogs. Extra eyes and hands is awesome. I am looking forward to participating with Hope for the first time even though i  have to drive in Washington, D.C. and not use to big city traffic.

I have been so impressed by the organizations dedication to professionalism and well trained teams.  HOPE AACR never self deploys, therefore we don't create more confusion for first responders or become victims ourselves.  Each volunteer pays their own expenses.  I am so proud to be a part of this organization and have met and worked with the most amazingpeople and dogs.
Western Environmental Law Center	146865		/users/profile/150904	Diosama	Donor	5	12/17/2012	This organization does the work that I would love to do but simply can't make an impact as an individual.  Since they fight for the causes I believe in and are quite successful in winning these battles, I am happy to support them.  You should consider these honorable folks to support as well.

Western Environmental Law Center	83168		/users/profile/92048	Mike Lindsay	Board Member	5	03/24/2011	I have been a WELC supporter for many years and a board member for going on three years.  As such, I have been privy to and witnessed the growth of WELC, from both a program and a positive impact perspective.  Much of the credit for this growth is attributable to very good leadership on the part of the Executive Director, Greg Costello, and the talented and dedicated staff attorneys.  WELC is invested in providing its constituents with exemplary litigation and non-litigation support in a number of critical areas within the environmental law arena.  The consistently positive results obtained by WELC in pursuing its goals and those of its clients speaks volumes with respect to its expertise in this area.  I strongly suggest that anyone who is interested in supporting an on-the-ground environmental law organization that consistently achieves sought after results should seriously consider supporting WELC.  If you are interested in seeing/hearing more about WELC, check out its website - www.westernlaw.org.

Western Environmental Law Center	81409		/users/profile/89113	KevinKirch	Board Member	5	03/08/2011	I'll admit it, I'm biased. The Western Environmental Law Center works to protect things I care a lot about: old growth forests, wildlife habitat, clean air, drinking water for local communities...the list goes on.  They provide  policy guidance, scientific advice, and legal representation to conservation groups, state and local governments, individuals and small businesses across the West who want to protect their communities and quality of life.  And WELC doesn't charge for their services. Instead,  they rely on donations and grants from individuals and foundations.  Over the past 35 years - first as the University of Oregon's Environmental Law Clinic and now (since 1993) as an independent non-profit organization - the Western Environmental Law Center has worked with hundreds of partner groups, individuals and businesses. In that time, it has become an incredibly effective advocate for protecting and defending the things that make the American West so special: its breathaking landscapes; its wild, free-flowing rivers, its crystal-clear air; its majestic old growth forests; its spectacular wildlife; and - most importantly - the quality of life for the people who live and visit there.
Pacific Pug Rescue Inc	318604		/users/profile/409817	Mike198	Volunteer	1	11/09/2016	Rude and insensitive.   They took our foster away with an hour's notice.   They are basically a machine to churn dogs through foster homes to the highest bidder.  Unfortunate, and as much as I love pugs, I'll just adopt through the county shelter or the Humane Society.   
Pacific Pug Rescue Inc	279875		/users/profile/369836	Writer	General Member of the Public	3	02/11/2016	Volunteer informed me it was a six month wait. I lost heart! 
Pacific Pug Rescue Inc	279543	1	/users/profile/369558	Writer	General Member of the Public	2	02/09/2016	Disappointed with this rescue group. Have experience with adopting rescue pugs  before so was very sad when the  system requires you to keep applying  and told it would take months. We are still waiting. And, as the another post indicates, hard to keep applying and finding out the dogs are not available any more (and/or not matched to you because there is no feedback from the group).  Since my references were positive, not sure why we fail to make their grade. Love pugs. Great that there is a pug rescue group to care for them. But, frustrating system managed by volunteers who could be  a little kinder in their process. 
Pacific Pug Rescue Inc	78373		/users/profile/85648	Bridget S.	Client Served	5	02/27/2011	I have been lucky enough to be able to adopt three seniors from this organization.  They are knowledgeable, compassionate and truly love the dogs making sure that they are matched up with people that will love and care for them as the special little family members that they are.  As long as I have Pugs, and I can't imagine not having them, then I will get them through Pacific Pug Rescue.
Pacific Pug Rescue Inc	61056	1	/users/profile/66593	Lizzi B.	Client Served	5	01/26/2011	We recently had the privilege of adopting a pug from Pacific Pug Rescue. Their organization does wonderful things for pugs in need and evaluates each pug thoroughly while in foster care to ensure proper matches with adopters so the dogs find their forever homes. We turned in an application and heard back as soon as they had contacted our references. The meet and greet prior to adoption allowed us to ensure the dog was the right fit for him, and us as a family (including 2 resident cats). They also offered considerable support after the adoption and care for their adopted pugs throughout their lives. All of the volunteers and foster families are wonderful, and I'd highly recommend this organization for anyone looking to adopt a pug.  
Pacific Pug Rescue Inc	57591	2	/users/profile/60930	wjperez	General Member of the Public	1	11/22/2010	On their site they say that they have adoptable dogs and if you're interested then to fill out an application.  The problem with this is that they claim it takes 3-4 weeks in order to process applications  and by the time they get to your application whatever dog you might have been interested in is probably already gone.   My experience is that I filled out an application and didn't hear anything from them until I followed up with them several days later.  It was ONLY then that I was informed that they needed additional information which I immediately gave to them.  At the same time I asked them if the dog I was interested in was still available and no reply, I sent two other e-mails following up with the person which I also asked the same question and was never given an answer or a reply of any kind.  I went out to their face book site and there I saw that the dog had already been adopted.  Now, how much effort is it to write a reply to the question and state that the dog was already adopted out?  But no, I received no reply from this person.  Then she also mentioned that she had sent an e-mail out to me to state they needed additional information, but she didn't, it wasn't until AFTER I followed up with her that she happened to mention that I needed some additional information, so how long was it going to take her to let me know that?  Again, it would have been a 5 second e-mail.  She cited in her last e-mail to me that the character of a person shows up during the adoption process and told me good luck in my endeavors to find a new companion.  So, she attacks my character because of her incredibly bad customer service and trying to follow-up to see if they had received everything?  I would be VERY careful about going through this organization since they seem to be so busy they can't handle replies to e-mails that would take all of 5-10 seconds.  I'm sure the thought and purpose is noble, but if you can't handle the customer service any better then that then a person should probably relook at their commitment to helping animals in need.  
Mobilize Mankind	252663		/users/profile/340763	MaryLintz	Volunteer	5	08/11/2015	Wow!  Looks like it's been three years since my last review and I'm still here! :)  Previously I'd mentioned the founders' endless commitment and compassion, and it's still going strong.  I'm so proud to be part of an organization that is so clear and dedicated to its mission, the communities in which they operate, and the volunteers.  One of many experiences I'll never forget is when they'd arranged to deliver and fit twin, 16-year old boys with donated power-chairs.  These practically full-grown 'young men' had been being carried by their mother, who was a small woman!  The whole town came out for the occasion and they'd brought snacks and even a pinata.  Gayle and volunteers were helping to fit the chairs properly, and once they were finished and the family was trained in how to care for and keep the chairs charged, those boys took off.  Watching their faces as they experienced physical freedom for the first time was absolutely unforgettable. 
Mobilize Mankind	252271	1	/users/profile/340334	Cindy185	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/09/2015	I have volunteered with Mobilize Mankind for the past 10 years. I am a special education teacher working with students with severe to moderate physical disabilities. My work with this organization has been focused on assisting the staff, families and administration of schools with the physical and medical needs of their students to better facilitate learning in their school setting. MM has consistently worked closely with families and volunteers and developed meaningful ongoing  relationships. They have worked very hard to provide much needed supplies and assistance to help with the children's medical and physical needs. I am proud to be a part of such a dedicated and heartfelt group of professional people who truly want to help the disabled children and families of Baja Sur. I have worked with volunteers of all ages there and all have had unforgettable experiences and are truly changed by the work they do. Mobilize Mankind has my complete devotion and utmost respect as they have consistently set an example of putting the needs of the children first, and keeping their focus on lasting health and comfort for the children they serve.

Mobilize Mankind	248652	1	/users/profile/336416	Kelley6	Volunteer	5	07/16/2015	I have been a volunteer with Mobilize Mankind for more than 10 years. Besides the local work in Eugene, Oregon, I have traveled down to Baja seven times. I brought my daughter down with me several times as a child and as an adult, and she has been inspired by the work that she did down there. It was one of the experiencesthat influenced her decision tobecame a speech language pathologist. She now works in a public school district.I have been involved in volunteer work throughout my life, but I have never had as much of an impact on people's lives as I have with this organization. The resources in Baja are so minimal and the need is great. Providing a wheelchair to a child with a disability, who would otherwise not have one, is critical to the health of the child and also to the families who do their best to rig up strollers and wagons to transport their children.The Mexican families are extremelygrateful, welcomingand generous to us all. I have never felt such warmth and gratitude. My work with this organization has given me back as much as I have put into it. I have helped recruit dozens of volunteers and they all give me the same feedback. We have improvedthe lives of hundreds of children and we hope to continue this work indefinitely.
Mobilize Mankind	248515	2	/users/profile/192855	Wendy50	Volunteer	5	07/15/2015	I have been volunteering with Mobilize Mankind for more than a decade and I am as enthusiastic today as I was in the beginning!  Mobilize Mankind's "target population" is children with disabilities in Baja Sur, Mexico.  The organization collects donated equipment such as wheelchairs and walkers, from various agencies, businesses and individuals in the US and transports it to warehouses in southern Baja.  Greg and Gayle Edwards, the directors of Mobilize Mankind, travel to various communities in the region, meeting children and their families.  They then adjust and "remake" equipment to fit the specific needs of each child, fitting the wheelchair or other equipment using their expertise and experience.  During spring break each year a group of volunteers from the US arrive, to assist with the equipment clinics.  Additionally, we volunteer at various schools for children with disabilities, providing support, education and sharing ideas from our experiences in US schools.  I am a physical therapist.  Volunteers also  include special education teachers, assistive technology specialists, occupational therapists, speech therapists, etc.  The organization is all about collaboration, with families, the local schools, government organizations and businesses.   When Hurrican Odile hit the Region last September, Mobilize Mankind mobilized!  Despite the fact that their warehouse was damaged, they focused all their efforts on assisting families in need.  This included rebuilding a home for a family who have a child with a disability.  The organization is all HEART! Volunteering for Mobilize Mankind has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life.  I give it 5 stars!
Mobilize Mankind	146162	1	/users/profile/192855	Wendy50	Volunteer	4	12/07/2012	Mobilize Mankind (MM) is an organization dedicated to empowering children with disabilities in Baja Mexico, along with their families, teachers and communities.  The directors, Greg and Gayle Edwards, moved to Baja in order to dedicate their lives to the the mission and work of MM.   I am a Board member and have made several trips to Baja, Mexico to volunteer, for one week at a time.  These experiences have been very fulfilling for me, personally and professionally (I am a pediatric physical therapist).  Additionally, I've had the opportunity to see, first hand, the direct, real and permanent change this organization has made in the lives of children with disabilities.
Mobilize Mankind	146223		/users/profile/192932	lintzstaats	Volunteer	5	12/07/2012	For anyone interested in contributing time or financial support to an organization that is grassroots and powered by passion, you've found it.   Primarily staffed by volunteers, Mobilize has provided countless children with mobility, access to education, and many other opportunities to engage in their communities.  Greg and Gayle have a bottomless reserve of compassion and energy and have an incredible ability to build relationships in the community to help children gain access to the world.  Baja is a beautiful place with beautiful people who are grateful for the services that Mobilize has been able to provide.  As a pediatric occupational therapist, I was looking for an opportunity to donate my services in exchange for some interesting life experiences--and, wow did I get my investment's worth!  My time as a volunteer with Mobilize has enriched my life far beyond anything I could ever have hoped to impart.  THANK YOU MOBILIZE!!  
Step It Up Inc	54336		/users/profile/55607	vmc	Volunteer	5	10/02/2010	This is a greatly committed organization connecting students to business partners.  If SIU had additional financial contributors and business partners there is no limit to its success. There needs to be more expansion to provide opportunities to the students on the waiting list.

Step It Up Inc	53947		/users/profile/55115	leamcleod	Volunteer	5	09/29/2010	What Step It Up Inc. is doing is such important work in the world, and especially Portland. The statistics show that we are just not getting the high school completion rates we need for our kids. Diminished completion rates keep students from realizing their full long term potential, inhibit our ability to thrive as a competitive workforce, and fail to ensure the best possible future for our kids.Step It Up Inc is focused on creating an environment where students have an investment in completing high school by creating a line of sight to the satisfaction of doing so. Its success in retaining students, increasing the graduation rate, and growing them into young confident professionals speaks for itself. The work Linda McNeill and her team are doing here is astounding, and I'm so happy to be part of this organization.

As a local business owner dedicated to the ethical treatment of animals, I greatly appreciate what they do - they really go above and beyond. My family donates all of our gently used items that we no longer want to S.A.R.A.'s. Please support them!
Shelter Animal Resource Alliance	118028	1	/users/profile/160538	ndp95	Volunteer	4	07/10/2012	I volunteered with S.A.R.A's last winter at their booth at the Holiday Market, and shortly thereafter visited their store on River Road. Everyone who ran the store was kind to both me and the animals in their care, knowledgeable about all aspects of their cat's lives and willing to help and answer any questions. Their store is clean and well-run despite the 10+ cats living in the store at any given time. All the furry friends there seem happy and healthy despite some having serious health issues (such as asthma), and my desire to adopt them all was through the roof! 
Shelter Animal Resource Alliance	106323	1	/users/profile/143315	astrid7	Client Served	5	02/12/2012	As an adopter, I have seen first hand just how much the people at S.A.R.A. care about the animals they rescue. They take the time to explain everything they know: from a cat's medical and behavioral history to their favorite foods and toys. Before adopting, the staff helps guide you to find a cat that's compatible with what you're looking for in a pet (lap cat? playmate for your younger cat? dog friendly?), and then you sit down for an interview so you can learn everything you can about the animal you are interested in. They also provide support after you take the kitty home, calling after a few days to make sure everyone is settling in/eating okay/etc. All of their cats are obviously well cared for, and they run a thrift store (where the cats live) that raises money for their medical treatment. They even sell all of the food and supplies you need to keep your new cat happy. A great organization! 
Shelter Animal Resource Alliance	104994	2	/users/profile/140925	ezsister	General Member of the Public	5	01/30/2012	The animals are the best cared for animals in oregon. The animal's welfare always comes first. The store is very cute and has great merchandise. The store is clean as well as the area for the animals. The expense to care for these animals is very high as some require medical treatment and special food. If you want to adopt a cat, this is the place to do it!
Shelter Animal Resource Alliance	104988	2	/users/profile/140897	CatsRule	Donor	5	01/30/2012	Shelter Animal Resource Alliance (S.A.R.A.) does amazing work in our community!  I have been donating to them for almost 10 years now and they work tirelessly to raise money to care for the animals the rescue from death at the shelters. They have many cats up for adoption in the thrift store and many others in foster care.   I will continue to donate to them as I can directly see where my money goes by the great care they give the animals there. They are open everyday unlike most other non-profits so their animals get lots of love and attention!  If you are looking for a great place to shop and donate S.A.R.A.'s is the best choice!
Shelter Animal Resource Alliance	104844		/users/profile/140700	Murdock	General Member of the Public	1	01/29/2012	This appears to be a for profit business posing as a non profit.  They take donations, and run a thrift store, but by their own admission, they adopt out and care for less than 20 animals a year.  Does it take over $200,000 each year to care for 20 cats?  If you care about animals, I'd advise donating somewhere else.
A Family For Every Child	219078	1	/users/profile/282682	ShirleyA	General Member of the Public	4	10/01/2014	The need for a loving home for every child is so important, and this organization has brought this need front and center in our community and throughout the country.  Our children are our future and every child in need that they help to find a home, is a blessing to  the future.

A Family For Every Child	194422	2	/users/profile/254067	loribumgardneradair	Professional with expertise in this field	4	02/17/2014	I am more than impressed with this organization as they have been able to fill a niche serving the hardest-to-place children who often languish in the foster system.  The hardest-to-place foster children are over the age of eight, are part of a sibling group, have been in foster care for an extended length of time, or are of an ethnic minority group. Many of them also have severe physical, emotional and/or developmental challenges. The shrinking Oregon Department of Human Services budget often results in these special-needs children being forced to the back of the line to receive supportsimply because they require more attention, assistance, and care than the majority of other foster children.   They have gone beyond the basics to serve needs as they arise: mentoring, advocate services, family building services (including a new Adoption Agency). As a start-up organization that does not take public funds, and operates with a full-time volunteer executive director (who herself has 12 children, 9 adopted) on a shoe-string budget, to serve as many children as possible is commendable. I have noticed some employee and/or volunteer complaints (on this site). As someone who has been a nonprofit consultant for 20 years, I am sure the need to tirelessly serve the 500,000 children in foster care nationally, focusing on the 13,000 in Oregon and 9,500 in Washington is taxing. This is hard work, and not for the faint of heart.  As a consultant, I see too many college graduates and/or early career professionals with misguided expectations: Working in a nonprofit is not a cakewalk! Good nonprofits are forever evolving... Good employees (who are the "right fit") are able to rise to this challenge, and those who do not forward the organization's mission will fall away. Guaranteed salary and benefit packages, even for large government organizations, are a thing of the past. Still, in working with the AFFEC board, I know that it is their goal to balance the urgent need for services and intentionally grow a stable organization with a well-compensated, trained, and creative staff on board the long term. I applaud A Family For Every Child for being a leading edge innovator with an entrepreneurial approach to doing business. It is obvious their donations are increasing while other organizations that have become passive in their approach to the urgent needs of children are flailing.  Why? Positive Results!
A Family For Every Child	168949	5	/users/profile/223920	private2	Professional with expertise in this field	1	09/10/2013	Although their mission is wonderful, their lack of organization and poor treatment of their employees and volunteers left a bad taste in my mouth after attempting to work with them for almost nine months. The individual programs are great, being run by wonderful, dedicated people who are doing the best they can with the resources they have. Unfortunately they usually burn out within 3-6 months. And usually don't get their last paycheck. Upper management is a huge hindrance on this organization. They talk badly about volunteers in meetings and are so incredibly disorganized that it affects how they serve their clients. They provide no training or support, but expect every task to happen perfectly without any questions. When everything blows up in their face, they have a volunteer or employee to turn into a scape goat. If you are looking to volunteer or work with this organization, I would proceed with extreme caution. I understand being desperate, but If no support coupled with huge work loads and very low or no pay sound like something you can skip, skip this place. If you are looking to volunteer, there are plenty of other wonderful places that help kids that will not make you feel bad about doing it. 
A Family For Every Child	151479	4	/users/profile/202236	non-profit employee	Professional with expertise in this field	1	03/22/2013	I want to share my experience applying for a job at A Family for Every Child. I was given an interview (they only asked me 1 question, red flag) and offered the position the next day, with the contract emailed to me. The position was a contracted position as an Adoption Worker. I had questions about parts of the contract, and they responded by the end of the week to answer them and set up training (with date and suggested  time) for the next week. I told my boss at my current job about my change in employment (luckily I was not quitting, just reducing hours) as soon as I considered it 'official.' I realized that no one had officially confirmed the training day and time, and emailed them to get confirmation. Only then, THREE DAYS BEFORE TRAINING was about to begin, did they send me a short, one sentence email that they had decided not to hire at that time. Unprofessional, lack of any tact whatsoever, and without apology. If you apply for a job with these folks, please take note of this situation and learn from it.

United Horsemens Front	192354	1	/users/profile/251134	TedWells	Professional with expertise in this field	1	01/09/2014	This "organization" is a thinly veiled disguise for a few individuals whose sole agenda is to financially gain from implementing equine slaughter in the US. It should never have received a 501(c)3 status from the IRS.
United Horsemens Front	108282	1	/users/profile/147374	Honest	Professional with expertise in this field	1	03/25/2012	This is a perfect example of why the IRS and FTC need to research non-profit and charities for viability and compliance. This United Horsemens Front is a cover for soliciting funds for politicians like Mr. Duquette's favorite, Rep. Sue Wallis (Wyoming).  Their travel expenses to promote horse slaughter for Chevideco of France (who still owes Texas thousands of $$$ in fines) can be raised covertly and fraudulently. Donations will enhance the overbreeding and slaughter of companion/service industry animals for their company's (Unified Equine LLC) profit, which means it is not 'non-profit. This 'charity' has no board of directors, no mission statement, no income report...and IRS hasn't noticed something wrong with this picture yet?
United Horsemens Front	96462	1	/users/profile/112341	shcisamax	General Member of the Public	1	08/24/2011	You must be kidding.  This is just a group  headed by Sue Wallis the WY state rep who has been trying to gather investors to bring the Sue Wallis Slaughterhouses Inc. back to her state and yours.  It is all about the money.  I imagine the  non "profits" are going right into her coffers for her trips to lobby.   
United Horsemens Front	96454	1	/users/profile/112333	theboyzmom	General Member of the Public	1	08/23/2011	Their name is misleading. I joined thinking they were horse lovers . What a mistake!  They should be renamed the United Horse Slaughter Industry Supporters. They are not lovers of horses, they only love the money they make from them. When these same horses have served their purpose, this  group promotes slaughtering them to eek out every last penny.  They claim it is their right to do what they want with their animals  because its their property. They disparagingly refer to anyone concerned with humane treatment as "freaks" or "AR's. To attempt to make the idea of consuming horsemeat more palatable, they claim there is no issue with horses being given drugs that are banned in horses for human consumption by the FDA .I was very disappointed in this group. 
United Horsemens Front	96447	2	/users/profile/112328	Jo-Claire C.	Professional with expertise in this field	1	08/23/2011	This charity is not a charity, it is a front for bringing back horse slaughter to the USA.  They hide behind the guise of horse welfare, when really all they want to do is line their pockets with money from horse slaughter plants.  Sue Wallis who is President of the group, already has the plans drawn up for a plant in Wyoming and also wants to develope a mobile slaughter plant.   I find their whole persona to be deceitful and misleading to the general public.  I would rate this Charity very low.  I would like to see an independent audit and if a 501c3, only 20% of their time can be spent lobbying, yet I firmly believe that their lobbying consisits of over 60% of their focus.  
United Horsemens Front	96446	2	/users/profile/112261	equinewelfare	Professional with expertise in this field	1	08/23/2011	This is a lobby group for a fringe collection of horse breeders who support the insidious business of horse slaughter. How this qualifies as a non-profit is beyond me. As a lifelong horse owner and trainer, I am well versed in the horse industry, and can say confidently this group does not represent "United Horseman." Most horse people are opposed to horse slaughter, primarily because of the brutality inherent in the slaughter pipeline. 
Assistance League Of Eugene	153514	1	/users/profile/204311	ginnydunphy	Board Member	5	04/08/2013	I've been a member of Assistance League of Eugene since 2009 and think this is an outstanding non-profit organization.  Part of the National Assistance League, which is more than 100 years old, the Eugene chapter was founded in 1973 and chartered in 1978.  Membership has grown to 243 this year and several founding members are still active.  Members volunteer more than 24,000 service hours annually. Assistance League of Eugene's mission is to provide programs that will enhance the quality of life in our community.  We currently have seven philanthropic programs which assist nearly 4,000 people in need:  Operation School Bell (new school clothes for children in need); Children's Dental Center (dental care for children without insurance); Operation Bookshelf (library materials for homebound patrons); Oregon Heritage (historical museum programs for children and seniors); Operation Hug a Bear (teddy bears for people in crisis); Welcome Basket (home supplies for families and veterans in transitional housing); and Caring and Sharing (music and fellowship with seniors).   These programs are funded primarily by proceeds from our Assistance League Thrift Shop, which is staffed by members with merchandise donated by the community.  Supplemental income is raised through grant-writing and additional fund-raising activities.  88% of all funds raised are returned to the community. Assistance League of Eugene's motto is "Caring and Commitment in Action."  Members volunteer their time, energy, and enthusiasm because they love what they do and know it's for a good cause.  That's why I'm a member and plan to be for a long time to come. 
Assistance League Of Eugene	153197		/users/profile/204039	Kathleen Turner	Board Member	5	04/07/2013	Assistance League of Eugene is a volunteer driven non-profit organization. Our seven philanthropic programs provide library materials to shut-ins;  new school clothing for over 1700 school children (fall 2012); Oregon History tours and "road shows" for students and seniors; friendship and music at local residential care facilities; household products for families moving into transitional housing; teddy bears for children in traumatic situations; and free dental care for students in six local school districts.   We raise the majority of the money needed to fund our programs through sales of donated merchandise at our Assistance League Thrift Shop. Our 240+ members work tirelessly to staff, fund and support our fundraisers and programs, donating more than 24,000 volunteer hours in fiscal 2011-12. We participate in local events to raise awareness of our organization's activities in the community; have a speaker's bureau that provides information about our organization to interested groups; and a fiscally responsible infrastructure that returns over 87% of the funds we raise back to our community. We make a difference in the lives of those we serve, and in the process, enrich our own lives.  
Assistance League Of Eugene	152893		/users/profile/203777	SBrous	Board Member	5	04/06/2013	Working with an organization that directly helps children and people in need in our community helps fill the need to give back to a community that has provided our livelihood and a great way of life.  Assistance League works well for me as a volunteer organization because it raises money, donates the money through services or programs right back into the hands of those who need it. Operation School Bell allows children identified through their schools as needing help.  Each child gets the joy of picking out needed, wanted clothing that makes them fit into their school experience. Love working the nights they shop!  VetLift, a newer program of Assistance League, helps Veterans moving into transitional housing by providing household supplies.  At a recent Assistance League meeting a Veteran described for us how important it was to know that people in his own community cared enough to do this.  Working at the Thrift Shop preparing donations for sale, creating artful displays, maintaining a retail shop takes many hours per week for all of our members. But the rewards are worth the effort.  We help people right where they need it  here, in Eugene. Another way Assistance League raises money is by writing grants and applying to foundations that seek ways to put their funds in the hands of those who provide programs to help people in need  for example the Childrens Dental Clinic is the recipient of many grants and donations.  Great way to help kids! Dentists and Hygienists donate their time and talents. Our volunteers maintain the clinic and make it all happen.  Assistance League has many talented and energetic volunteers that love making someone elses life better.

We also provide dental care for students who do not have insurance. Senior citizens, that our house bound, receive books from our public library delivered by Assistance League members.  Working with St Vincent de Paul, we provide Welcome Baskets for families and veterans that are getting into housing.  We have a group of volunteers who provide Sing-a-longs for nursing home residents.

Children in need of new school clothes are helped through Operation School Bell, flagship program for all Assistance League chapters nationally. The Children's Dental Clinic provides treatment and education  for dental health in children lacking dental insurance. I love teaching elementary students about Oregon Trail pioneer life in another program because it is so rewarding to make history come alive for children. As a reader, I support Operation Bookshelf, which delivers library materials to those unable to travel. Assistance League is filled with conscientious members who donate hundreds of hours each year to make life easier for Lane County residents. Each Assistance League chapter creates programs that match the needs of their own communities.

In all, seven programs are funded by donations, grants and the proceeds of Gently Used, a thrift shop at 1149 Willamette Street.  Except for a part time dental assistant, this organization consists entirely of volunteers who work hard to ensure that the programs are well run and fulfill their mission to enhance lives.
Proud Ground	53117		/users/profile/54189	proudgroundhomeowner,	Client Served	5	09/22/2010	I was a renter who was eager to own my own home, but Portland's housing market was out of control, I could only afford homes way out of the way, or ones that would need lots of repairs. I liked what Proud Ground offered, a way for me to purchase a home that was the right size, and in a neighborhood that is not too far away from my work. I was delighted to be a part of something that would ensure that this opportunity would be available in the future for other home buyers.
Proud Ground	43893	7	/users/profile/44797	eralbrich	Board Member	5	06/14/2010	Proud Ground is an innovative, unique organization providing a much needed opportunity for affordable home ownership in the Portland metropolitan area and beyond. Moreover it is successful, having a zero foreclosure rate with over 115 affordable homes in Portland.  Proud Ground staff are dedicated, smart, and well-connected in the community, and I've enjoyed my time working with them while on the board.
Proud Ground	43284	5	/users/profile/44105	atlast	Client Served	5	06/08/2010	Solid, smart, innovative, successful, integrity.  These are just a few of the words I comfortably use to describe Proud Ground.  My partner and I purchased our first home with Proud Ground in 2008.  The staff made the intimidating process less confusing, worked seamlessly with our Realtor, and have continued to be a source of support and encouragement.  Our purchase has fundamentally changed our outlook for our future and we could not have done it without Proud Ground.
Proud Ground	43033	5	/users/profile/43795	giererpdxedu	Donor	5	06/04/2010	I first learned of Proud Ground in 2005 and have been a supporter ever since.  The work the organization does is foundational, essential, and crucial, I believe, for maintaining permanently affordable homes for persons and families in our community for years to come.  I am pleased to continue to support Proud Ground and eager to encourage others to do the same.
Proud Ground	43026	11	/users/profile/43793	kathy20	Donor	5	06/04/2010	I love Proud Ground. I believe that home ownership is key to a just society with a level playing field and equal opportunity. When more folks can own their own home, more folks are then interested in and able to participate in their community while achieving stability and economic growth. Proud Ground's program helps families do just that -- with the added bonus that the homes can't be bought and then "flipped", and that Proud Ground homes are always affordable.

She was a dedicated teacher and cared more about her students than any other by far.  She translated those passionate skills into this program and now is changing the lives of so many people. It's an honor to have someone so valuable in this community.  I also went to high school with one of the staff members and he is transforming lives each and every day.  I have gotten to know the other staff members and each of them have committed themselves to protecting and promoting the citizens of this community.

Not until I began volunteering as a mentor earlier this year did I observe the true depth and dedication this program offers to mentees, mentors and the community. The training and support for mentors are excellent.  While mentoring is not easy, the highly trained staff is there to prepare and accompany you every step of the way. If you have ever thought about mentoring a young person, try it through Citizens for Safe Schools!

The Feral Cat Coalition of Oregon	200726	2	/users/profile/262066	KenHick	Donor	5	05/22/2014	As the Honorary Chair at this years annual Gala/Furball, I am very proud to say that it was a pleasure to work with this organization. Their passion, dedication, and hard work is highly commendable. It was a wonderful, well organized event that was enjoyed by all who attended. It was also very successful as a fund-raiser and achieved financial goals. I reviewed an earlier comment in November of 2012 regarding shill bidding. I was confused by this posting. I have participated at many of FCCO Galas as a bidder/donor and I have never seen this behavior as it is described. These are professional events with a dual purpose to- raise funds to support the mission and to provide a fun evening for all who attend.  As the Honorary Chair for this years Gala, I was very involved with all aspects of it. I can assure anyone that this behavior of shill bidding did not take place. What did take place was a group of very generous people donated items for the gala  both silent and oral items. The attendees bid on these items with the proceeds going to fund the mission of FCCO. Certainly both the donors and staff want to see each item bring in as much money as possible, but there is very little they can do in this regard except to continually share their mission and to appeal to everyone to help and support. Unfortunately, negative comments such as this one on shill bidding can tarnish the reputation of a wonderful organization. FCCO is one of the most professional, dedicated, honest organizations I have worked with and they would never do anything as described. 
The Feral Cat Coalition of Oregon	163593	4	/users/profile/217242	AEAI	Volunteer	5	07/25/2013	I have volunteered with The Feral Cat Coalition of Oregon since about 2008. In that time I have witnessed extreme care and concern to spend donor money wisely. I have been part of the Furball Committee where we all were brining in coupons to buy supplies and reusing items which have been used for years, to save all the money we could so as much money as we raised, would go directly back to help the cats. It has been my experience that  FCCO takes their fiduciary responsibility to the donors and supporters very seriously. I wouldn't hesitate to support this organization with my time and/or money and have encouraged many others to do the same. 
The Feral Cat Coalition of Oregon	151294	3	/users/profile/201952	mentleytoews	Board Member	5	03/19/2013	I was asked to be on the board several years ago since I had experience with animal welfare in Portland.  I was absolutely amazed at what these folks can do with their budget.   The amount of cats they are able to help with such a small agency is laudable.  They use their volunteers well, expect a lot from the board, and run a professional, successful organization.  I have since moved from Portland but have only the best things to say about FCCO.  Your donations are well used.
The Feral Cat Coalition of Oregon	136758	7	/users/profile/182696	concern4catz	Volunteer	2	11/10/2012	I was have been a volunteer at the FCCO fundraising event, called  Furball. It is a large even with bidding Auctions to raise money to fix cats. I have first hand knowledge of an illegal practice that is condoned by the Board and the Director at this event. What they do at this event is call "Shill Bidding." The Board members and key people bid on items without any intent on buying the items, it is just to run up the prices for the honest bidders. I was working at the Check Out Station during the auction and a very expensive painting with a retail value of probably $1000 came through but the person who WON the item wasn't going to pay for it. The person was the Board President Kris Ellingsen. She was bidding on the item only to run up the price for the other person who was bidding and wanted the item but she bid one too many times and got stuck with the item and she wasn't going to pay for it. I volunteered again the next year and was told by this one lady that they have seen this before and that all the "insiders" know about this. The Manager/Director, Karen gives signals to people of when to bid and when to stop. I wanted to continue to volunteer at the FCCO clinics so I wrote an anonymous letter to the Board expressing my displeasure about the unethical practices and they should apologize pubically to their supporters for thier behavior. To my knowlege they haven't done this. All of this is for the animals, but do they have to stoop to illegal and unethical practices that pose a negative light on them. I think they would do fine without all the secret bidders to defraud the honest ones. It makes people wonder what else do they do that is dishonest to the public. Those two women who run the organization really need move aside. At least I want other people to know about this and found this way to review a charity. 
The Feral Cat Coalition of Oregon	103216	6	/users/profile/137283	Anne29	Client Served	5	01/11/2012	From what I've seen, the FCC of Oregon is a first-class organization. I had several strays and ferals in my neighborhood. When I chose to become their caregiver, FCC was there to help with low-cost surgery and vaccinations so these cats could be healthy and happy in a well-populated neighborhood. I was happy with their services and all the people I met who provided the services. Well done!

It will be a flying tribute to our veterans and their sacrifice for the freedom of our country.

As a young boy I remember climbing up into the aircraft and pretending to be part of the crew, pilot to gunner. As an adult I realized how important this aircraft was in the defeat of Natzi Germany. To me this aircraft symbolizes heart of all the men and women who lost their lives so I  can live free today. I volunteer my time to support the Group in its effort to preserve the history of WWII and teach it to all future generations. I want to see this aircraft fly again to be a reminder of the incredible spirit of the airmen who helped win the war.

Cat Adoption Team	191769		/users/profile/250276	Eyegal	Client Served	5	12/28/2013	I volunteered for the Cat Adoption Team from 2001-2009  (photography, writing cat bios for adoption, cleaning cages and fostering). I am very impressed with the organization of this truly No Kill shelter. Everyone there is a true animal lover. Their on-site veterinary hospital nurses ailing cats back to health and even helps the local wild animal shelter with their big cats. I fostered kittens until I adopted some of my fosters and realized I would truly become a crazy cat lady if I fostered more. I now just enjoy the wonderful cats that became my family members.  Over the years they have helped rescue several strays that I or my friends came across. They are a truly worthwhile charity that I will continue to support and promote. Sorry I'm too busy and a bit too far away to volunteer anymore.

I cannot express the immense personal satisfaction I have gained over the years.     I donate to the food bank every month to help keep people with their pets. This is a great program. Cat needs help in all capacities to continue the wonderful work of placing abandoned cats. Cat's partnership with the county shelters over the years has decreased the euthanasia rate in the Portland metro area.  If you are considering volunteering, give CAT a try!

Cat Adoption Team	99410	1	/users/profile/119401	bunnysgrandma	Donor	5	10/18/2011	Instead of birthday presents, we ask for cat food to donate to the foodbank.  We also send a monetary donation from time to time.  We love the idea that this is a no kill shelter, but that it also helps with those who are struggling with a cat food pantry so that their pets do not need to be given up or go without.  They take care of animals, try to match the cat with the right family.  Only a small percentage of donations is used for administration, the majority is put back into the shelter.   
Sustainable Northwest	106388	1	/users/profile/143673	meanusl	General Member of the Public	5	02/13/2012	I am a tribal member of the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs of Oregon.  I am curious on what kind of sustainable you do for protecting the herbs, huckleberries and other edible foods that are growing on the Reservations.  I know, we are called "stewards of the land" where we are chosen by the Elders to go dig our roots, and pick the Huckleberry that are part of our "sacred foods" to all the Native People of the NW tribes.  We have four sacred foods that are seasonal. First, salmon, second is the deer/elk and then, our roots and huckleberries as well as the chokecherries.  These are what helps us heal, that is chosen for us to provide for the winter.  And that this is what is nutritional, has proteins, and vitamins, and a lot more  healthy to our Indian people.

Big Stone Foundation	148779	2	/users/profile/198159	Clay W.,	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/31/2013	My wife & I founded the Swallows Nest Children's Homes in 2006 where we work full time with special needs orphans in Henan Province ... http://www.swallowsnestzz.org ... we first learned of Peter's work with Children in 2001 when my wife started corresponding with Peter's mother .... Peter intrigued us because he was reaching out to poor city children near the college where he taught English ... most English teachers at that time would only tutor students outside of the university for money ... Peter taught the children for free ... we were volunteer teaching at an English summer program for Home of Home Orphanage in 2002 and traveled with the owner to SIAS University for their pioneer graduation of students ... later we found and had a short meeting with Peter ... this was the start of a long friendship involving cooperation & networking with Peter in Henan China ... over the years we have continued to visit and stay in touch and I have assisted Peter with teaching and consulting work at times over the years ... and Peter has also assisted me by helping me obtain my current teaching post which I started four years ago ... always with sincere interest Peter has helped children in China ever since we have known him ... his foster daughter Alayna is a product of a child rescue from years back ... the Big Stone Foundation is the product of Peter's vision for sustaining a movement to help the people of China, especially children at risk ... whereas my wife and I work with special needs children registered in the government orphanage system ... Peter works with children who do not qualify to be cared for by the state and would just live a life of extreme poverty with no hope for education or a future ... his work provides opportunity and a future for these children in so many ways ... the reasons stated above is why we recommend Big Stone Foundation as a very wonderful charity worthy of your attention and funding ... through Peter you will have a direct effect on the life & future for many children in China ... thanks for taking time to read my recommendation ... blessings ...

Big Stone Foundation	148689	2	/users/profile/198065	nray1309	Volunteer	5	01/30/2013	In 2008 I with a group of other students visited China and worked with Big Stone China. We spent 3 weeks traveling through the Hunan province. We visited an orphanage almost daily and spent time playing and loving on some of the most beautiful joyful children I have ever met. It was there I really got to True Pure Joy! We met so many orphans who had so much PURE JOY. They had so much to be sad about: abandonment, underfed, poverty stricken, and some living with aids. But through them I came to a greater understanding that joy is truly is in the heart not in circumstances. That we are so loved by our heavenly Father; Peter had spent time loving on these kids and sharing Gods love for them they were filled with it. A matter of fact they filled us with their love and joy. I reflect back on my 3 weeks in China as one of the most impactful times in my life. And am thankful Big Stone China was the organization that led me to this experience 
Big Stone Foundation	148596	2	/users/profile/197872	megan.schuster7	Volunteer	4	01/28/2013	I have just recently gotten involved with this wonderful charity and have been able to see and experience first hand the great work they are doing not only to better the lives or orphans or underprivileged children but to help whole impoverished communities around China.  I have found their can-do attitude to be uplifting.  I look forward to being involved with this group for years to come.

Big Stone Foundation	148567	3	/users/profile/197817	ChefBrad	Volunteer	4	01/27/2013	This is not my first experience with Big Stone China.  I have worked with them on and off since 2008. When my interest in China first began to develop, I was looking for ways to be involved in changing people's lives. What I later found after my first, (and subsequent) experiences with Big Stone, was that not only did I help to change the lives of others, but that my life was changed as well.  The staff, volunteer coordinators, drivers, Everyone, was wonderful to work with, pleasant, happy to have us there, and very accommodating.  They worked hard to make sure that we had the right balance of sight seeing and service projects included, and kept the cost of our trip / work camp very, very affordable. I can't wait to enjoy our next experience with Big Stone, probably coming in 2013!
Options Counseling and Family Services	305087		/users/profile/396311	NoOneOfConsequence	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/16/2016	I have volunteered and worked with several non-profits through the years and after this experience, I don't think I would ever have it any other way."Be the Change you wish to see in the world" they say... well at Options, I see it happen daily.  Respect is held at the forefront of everything we do.  I see the management respecting the employees and clients.  I see the providers respecting the clients and the challenges that they face.  I see opportunities provided for individuals who are so used to being told no.  People whether employees or clients are finding hope in these halls and I am thrilled to be a part of it.

Options Counseling and Family Services	305026		/users/profile/396230	willowssk	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/16/2016	I have worked for several community mental health non-profits over the last 10 years and I have never been so happy than when I accepted a position at Options Counseling.  The culture of Options is so different than most other places I have worked.  Other places I have worked have the use, abuse, burn out, throw away mentality with their staff.   Options mentality is to take care of their employees so they in turn can give the best care to the clients.  I have worked in two different regions and have found that culture is fairly the same in regards to being supportive of you.  They want to help you achieve your goals as best they can.  The supervisors, regional directors, CEO, and COO work on continually creating an environment in which you never want to leave.

I have worked in many fields over the years and for many different companies.  My experience with Options has been incredible.   The way that the management works with the staff sets a tone that carries all the way through the organization.  The process that we just recently went through to develop or mission statement was  incredibly collaborative.  it encouraged input from staff at every level of the organization and all input was valued with the same weight.I believe that Options Counseling strives to follow our mission statement, providing an amazing place to work.  Even though I am not directly in contact with our clients I feel that the work I do provides the support to those who are directly impacting the health and well being of our clients and community.It is a honor to work with everyone at options.     
Options Counseling and Family Services	304946		/users/profile/396153	therapist1	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/15/2016	I work for Options and would not want to be anywhere else.

Leadership is mindful of their employees and not only want  you to be successful, but give you the tools to get there.I have seen lives changed here. I am thankful to be along for the journey.
Rogue Valley Humane Society	198411		/users/profile/259128	Pebbles79	Volunteer	5	04/20/2014	I have seen a major turn around with Rogue Valley Humane Society in the past 8 years for the positive. The facility has improved their standard of care to such a level that the animals are more healthy both mind and body. I have worked with the staff as both a volunteer and a CVT and am so impressed with their  willingness to learn and make what ever changes necessary to improve their facility. The staff and volunteers are a great group of individuals and their dedication to the animals is most admirable. I have also seen a marked improvement in reaching out to the community and offering programs such as low cost spaying and neutering, dogs without chains, critter champ to name a few. In closing I would just like to say that I am very proud to be a part RVHS and look forward working with them in the future. 
Rogue Valley Humane Society	198005	1	/users/profile/258693	lovesdogs	Board Member	5	04/16/2014	 It has been about 3 years since I became a volunteer at the Rogue Valley Humane Society (RVHS) in Grants Pass, Oregon.  They are a no-kill, 501(c) (3) non-profit animal care facility.  Over the years I have watched SO many homeless and abused dogs, cats, kittens, and puppies come to RVHS scared, underweight and traumatized.  They leave RVHS happy and healthy excited to be a treasured member of their new loving family.  The dedication of the staff and volunteers is nothing less than phenomenal.  No and cant arent words in their vocabulary.  They feel that the standard of care for the animals is most important.  By the amount of hand licks and purring going on around here tells you that the animals know they are loved. If there is an injured dog alone in a field needing help, he gets that help. Dogs and cats in hoarding situations are rescued, medically treated, rehabilitated and given a new chance to become loved. Senior dogs and cats with no one and no place to go can come to RVHS and get the care they deserve.  Puppies thrown away in garbage dumpsters are brought to RVHS and given the love and care they need to live. I can truly say that RVHS is the best animal care facility around and we are fortunate to have them in our town! I am now a proud board member of RVHS and continue to see first hand what incredible, heroic things happen at RVHS.  Our community depends on us to keep these animals safe.  We are their voice.  Sometimes they just need a chance and RVHS gives them that chance, without question.  Go team RVHS!!
Rogue Valley Humane Society	96222	5	/users/profile/112006	Diane Mead	Volunteer	5	08/21/2011	My husband and I both volunteer at RVHS and we are rewarded in too many ways to count. The love, committment, caring and unending sweat and tears that this shelter and it's employees and volunteers give is phenominal. I have never witnessed a place such as this. It has expanded my hearts vocabulary to know what unconditional love is.From the first time we went to RVHS we were hooked by the caring individuals who take love these animals and in the process they    encourage love and tolerance in the human factor. God bless you RVHS!!
Rogue Valley Humane Society	94934	4	/users/profile/50255	doglover1	Volunteer	5	08/03/2011	In the last year the Rogue Valley Humane Society (RVHS) has participated in over 8 major rescues of cats and dogs.  Many of the owners contacted RVHS because of illness or are overwhelmed by numbers of animals that they have.  We rescued 7 orphaned pups in Dec 2010 whose mom was shot and killed.  All of the pups survived and have been adopted into loving homes.  We have rescued over 115 cats from hoarding situations.  Recently we rescued 8 puppies near death  found in our local Walmart dumpster! They all lived and have been adopted.   Watch for us on Animal Planet's new program Confessions: Animal Hoarding in Sept or Oct to see us during one of our rescues.   We have started a Chained Dog Project and have gotten our first dog off of her chain (she had a padlock around her neck too).  We are completing our 2nd one this week where there are 2 chained dogs.   WATCH THE PUPPY CAM- they are so cute.  Go to this website: www.thedailycourier.com   Click on the Critter Cam on left side of page. No donation is too small to help our animals.   OUr website:  rvhs-or.org    Check out our videos too.

Rogue Valley Humane Society	49006	2	/users/profile/50255	doglover1	Volunteer	5	08/01/2010	The Rogue Valley Humane Society in Grants Pass, Oregon is a NO-Kill, nonprofit animal shelter.From the first time I went to the shelter I found the most caring staff members.  And it shows with the cats and dogs that are living there.First off, it was SO clean and cheery everywhere.  It had to be the best smelling shelter I have ever been in. When you go into the dog kennels you see wagging tails and smiling faces.  It is the same thing when you go into one of the cat rooms - friendly and ready to snuggle cats and kittens.The staff and volunteers are devoted to the animals in their care. It really shows!If you EVER thought about donating to an organization that protects animals this is the one for you.  Check out their online website:  rvhs-or.org and you can see it first hand.  If you get a chance to see The Truman Fund video on their facebook page get some kleenex out. It does have happy ending! All I can say is they are the BEST!  I am proud to be a volunteer of this great organization.  If you are ever in Grants Pass come for a visit!  You will be so glad you did.
United States Mission Corporation	262198	4	/users/profile/350874	Writer	Client Served	5	10/07/2015	My girlfriend and I were homeless after both of us lost our jobs. The U.S. Mission in San Jose gave us the opportunity to get off the streets and stay together. We are not criminals, we were just people who had some bad luck and needed help. It's been over 7 years since we left the Mission and now my wife and I are still together. She is starting her own company and I'm in the electrical union with our own place to live. Thank you U.S. Mission and thank you Michael.

The residents get along very well, you can always feel the chemistry. It"s a very friendly environment. What"s more? It"s  clean!

United States Mission Corporation	121401	17	/users/profile/165184	stphnigo	Client Served	1	08/25/2012	To whom it may concern, I have recently had the misfortune of staying at the Portland Oregon United States Mission. I intend to be brief here but I also intend to be direct. As stated the misfortune I encountered at the Mission began on Tue. August,14 2012 when I entered as a resident/member. Beginning on Wed. August 15, I started training as a door to door fundraiser as is customary at U.S. Mission.  On this same date one of the roommates in the room of five men that I was assigned asked me, in private, if I had noticed any "itchiness" because he was experiencing some. The conversation led to discussing mosquito bites we may have gotten in the evening while waiting to be picked up from our assigned areas but the conversation also referenced a situation, previous to my arrival, where a member/resident had needed treatment for what was described as scabies.  Sadly you may be able to see where this comment is headed. Within the course of seven nights while sleeping on my assigned bed I was covered with welts. As I am writing this I have more than fifty welts, many over an inch in diameter & at least one that protrudes a half inch, most have broken the skin leaving my immune system at risk in a high use environment as this particular Mission goes through over 300 men a year as stated by the House Manager. Quite honestly it is not the bug bites, whatever speices they are, that prompts this review of the Portland Oregon United States Mission. I am an extremely durable person in good health so I'm confident I will be fine. I thoroughly understand the nature of residential situations & accept that contagion goes with the territory. See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BedbugWhat prompts this comment is the handling of this situation by the staff. After due consideration when I had eliminated all other sources of exposure to skin irritants & was sure that my assigned mattress was the culprit I reported my pain to the staff member who had assigned me the bed. He became defensive & acussatory, stating, "I don't believe you. I think it is mosquitoes".  He also said "I don't have any place else to put you". This statement is most troubling because we had actually been out recruiting for new member/residents that day because there were two beds open. He also asked me not to say anything to the other member/residents about this subject, stating "the last time it caused a panic" a statement which seems to belie his denial of any problem. I slept that night in the back yard wondering how the previous person who had reportedly had scabies left. The following day, Thursday August 23 I left after raising a total of $536.85 by my count through door to door solicitation. To finish up here I only want to point out that what we have here is the same tired story that has contaminated much of the social service sector. Having worked in that sector it is easy to recognize the scapegoating of vulnerable people to avoid the effort & expense of offering a quality service. In light of the fact that on my last day there among the 13 men seeking donations there was over $1600.00 collected it seems to me they could maintain a hygienic facility of at least promptly correct it upon learning there was a problem. In closing I want to say this organization has a valuable place & a great potential but it is limited by the people who operate it. Sincerely, Stephen D. Igo Mental Health Consumer AdvocateCertified Peer Support Specialist  Addendum 8/25/2012I am attaching all communication I have received  to date. Note it does not include an apology. Further communication with the United States Mission will be posted here in an ongoing effort to make sure that the disrespect with which I was treated does not happen to the next man in line.usmissionsg@q.com Thank you for your comments. We are looking into this matter. Brian Jones, Secretary-GeneralUNITED STATES MISSION CORPORATION

When I finally got there I was utterly blown away. This place is amazing.This is a world-class mineral museum, overflowing with of some of the most beautiful mineral specimens I've ever seen. A single visit isn't enough time to appreciate everything they have to offer. I will be back again and again, and I regret waiting so long to see it the first time!(And the house is pretty cool, too!)

I've been to tour the museum and to some of their annual events, and always my children come away having had an enjoyable time.  They don't even realize that they are learning.  Makes you appreciate what a wondrous world we live in.  The staff is knowledgeable and friendly, and will patiently answer many pestering questions from kids.  I can't recommend this hidden "gem" enough.
Rice Northwest Museum of Rocks and Minerals	320430	2	/users/profile/412925	DennyD	General Member of the Public	5	12/22/2016	I've been here with school groups and alone and it never fails to impress!  The collection is stunning; mind-blowing, really!    It is truly a not-to-miss place just minutes outside of Portland.  Worth the trip.  In addition to the exhibits and interesting film, they have picnic tables, so it's a great place to spend part of the day.  The building is interesting, too, and if you admire collectors and collections of any type you will certainly love the RIce Museum!

Not only have I accomplished my two original goals, but I've been trained to fully support nonprofits through fund development, event planning, marketing, member relations and so much more!  I am also able to volunteer with amazing community organizations that truly impact the Portland community.  My experience with the JLP has been nothing but exceptional.  If you are a Portland-area woman looking to make an impact and expand your volunteer capabilities, the JLP is the place to be!
Artist Mentorship Program	29616	8	/users/profile/30625	ellen2	Volunteer	5	02/21/2010	Absolultely impressive and stunning.  I learned about AMP through a co-worker when I was struggling to find funds to help two of my students gain access to an art program that was extremely cost-prohibitive.  AMP rallied behind the cause and together we raised over $5000 to pay their tuition, room and board for the summer, they now have art portfolios that they have taken to college review days - and the colleges are liking what they see and offering them money.  AMP was a HUGE stepping stone in the lives of these two young men, a huge stepping stone toward a future that may not otherwise have materialized.  Support the magic that AMP produces for the lives of at-risk and homeless youth - I support them fully!!
Artist Mentorship Program	29262	1	/users/profile/30292	millie1	Board Member	5	02/19/2010	I have supported this non profit for a few years now, and as I do so remotely, living in the United Kingdom I keep abreast of their program via updated emails and facebook. The british music industry supports this non profit and many working musicians have pledged their affiliation with AMP. Rehabilitating at risk youth through the arts is a task that should not go unrecognised. Keep up the good work!
Artist Mentorship Program	29185	8	/users/profile/30223	amberjohatt	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/19/2010	I worked with homeless and at risk youth for a decade and by the time I moved on in my career I had a firm understanding of what it takes to help these kids succeed. Homeless youth's basic needs being met is important but what gives them the drive to one day meet their own needs is purpose. Artist Mentorship Program, "AMP", provides the perfect setting for a youth to derive purpose in their lives. A kid gets to learn and experiment with creating their own music and art and they are taught by real artists and musicians. AMP builds self esteem in youth who have very little to show for themselves and very few positive experiences to brag about. I have referred youth from my current work to AMP and they have thrived in the setting. I donate money to AMP because it is a unique resource offering an experience in the art world that is usually only accessible to the privileged.
Artist Mentorship Program	29054	1	/users/profile/30093	tristanlemons	Donor	5	02/18/2010	Artist Mentorship Program is one of those amazing programs where, after you hear the mission statement, you think, "BRILLIANT!".  Homeless youth are in situations that can be very complicated and often need guidance, support and information.  AMP allows homeless youth a structured, supportive environment where youth can make/learn music from talented, professional musical mentors.  It is one of those rare marriages of theory and practice; both the mentors and the youth express how lucky they are to have a safe place to BE to express themselves musically.As a small business owner in this crazy economic time, I wish I could make quarterly (significant) donations to AMP.  I do what I can, when I can, but AMP needs more support.Please help support homeless youth in Portland have a safe place to learn to be themselves in this insane world.  It only takes one small gesture of kindness sometimes to make a significant difference in someone's life.

My Voice Music	275385	1	/users/profile/364999	cekberg	Board Member	5	01/02/2016	I have been involved with MVM in many ways and truly value what it offers the youth in our community. One of my favorite programs is the Rock camps, specifically the week long summer offerings. For children in the foster care system, this is a free opportunity for them to learn instruments, gain confidence and be around others who are in similar situations. I have been honored to hear from DHS workers, foster parents and family members the changes they have seen in their children. I can't speak more highly of My Voice Music!
My Voice Music	175264	2	/users/profile/231599	crash41	Advisor	5	10/08/2013	Being a musician myself I understand the affect that music has on a person.  Growing up shy and introverted, I used music to help express myself.  It was an outlet that I was grateful to have.  Kids these days have so much more influencing their lives and decisions - it's so important to have the opportunity to provide another form of expression.

Camper families  are not charged.  You are  welcomed with open arms and acceptance.  You are treated just like a "normal typical" family and ALL of the kids participate  in ALL of the activities.  Parents can sit and soak in  seeing the smiles and joy on their children's faces when they are  on a horse,  riding a jet ski,  playing in the river,  etc.  It's truly a  wonderful  life changing camp for  families that have a child with a special  need.  It has been a true blessing to our daughter,  our family and the joy and love we have felt while there is... Well..  fills our hearts and soul.  Camp Attitude  is truly a blessing.

His t-shirts from camp are the only clothes he wants to wear.  He is accepted and is able to do things that would be very difficult in other settings.It is wonderful to have a camp that is designed for every member of the family, since he is too medically fragile to go to a camp without me and would be unable to attend another type of camp. Because of the buddy system, he has independence from me and gains a new best friend every year.We all love going and support the mission of Camp Attitude!
Camp Attitude-Oregon Inc	214896		/users/profile/278217	Diane121	Client Served	5	09/12/2014	Camp Attitude is a wonderful not for profit camp for people with disabilities and their families. They don't charge the families to attend. Instead, those who come and volunteer to be buddies or work at the camp are the ones who pay to be there. That is the money they use to allow the families to attend for free. It is a 5 day camp where those with disabilities are allowed to just be "normal". They have a lake day where they can jet ski, tube, take boat rides and just have fun. The offer activities like laser tag and horseback riding. It is just a place to not see the disability but see the person. If it weren't for this camp, my daughter would never have been able to attend a camp. We love Camp Attitude, the people and the whole mission of "having the attitude as that of Jesus Christ."

Minimal fuss, total dedication to the project at hand, and the ability to communicate in a real manner to real people about real things. That sounds silly, but in a world that often seems full of smoke and mirrors, the real deal is a refreshing and welcome encounter.

Clean Forest Project Inc	65094		/users/profile/71156	Nature Walker	Volunteer	5	02/08/2011	Clean Forest Project is a worth while volunteer project focusing on the clean up illegal dump sites in the Josephine, Douglas, Jackson, Klamath and surrounding counties for the aspect of sharing in nature the belief in giving back to nature what has been disrespected by illegal dumping, RESPECT. It is quite enjoyable to give back to nature by giving a little time and effort of oneself through the ties and bonds of members that believe as you do in conservation and respect of our public and private lands.   At one of these such events, I realized the need for this worthy organization's growth to be funded by hard work ethics and contributions made by local community members surrounding these areas.  Anderson Butte Clean Up Project entailed many CFP members coming together early one Saturday morning to share in cleaning up an illegal dump site in the mountains on the outskirts of Medford Oregon. I was amazed at the turn out of so many people that felt as I had my entire life about illegal dumping in our beautiful forest lands. Many came with trucks and used their own gas to take dump site materials to land fills and recycling places in the local area where they should of gone in the first place. It was amazing to see how little time it took for so many members to clean up such a large dump site as the one I had seen upon my arrival that morning. It is through the efforts of Clean Forest Project's staff that these events are organized to such a perfection. They deserve to be funded, respected and honored for their hard work and commitments to making a difference in the world we all share.

This is very frustrating to see and I am so thankful for organizations like CFP that clean these areas up so we can enjoy nature without the trash.  I think this is an important service to keep our environment clean and SAFE from health hazards and unsightly trash.  Thanks to all the workers and volunteers of CFP!

Not only have they cleaned up over 460,000 pounds of garbage from Oregon and Northern California forests in the last 3 years, they have also reached thousands of kids with their comprehensive education program. A very worth-while cause, indeed!

She has been helping them clean up Southern Oregon for the last year. I decided to join her in a project up at Anderson Butte, and was plesantly suprised at what a  wonderful group of people that I met. They all showed up on a Saturday to help clean up our forest, and support this cause. With all the volunteers we had it only took about 90 minutes to clean up 3500 pounds of trash. It was a great experience, and I definitely plan on continuing to contribute to this great cause.
The Portland Ballet	133470	1	/users/profile/179194	Lisa162	Volunteer	5	11/04/2012	We started our daughter at The Portland Ballet seven years ago when she was four.  We left for two years for a more convenient studio, then realized what we were missing and returned to TPB.  I know several other families that have transferred in for the special place that is The Portland Ballet.  The nurturing atmosphere and many opportunities to grow and perform are wonderful.  But where they go above and beyond is in their outreach to the community.  Their programs to introduce ballet to underserved communities and kids (like the cancer patients) who might not be otherwise able to meet a real ballerina.

The Portland Ballet	130341	2	/users/profile/175812	robin2343	Volunteer	5	10/27/2012	There are so many schools for ballet training available to the general public and so few offer the quality and care The Portland Ballet provides. This is truly a school where a child can develop a life-long love of movement and the arts, train to become a professional dancer or an educated ballet patron, or have their lives enriched through the self-discipline and careful guidance TPB teachers provide. It is a pleasure watching TPB dancers grow and develop as students, as performers, as people.

The young dancers respond well to this expectation of excellence, set in an environment that is disciplined yet caring and compassionate.  TPB dancers are motivated by multiple opportunities each year to perform in professionally-produced, public productions.  Inspired by the beauty and athleticism of ballet, they strive to do their best on stage.  The habits learned in studio and on stage translate into achievement, confidence and a sense of community in every aspect  of their lives.

Oregon Outback Humane Society	100774		/users/profile/124608	alexav	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/17/2011	I am a Veterinary Technician, a profession that is rewarding in more ways than one, but a profession that can literally break your heart in two.  I began working in an animal hospital in high school and at that time our small community has no humane society to speak of.  Stray dogs and cats came in daily and often in groups of two or more.  We did our best, and so did our small community, but with zero funds and just not enough homes to go around, we were forced to euthanize countless strays.  There were days the staff would all be in tears, knowing there was just not enough resources to do the right thing.  It was out of our hands.I went off to college and later returned to the same animal hospital in the same small community.  But things had changed; a small group of volunteers had formed Oregon Outback Humane Society and despite their small number big things were happening.  At first the number of strays had not changed, but now we were not having to euthanize.  Once it was determined there was no owner, these animals were being spayed and neutered and were being adopted in the community or being shipped all over Oregon to be matched with a new family.  And in my three years at this hospital the number of strays that came through our doors drastically dropped. And not only were we not seeing as many strays, but owners were being financially assisted with spaying and neutering their own pets.  Oregon Outback Humane Society has done wonders for the animals and animal lovers in our small town.  And not to mention this Vet. Tech. who doesnt get her heart broken nearly as often!
Oregon Outback Humane Society	100751		/users/profile/124515	DJ Marshall	Volunteer	5	11/17/2011	With no financial assistance from local County or City Municipalities, Oregon Outback Humane Society is an all fostern all volunteer organization, there is no shelter. Volunteers work endlessly after their day jobs, to educate, promote spay/neuter, assist pet owners with low or no incomes with food, spay neuter options and outreach regarding behavior, training and tips to help keep pets in the home. Board members and volunteers spend many hours a week returning phone calls and checking emails regarding lost pets, animals who's owners want to surrender them and always, problem solving/the challenge of feral and stray cats.All funding comes from donations, fundraising (cleaning restrooms, Holiday Fairs, Community events, such as the Mutt Strutt and Feline Festival)  and an occasional grant applilcation. Newsletters and donation letters are sent out regularly to keep the community, adopters and donors informed on the status, needs and accomplishments of the small non profit organization. Regular adoption events take place monthly at a neighboring county three hours from Lakeview, as the chances of finding pets forever homes are greater in a larger city.Although the work is endless, the challenges are stressful and the situations can be chaotic, the end result...happier, healthier, altered animals. Oregon Outback Humane Society is the first animal rescue organization in the largest, lowest populated, highest poverty rate county in the state of Oregon. The need is endless for people and their pets.
Oregon Outback Humane Society	100735		/users/profile/124411	Tessa T.	Volunteer	5	11/17/2011	Oregon Outback Humane Society (OOHS) receives no funding from any government agency. All funding for this organization comes from fundraising activities and donations. OOHS is run by a handful of highly dedicated volunteers who run all aspects of the organization. Unlike many 501c3 groups, 100% of donations goes to benefit animals in Lake County, Oregon.  I have been an OOHS volunteer for approximately four years and have been continually impressed with the innovation and dedication of OOHS volunteers. The only real criticism that I have about this organization is that many of the board members don't actively participate OOHS programs. An organization as small as OOHS needs all the volunteers it can get. In my opinion, the board members need to step up and help run the programs for which they make decisions.
Oregon Outback Humane Society	100732		/users/profile/124398	Martina K.	Board Member	4	11/17/2011	In an area where no other options exist, OOHS  has made significant strides to making Lake County a place where no animal need be homeless.  By focusing on the proactive solutions, the number of stray dogs and cats is decreasing. Through Targeted TNR, community cat numbers are on the decline and the quality of life of the community cats that are here is improving.  Pet Food Share and Companion Animal Spay Neuter are keeping pets where they belong, in the home they already have. Foster and Adoption programs and partnerships throughout the state of Oreogn and beyond are giving more homeless a second chance. We are fortunate to see daily what other organizations that have existed for a long time no longer have memory of, the palpable positive changes that take place when opportunity arises. In an area where there are no shelter statistics (because there are no shelters) you can see the change first hand every time you look around. Less stray dogs, less community cats, companion animals that are well fed, fewer and fewer free puppy and kitten signs at the local grocery store, people telling you how much nicer there neighborhood is since we started a Targeted TNR Program. You don't need to see numbers to know there has been a change for the better. We have watched it happen. We hear it from people everyday. So now, after five years, we find ourselves where other communities have been for quite some time. Trying to find the answers to why, with all the resources we make available to pets and people, we are still not there. Why we occasionally get the call about someones cat having kittens, see the sign at Safeway for free puppies, get a call about a stray dog. Sure, these instances are fewer than at the beginning , but that they still exist means we still have a lot of work to do. It means our job is not done Now, we look to other organizations for direction as we struggle to find the solution. Organizations that have are or have been in the position we find ourselves. We picked the low hanging fruit and are challenged to reach higher.  Now we are going to need a ladder, someone to hold it for us and possibly a stick to reach further, I know we do not have all the answers yet, but we are determined to keep looking.  Our situation (remote location, remote individual communities and a community where financial resources are few) adds complexity. It makes it necessary for us to be more creative, to have better problem solving skills. We can reject the "you can't" because we already  have done so much more than so many thought was possible in our community.  I truly believe we can make Lake County a community where no pet need be homeless. It is not going to be easy, but it can happen. We need to make sure we don't just pat ourselves on the back for what we have accomplished, we need to keep reaching, to never be satisfied.

Six months ago I took on the task of writing a five year strategic and funding plan that has since been adopted by the board. Our goal was to laser focus our volunteers and limited resources to continue to provide excellent care for the equines in our care now and forever through a number of Legacy programs and fundraising. As an all volunteer run organization it is important to know 100% of all funding received goes directly to the horses. We take care of a lot of horses with little, we know how to stretch a dime but never at the expense of our horses! I could not be more proud to assist this great organization in its 10th year of providing for the horses, mules and donkey's of Central Oregon! Adopt don't shop! cyndi
Equine Outreach, Inc.	146789	2	/users/profile/193779	AFriend	Donor	5	12/15/2012	Feeding and caring for over 100 horses is not an easy task. The horses have no where else to be. My wife and I have made donations and volunteered at the horse rescue ranch and feel that it was and is time and money well spent. At EOI (Equine Outreach, Inc), it is all about the horses: rescuing them and providing the best care for them until they can be adopted. Many of them come in malnourished and requiring medical attention. Some have been abused. All are fed and provided quality medical care and humane training. The goal is to get the horses healthy and trained and find them permanent homes. It takes a core group of dedicated volunteers and management, many others who volunteer when they can. and a lot of donations. Seeing our favorite horse, which had come in hungry and afraid of people, find a new loving home, was both tough (seeing her go) and a blessing (knowing that she had a good home). We are proud to be part of it.

Eastern Oregon Renewable Energies Association	89264		/users/profile/35429	kb7rhi	Volunteer	5	05/26/2011	Do you have questions about solar power, wind power, alternative energy? The Solwest alternative energy fair is full of classes for an entire weekend. Four different classrooms with experts in their fields giving you practical information. Venders also attend and answer your questions about products you are looking for. This event is held in John Day, Oregon and is geared for the entire family. Come and campout at the Grant County Fair Grounds, or stay in a nice motel nearby. Come away with lots of information that will expand your understanding of alternative energy. I felt like a sponge just drinking up the information from so many experts.
Eastern Oregon Renewable Energies Association	34570	8	/users/profile/35429	kb7rhi	Volunteer	5	04/03/2010	Eastern Oregon Renewable Energies is involved in energy fairs, green education and hands on workshops involving renewable energy and green construction. I participated in two workshops and have also attend the Solwest renewable energy fair several times. One workshop was an introduction to the design and installation of a net-metered grid-tied 2000 watt PV system that also had battery back-up.  This system could serve as a stand-alone power system for the home during power outages. During the 3 day long workshop the instructors presented information about system design, component selection, electric code compliance, installation safety and system operation. Each day we would have classroom instruction and then hands on installation time.  Each workshop participant received a detailed notebook that outlined information on the system with several supporting articles for reference.The other workshop followed the same professional pattern with notebook, classroom time and hands-on participation. This workshop involved the removal of an outdated solar hot water system and placement of a new solar hot water system. The business owner was very welcoming of the group and the system was completed and each of us participants watched the gauges we installed that showed the gpm flow rate and temperature of the water going into the holding tank. I found the hands on format to be the best learning experience that I have ever had.

I had worked in Solar Energy before, so this was a natural for me.  I enjoyed the small town atmosphere of John Day, as well as the surrounding natural beauty of Grant County.  But, most of all it's the fair goers who camp in the orchard each year that keep me coming back.  The camaradaderie that exists between folks who share an interest in renewable energy and sustainable lifestyles is fantastic.  And, we all share knowledge and skills through workshops that bring those good folks together on specific topics.  After the workshops, the social gathering continues in the orchard with potluck food and spirits.  Relaxed conversation ensues late into the evenings with much brainstorming and networking among folks with shared intersts.

Lord Leebrick Theatre Company	32290	8	/users/profile/33082	nancyhopps	Professional with expertise in this field	5	03/02/2010	Having played roles as an actor and audience member at LLTC since its inception, I appreciate this company's unique and valuable niche in the community. The choices of thought-provoking, relevant and entertaining plays, and the consistent quality of acting set Lord Leebrick apart from others' offerings. Its loyal supporter base is a testament to this. As an actor, I've been fortunate to have been in a number of West coast premiere, and/or original productions that played to sold out houses. Two Shakespeare productions I was involved in were held over and hailed as "the way the Bard would have wanted it done" and "at least as good as anything seen at regional repertory theaters", such as Ashland Shakespeare Festival. LLTC balances new, risky material with familiar pieces of substance, continuing to challenge actors, directors and other crew members, as well as theater-goers looking for an entertaining, stimulating evening of live theater. THey also offer a variety of community outreach programs, . Previously, I taught youth acting, through their summer and after-school programs, including working with at-risk teens. The results were heartwarming.
Lord Leebrick Theatre Company	32264	6	/users/profile/33056	eechace	Professional with expertise in this field	5	03/02/2010	I have been a regular audience member for many years. A "flex Pass" holder. I served on the Board of Directors. I have acted in several productions. I have participated in many of the adult acting, voice, movement classes. LLTC is consistently voted "the best" small theatre company in Eugene, OR, by the readers of the very popular Eugene Weekly newspaper. I find it exciting to be next to that kind of creative energy that strives to produce plays that are current, intellectually stimulating, dealing with real issues, above the ordinary stuff usually performed by the typical community theatre. After closing Sarah Ruhl's, The Clean House, last season, I was at the gymand a young woman asked me, "were you in Clean House?" I said I was. She told me that she had recently moved to Eugene from New York City, and it was a great thrill for her to realize that she could still enjoy great theatre outside of the big city.
Holt International Childrens Services Inc	189723	1	/users/profile/247662	AdoptDad	Client Served	4	12/02/2013	Holt is a reputable adoption agency started in the 1950's in South Korea during the war. For many years Korean families would not adopt children outside of their immediate families. With so many children having American GI fathers in the 1950's, Holt was formed to bring these children to the U.S. This continued for a number of years, but has slackened in recent times as the Korean people have opened up to adopting children outside of their families.  Holt continues to operate an orphanage in Korea for children with special needs. The agency offers tours to families -- like ours -- who have adopted children from Korea, so these young adults can learn about their birth country. Holt operates summer camps for adopted children, too. The agency has expanded to other countries and provides services to keep children in their lands of their birth.  Our experience with Holt after over 30 years is quite satisfactory. Holt has nothing to do with enslaving children or other nonsense you may read here. It is far better for a child to have a home than to grow up on the streets where they can (and will) fall into trouble.  As mentioned, Holt not only sponsors adoptions, but also runs orphanages and counseling services for pregnant mothers to keep keep families intact.  Don't put stock in random, negative internet postings from people who don't know what they are talking about.  If you want to know about a group such as Holt, do your own research and talk to people who know what they are talking about. D.J. Iowa
Holt International Childrens Services Inc	164643	8	/users/profile/218820	adoptiontraffic	Professional with expertise in this field	1	08/11/2013	Holt is known for taking babies from the poor and giving babies to the rich.  Started out in Korea, taking babies from vulnerable mothers, preaching to them how God will save them if they just hand over their child, labeling them as 'orphans' and developing a system to continue white collar child trafficking and getting away with this crime while making huge amounts of profits for their CEOs and staff.  They have manipulated their way around the globe, taking children in strategic ways according to the countries and creating 'paper orphans', to meet the Western demand.  They also create the demand by photolisting children who still have families and are not truly orphans.  If you do the research you will see how manipulative these adoption agencies are.  It is a spiritual crime for these people to do this.  They have manipulated the world with their advertisements. Holt owns the orphanages and recruit children to the harvesting homes so there is enough supply to meet the demand.

We have been involved with Holt for only 3 months, but in that short time we have fallen in love with our sponsored child from Vietnam.  Every week we take an offering for her and send it in at the end of the month.  So far the church has not had to make up any of the difference yet.  I am pleased with the frequent update letters that we receive about our sponsored child as well.  It's nice to know where your support money is going and what percentage is being allocated.  I was told by a Holt Employee at WinterJam that 80% of your donation goes toward the child you choose to support and around 20% is administrative.

Dignity Village	82921		/users/profile/91699	Shade	Client Served	4	03/22/2011	Having lived there myself for 4 years, I found Dignity Village to be a blessing.  I can't speak for everyone that lives there as people come and go as they better there lives, and move on with it.  I can speak from my own words, and feeling , I could of lived on the streets, with no shelter, in the rain, cold , and been wet, dirty,  hungry,   or Have a roof over my head, been dry, warm, and was able to shower , and have clean closes to wear everyday,  What would you do?  giving these opportunity.   Not everyone is perfect, some need help, which isn't all ways available to people on the streets.  People at the village help each other, some  do fall back wards , but all you can do is help them forward again .  I know as a rule , Controlling  interest in a human life is a had task. You give the best , in hopes that with guidance they will change.  I personally seen many homeless people come to dignity village and better there own lives. Its not an easy road , as some have said, but without  the village many of the people  who have changed there lives , may of not gotten the chance, that Dignity Village offers the homeless that come in off from the streets.  Yes these are people that have had no place to go for the help they need to turn there own lives around . I am blessed Dignity Village was there for me when I need a place to go to.

Heartland Humane Society	43129	6	/users/profile/43913	karalee	Volunteer	5	06/06/2010	I recently started volunteering at Heartland Humane Society and am extremely impressed by the way in which the animals are treated.  Not only are they given a clean, safe environment, but they are also given lots of love and stimulation.  It's a wonderful shelter and I feel very lucky to volunteer their every week.
Heartland Humane Society	40112	6	/users/profile/41042	kate11	Volunteer	5	05/23/2010	I LOVE this place!! I have trouble leaving when my shift is over ~ sometimes I wish I lived closer and didn't have anything else to do.  For the past four years, I have been fortunate to volunteer with Heartland's cats and dogs, and for over a year, I have also served on the Board, for an entirely different view of the organization.  It has been the most rewarding volunteer experience of my life, due in large part to the excellent staff.  The whole staff, especially Director Andrea Thornberry, have consistently made me feel respected, needed, and appreciated.  I have seen them make difficult decisions about how to best help a particular animal, and how to re-direct volunteer efforts which were not appropriate.  The challenge of triage for limited resources and unlimited need is met with an effective blend of reason, passion, creativity, and long-range planning.  Efforts to establish an 'Open Paw' environment which nourishes and socializes cats and dogs with stimulating human contact several times a day, have led to calmer animals, less barking, cleaner kennels, and animals becoming 'adoptable' more quickly. One of the most rewarding experiences I have personally had is the preparation of a special photo album which tells the story of a major rescue of over 90 dogs from a local hoarder.  Many happy endings finally resulted for those dogs, and the public is often moved to donate their time, money, or talents when they see the stories.
Heartland Humane Society	40084	7	/users/profile/41018	mattandresen	Board Member	5	05/22/2010	Heartland Humane Society and its Executive director Andrea have been amazing!  The advances they have made in humane education have gone unnoticed for too long!  I don't think the Corvallis community has yet understood the difference they are making and how important donation continue to be.  Kudos to anyone involved with this organization!!!  The women that I serve on the board with, take passion to a new level.  Their empowerment is so strong it empowers the men.  I joke with my lady friends a lot about how much tougher it is being a woman and how glad I am a gent, but being involved with Heartland changes that type of thinking.  Through humane education and other programs, girls everywhere are looking forward to being woman and continuing to fight the fight for animals everywhere.

They ask a lot of questions and follow up several times to make sure you and your pet are doing well.  I adopted a small dog who had come from a shelter in CA.  She was never properly socialized with other dogs and had some issues.  The shelter gave me a lot of good suggestions and told me I could return the dog to them if I felt I could not keep her.  She was so sweet and adorable that we did not have the heart to give her up.  Needless to say, she is now happy, healthy, and well adjusted (except for the obsession with squirrels).  We love our Luvable Dog!

In that time I have seen the development of educational programs including: interactive exhibits, plaetarium shows, labs, and camps. There has been a culture shift toward improved education and staff development in that time, with direct ties to local schools and activities for families. The result of this has been a sustained growth rate in visitor participation. That rate has been from 5700 visitors in 2003 to over 35,000 in 2010.  In 2009 the obstacle to advancing programs was the outdated equipment in the Planetarium. That was quickly addressed with a 6 month fundraising campaign. The growth rate contiunues. The next obstacles are space related. Space to expand and store exhibits, space for staff work. 
The Science Factory, Inc.	73012	1	/users/profile/79811	kenche	Board Member	5	02/22/2011	The Science Factory, with it's new exploration dome, is a great hands on museum where children are exposed to the wonders of science. We know that many of the children have gone on to make science their career as a result of this museum. Since the board of directors is aware of the relatively small size of museum in proportion to the size of the area it serves, a capital campaign to expand the museum is always on our mind. This expansion would allow for both traveling and permanent exhibits to exist at the same time. In the mean time, the museum offers numerous programs to service the children of our community.
Akha Heritage Foundation	200047	2	/users/profile/261136	hunt4paul2	Donor	1	05/10/2014	This is a one-man operation - Matthew Duncan McDaniel. Akha leaders in Thailand have disassociated themselves from his activities. Donations only go to McDaniel himself. He has NEVER published any full accounting of how he uses donations. Little or nothing of donations to McDaniel's AHF go to help Akha people, except his own Akha wife and kids. His AHF nonprofit amounts to a scam without support of Akha people, whose rights he has hijacked for his own delusory dreams.
Akha Heritage Foundation	153757	2	/users/profile/204572	hunt4paul	Volunteer	1	04/09/2013	The Akha Heritage Foundation, a dream of Matthew McDaniel, is an incredible nonprofit. He claims to support the Akha hill-tribe minority in S.E.Asia, but the people and their leaders dissociate themselves from him! Now McDaniel is raising donations for his Sail For Freedom project. If you really need to be hoodwinked, robbed blind or just play the fool, then go ahead and donate to McDaniel. But read the below comments, and do some more research first. "Due to Mr. McDaniels behavior, the Akha Community Leaders in the Northern Part of Thailand and the Thai-Akha Fellowship in Thailand issued declaration on 16 and 23 November 2007, respectively, disassociating themselves from any action by Mr. McDaniel and his Foundation.The declarations clearly stated that the Akha people in Thailand do not recognize Mr. McDaniel and the Akha Foundation as duly authorized representatives of the Akha people.Any statement or action made on behalf of the Akha people by Mr. McDaniel of his Foundataion would not be taken into account.In fact, Mr. McDaniels behavior and action have been detrimental to the Akha, causing conflicts withing the Akha communities." (sic)http://www.chaoprayanews.com/2009/07/26/akha-heritage-foundation-matthew-mcdaniel/ Akha Outreach Foundation -www.akhaoutreach.org"Please be aware that there is a man name Matthew McDaniels (he owns www.akha.org and several other sites which openly bash all missionaries and the Thai government) who has put a lot of deceptive information about the Akha on the Web. This man is not credible; deeper research reveals that he has multiple Akha wives and has been officially expelled from Thailand because of sedition." (sic) Jake Terrell, a Ph.D. candidate and faculty member of The University of Hawaii, carried out a research project on Akha pirma chants. McDaniel got wind of it on the internet and had the audacity to claim the project as his own for donations on his AHF website. Terrell explained, "I asked him to take that post down from the AHF website, and he did, but still, that was quite outrageous behavior. He is delusional. Are you aware that in Nov. of 2007, about twenty Akha community leaders many who run their own NGOs for the people, christians and traditionalists, held a meeting in Chiang Rai, where they drafted a letter in Akha, English, and Thai telling McDaniel that he is not Akha, and asking him to cease and desist with his activities?" The Akha Heritage Foundation, aka Matthew McDaniel, is an incredible nonprofit! Incredible means NOT credible!
Akha Heritage Foundation	103061	1	/users/profile/136745	MetaApe	Volunteer	1	01/09/2012	Matthew McDaniel was furiously working away at a keyboard in an internet cafe in ChiangRai, northern Thailand, when I first clapped eyes on him early in 2003. Wearing a ragged hat and battered cowboy boots he walked out to his mud-spattered, uniquely modified, pick-up truck acknowledging me on his way. During the ride out to the hills he wasted little time expounding his views about christian missionaries abducting hill-tribe children into orphanages, sterilizing the women and generally desecrating their culture. Thai army, police, forestry, government officials and Thai royalty were all involved in dispossessing hill-tribe people, especially the Akha, of land, livelihood and life. I became aware of large numbers of hill-tribe inmates in Thai prisons far from their homes in my personal charity work since 1999. As part of my interest in understanding the issues involved I contacted McDaniel and met him several times in northern Thailand before his arrest on 18th April 2004 at the MaeSai border, his subsequent imprisonment for nine days, and deportation back to the USA ostensibly for visa violation. McDaniel had been living in Thailand since 1991. He told me he'd been exporting beads and jewelery from Thailand in a business with his brother in the U.S.A. until they fell out over finances. In MaeSai the Akha and other hill-tribe people caught his attention at the border bridge between Myanmar and Thailand. They are largely a poor, dispossessed, exploited people who have their own distinctive cultures quite different from mainstream Thai and Burmese cultures. Seeing the discrimination, and sometimes abuse, these people suffer, McDaniel said he tried to help with much-needed medical assistance. He had no professional medical training or qualifications, and more or less taught himself even how to extract teeth. McDaniel learned the Akha language and took a young Akha girl, Michu Uaiyue, as his wife. He lived in her family's village house at Pah Nmm in Bpah Mah Hahn until he was apparently told to move out. So he built a bamboo hut just above the village for his wife and their growing family. Visiting Pah Nmm one day with McDaniel, I noticed slogans daubed across village walls in English - "No Police", "Police Keep Out". At his bamboo hut his young wife was busy taking care of their children - four by this time, I think. Previously, I'd sent a variety of vegetable seeds by post from Europe in the hope that McDaniel would distribute them to villagers for trial growing. When I asked how this project was going he showed me a vegetable patch, explaining how well the beans were doing and producing a bountiful crop for his family since his wife planted them there. He avoided answering queries about any other villages he may have distributed the seeds to. At his bamboo hut there were some boxes of clothes recently donated to McDaniel's nonprofit AHF for Akha villagers. First pickings were obviously being picked out by relatives and friends. Another Englishman visiting McDaniel had been busy inside the hut setting up a new computer which he'd donated for McDaniel's AHF work. When he came to me complaining bitterly how McDaniel wouldn't let him use it I was at somewhat of a loss myself. Later the same day, McDaniel drove me down through Pah Nmm village as we discussed an issue on which I thought we needed views from Akha people themselves. I suggested we stop to ask an Akha man walking along the dirt track. "Not much use," snapped McDaniel driving on. "Why's that?" I asked. "He'll talk without saying much of anything. Typical Akha." McDaniel drove me to several Akha villages near the Burmese border, a region many hill-tribe prisoners whom I knew personally came from. He provided basic medical help to a few sick villagers and he carried a can of liquid used as pesticide for villagers to debug themselves from jiggers and other such insects. When he pointed out a fish pond in one village, explaining how one of his many projects was to set these up to provide protein food for villagers, I expressed my interest in stopping to see it. "No fish in it," he replied, driving on seemingly with no intention of stopping. "Why's that?" My questions were beginning to fall into a pattern, but I didn't see this clearly until later. "Akha ate them all," he answered. Some hill-tribe villages do reasonably well with viable projects producing coffee, tea, ginger, other crops, as well as handicrafts, while others provide accommodation and guided hiking trips for tourists. Admittedly, such projects are not all managed by hill-tribe villagers themselves, but some are. However, McDaniel said he didn't work with those Akha villages I'd mentioned. A small cluster of newly built wooden huts we visited was untypically situated in a valley, not the usual ridge-top location of most Akha villages. They'd been forced to relocate by forestry officials. Similar, and much larger, forced village relocation occurs throughout the region in Thailand, Myanmar and Laos. Such dislocations and interference by government officials, army, police, missionaries, business interests, and even due to tourist developments, obviously have a devastating impact on hill-tribe villagers. These usually uncomplaining, self-sufficient, quiet people have little or no say in such matters that severely affect their livelihood. McDaniel seemed to have a nose that picked up on the scent of suffering hill-tribe people. In ChiangRai soon after I first met McDaniel, he was handed a modest donation in cash with the suggestion that it be used directly for poor hill-tribe villagers. Soon after this, he said we were going for lunch, and he drove us to a large food court. I headed for local Thai vegetarian food, while McDaniel sepa
Long Tom Watershed Council	212396		/users/profile/275395	JimPendergrass	Board Member	5	08/27/2014	I've been involved with the Long Tom for over ten years, first as a volunteer and now as a Board member too.  Originally volunteering to slosh through creeks seining for macro invertebrates I got to know the restoration staff and director.  Their commitment to watershed restoration was inspiring.  After attending some meetings I was impressed with the grassroots nature of the organization, and how a Board of disparate personalities and occupations could work so well together in pursuit of a common goal.  That combined enthusiasm and dedication of staff and Board is what has kept me coming back all these years.  I've served on quite a few non profit Boards over the last thirty years, and this is by far my favorite.  All organizations should be so well run - and as much fun!
Long Tom Watershed Council	208392		/users/profile/271073	dgturner3	Board Member	5	08/02/2014	This group exists to help people enhance their local environment and it excels in all of its goals.  My first experience with LTWC was as a new landowner in the watershed with questions about what to do about a small dam on my property which was slowing down the creek to silted almost still water.  They were eager to help solve the problem and came up with sound expertise and grant support to carefully remove the dam and plant native vegetation to restore the creek habitat.  Their guidance and advice led me to a new level of stewardship to the property. In return for their service to me, I started volunteering with them in the field and later became a member of their Board, all being rewarding experiences.  The organization is efficiently managed, strategically focused, and totally committed to bringing people of the watershed together for the common goal of education and preservation of habitat issues.  They hold exceptional public "meetings" where experts give informative presentations on wide-ranging topics ranging, such as native fish migration, mammals in the watershed, managing forest lands, and invasive vegetation.  These meetings bring together individuals from the area and help nurture new relationships with landowners who could benefit from LTWC's services. My experience with the group has been totally positive as I watch the organization spend their time on issues that matter and are not distracted from their mission and vision to "use the collective wisdom and voluntary action of community members" to improve watershed conditions.  LTWC is a model organization for community action leading to sensitive stewardship of the natural resources.

Staff turn over is very low - that says a lot. And the organization is always looking to the future and asking about how to improve its service to the community.
Chess for Success	180130	1	/users/profile/236787	Richard66,	Volunteer	5	10/20/2013	For over 20 years Chess for Success has been helping students succeed one move at a time. For just over 5 years I have been in awe watching students gain confidence in their ability to solve complex problems, improve their focus, and learn the importance of respect and good sportsmanship. Many of the students from 5 years ago, when I started, are still participating. It has been so rewarding to watch their growth as students and to watch them take an active role in teaching new students.  They have built the kind of confidence in their abilities that knows no limits. They know that no matter how difficult a problem they are given, the right amount of time and effort will get results. All this while playing a game that has a long history of being played with respect for your opponent. 
Chess for Success	185023	2	/users/profile/241962	Rosebud4615	Volunteer	5	10/30/2013	When I raised my hand to volunteer, I had no idea how wonderful the organization was. It helped 50 plus students learn how to play chess effectively. The students learned more than just how to move pieces across the board. They learned to strategize, recognize what play their opponent would make, the students learned good sportsmanship Winning isn't everything but how you play the game. The students were given a greater understanding about the world right next door while attending various Chess for Success tournaments. The most important aspect of the program the students understood and appreciated was the organization cared for them as an individual.  The support I have received has been phenomenal, the staff has been supportive and encouraging as I learned about the world of chess. They are kind and instructive. I have been involved with a few non-profits but this is one I would strongly recommend to anyone.
Chess for Success	178560	1	/users/profile/235190	Victor L.	General Member of the Public	5	10/17/2013	They have been great at giving us advice as we build our chess education organization, Learners Chess Academy, in Albuquerque.  We have called them from time to time looking for advice or a perspective and they are always willing to share what they've learned along the way.
Casa Of Lane County	148968		/users/profile/198443	keladev	Volunteer	5	02/05/2013	CASA of Lane County is one of the most well run, strategic non-profits I have had the pleasure of being associated with.  In the last seven years, I have served on various committees, the board of directors and I am a donor.  My husband went through the training and served as a CASA on two cases prior to my involvement with the organization. In my 15+ years of working for and volunteering with non-profits, I have seen few that match CASA in their strategic focus and emphasis on mission.  The staff are professional and mission driven. The biggest challenge for this organization is for the general public to know and understand their vital roll in ensuring the safety and security of our community's most vulnerable children.  But, that is changing with the organizations consistent effort to raise awareness and tell their story.  My life is richer for having served this organziation. 
Casa Of Lane County	148822		/users/profile/198217	mdrennan	Volunteer	5	02/01/2013	I have worked with this agency for several years.  I am extremely impressed by the quality of leadership exhibited by the board and the management team.  Management has been innovative in developing a new model for the supervision of volunteers that is receiving national attention.  The organization remains fiscally sound and dedicated to the mission.  I serve as a CASA volunteer appointed by the court, as a member of the development committee, and on the legislative committee.  This is a strong and excellent non-profit that accomplishes critical work with at risk children.
Casa Of Lane County	9448	12	/users/profile/11259	Bob	Volunteer	1	08/22/2009	I think this agency could do a really wonderful job if they had more qualified staff. I felt as if the supervisor and staff I encountered needed more professional training in social services. It seemed that many of the supervisors and staff were friends and that was the basis for their hire, not professional experience or training.
SCRAP:  Creative Reuse Centers	109873		/users/profile/149653	christietodd	Volunteer	4	04/14/2012	SCRAP is just such a worty organization. As an at home "artist" re-establishing my studio I knew how amazing a place it is to shop, but after volunteering I realized to what extent they really go to educate people about the artistic and organizaional possibilities of re-using what was formerly considered garbage. Bravo!

It is a crafty paradise with many vintage craft materials like fabric, binding tape, and buttons just to name a few. But they also collect the more obscure materials made useful by virtue of their bulk, like bottles, tins and vials of various sizes, photo negatives, corks, and vintage paper.
SCRAP:  Creative Reuse Centers	109144		/users/profile/148635	Tammy16	Client Served	4	04/05/2012	Scrap is a great place to shop and a great place to donate your bulk items.

Caldera	140030	2	/users/profile/186167	CalderaArts	Advisor	5	11/15/2012	Response from Caldera:  While we are extremely fortunate to benefit from a generous founder, we also receive support from a variety of other foundations, corporations, and individual supporters.  Our facilities and camp on Blue Lake are only one part of our year-round, long-term mentoring program.  That property is funded separately from our operating costs through an endowment by our founder.  The facilities are also rented out to other nonprofit organizations whose missions align with Calderas and at an extremely low cost in order to support our goals.   We are a nonprofit organization and we are fortunate to have access to these incredibly beautiful facilities and resources.  We are continuously humbled and grateful for the support we receive from each and every donor and we are very careful with our use of supporters donations. We pride ourselves on being fiscally responsible and are happy to be transparent in our actions.  Please feel free to check our 990s for more information.   Caldera students come from a variety of backgrounds, as do our staff and board of directors. Our mission is to help support and encourage all under served youth to find their voices by accessing their creativity. That is always our focus with all our students regardless of ethnicity.  We welcome any further specific questions you may have. Please email us at caldera at calderaarts.org.
Caldera	129697		/users/profile/175094	mforester212	Volunteer	1	10/26/2012	My experience with Caldera is so similar to greatergoodpdx it's uncanny.  I too was told the same story about the underprivileged minority children wondering who the "rich white guy" was who lived in the huge house overlooking the camp. That seems to be the philosophy of the organization, "let's help these poor black kids while we flaunt our wealth". The BOD is full of the founders friends who donate $10k to each others non-profits while attending lavish, decadent fundraisers. They care more about stroking their own egos than helping kids in need. Disgusting.
Caldera	107741	2	/users/profile/146291	Greatergoodpdx	Donor	1	03/09/2012	The more I learn about Caldera, the more I regret the sizable donation I recently gave the organization. Caldera was started by an incredibly wealthy ad executive years ago to introduce the arts to underprivileged children. The concept sounds wonderful. The reality, however, proves to be a giant ego trip for the founder and his wealthy friends. The camp in Central Oregon is strange.  There are rustic teepees for the children to camp in. The children eat in a rustic outdoor kitchen area. They use basic gymnasium-style bathrooms and shower facilities.  Overlooking the children's campground is a palatial 3000+ square foot million dollar home. This home is where the founder stays when he visits. It was designed by a world famous architect. It boasts a chef's kitchen, spa-like bathrooms, a hot tub, a grand piano, etc etc. while taking a tour of the camp, I was told a "funny" story about how all of the underprivileged black kids would wonder who the old white guy was who lived in that huge house. 
Bends Community Center	23855	1	/users/profile/24994	kkniels	Board Member	5	12/11/2009	Bends Community Center lives by it's name. It is our towns community center to provide help and support to all ages to meet the basic needs of so many people. Every time I visit and spend time there I am humbled by the staff and the services that they provide with limited funds. It is an organization of volunteers that want to make a difference and they are!They treat individuals with respect, dignity and support them during tough times. I am amazed at the success stories of individuals who once needed to use the services offered but who are now self suffecient enough and are there to give back.
Bends Community Center	23834	1	/users/profile/24974	zmsj	Board Member	5	12/11/2009	Our firm has supported Bend's Community Center's Feed the Hungry program on Christmas day for several years.  My understanding is that Bend's Community Center is the only place, or one of the only places, in Bend open all Christmas day serving the homeless and hungry on what can be a very difficult and lonely time in a very cold climate.  I am always amazed at how much BCC accomplishes in so many areas and we are proud to help the Center in one facet of its many activities.  BCC is a true asset to our community and helps many people every day.
Bends Community Center	23804	1	/users/profile/24942	pleahy	Board Member	5	12/11/2009	I relocated just over a year ago and wanted to get involved with my new community here in Bend as soon as possible.  After working on food drives for another organization I discovered Bend's Community Center.  With a recently renovated commercial kitchen, cafe, conference space/hall rentals, thriftstore, bike shed and jobs training program, BCC was much more than what it appeared to be on the outside!  I was put in touch with Taffy Gleason, the Director of BCC, as someone who might consider helping me start the first Oregon diaper bank - and she welcomed the idea with open arms, so we now run Bend's Community Diaper Bank.  Taffy is a visionary who's programs include Feed The Hungry, Keep Them Warm, the Diaper Bank, the Bike Shed and jobs training.  Her goal is to reduce land fill, help put people back on their feet through job training, feed the hungry and offer clothing to those that need it.  Each program directly effects and pays for the next, allowing her to keep costs very low.BCC feeds 600-800 people throughout Central Oregon each week.  They provide bag lunches, take home packages, hot meals and a warm, inviting and respectful environment.
Virginia Garcia Memorial Foundation	176649		/users/profile/233068	Tina J. M.	Donor	5	10/10/2013	I first learned about Virginia Garcia about three years ago. After learning about what they do - provide health care to those who need it most - I was glad to make a donation. I've had the opportunity since to visit a clinic, meet their providers, and learn more about the thousands of people who rely on Virginia Garcia for health care. I've made several donations since, the last a week ago, and I am glad to have the opportunity to donate to such a worthy cause.
Virginia Garcia Memorial Foundation	147415		/users/profile/194856	Donor44	Professional with expertise in this field	4	12/29/2012	I have followed this group for decades, and always been impressed with their dedication to their clientele and to the work they are doing. I read the one other review, and it is apparent that the individual was poorly served by them. On the other hand, I have seen first hand the long hours and hard work of those involved with their clinics, and feel that the overwhelming majority of the clients are very grateful for their services. 
Virginia Garcia Memorial Foundation	101165		/users/profile/128693	Princssfe	Client Served	1	11/28/2011	This place is a joke!!  I am a full time student with a part time job and I have no insurance.  I have several health issues which require constant care.   This so-called charitable organization who told me that it would be a month and a half to two months wait to be seen left me waiting for almost six months to get an appointment and saved me a whopping $23!!  I was charged $82 for a doctor to talk to me for 15 minutes and $50 for one blood test!!  If this is how they help people who are uninsured and have medical needs...they might as well have kept their help!!  If I knew it was going to cost me that kind of money to be seen, I would have went to a real doctor six months ago instead of waiting.  My aunt has a general practitioner who charges $60 for an initial office visit and only makes new patients wait two weeks to get in.  I'm glad I'm not dying of something requiring constant attention or I would have died waiting for these people to "help" me!!!  On the up side the doctor I met with was very nice and seemed genuinely concerned but that did not help my financial situation at all.

Florence Caring Pregnancy Center	144684		/users/profile/191228	lulubell	Board Member	5	11/29/2012	I have been a board member for about 7 years.  During this time, I have seen young women and men not only able to learn how to be good parents, but also how they have been able to help themselves and understand what it means to be good parents.  Our counselers give unending love to their clients, who in the past, may never have been loved.  They are there for them and help them through some tough times.  Our counselers are like grandparents to these young people.  They may never have had this kind of love in their lives and most likely never been told that they are very special not only to them, but also to God.
Florence Caring Pregnancy Center	142838		/users/profile/189271	Betty17	Volunteer	5	11/26/2012	I work with Margaret Getchell, Executive Director of the Florence Caring Pregnancy Center, P. O. Box 1732, Florence, Oregon, preparing letters and other communications.  I am retired, after having worked for 45 years in an office environment and have been delighted to be able to help Mrs. Getchell over the last several years.   The Center is supported solely by individual donations, as well as grants. The Florence Caring Pregnancy Center is committed to speaking out for the pre-born who have no voice.  Pregnancy testing, post-abortion support and parenting education for families with young children are a focus of this ministry. The dedicated volunteers at the Center provide services for newborn babies, toddlers, mothers and families. Parents are helped by learning to be responsible for their children while they are being educated about how to provide safe, wholesome homes.  All the services and education are provided at no cost to clients.  A Stork Closet is maintained with donated diapers, clothing, necessary baby items, etc., and clients may shop in the Stork Closet without charge after having completed education sessions with a volunteer.

I personally took a 13 module Discovering Buddhism course and it was wonderful! I feel so much more peaceful and satisfied in my life after discovering what Buddhism is. I highly recommend it to anyone that is curious, because it's a great way to start your spiritual life, with this course.

Meow Village	147263	2	/users/profile/194555	Seascape3	Volunteer	5	12/26/2012	Meow Village and everyone involved with them are cat angels. They helped me in the summer of 2012 feed, trap and find new homes for a colony of 18 starving cats that a neighbor of mine abandoned at his home. I have been a volunteer with them since July 2012 - helping with the multitude of cats abandoned and dumped by uncaring people. Thank you Meow Village for all the cats you have saved from horrible situations or death. Thank you from me and that one special cat from the colony of 18 that came and found me to save the rest  - my old man Mac.
Meow Village	147060	2	/users/profile/194206	Cats Rule	Client Served	5	12/20/2012	I had been trying to care for a little striped feral 4-week old kitten I had found among a sick feral cat colony off the side of a highway (I couldn't find the rest of the litter)--yet I hadn't even a place to live for myself and my funds had been depleted. I had taken the kitten to a veternarian--and she was free from disease. Upon notifying MeowVillage, staff immediately stepped in and found a home for the little one and finished the vaccination series for her and made sure she got spayed. I was lucky she hadn't escaped in my car while I had to keep her in the car.  I miss her terribly--but I have helped the little cat more than I would have imagined by having found MeowVillage to get her placed safely, spayed, and permanently cared for.     Allison
Meow Village	125859	5	/users/profile/136315	Brooke6	Donor	5	10/16/2012	Where to start?? These volunteers spend HOURS advocating for feral cats. They trap, spay/neuter, then return feral cats to colonies and then take care of them with daily feedings, shelter and water. This has then led to fostering and re-homing numerous dumped cats and kittens. Due to the generosity of all these people involved thousands of cats have been saved as well as found "furever" homes. This organization is 100% volunteer and all vet, food "AKA expenses" is paid totally out of pocket and with generous donations.
Oregon Center for Public Policy	299028		/users/profile/389917	Mark219	Board Member	5	08/02/2016	The OCPP serves as Oregon's best source of information and analysis on economic and fiscal policy, with both long term macro-level research and immediate responses to emerging issues and legislation. Known for its high quality reports and strong reputation for accuracy, the Center has been successful in transmitting highly influential information to the general public - despite the corporatist control of Oregon's major media outlets.  Thanks to OCPP, Oregonians have access to data and analysis from a worker/human perspective that counters the corporate/institutional propaganda regularly trotted out as news.  As a result, in Oregon, progressive economic and fiscal policy initiatives have a reasonable shot at success.

Oregon Center for Public Policy	298020		/users/profile/388846	userrmlan509	Board Member	5	07/25/2016	As editor  of the editorial board  of Oregon's largest  newspaper  for 16 years, a member of the board for  22 years  and the board's editorial columnist for 10 additional years,  I  call the following information to the attention of GreatNonprofits:The Oregonian (20th-largest newspaper in the United States)  has regarded  the Oregon Center for Public Policy  as  the gold standard  of factual  accuracy  and the platinum standard for non- partisan agenda-setting  and consciousness raising  on  a quarter-century  series of  economic problems and  social controversies affecting -- and often afflicting -- the state. A few specifics: OCPP was the whistle blower that alerted us that the state's corporate  minimum tax was a shambles -- and a sham.  It was the prime, reliable source  for raising public  awareness  about the actual and  projected effects to changes in the minimum wage and the Earned Income Tax Credit. It currently  leads  (in partnership  with the League of Women Voters)  a remarkable statewide  effort to raise civic literacy about the chronic, deep  underfunding  of  public schools and of plausible  options to remedy it.  It is the honest broker, the go-to source,  that assesses  what has been achieved  in ensuring  that all  Oregonians have affordable access  to health care  and,  with commendable precision, what remains to be done.This is a low-budget, very factual,  high-impact, community-building  operation --  an indispensable  tutorial  source for policy-makers and citizens alike.

I've been helping to design an experiential Spanish curriculum to be used in Nicaragua for anyone who wants to learn Spanish in a fun, engaging and interactive way. It is based on learning through experience, giving as much back to the local community as possible and working closely alongside them.

Friends Of South Slough Reserve Inc	74269		/users/profile/81146	Joy T.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/23/2011	I work at least weekly with the Friends of South Slough.  Without FOSS, many of the education programs I lead would not be possible.  FOSS provides materials and funding for a variety of environmental education experiences from 1 hour toddler programs to 4 day summer camps to paddle programs.  FOSS recently donated an 8 passenger canoe to the South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve, which will give the opportunity for a much wider audience to experience South Slough by water.
Friends Of South Slough Reserve Inc	71286		/users/profile/77949	Rich	Volunteer	4	02/19/2011	It is my understanding that the Friends of South Slough Reserve (FOSS) was first created to provide a bookstore which supplied material for visitors which related to the purpose of the South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve, the very first National Estuarine Research Reserve in the nation.  This bookstore has grown to be a centerpiece in the Reserves Interpretive Center, an invaluable asset.  In later years FOSS has been quite involved in fund raising, the major objective being to provide required non-federal matching funds for grants the Reserve has received from NOAA.  These efforts have made possible a number of major Reserve projects including the addition of an auditorium and classroom to the Interpretive Center, new exhibits in the Interpretive Center and an aluminum pedestrian bridge across a water arm of the estuary proper which now links pathways at the waters and thus provides a loop pathway to and from the Interpretive Center.  Most recently FOSS has raised funds to support the construction of an aquarium in the entry hall of the Interpretive Center.I am a life member of FOSS which is an all-volunteer nonprofit 501 (c) (3) organization.  I am a past president and treasurer and am currently webmaster of the FOSS web site.  I also maintain a FOSS presence on FaceBook.  FOSS members, as volunteers, support a number of the Reserves activities and projects along with non-member volunteers.As the Reserves purpose is to support the preservation and understanding of the environment FOSS performs a very significant service for the environs locally and worldwide.
Friends Of South Slough Reserve Inc	70342		/users/profile/76891	Mike G.	Board Member	4	02/17/2011	I am a life member of the Friends of South Slough...  I have been a member of the board since the organization was formed in 1988.   Our group is an all volunteer organization that has done a whole variety of projects over the years.   All the the projects are aimed at supporting the  the South Slough National Estuarine Resarch Reserve goal to improve the understanding of estuaries and coastal watersheds...  Estuaries are important places that form where a river meets the sea.  Estuaries are important place for people and other living things.   The Friends of South Slough have helped to publish a book about the history of the South Slough and have raised funds to support the expansion of the visitor's center and to create exhibits about estuaries.   Our group also runs a book store at the visitor's center that sells great books and sundries that encourage people to enjoy the out of doors and the world we live in.  ONe of the fun current projects of the Friends of South Slough (FOSS)  is called "FOSS Floats"  Two months ago our group did research into big canoes that ended in our group purchasing a really beautiful 23 foot long, 8 passenger canoe that we donated to the education program at the Reserve.  This will enable the staff to lead tours on the estuary for people who don't have a canoe or kayak!  The staff is really excited about the FOSS Floats project.  Our next step will be to create a floating structure that looks like one of the original "float houses" that people lived in durnig the 1930's.  we plan to create the floating structure so we can take educational programs about estuaries to other locations such as the boardwalks in the downtown waterfront districts of the nearby communities of Coos Bay and North Bend.  This will be really fun and will really help the Reserve!  
Northwest Zen Sangha	164902		/users/profile/219195	DharmaMom	Donor	5	08/13/2013	I have been a member of NW Zen Sangha (DRZC) for 20+ years. The organization has been vital to me and my family. The DharmaGarden programs give children an opportunity to discover who they are in a safe, supportive and respectful environment. There is more demand for the Children's program than space to provide it, so this organization needs to grow. I appreciate that DRZC strives value and honor all forms of diversity.

Northwest Zen Sangha	151313		/users/profile/201978	jstookey	Board Member	5	03/19/2013	Guided by the wisdom of our Abbots, Kyogen and Gyokuko Carlson, Dharma Rain Zen Center (DRZC) has been teaching people how to cultivate peace of mind for more than 25 years. From the Introduction to Meditation workshop to the multiple weekly opportunities for group meditation, DRZC has provided me with guidance and the many benefits of Buddhist practice. Our popular Wednesday night classes provide an introduction to Buddhism, and seminary classes allow senior students a deeper look into Buddhist sutras, history, and philosophy. Throughout the year we offer silent meditation retreats that last from one day to a weekend to a whole week. We operate a robust Prison Program that reaches out to six different correctional institutions. Our nationally recognized childrens program serves as a model for Buddhist organizations across the country. I have learned and grown from all of these programs over a period of many years, and I am pleased to now be serving on the DRZC Board of Directors. Currently, the childrens program is turning away families because of lack of space; some rooms serve triple-duty as dining-, meditation-, and meeting-spaces; and our Zendo is often full to capacity on Sunday mornings. So we are in the process of undertaking a profound transformation as we expand onto a new fourteen acre campus.  You can help us make this dream a reality by contributing to our capital campaign, so that we can continue to share the stillness and wisdom of meditation practice on into the future.

Civil Air Patrol 36073 Columbia Composite Squadron	166906		/users/profile/210342	spsmsarpio	Advisor	5	09/04/2013	Thank you Civil Air Patrol for all that you do! We appreciate your work.
Civil Air Patrol 36073 Columbia Composite Squadron	162596		/users/profile/215800	Carol103	Volunteer	5	07/14/2013	I have been a senior member with this squadron for three years, I currently hold the rank of Captain. Back in the mid 60's to early 70's I went through the cadet program. We offer many opportunities, for cadets to learn how to fly, emergencies services, International Air Cadet Exchange, this is where cadets and seniors have the chance to visit one of 18 different countries and learn about their aerospace education programs. Many of out cadets have chosen a carrier in the military and have been selected to attend different military academies. So chose to start their own business.   We attend a camp for underprivileged youth for a week so the can see life from a different point of view, that life is not all negative.    In December we place wreaths on veterans graves at Willamette National Cemetery.   The cadets get a chance for orientation rides in the Cessna 180's, there are different encampments they can attend. And that is the short list.  
Civil Air Patrol 36073 Columbia Composite Squadron	86680		/users/profile/97118	Lt. Grove	Volunteer	5	04/21/2011	I'm the cadet commander of the Columbia Composite Squadron, Civil Air Patrol. Every year we run the gamut from distributing Thanksgiving baskets to low-income people to assisting for more than a week at a camp for under-privileged kids at risk for gang and drug activity to participating in Veteran commemoration ceremonies. Internally, we teach cadets discipline, leadership, how to march, how to polish boots and iron uniforms, etc. Cadets also have the opportunity to fly in both civilian and military aircraft, get some pilot training through the Air Force, to be trained rigorously by military special forces, do colorguard, participate on search and rescue teams recovering downed aircraft or lost hikers, among many other activities. It's a great program which I strongly urge any teenager from 12-18 or adult to join. Adults have their own track they can follow. For more information, please go to www.gocivilairpatrol.com.

The women are mentored, have case management and good old dirt therapy. Meals are prepared and eaten family style and sleep is dormitory style. Grace, care and accountability are taught and modeled by staff, mentors and volunteers who work with the ladies one-on-one and in group activities. Faith based studies are offered, but are not mandatory for a woman's stay at Grace House.

Corvallis Bicycle Collective	151426	2	/users/profile/202170	masternico1337	Board Member	5	03/21/2013	I am a manager for the Corvallis Bicycle Collective and I can tell you that it is an amazing place. Here is where not only can anybody get a bike, but they can learn to fix it as well(we are a learning shop). Corvallis is a college town, so we get everyone from homeless people looking for inexpensive transport to college students looking for a lightweight way to get to class. In short, the CBC is a miracle of nonprofit engineering, and I will continue to serve there as long as humanly possible.
Corvallis Bicycle Collective	145617	3	/users/profile/192130	danielcoyle	General Member of the Public	5	12/02/2012	The Corvallis Bicycle Collective is an amazing resource that had been missing in otherwise bike friendly Corvallis previously.  It has made sustainable and healthy transportation available to lots of folks who are able to take advantage of it in a college town with parking issues and a desire for active lifestyles.  I am a big fan of them and their leadership.

The CBC in my first stop whenever I am in need of a part, have a question, or need tools that I dont have at home. They have volunteers that are well versed in bikes and can help you with whatever problem you are having. Parts are cheap if something break and they help you find the best parts available. Yet to be disappointed by their service, a great asset to the City of Corvallis and its many cyclist.

Willamette Girlchoir	197048	2	/users/profile/257579	Angry_Parent	Client Served	1	04/04/2014	Corrupt board practices in relation to fund raising. You have a board president who is double dipping into the fund raisers and another board member raising money under false pretence saying it is for the girls trip to New York, but, in fact it is to pay for her own way to New York. They also lied about event and practice conflict issues. My daughter is participating in many things along with this choir, and, we were reassured that it wouldn't be an issue. It quickly turned into an issue. Bottom line is that the board members lie about everything and then punish all who were involved. There really needs to be an investigation into the practices of this organization.
Willamette Girlchoir	197042	2	/users/profile/257573	dyerlaura	Client Served	1	04/04/2014	I enrolled my daughter twice in this choir.  We had a great experience until this year.  We joined this year after speaking with administration regarding conflicts in scheduling with my daughter's cheer competitions.  I was assured this would not be a problem.  I paid for a year's worth of services up front and in full based on this conversation.  After my daughter missed a Saturday reversal for cheer, she was not allowed to participate in a concert.  She was then excluded from the next reversal since they decided to use regular practice time for reversal for the girls only going on a New York trip.   In addition to having me sign up under false assurances, they also did not provide services I paid for.  Furthermore, my daughter spent countless hours fundraising for the New York trip, which the organization kept in individual accounts for each girl that did fundraising.  This money could be used for the trip or tuition.  Since we did not raise enough for my daughter to go on the trip, I asked to have the money applied to my daughter's tuition.  I was told they could do that.  When they found out that I had prepaid for the year, they told me they could not refund my money.  Had I not paid up front, they would have been happy to apply it to my daughter's tuition.  I paid $650.00 for my daughter to participate.  We fund raised $654.00 dollars.  The organisation was paid twice for my daughter to participate.  I even offered a compromise of returning half of the money we had fund raised.  This was also rejected.   Fundraising is another problem area.  We did group fundraising and the profits were to be split evenly between all the girls that participated.  A board member, who also holds an administrative position, and has a girl in the choir, did fundraising for her own expenses for the New York trip.  She did so by telling the public she was raising money for the girls.  She took money away from girls who were trying to raise money for their own participation in the music festival.  Furthermore, board member and choir president would double dip at all of these fundraisers.  She would bring both her daughter's to sell, one not being in the choir, and take two shares of the profits instead of just one, like everyone else had to.   The music teachers are wonderful.  However, I strongly recommend that you avoid this choir due to their corrupt administration.  Get anything they tell you in writing.  And know that they will take your money and will withhold services at their whim.  I am also disappointed that board members and choir administrators are using their positions for personal gains.

BRIAN GRANT FOUNDATION	101114	6	/users/profile/128435	bobn	Donor	1	11/27/2011	This non-profit has done very little with the tremendous amount of money they have received.

There are far more effective organizations to give your money to that will actually fund research and outreach for Parkinson's disease.
Hopeful Hearts Horse Rescue Inc	84953		/users/profile/94446	Angelos3	Client Served	5	04/07/2011	Hopeful Hearts Horse Rescue came thru for me when I needed to save a OTTB named "Norman". His racing career was over and his owner contacted me when she could no longer keep him.  She was desperate and he needed to be moved. He would be going to the auction which would probably have sent him to slaughter.  Hopeful Hearts contacted me that they had a place for him in Oregon so we shipped Norman to them.  They have lovingly cared for him and given him a chance to live with a new career.  Kim has a love for the horses and the skills to take care of them.   
Hopeful Hearts Horse Rescue Inc	81899		/users/profile/89812	BethoniAnn	General Member of the Public	5	03/11/2011	I have know Kim for three wonderful years. In those years I have worked closely with her at an emergency veterinary clinic where she has shown so much compassion and love for all animals. She has always had a love for horses, and recently became interested in starting a rescue.  Kim and her father have done a great amount of research, and networking to get their rescue started. (On a side note they both also work closely with the Oregon Hay Bank to get hay to people who can't afford it.)  I was so happy to hear when they were set and on their way to rescuing their first horse, Norman!  Norman is a 5 year old Thoroughbred, who was potentially going to be sent to slaughter, Kim and her father happily took Norman in. Norman was going to be adopted by someone for eventing, but he had some neurologic issues that could be permanent. Kim, of course, fell in love with the big red gelding and is keeping him on a beautiful piece of property that her friend is graciously letting Kim keep him at.  Kim has taken great care of Norman and he is on his way to recovering! There have been no signs of neurologic deficits at this point. Kim and her father are desperately trying to get grants to buy property to keep Norman and their future rescues at.  Any horse would be lucky to be in Kim's hands.  She has done an amazing job and is a great person to work with!
Douglas County Low Cost Veterinary Services	281070	2	/users/profile/371086	Guamo	Client Served	1	02/27/2016	UPDATE!From The News Review July 21, 2015:Douglas County Low Cost Veterinary Services lost all but one employee and its entire board of directors last week. A new board and new staff have taken their places at the clinic.  Most notably, founder Julia Russill has returned to the clinic after being let go last month. She has a considerable amount of work ahead, she said.  The clinic offers low or sometimes no-cost animal services to almost 6,000 clients in Douglas County who cant afford care at the for-profit pet hospitals in the region. This clinic has been operating at a deficit for some time, relying on donations and grants to continue, according to various sources.  The clinic is in debt about $25,000. In 2013, GuideStar reported the nonprofit was operating $12,858 over budget. GuideStar doesnt have more recent numbers.  The nonprofits stewardship council, which oversees the board, asked three of the five board members to step down last week. The other two members resigned.   The old board of directors will give way to Will Wagar, Karen Lindsey and Julia Russill. Russill was originally the executive director and founded the nonprofit, but she was let go last month by the same board that is now leaving.  Rumors circulated that the clinic was closing last week. Though there were plans for it to close until July 27 during the restructuring, now that Russill is in charge, plans have changed.  The clinic is not closing, Russill said. Were forging on.  Russill called the changing of the guard a breath of fresh air.  I want to rebuild the clinic in a positive way and get the clinic back to serving this community, Russill said. This has been a pretty incredible ride.  Russills plans include bringing back the weekend emergency pet hospital, but the plans have their skeptics.  One is Julie Zuver, who recently resigned from the board and from her position as the acting director.  She said shes seen the nonprofit struggle while Russill has been at the helm.  She started something that is very, very needed in this community, Zuver said. But she hasnt been very successful at making it work so far.  Though involved parties disagree on how to run the clinic, the services it provides are essential, since it has spayed and neutered an average of 2,000 animals a year and provided free services to homeless individuals who own pets, as well as a free food bank for pets.  Veterinarian doctors Ilana Levinson and Kate McInnis have returned to work for the clinic.   This clinic used to be a very well run and friendly place.  Something happened somewhere around the summer of 2015.  Most all staff is new.  None of them know what they are doing.  They tell you one thing or price then change it.  They out and out lied on my dog's records.  There used to be a surgeon there who was the best there is.  Now they can't hardly even get any vets in there; some of them act like they never went to veterinary school.  If you question them on something they told you or quoted you earlier, they tell you not to come back.  I don't know what changed but it has miserably gone downhill.  The current vet tech there is a nasty, difficult woman to work with, and she should NOT be the one who has the final say so on everything.  There is no leader.  It's a shame because so many of us cannot afford full vet prices, but neither myself nor my animals will ever return there.  BTW, my role was not "Client Served" but rather "Client UNSERVED."
Douglas County Low Cost Veterinary Services	250753	3	/users/profile/338642	shona	Client Served	1	07/30/2015	The office staff and administration are impossible to deal with.  Administration doesn't seem to administrate, and things were evidently left in the hands of the front office people. Once I spoke with the two volunteer vets I have dealt with things were okay in that department.  But it seemed the front office demanded some type of obeisance, .They repeatedly told me to do opposite things, and my asking for clarity was answered with rudeness.  The animal isn't doing well, just needs a prescription, which they won't give, so he will probably die.  I pleaded with them for him to no avail. Evidently their anger at me, and I did nothing wrong; will cost an innocent animal his life.  My bill was paid in full at time of service, so this isn't about money on my part.  Other problems as well.  I don't see that they follow the spirit of what they claim they are about. 
Blanchet House Of Hospitality	160489		/users/profile/212781	RICHU	Board Member	5	06/12/2013	I want to thank all who have helped make our new Blanchet House building a reality.  The generosity of individuals, foundations, companies and the City of Portland was truly amazing and will allow us to continue our mission to feed the hungry, provide shelter and a safe haven for those in need for another 60 years.  The number of meals served has increased since our new building opened in October of 2012.  In January alone, over 30,000 meals were served at our new facility.  "Build it and they will come!" We are grateful for all who have volunteered and provided the hospitality our guests need.  We are indeed grateful to all of Portland!Many thanks,Rich Ulring and all of theBlanchet House Board Members     
Blanchet House Of Hospitality	142727		/users/profile/180206	Michelle102	Volunteer	5	11/26/2012	I've had a chance to work at the Blanchet House a few times through the Hands On Portland website and this place is great. The staff that runs this operation day in and day out is great - they are concerned about the well being of those they serve and ensuring a positive experience for all. I have really enjoyed my time I've spent with them.   The shelter is unique in making the individuals feel more like customers than an individual passing through a cafeteria line - this adds to their hospitality status. They bring the food to the client, the beverages are on the table - the client just comes in and gets food - similar to a restaurant style service.  Having volunteered at other local shelters, this definitely adds to the organization and efficiency of the meal providing.  Kudos to Blanchet!
The Bloom Project	286625		/users/profile/376695	Jodie_U	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	This past summer, in the name of volunteering for http://thebloomproject.org, I traveled to many breathtaking Central Oregon wedding venues to collect the thoughtfully donated wedding flowers of socially and environmentally conscious brides and grooms who weren't too busy with endless details to think of ensuring that the special flowers that graced their momentous day would be lovingly repurposed, reused and rearranged into born again bedside bouquets for nearby hospice and palliative care patients and their families. Yes, this is a thing. This is happening! And The Bloom Project exists so that it will continue to happen.Following these joyous occasions, in the name of giving, I got to throw open grand doors and walk into spaces still full of beauty and life and gather up vases full of perfumed petals for the purpose of brightening a dark period for a person unknown to me and in doing so my own spirit was so buoyed that I did this again, and again and again. Giving can fill like getting, and this is how you know you found the sweet spot. That moment when in doing for someone else, something is done for you and it feels so good you just can't stop. You find ways to do it more. You tell others how to do it too. You can't believe there was a time you didn't do it. You can't imagine a time when you won't do it. It's the sweet spot. It's a great place to be. You have one too. Wherever yours is, in the name of expressivity, humility, humanity and unity, I hope you find it soon.
The Bloom Project	286624		/users/profile/376694	Janet_S2	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	As a volunteer for The Bloom Project/Portland, I really feel like Cinderella at the Ball!  This glass slipper just fits!My husband and I moved to Portland 8 years ago from L.A. after we retired.  I worked in the entertainment industry  mostly in administration and human resource management.  Ive had the privilege of working with some pretty amazing people, some amazingly demanding people, and shall we say, some that were less than amazing?  Anyway, were happy now growing moss between our toes here in in the Northwest.  Right after our move, I plunged into the needlepoint and knitting world and was thrilled with the amazing community of women.  It wasnt long before I was introduced to Heidi Berkman, the Founder of The Bloom Project.  When she gave a presentation about starting a Portland Project, I was absolutely intrigued.  I got to know her a little better when she set up a stitching retreat that I attended.  This is where things began to jell for me.  The idea seemed so simple, but brilliant.  Re-purpose perfectly good flowers that get thrown away?  Terrific!  Arrange flowers?  Love it!  Send a random gift of a beautiful bedside bouquet for someone in hospice?  Its such a small, wonderful gesture that means so much to end-of-life patients and their families.  I was sold.Like so many of our volunteers, I, too, had the experience of knowing first-hand what it was like to lose a parent or loved one, and I saw what hospice meant to them and us.  I knew it was just those small gestures that mean so much to everyone involved.  I know our family will be forever grateful for this amazing service.  I think the timing was right for giving back.  As much as I love knitting and stitching (and Im still involved with it), I was sitting too much and developed a nice crick in my neck!  I was anxious to find something where I could move and make myself useful.  I love doing start-ups, was completely comfortable with Heidi and impressed with what she had put together.  It was immediately obvious to me that she had what my German-born husband would say is fingerspitzengefhl  a fingertip sense or feel, intuitive flair or instinct for leading.  It all came together.When she called and said she had something in mind for me, I had no problem telling her, Whatever you want me to do, Ill do it! I suppose THAT was a mistake, but 2 years and some 2,000 hours later, Im still at it!  Initially I became her Portland Volunteer Coordinator and then the Lead Site Coordinator.Its been lots of work, and my husband has been incredibly supportive, but in the end, I have a new paycheck:   Watching Heidis incredible dream come to fruition; Working with amazing volunteers, sharing a special camaraderie and building real friendships;  Networking with organizations that love and support what we do; Watching with admiration the work of the service organizations and their dedicated caregivers; And most importantly, reading all those incredible notes of thanks from patients, families, friends and caregivers!  Thats why Im doing what Im doing.  Thats my paycheck!
Making Memories Breast Cancer Foundation	261074		/users/profile/349668	AuntieAmy	Client Served	5	10/02/2015	I am writing in support of Making Memories Breast Cancer Foundation.  Eleven years ago the Foundation sent my sister, her husband and their two kids to Disney World.  My sister Trudi had been diagnosed with stage four metastatic breast cancer.  The trip to Disney gave her family a brief few days to set aside the devastating diagnosis, have fun, and make memories that the kids still talk about today.  Sadly she passed away within months of their trip, but her kids, now 18 and 21, cherish that time and those memories.  Thank you for all you do!
Making Memories Breast Cancer Foundation	67722	1	/users/profile/74020	meo6453	General Member of the Public	1	02/14/2011	Heads-up, This organization does not look good. If you want to know anything about any given non-profit check their form 990 which is required reporting. You can find it at Guidestar.com. and type in (making memories) in the search bar and it will be the first one listed in Lake Oswego. Making Memories Breast Cancer Foundation and Brides Against Breast Cancer are the same organization. It can tell you how much of a non-profits income goes to their stated purpose. This organization has a very credible purpose but probably uses less than 10 per cent and maybe as little as 5 per cent of its income to do its potential good work. This should put them on the Oregon department of justice's list of worst non-profits. Call the Oregon dept. of justice and ask them about Making Memories and Brides against Breast Cancer. If you donate to them or buy from them then you will be enabling them to continue their poor record. Ask them some hard questions before helping them. Make them become a decent organization by putting pressure on them.  
Oregon Zoo Foundation	89403		/users/profile/41690	sugarbear	Donor	5	06/01/2011	My personal experience (2 family retired over age 60 folks) is that this foundation really RECOGNIZES their donors, caters to them and tries to give quality experiences to match their voluntary gifts .As we know there are many charities clamoring for our dollars The Oregon Zoo delivers value for dollar. The zoo has metro (govt) employees who work WELL with the donor foundation volunteers and donors - not always the case. 
Oregon Zoo Foundation	40801	12	/users/profile/41690	sugarbear	Donor	5	05/26/2010	The Oregon Zoo Foundation is completely integrated with the Zoo Operation and puts its/your "money where the commitment is". They just recently completed and opened an African Exhibit that came in on budget and are working on a new ape exhibit. They use the money wisely and have great project management relative to other Zoo's I have donated and volunteered with such that YOUR donor money actually shows up in a completed project! They acknowledge their donors with special previews and use LOCAL merchants to provide the goodies (eats and drinks) at these events. I like that. I recommend involvement in the OREGON ZOO FOUNDATION. Also a plus - foundation members use email extensively, are available in great number at their donor events and I have found their backgrounds to be very deep in the field (they hire well).
Kuza Program	248186		/users/profile/335879	kirstenw	Donor	5	07/13/2015	I have sponsored 4 KUZA students and am preparing to sponsor another!  I have traveled twice with KUZA to Uganda to see first-hand the education, leadership development and personal care these young men and women receive.  The gift of an education gives them the chance to not only earn a reasonable living but, more importantly to make a positive impact on their larger community.  There are great opportunities in Uganda and our graduates are just starting to blossom and become leaders in their country!
Kuza Program	248179		/users/profile/335873	Carolyn Z.	Donor	5	07/12/2015	KUZA is one of those rare organizations where you can be sure that the money you donate goes directly to the education of an African student.  Over the last half decade, our family has had both the privilege of supporting a KUZA student, and actually going over to Uganda with the team (at our own expense) and seeing our KUZA dollars in action.  I simply cannot envision a more worthy group of savvy, smart, lovely young people to help lift from a life of poverty so that they may in turn, bless their own struggling nation.  God is truly at work in KUZA.
Children's Center	205713		/users/profile/267952	turtletango	Board Member	5	07/11/2014	I am honored to help this awesome organization that serves abused children of Clackamas County.  The staff and volunteers work together to create the best experience for children who need medical assessments for suspected abuse cases.  
Children's Center	167570		/users/profile/222436	volunteergirl	Volunteer	5	09/05/2013	I learned about this organization when I met its executive director.  She explained that the Center supports and medically asses children who are suspected victims of child abuse.  Child abuse is a significant problem in our county, so I was interested in learning more.  I toured the facility and was so impressed I became an active volunteer.  I do everything from make phone calls, help with fund raisers, and prepare snacks. Through my work, I learned that this Center is populated by some of the most dedicated, gentle, caring people I've ever met.  From the administrators to the child interviews to the medical staff, every employee and volunteer is highly skilled and absolutely dedicated to child health.  In addition, the program is highly effective.  Children arrive frightened and unsure of themselves.  After their interviews and exams, they leave far happier and relieved of their terrible stories of abuse.  Frequently the exams result in law enforcement intervention which stops the abuse altogether.  Families are also supported with support groups and referrals to mental health care providers for further healing. In addition, the board of this organization is made up of local volunteers and professionsals who are thoughtful, intelligent, and very careful with the organization's funds.  All dollars are stewarded very carefully.
SUNSHINE DIVISION PORTLAND POLICE DEPT	219654		/users/profile/283275	Fabrienne.	Client Served	5	10/03/2014	The Sunshine Division has helped my family during times we were most in need. Because I live paycheck to paycheck and I am also a single mother it very hard to create a savings for any kind of emergency needs. When the time has come for an emergency need, the Sunshine Division staff has always made me feel welcomed and has always made me feel like there is hope during my time of need. Without the Sunshine Division's support, I don't know what I would do. Hopefully one day when times are better for myself and my son, we will return our thanks by giving our time back or by donating to those in need that go to the Sunshine Division for emergency services.  
SUNSHINE DIVISION PORTLAND POLICE DEPT	218932	1	/users/profile/282538	Southpaw97209	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/01/2014	I've been involved in a number of nonprofits as a volunteer, donor, and consultant and few are like the Sunshine Division.  As a donor, I focus my gifts on organizations who directly serve the local community in a tangible way.  Sunshine Division has a variety of programs that help families in MY community.  Their connection to the police is unique and I believe adds a perspective other food relief organizations do not have.  They also follow my guidelines of what "charity" is, as they don't charge clients or other organizations who receive food from them, unlike the Oregon Food Bank. As a consultant, I've helped other nonprofits plan fundraising events and can tell you that many thousands of dollars are spent to put on these fundraisers.  The Sunshine Division spends virtually nothing to hold fundraising events.  It's pretty much unheard of to have so many sponsors underwriting almost 100% of their fundraising event costs.  It's a real testament of how local businesses feel about them in Portland.

Kitty Angel Team Adoption	258360	2	/users/profile/346850	LaydieK	Board Member	5	09/18/2015	Kitty Angel Team Adoption is an all volunteer group devoted to rescuing cats and kittens where they can. We are a small group and we have extremely limited funds (out of pocket). When we help people with their cats and kittens we try to ask for an in-kind donation of some sort to help off-set our huge expenses. We have rescued thousands of cats and kittens and will continue to do so. We cannot help everyone, not everyone wants help and some don't understand they need help. But we do help the kitties. We love kitties!
Kitty Angel Team Adoption	243597	1	/users/profile/330396	TMGedda	General Member of the Public	1	05/26/2015	Was lied to and betrayed by Vicki who runs the Kitty Angel Team Adoption. I contacting her for assistance with kittens I rescued from an extremely unhealthy and unsafe home. Of the 11 kittens from three different litters, my disabled daughter had one written in as her therapy companion through her medical care provider. Some of the kittens were sick with an upper respiratory infection. Vicki made strong promises to help with antibiotics for my daughter's kitten as we were giving Vicki the rest of the kittens. The day she arrived to pick up the last few remaining in my care she was also to bring the antibiotic. She refused to give the antibiotic and stated my daughters kitten would die without it. I spent close to $200 in the care of the kittens while in my care. She knew I could not afford a vet bill at this time. I was attempting to question her about her dishonesty when my daughter agreed to allow Vicki to take her kitten so the kitten would have a chance at getting better.  My daughter showed in that moment to be more adult and more compassionate than Vicki could ever imagine being for herself.
Sea Turtles Forever	184066		/users/profile/241005	cveraldo	Donor	5	10/29/2013	Sea Turtles Forever is an amazing nonprofit organization! I am a donor and adopted a mother sea turtle and named her after my granddaughter. My donation helps track my adopted sea turtle and protect her eggs from poachers. I have received data directly from the organization about my sea turtle. I have also learned how the plastic micro particles in the ocean destroy the reefs that feed the other fish and prevent the sea turtles from eating the sea grass at the bottom of the ocean, which releases nutrients for the reef which in turn helps the lobsters, fish, and other ocean life prosper. This organization has prevented poachers from steeling eggs from the sea turtles nests, and clean up the environment so the sea turtles can prosper. This is one organization I will continue to support. I believe their efforts are helping our sea creatures survive, and flourish. They are awesome and deserve recognition for all their efforts, and successes! Regards,Coleen Veraldo

The Rinehart Endowment Fund Inc	81093		/users/profile/63291	Singer	General Member of the Public	1	03/03/2011	It is my understanding that the Rinehart Clinic Endowment Fund has been liquidated and donated to the Rinehart Clinic to cover day to day expenses.  The fund is a victim of a high turnover rate (two thirds of its administrative staff has turned over in 2010) and bad business practice brought about by bad management and lack of fiscal responsibility.   Federal funding has allowed this entity to continue to practice in an irresponsible manner. 
The Rinehart Endowment Fund Inc	59070		/users/profile/63557	JusticeComesFromRight	Professional with expertise in this field	1	12/24/2010	The major donor for this endowment admitted to me that he was very upset by the way his sizable, founding donation was being spent on a clinic that is flushing money down the toilet.  Those are his words.  If you note the waste at this organization, and their admitted $100,000 loss in the last year, you can understand a bit of his concern.  This endowment has very little money left in it, in fact, due to a recent bail-out scheme enacted on behalf of the poorly run Rinehart Clinic.  Donate your money to a fund that is not involved in bad business, I say.

Street Roots	94118		/users/profile/108695	Orion L.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/20/2011	Street Roots is an amazing newspaper as far as content and quality, because the staff bust their butts with a tiny budget to do great research and tackle hard, topical issues around homelessness and housing. They do far better with less than the mainstream papers in Portland as far as in-depth coverage of issues important to me. Also, they are great advocates, actually jumping into different issues around homelessness in Portland, putting pressure where pressure is needed. As an affordable housing professional, they are valuable to me because they keep the important issues on the political table, and are a source of important information to our community. They are also great with the vendors - the people experiencing poverty and homelessness - offering them gainful employment, community, dignity, and genuine care and respect. I don't have a lot of money but when I do I like to share it with Street Roots. 
Street Roots	59307		/users/profile/63931	kvrfan	General Member of the Public	5	12/31/2010	The homeless need a voice, and Street Roots provides it. Its pages are filled with articles not only for, but by, the street community. In offering this voice, it not only is a newspaper--it is a community. Too many forces are aligned to marginalize those already on the margins. Street Roots provides the advocacy to counteract that. It is principled and operates on a shoestring. All who care about the homeless should give it their support.
Small Miracles Foundation	46048	4	/users/profile/46937	sandi4	Volunteer	5	06/27/2010	When asked to participate as a volunteer board member for the SMALL MIRACLES FOUNDATION, I readily accepted out of friendship and civic duty.  It has since become so much more.  At the onset,  My experience was very limited, but after two years on the board I have learned a great deal about charities in general. One of the FIRST things I discovered was that the percent of overhead speaks clearly about the charity itself. In most circles, a 40% overhead is considered good,  a portion of that being salaries.  The SMALL MIRACLES FOUNDATION can boast an only 2 to 3% overhead  (97/98% of funds received are available to the mission) and a COMPLETELY VOLUNTEER board. I believe that to be EXCEPTIONAL.The SMALL MIRACLES FOUNDATION can also claim to have a PHENOMENAL response time to requests received. After receiving a request and reviewing it,  the payment is generally made within  24 to 72 hours.  And, at least on two occasions, has been made, due to extreme circumstances, within 1 to 2 hours.  There is no waiting for a monthly or quarterly board meeting to discuss and review a request...With the use of fax and e-mail,  the ALL VOLUNTEER board can review and vote immediately.  And, if necessary, a request payment can be made over the phone.The requests received at the SMALL MIRACLES FOUNDATION are wide ranging and generally accepted. The foundation has covered the transportation costs of a grandmother, unable to drive, taking her granddaughter to the hospital for treatments....It has purchased a wig for a teen girl who lost her hair during chemo therapy...It has covered the rent for a single mother having to take a leave from work while staying by her young son's bedside during his hospital stay.  It has covered pharmacy and medical costs, car payments, utility bills, and so many more daily expenses that seem monumental when facing the heartbreak and stress of a child diagnosed with cancer.The SMALL MIRACLES FOUNDATION is indeed a UNIQUE and EXCEPTIONAL charity.  It is proudly able to claim EXTRAORDINARY benefits to those in need.

Every aspect of my interaction with SART followed this to the letter. The process was, as you can imagine, difficult. However, I received the help needed to get me through the tough time, and continue through to the healing stage. I owe SART an abundance of appreciation, as I wouldn't have been able to do any of it without them. Much love from a healing victim...
Jackson County Sart	280079	1	/users/profile/369947	Writer	Client Served	1	02/13/2016	The woman who runs this cares about "changing things" and not the actual individual who was raped. Reporting to the police through this program was a lie. My rights were trampled and she did not follow ethical guidelines. This "advocate" kept pushing me to drop the case. I got a confession and no justice at all. I was treated with pretty horrible disrespect and the emotional damage done to me by this woman and the police was profound. My advice is don't bother reporting your rape in the Rogue Valley. You will get no justice.

Ano's Art	32560	2	/users/profile/33380	pdxam	Volunteer	5	03/05/2010	Ano's Art is a truly great art studio. The warm atmosphere nurtures creativity and fun for students of all ages and artistic abilities. Besides being an extremely talented artist, Ano Youssefian is a warm-hearted and loving teacher. She treats all the children as if they were her own children and showers the students with love and support. She caters each class to the individual abilities and personalities of its students. I attended Ano's Art Academy when in Elementary School, and while art is not the direction I ended up taking, I am still very thankful for my wonderful experience at Ano's Art. I strongly recommend the Academy to any elementary through High School student who is looking for a fun place to explore and develop their artistic creativity.
Ano's Art	28109	5	/users/profile/29187	fireflyab	General Member of the Public	5	02/12/2010	Ano's Art is a wonderful place where kids can create art in various mediums under the nurturing guidance of its instructor, Ano Youseffian. Ano is a warm and vibrant teacher.  She knows art and loves to nurture the artist in every child.  She makes each of her students feel like a special individual with a worthy and creative voice.Our daughter has been attending Ano's Art for over 3 years now and she looks forward to art class every Friday.  The friendships she have made there are priceless. The students are of mixed ages and the advice and opinions shared on their artwork are always appreciated and respected by all.  Ano's Art is more than an art class - it's being part of one big artistic family.  Art is a creative process and when you're happy and content, you create more quality art.
The Elizabeth Bowers Zambia Education Fund	216176	2	/users/profile/279638	Emily_M.	Volunteer	5	09/21/2014	EBZEF has shown that if you truly have a passion about something you can create something far beyond expectations and help others. Everyone who helps out with EBZEF sees the passion behind the board members and especially the founder, Linda Bowers. She has committed many years to this organization with her daughter as her motivation.  EBZEF is a great non-profit to support, every dollar donated has had a great impact on the Zambian women education. EBZEF has big plans and needs the support of everyone they can get! The secondary school they are planning on creating will take a plethora of support. I'm amazed about how much impact this small non-profit has had in Zambia and would highly recommend supporting this non-profit if you can! 
The Elizabeth Bowers Zambia Education Fund	212982	4	/users/profile/276093	Gunnar G.	Donor	5	09/01/2014	I have supported this fund since its foundation.  It is named for Elizabeth Bowers, a young woman who worked for my University, Tokyo International University of America (TIUA), which is affiliated with Willamette University, both located in Salem, Oregon.  During her employment with us, Beth was an example of someone who knew the power of "giving back."  She worked with our students from Willamette's sister university (Tokyo International University/Japan).  She demonstrated leadership, conscientiousness, professionalism, and, above all, a sincere caring attitude about others, whether they were the students she was guiding, or her faculty and staff colleagues.  When I heard that Beth had joined the Peace Corps and was assigned to work in Zambia, I was not surprised.  We were all very happy for her and proud of our association with such an outstanding young person.  Beth met with a tragic accident, riding her bicycle along a roadway in the local area, near the village where she was working.  In a very short time, Beth had become a member of this community and had already made an important impact.  That village has adopted Beth as one of their native children.  She lives today for them and through the EBZEF efforts started by her parents, Linda and Gerry, her impact continues to multiply.  As a result of this fund, which has a clear and dedicated focus on the education of the young people in that area, especially young women, Beth is still very much alive in the hearts of everyone who knows her and thanks her for what she has done, and continues to do, to help young people achieve their dreams.  These efforts have included the building of school buildings, a library, and the establishment of scholarship funds that have helped young women achieve their goals beyond what would have been possible otherwise.  Every time that I donate to EBZEF I know, firsthand, that the donation is going to forward the original purpose behind Beth's first contribution that she gave, and gives, through her service to her adopted community.  I encourage others to consider donating to this important cause.

Their founder Genny Nelson has been a key player in Portland's efforts to make ending homeless a priority for 30 years, and the organization continues to focus on it. Sisters helps homeless parents and children and other individuals get a good meal and treats them with respect and love. People can trade barter work for meals, play with their little ones in the children's area, and get referrals and other support. The combo of direct service and systemic change is hard to find, and Sisters does it well.
ETHOS INC	92112		/users/profile/105556	Pankratz	General Member of the Public	5	06/26/2011	I had a stack of instructional music manuals that I wanted to donate.

Echo Theater Company	287008		/users/profile/377080	Marika_R	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	Creativity For LifeI started going to classes at the Echo Theater when I was three, (I'm 34 now). The Echo Theater became my second home the teachers became my older siblings, surrogate parents, and friends. For 17 years I performed, took class, taught class, toured, created work, saw shows, meet some of my best friends, and had the most supportive creative experiences ever. I grew up at the Echo Theater, they saw me graduate high school, sent me off to college, and welcomed me home, with open arms every holiday break. Living across the country my time performing with the Echo Theater Company inspired me to study theater, then go on to get my masters in dance/movement therapy and keep my creativity alive. I now work with performers on sustaining creativity across the country, and truly believe that my beginnings at the Echo Theater helped shape the work I do and why I love to do it. I wouldn't be the person I am today without the amazing experiences I had with the Echo Theater Company. Somewhere there are pictures of my three year old self sanding a wall and helping remodel the entryway! I love how many memories I have that include the Echo Theater and how much I was given by being a part of this incredible community. Not only did I learn how to juggle, fly, and hone my physical theater skills, I learned how to be me, in all my creative glory, and that gift is priceless.http://www.echotheaterpdx.org/
Echo Theater Company	287007		/users/profile/377079	Arcadia_T	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	Life Mirrors ArtOn dark winter mornings, I struggled to pry open my eyes and pull myself from a warm dream world. But, as I stared into the dark, I would remember my newest acrobatic piece. Middle school was rough and nothing I looked forward to but I got out of bed each morning because I wanted to try out my new performance ideas. While dressing and packing, I would begin to excitedly pace around the room planning which of my fellow performers would stand where, how we could climb up each other, and what kind of music would play. Soon I felt thrilled to be awake and moving and even more so to have a purpose in my life. Echo Theater Company (http://www.echotheaterpdx.org/) gave me a place where, at a young age, I could contribute my energy and passion. Echo Theaters youth company was the first place where people  children and adults  really listened to my ideas. Our directors, Wendy Cohen and Aaron Wheeler-Kay, led the group but we were expected to collaborate with each other to create our performances. The group consisted of other middle and high school aged youth and together we discovered how to give to a group effort  sometimes by proposing ideas and sometimes by agreeing to let them go for the good of the whole performance. This learning process was sometimes challenging as we struggled to find a way to be heard and to listen. I remember the rehearsals for one piece in which we constantly argued over parts until Aaron suggested we use these squabbles to create a comical act. The piece became fun and delightful to perform because it was so honest to our actual experience of collaboration. Art mirrors life, Aaron chuckled. When I look back at the five years I spent in Echo Theaters youth company, I cant help but wonder if life also mirrors art. As I learned to communicate, to be brave with my contributions, humble with my desire for recognition, and to value, above all, the success of the collective group, I became a more confident and considerate person outside of the theater. Now I am twenty-five. I am not a professional acrobat or a theater director but I care deeply about community. I have worked in Latin America and the US for social justice and childrens rights.  I care about the needs of others and I am confident that my ideas and passion can make a difference. For these beliefs, I wholeheartedly thank Echo Theater Company for giving me a place where I could give, and by giving become part of my first community.

I am a veterinarian and I know the healing power that animals can offer people. Chewey is such a smart and beautiful dog. He works very hard taking care of Kaleb and keeping him safe. ASDA has become a part of my family and made us whole again. This is a wonderful organization and needs donations to be able to continue helping families like ours.
Autism Service Dogs Of America	71849	3	/users/profile/78562	glendafh	Donor	5	02/20/2011	Our grandson Kaleb was diagnosed with autism at the age of two.  Life as we all knew it changed with that diagnosis.  Kaleb was unable to face life situations and even the smallest issue could become a nightmare.  That was before "Chewey " came into Kaleb's life and the world became a less frightening place.  Chewey is a yellow Lab that was trained by ASDA and has now become Kaleb's best friend and lifeline.  This animal is a miracle and it is all because of ASDA and the work they do for autistic children.  These dogs make life situations possible again for the children and their families.  We can not begin to express our gratitude for what Chewey has done for Kaleb and our entire family.

When I first joined NTEN, I had no idea the community and education I would receive  and my entire team has advanced their use of technology through our membership. I highly recommend NTEN's annual Nonprofit Technology Conference. Their Nonprofit Technology Academy is also a must for any staff who are responsible for technology. I look forward to growing my involvement with NTEN in all the ways that I can. 
NON-PROFIT TECHNOLOGY ENTERPRISE NETWORK	155477		/users/profile/170617	Carolyn Appleton	Volunteer	5	04/20/2013	I became a volunteer for NTEN a few years ago. I was searching online for information about constituent data management systems for two nonprofits with which I was working. I discovered an eye-opening vendor satisfaction report on the NTEN website, and there my adventure began. The report helped make my work much easier, it definitely helped my nonprofits, and soon thereafter I became an NTEN member.  Eventually, I was invited to speak at the 2010 Nonprofit Technology Conference in Atlanta, which I enjoyed greatly. I have served on two committees, the NTC Organizing Committee (fundraising track), and the Membership Committee. In 2011, I was honored to receive an NTENy award for my membership recruitment efforts. The way society communicates and works has changed greatly, and it continues to evolve. NTEN has helped me lose my fear of new technological developments, and to embrace them heartily.

Badger Run Wildlife Rehab	199970		/users/profile/261030	Liz_41	Board Member	5	05/09/2014	Badger Run has been a work in progress for many years. Every penny raised is put back into the growth of the facility and the medical needs of each patient. It has been a pleasure working with the organization and watching the growth and dedication of all the volunteers. The organization is a great asset to the community. lr
Badger Run Wildlife Rehab	24062	1	/users/profile/25175	Barrel Builders	General Member of the Public	5	12/14/2009	I've been watching Liz Diver build BR for several years now and her skills and compassion are incredible. As someone who actively birds and spends time outdoors, I know firsthand the need for quality wildlife care and rehabilitation. She's committed and caring and the need in her area is huge. BR deserves the support and help of anyone who cares about wild creatures from birds to Badgers.
NATIONAL ALLIANCE ON MENTAL ILLNESS OF CLACKAMAS COUNTY	208643		/users/profile/271377	PNordbye	Board Member	5	08/05/2014	Our family has been dealing with affects of mental illness our whole lives.  My sister, my brother and myself have finally come together as a family after years of separation, anger and frustration.  By taking the Family to Family class four years ago, which provided so much valuable information, the healing has begun.  We are finally learning to enjoy each other and have learned to put much of our past in a proper perspective.
NATIONAL ALLIANCE ON MENTAL ILLNESS OF CLACKAMAS COUNTY	207242		/users/profile/269863	mveenker	Client Served	5	07/25/2014	It was because of NAMI Clackamas and it volunteers that I was better able to understand my daughter, learn how to advocate for her and navigate complex systems of care.  It is because of NAMI Clackamas volunteers that the housing that she lived in for 5 years as she became more stable, existed.  I owe my daughter's life to NAMI and my sanity.  For full disclosure, I was so impressed by this organization and what they did for my family, that I went back to school, Portland State University, in nonprofit management and development.  I later wrote a grant that provided funds for NAMI Clackamas' first paid employee and applied for the position.  I am pleased to say I have worked here for 4 years now and love NAMI Clackamas and those we serve as much as when I began.
Meriwether Lewis Memorial Eisteddfod Foundation	69400		/users/profile/75837	Nola	Volunteer	5	02/16/2011	Like many Americans, I have roots in many countries. Until recently few roots were traced to me and I felt compelled to find others. The Welsh root, once found, has been nourished by my association with the Meriwether Lewis Memorial Eisteddfod Foundation, through volunteering in their festivals, as a participant in photographic and writing competitions, as audience to live music and especially in interactions with Welsh authors.  One of the founders is my daughter who has always been interested in her personal history and that of particular peoples. At the latest Eisteddfod, the storytellers were particularly delightful as this form reconnected me in a powerful way with my youth, my children's and grandchildren's.  Storytelling was an important part of our families' social interactions. It's what we do at all our gatherings, in reminiscence and as catch up about our lives spent apart. The feeling is very different from that when stories are read, to you or alone.  The connection is full, immediate.  I believe there is much potential in this foundation, for projects and activities that have yet been imagined or launched, and plan to continue my support.
Meriwether Lewis Memorial Eisteddfod Foundation	68686		/users/profile/75052	David Western	Donor	5	02/15/2011	I was inspired to become a donor to the Meriwether Lewis Memorial Eisteddfod because I believe the Welsh culture is seriously under-represented in North America.  While everyone knows the cultural contributions of the Irish and the Scottish, few know anything of the Welsh.   It is my belief that the M.L.M.E offers both Welsh-North Americans and those interested in Welsh culture an opportunity to sample it in a way that is modern, vibrant and valid.  It represents the Welsh of today,  and their achievements, contributions and aspirations in North American society.  The M.L.M.E is inclusive and welcoming to all who have an interest in things Welsh and I am very proud to be associated with it.

Klamath Siskiyou Wildlands Center	23074	10	/users/profile/24130	telefriend	General Member of the Public	1	11/27/2009	Given the aggressive posture of this long-in-the-tooth non-profit organization, a lack of research (and credibility) reveals unrealistic aspirations. In short, KS Wild is way ahead of itself with marketing more than they're prepared to deliver.
United Way Of Lane County	287005		/users/profile/377077	Heather_Q	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	In 2011, I finally realized I was in an abusive relationship. My husband constantly told me that I was worthless, cursed at me, forbid me from spending time with my family, refused to care for our then three year old son, and repeatedly threatened me with physical violence. I made the decision to file for divorce because I did not want my son, Elijah, to grow up thinking that it was okay to be verbally and emotionally abusive to anyone, let alone someone you were supposed to love. I informed my husband of my intention to leave him. He immediately emptied our join bank account and moved out. Just a short while later, I lost my job. I went from living in a two-income household to living with no income. In no time at all, shut off notices started arriving and we were quickly running out of food and other necessities. I did not have a strong support system since I was not allowed to develop any friendships while I was married. It got to the point that I was grocery shopping out of my mom's pantry in order to feed my toddler.With the thought of becoming homeless in the middle of winter in Oregon looming in my mind, I made, what turned out to be, a life changing phone call. I called 211info, a information and referral program funded by the United Way of Lane County, and explained my situation. I was expecting the operator to refuse to help me because I was on the verge of homelessness due to filing for divorce; my soon-to-be ex-husband was quick to point out how horrible of a mother I was for putting our son in this predicament (though he refused to pay child support). Much to my surprise, the operator was very kind and understanding. She put me in contact with an agency that was able to provide Elijah and I with a food box and some household items; Elijah also received a toy from this agency and he has it on his bed to this day (he is now 7).  I was also given the contact information for an agency that paid my utility bill and yet another agency who provided counseling to Elijah and I, free of charge.I found out later that all of these agencies, as well as 211info, received funding from the United Way of Lane County.  Since acquiring a new job, I have made it my personal mission to give back to the United Way in any way I can. Without the support from United Way's partner agencies, my toddler and I would likely have been hungry and homeless in the middle of an Oregon winter. Over the last four years, I have donated my time to the United Way by speaking about my experience with the United Way and its partner agencies every chance I get. I also participate on the steering committee for the United Way of Lane County's Emerging Leader program, a group of professionals under the age of 40 who are focused on bettering the community through volunteering and advocating. In 2014, I remarried and we asked our wedding guests to support the United Way instead of buying us another toaster. My new husband and I also donate to the United Way at the Leadership Giving level ($1,000 or more in a calendar year). I cannot think of a more deserving nonprofit. Thousands of people in my situation, or worse off, are helped each year by the United Way of Lane County and their partner agencies. http://www.unitedwaylane.org/ 
United Way Of Lane County	84489		/users/profile/93455	Cheryl Crumbley	Professional with expertise in this field	5	03/31/2011	United Way of Lane County (UWLC) is classified by Charity Navigator as a fundraising organization. As such, UWLC's rating is solely determined by revenue growth per Federal Form 990. There is no measurement of community development, United Ways proven strength.  Past fundraising success has been dependent on grant revenue (for work in health and education) and our workplace campaigns. Grant awards to all nonprofits have been diminished by the recession. Workplace campaigns in this region have been severely reduced by workplace closures that left Lane County, Oregon with double-digit unemployment rates. Based on revenue growth and sound fiscal management, UWLC was a 4-Star Charity before the recession.   This drop in income has required signifcant budget cuts for UWLC so that it can continue to fund 44 partner agencies, exercise prudent governance, and  expanded its role as a community convener.  Developing key community partnerships, along with accessing and leveraging resources other than money, are not reflected on Federal Form 990 but have resulted in streamlined community-wide improvements in access to healthcare, moving families from poverty to self-sufficiency, the reduction of child abuse, early childhood literacy, and service access through the 211 system.
Stand For Children Leadership Center	99470	7	/users/profile/119676	Simonpaddock	Volunteer	1	10/19/2011	I spent several years as a  Stand for Chidren member and activist. in the beginning Stand was very helpful in organizing our community around education funding issues. We got some great training and our membership grew. Then everything changed. Stand decided they they no longer needed us or our community. Only later did I discover that it was because they decided to go with the money provided by large wealthy charities that were looking for fronts for their agenda. Stand Children now represents the interests of the Walton Foundation, The Gates Foundation and many other powerful political interests. They are no longer a grassroots organization. I am very sad about how this all played out.
Stand For Children Leadership Center	97146	9	/users/profile/113663	Kris Alman	Volunteer	1	09/03/2011	I used to be a donor and volunteer for Stand for Children. That was at a time when it was actually striving to be a grassroots organization in Oregon. In 2006, I protested to leadership when SFC decided to create this 501(c)4. I knew that these political activities would outstrip the 501(c)3 and the mission of the organization would be distorted by the wealthy elite. I am struck by the only "news" you have on this organization is a puff piece coming from Colorado. So let me give you a couple other links to add to the news.http://www.portlandtribune.com/news/story.php?story_id=131105508519296400 http://www.substancenews.net/articles.php?page=1948 http://parentsacrossamerica.org/2011/07/jonah-edelman-on-outfoxing-teachers-unions-transcribed-remarks/ I would give this organization 0 stars if I could. With the help of an oligarchy, it (with Jonah Edelman as leader) is out to destroy public schools--and with that, will go our democracy. Kris Alman
Edwards Work-Activity Center, Inc.	147252		/users/profile/194532	Andy V.	General Member of the Public	5	12/25/2012	My Brother David is one of the earliest residents at Edwards center. As far as I know, the only one who came in as a physical injury patient. David was in an accident in 1972, that was supposed to have claimed his life. When he survived and actually came out of the coma, the doctors were in denial. They said that there was just too much brain mass destroyed in the accident. They gave us instructions on how to take care of David, and sent him home. With the direct and explicit knowledge that he would not survive the year. I was young then, and I do not fully recall how Edwards came into the picture. I think it was through the news paper articles and the church. Anyways, they came and talked to my parents. " A new and evolutionary" plan. A home with 24 hour care, Dr's on staff and on call. Dave not only survived the year, he has survived almost 40 years. He has had a life. he has had Jobs.  A job people, Dave loved working. I can not express enough the amount of respect and devotion I can give these people. They gave me my brother.

Ospirg Foundation Inc	189752		/users/profile/247707	Rob_23	Donor	5	12/03/2013	At a time in our country where corporations have unprecedented influence on public policy, OSPIRG is a champion of the public interest.  I have been an OSPIRG member and donor for years, and have been very impressed with some of their accomplishments, both at the local scale, here in Oregon, and nationally as part of USPIRG.  They have been known in the past for their environmental work, but recently have been focused on consumer issues.  Such as stopping tax-payer subsidies for big agra businesses like Mosanto, and keeping health insurance rates down in Oregon.  Every year, a canvasser comes to my door to renew my membership.  I don't normally give to organizations at my doorstep, but the canvassers from OSPIRG are extremely professional and well informed about the issues, and I feel comfortable supporting them this way. 
Ospirg Foundation Inc	46532	4	/users/profile/47367	bethechange1	Donor	5	06/29/2010	OSPIRG is amazing. Their canvassers are so friendly. This year they are working on improving the standards meat in the school lunch program. They are an organization defending the interest of the public and standing up to powerful interest. The are funded 96% by their citizen members and the other 4% is from grant money. With all the corruption these days, there should be more organizations like OSPIRG.
WELLMAMA INC	195708		/users/profile/255912	naturenow	Volunteer	5	03/16/2014	I'm most impressed with how WellMama uses funds. Their staff is insanely small - one ED who only works part-time. Everything is run by volunteers who are passionate about helping moms during the stressful and turbulent time of pregnancy (and post-pregnancy). They also work with medical professionals to make sure that women are being screened for post-partum depression and that everyone has access to helpful tools and resources!
WELLMAMA INC	118053	1	/users/profile/160564	Mommadai	Donor	5	07/10/2012	WellMama is respectful and hopeful for all women experiencing stress and depression during pregnancy and the first year after the birth of their baby. They teach and encourage women, partners and family members throughout Oregon and the United States to be a part of the movement toward ending the shame of this temporary illness. WellMama's support groups help women to heal and often they become support group volunteer leaders themselves. Our donations are thoughtfully applied to women who need help bonding with their babies, communicating their needs, and understanding their illness and ways to feel better.

Eugene Masonic Cemetery Association Inc	236480		/users/profile/320400	AlexBrokaw	Board Member	5	01/07/2015	This cemetery is a beautiful natural place located on the side of a gentle hill centrally located in the City of Eugene. It has towering trees, native understory trees and plants, and an area of oak savanna.  In addition, the cemetery has a historic mausoleum, Hope Abbey, which has been nearly restored to its original Egyptian Revival splendor. Even though this is a Pioneer Cemetery and Mausoleum, it is fully functioning and has spaces available for coffin burial, cremains burial, and has a lovely designated Scatter Garden. I know this because I have three members of my family in their final resting places under a grand towering oak. My family and I love this cemetery because it is picturesque and tranquil, because of its historical significance, and because it is a joy to walk on the many trails that are open to the public. We have planned for the future and will become residents but with luck, exercise and a good diet at a much late date! 
Eugene Masonic Cemetery Association Inc	236138	1	/users/profile/319944	John312	Board Member	5	01/01/2015	The Eugene Masonic Cemetery Association (EMCA) is the oldest operating cemetery in Eugene, dating to 1859. The EMCA was incorporated in 1995 to take over ownership and maintenance responsibilities from Eugene Masonic Lodge #11. The property is 10 acres of trees, bushes and flowers with monuments throughout. Wildlife abounds. 2 1/2 miles of well maintained trails allow easy access to the hilly site. The imposing 100 year old Hope Abbey Mausoleum is a prominent landmark. Functionally, the cemetery is a defacto city park even though it's privately owned and receives no financial help from the City of Eugene. The EMCA is a 501 (c) (3) non-profit organization with a totally volunteer Board of Directors. We have a budget in 2015 of about $100,000, the majority of which comes from the sale of lots, crypts and niches, as well as donations. The major expenditure is for payroll of our two part-time groundskeepers, plus our part-time administrator/sexton. Deductible contributions are always welcome, and can be made through PayPal via our website, or mailed to PO Box 5934, Eugene, OR, 97405.  Our website is available at eugenemasoniccemetery.org , and more information about the cemetery can be obtained by emailing to EMCA1859@gmail.com , or calling Sally Dietrich at (541) 684-0949. The cemetery is located in SE Eugene with the main gate at 25th and Potter. The grounds are open from dawn to dusk each day. The Hope Abbey Mausoleum is normally closed, but is open to the public on the last Sunday of each month (except December) from 1 to 4 PM. During the months of June, July, August and September, we have a free music concert in Hope Abbey at 2 PM to which everyone is invited. Music genres vary widely, from  classical to bluegrass to vocal.
Salem Youth Symphony Association	86646		/users/profile/97068	mom35	Client Served	5	04/21/2011	My experience with Salem Youth Symphony has been extremely positive. The conductors are very experienced and take a group of kids who have never played music together before and in 8 weeks have them playing Mozart and Tchaikovsky!  The leadership is very organized and professional as well as friendly and approachable.  There is always someone welcoming me when I come in the door and giving information about upcoming events.  I loved the annual fundraiser this year--very classy and fun to attend as well as bringing in good money for the organization.  Thanks, SYSA, for providing such a great opportunity for my child!
Salem Youth Symphony Association	81634	1	/users/profile/89462	TheParent	Board Member	2	03/09/2011	This organization has over 50 years behind them. They produce a good product. Sorry to say that they act like they are in the teen-age years of a business. They do not realize the importance of knowledgable leadership and have loaded their board with artsy minded members. They need a balance of practical real-world people on their board. Their current fund-raiser is a look-good event. Way too much money is being spent for what they will take in. Didn't learn in past years, still doing much the same this year.  High turn-over in Treasurers because they do not want to hear the real picture. They do not stick to their own rules set down in their by-laws. Neither do they change the by-laws to the way they now function.  Definately a feel-good group.
Nepali Host Family	122362		/users/profile/166632	florian	Volunteer	5	09/15/2012	Well as a frequent traveler to Nepal, I do like to spend some free time volunteering in this beautiful country. I have known Nepali Host Family organization from the beginning and have seen how they work, taken part in their volunteer programs and today feel great to review the organization. I have volunteered many times with this organization and each time I visit Nepal, I do meet their staffs who have been friends with me and it's like their home is my home. I got to know about them from my friend who also has been a volunteer in Nepal. The highlight of this organization is their Low cost volunteering or internships opportunities. It was hard to believe that they offer cheap volunteer fees compared to others. After actually doing the volunteer work, living in their hostel and watching everyday how they function in Nepal, I was clear about their mission and endeavour. This is a local volunteer organization so it has better understanding of the community, people and needs. The helpful staffs, cultural exchange programs, good Nepali food in hostel, great volunteer projects and an amazing opportunity they provide for the International volunteers in Nepal are the reasons why I would recommend this organization. I have done traveling a lot as well as trekking in Nepal. I have been to villages with their staff doing community volunteering and would like to see Nepali Host Family running their programs far from Kathmandu and spreading to rural parts as well. I would also like to request upcoming volunteers to fundraise before traveling and help the Nepalese society. 
Nepali Host Family	121516		/users/profile/165338	Kate Slomiay	Volunteer	4	08/28/2012	Volunteering abroad was my dream and I had looked into various organizations for volunteer opportunities online. Most of the volunteer programs offered there was really out of my budget because I am a University student. I am a medical student in Germany and was looking to volunteer in Nepal. Thank god! I heard about Nepali Host Family from my friend who volunteered with them two years ago.  I looked into this organization and got to know about their work in Nepal. From the first email contact to the date of my departure from Nepal, Nepali Host Family staff have provided every kind of support. I fell in love with the small kids from my volunteering placement  and I feel very satisfied to be able to volunteer with children in Nepal, a totally new experience. What can I say about Nepal, amazing country and I did Annapurna base camp trekking, Pokhara, Chitwan tour. Nepalese people are so friendly. One early morning, I had to go to Thamel, the center of Kathmandu to catch a bus for my Chitwan trip. Unfortunately that day was a Strike of public transportation in Nepal. So i couldn't find any buses or taxi to go to Thamel. Thamel was 25 minutes away in a taxi from my accommodation. Luckily a Nepali family offered me a ride on their private car. This shows how big heart they have. Well to sum up, I had a good experience in Nepal both traveling and volunteering with Nepali Host Family organization which I would recommend to everybody because they are a Non profit, organized and trustworthy.

Health In Harmony Inc	321539		/users/profile/414943	L.ChowMD	Volunteer	5	01/18/2017	I met Dr. Kinari Webb in 2005 when Health In Harmony (HIH) was yet a dream of possibility and have been a financial supporter since HIHs inception.   I have seen consistently excellent stewardship of the resources given to this organization  not just treasures received but time and talent donated as well.  Additionally, the partnership between HIH and their Indonesian partner, ASRI, is a model of mutually supportive interdependence, international partnership at its best.  The radical listening that has been done in the communities they serve has resulted in meaningful and sustainable change that benefits not just those whose needs are directly met but all of us who live on this planet as well.  I have personally spent time there in 2014 and 2016 so am also speaking from in-person, on-site experience.  If you are looking to contribute to accountable, meaningful work then I encourage you to support Health In Harmony.
Health In Harmony Inc	321344		/users/profile/414657	Alex65	Volunteer	5	01/16/2017	I spent 6 weeks with HIH/ASRI at their site in Borneo as a medical student. Given a lifelong interest in environmental sustainability as well as human health, I was attracted to the program by the mission of providing healthcare while protecting the rainforest. Upon arrival, I was thrilled to find a community-driven effort built to empower the local community and create sustainable change. Rather than imposing Western ideas, the organization draws from the genius of the place to develop creative and effective programs that evolve out of the locals'  experience with the unique resources and challenges of life in West Kalimantan. I saw every member of the team--including security guards, various program members (e.g. conservation, children's program, Goats for Widows), and clinic directors take turns leading morning meeting, discussing their concerns, and sharing new ideas. Outside of the obvious impact on lives I witnessed in clinic daily, I met a farmer whose life was transformed through his ASRI/HIH sponsored training in organic farming, met ex-loggers turned into forest guardians, and sat with a team of village leaders celebrating their success in fighting tuberculosis in their communities with their ASRI/HIH partnership. These are just some of the many profound stories that emerged regularly during my stay. On a personal note, spending time with Dr. Kinari Webb, an incredibly inspiring person, re-awakened my own desire to live a purposeful life driven by my inner guidance and the needs of the people and planet, in part through a career in family medicine for the underserved. I cannot more highly recommend becoming a part of this organization directly or through providing financial support! Thank you HIH/ASRI!

I would like to tell the public, private business, church organization or other to please not give anymore money to the Helping Hands Shelter untill questions are answered reguarding the new Excutive Director Paul N Barnes and his background and his resume he used to gain employment. I'm researching his resume and what I have found is disturbing to say the least. He has misrepresented himself, ommited important facts about bankruptcy, being a felon, kidnaping, domestic violence etc. Since Paul has found out I'm researching his resume and back ground has taken my church privledges, bible study, and all other privledges away. He has done this with me breaking no rules whatsoever at the shelter. He has or told his staff to call the police if I came on the property. Until I tell him where I had gotten the information. I threatened to sue over this matter to gain my church, bible study and privledges restored. I have much more to share about Mr. Barnes. The accountant that worked for the shelter for 10 years has resigned and a fine tuned machine, transparent business is turning into a clouded nightmare. Which opens the door for dishonesty. I have went to the board members three times to discuss this problem but to no avail. I'm raising questions that should be answered before anyone donates money.

Urban League Of Portland	148109	2	/users/profile/196066	Stephen Reichard	Volunteer	5	01/15/2013	With a very small budget, the Urban League of Portland manages to be at virtually every table in the greater Portland area that has anything to do with people of color. And despite the fact that it is in demand everywhere, and the fact that they have a small budget, they manage to get very important things done - both legislatively as well as substantively. The staff is grossly underpaid but they stick around anyway. Their new CEO is charismatic, smart and humble.

The Oregon Foundation for Reproductive Health	38992	3	/users/profile/39923	tracy5	Board Member	5	05/14/2010	I have served on the Board of the Oregon Foundation for Reproductive Health (OFRH) since 2005, and have very much enjoyed working with the staff and other volunteers.  Most importantly, I have been thrilled to be part of an organization that make such a difference in women's lives.  With grant funds and individual donations, we have implemented a successful Emergency Birth Control (EBC) Access Project to increase awareness of EBC as a second chance to prevent pregnancy. OFRH is a statewide organization, but has focused efforts in rural areas where access to reproductive health care is most challenging.
The Oregon Foundation for Reproductive Health	38980	5	/users/profile/39911	pdxgeek	Volunteer	5	05/14/2010	The OFRH is a wonderful organization, working towards ensuring Oregon women have access to reproductive healthcare as well as Emergency Birth Control (EBC). OFRH does not provide direct services, but rather is helping to educate pharmacists and healthcare providers regarding EBC. They are currently conducting training sessions as well as compliance checks to ensure that pharmacists are following the rules regarding the dispensation of EBC. Their work is invaluable in helping Oregonians get much needed reproductive healthcare.The "Liberty Auction" is the major yearly fundraiser for OFRH, and is always fun. I've helped out 3 or 4 times over the past 6 years, and have always enjoyed working with the OFRH folks and meeting the people who come to their auction.

Assistance League Of Bend	136404	4	/users/profile/182316	Cindy J	Volunteer	5	11/09/2012	I joined Assistance League of Bend shortly after moving to Bend, Oregon, and it is one of the best things I've ever done!   This organization is completely hands on helping many people in our community:   we will provide brand new clothing to 1500 children in the Bend/LaPine School District this year, give joy and comfort to hundreds of seniors who otherwise might be forgotten through  Secret Santa and holiday table decorations, teach middle school students  about cooking and nutrition through after-school cooking classes, together with the Pine Tavern, provide a holiday gift and visit with Santa to foster families in the community, and make and deliver 60 - 75 hats and gowns each month to local cancer centers.  Through our two major fundraisers each year, a holiday Gala and springtime Kitchen Kaleidoscope, and generous support from the community,  we are able to fund all of these projects.   Working with over 130 caring, interesting, and passionate women is the best way to give back to our beautiful Bend community.

I saw an article for a concert in JustOut...my partner was not "excited" about catching a PGMC concert.  I persisted and we attended the holiday concert in 2000.  My one word to describe the performance..."WOW!"   Since then we have been season subscribers and added 2 additional subscriptons as our holiday gift to friends! Last year, I joined PGMC as a board director and continue to be season subscriber and invite more friends to the shows!    
Makena Childrens Foundation Inc	160291	1	/users/profile/212566	annebatzer	Volunteer	5	06/11/2013	The Makena Children's Foundation is a true labor of love.  In its sixteen year history of educating deserving Kenyan students, no American working for the Foundation has ever taken a salary or stipend. All are volunteers.  Overhead is very low because we all work from our homes, so there is no office rent.It is a cross-cultural partnership with the advice and input from Kenyans having equal value as that from Americans. The small, personal nature of this Foundation is why the "Makena kids," the students, are flourishing. Annually, we meet individually with each student, their school personnel and their parent or guardian. Physical, psychological and academic needs are openly discussed and addressed. We support the students through elementary, secondary and university education.

I have volunteered with REACH for several years now and each time I learn of a new, amazing thing they have done for our community.
Saint Child	95733		/users/profile/111247	Kathryn S.	Donor	5	08/15/2011	I love being at Saint Child and seeing how young women's lives are being changed.  One young woman came to us because she was "couch surfing" because her family life was very disfunctional.  She was looking for change.  Because of the support of Saint Child staff she grew as a person from one who was self centered and cared only about her own happiness to a person who was able to see that the best for her unborn baby girl would be to bless a family who could not have children.  She choose a open adoption and was happy to be able to visit her baby and watch her grow in a loving family.  Saint Child supported her through the pain of blessing a family through adoption with continued support and counseling.  She was able to transition to an apartment and continue on in her personal educational goals.Another young woman was pregnant and her husband of 3months had left her.  She was able to stay at Saint Child and work on her relationship with her husband.  They were able to reunite and have a beautiful baby boy.
Rogue Area Senior Computer Assistance League	233949	1	/users/profile/297981	Ernie C.

Classes are offered with volunteers putting on the classes, and they've been in existence for approximately seventeen years. The title of the club shows, basically, what the main philosophy is about this organization.

IAPF - International Anti-Poaching Foundation	322634		/users/profile/261250	KimMcCoy	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/03/2017	As a professional who works each day on African conservation, I know first hand the severe threats faced by African wildlife and habitats. Global criminal networks profit from illegally slaughtering keystone species like rhinos, elephants, and lions in unsustainable numbers. Without committed, well trained, and courageous anti-poaching rangers who place themselves in harm's way on a daily basis, these animals will disappear before our eyes. This is where an organization like the International Anti-Poaching Foundation steps into the void to make all the difference in biodiverse and critically-threatened African ecosystems. IAPF's direct action approach, combined with ranger training and education, in countries like Zimbabwe and Mozambique has generated profoundly impactful results. This small organization does a lot with a little for the benefit of all. Please consider supporting them.

Death With Dignity National Center	287011		/users/profile/377083	Brenda_W	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	I support Death with Dignity. My very dear grandparents both died from cancer. Really, they died from voluntary refusal of food and fluids, pumped with morphine (that barely managed their pain) as a result of the cancer that was killing them. It made me rage - it made my heart break -  that these two wonderful, giving, caring people had to have their family watch them suffer and die this terrible way. Worse - that of all the wonderful memories...this is my last memory of them. And so, for those that are dying from an illness that is killing you (and for 'us', the people that that love them). I support a dignified end-of-life option.I support www.DeathwithDignity.org.
African American Health Coalition	294556	1	/users/profile/385297	Writer	Former staff	1	07/02/2016	The AAHC is a dysfunctional, disorganized and disappointing organization. The CEO is incompetent and unable to facilitate a positive working environment, as evidenced by the high turnover in employees. While there is an undeniable need for health services and programs specifically tailored to the African American community in Portland, Oregon, this organization fails to deliver. The highlights of this organization are the discounted memberships to several community centers and pools in town, as well as the walking groups for senior citizens. Overall, the AAHC has the potential to provide beneficial programs and services, but not until there is a turnover in senior management. 
Celtic Heritage Alliance	214526		/users/profile/277797	Belinda G.

We do this by organizing annual events which feature Celtic heritage arts and crafts, food, music, dancing, language and all other forms which "culture and heritage" take.   We work to introduce others to the Celtic cultures of the seven currently recognized Celtic nations of Brittany (France), Cornwall (England), Galicia (Spain), Isle of Man (UK), Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Our goals are to offer the most authentic experience possible and we host several celebratory events throughout the year to include an annual Robert Burns Supper (January), St. Patrick's Day Celebration (March), the Newport Celtic Festival & Highland Games (June) and Celtic New Year Celebration (October/November). Our events have grown steadily each year since its inception in April 2010 and the inaugural events in 2011.  We hope to continue our mission to bring Celtic culture to the Oregon coast and create experiences and connections with others in the process. Belinda GoodyCHA President

Outside Initiatives	235123	1	/users/profile/313348	Leadhorse	Board Member	5	12/08/2014	This is the most important work I have ever done.  The idea to use GROUNDWORK with MINI HORSES to help teach self-mastery and build true leadership and strong character is an ingenious way to reach people of all backgrounds and ages and to help educate humanity about the amazing possibility of services horse are able to provide.  This one on one relationship with a horse includes active exploration of  traits like, honesty, courage, compassion, loyalty, consistency and patience, in the specially developed series: BUILDING TRUST THROUGH UNDERSTANDING.  It requires focus and elevated awareness of our body, its position, movement and carriage for all of this is the language used by these horses.  17 mini horses are kept in the herd setting when they are not busy training people.  This offers a setting that induces enough culture shock to induce participants abandon all preconceived notions about themselves and horses.  While they learn how to navigate the horse through obstacles, jumps or complicated dressage movements, they have to learn all about themselves,  the horse, their instincts and senses.  This is such a personal experience that self awareness progresses to self confidence and esteem in ways that are permanent and transferrable to other life situations.   We hear this from teachers, students and parents.  The minis have never failed.  Often people who have big horses are surprised by their affinity for this work and the huge amount they learn just about the horse in general!  This is the only program I know of that ensures advanced engineering and science courses along with exercise, recreation and social development skills.  What an efficient and effective program. 
Atma Foundation	161457	1	/users/profile/214138	jk22	Volunteer	5	06/26/2013	I have volunteered and coordinated events for this nonprofit and it was a great experience.

Its programs are also rooted in sustainability which is so important when working on such important issues. The Atma Foundation ensures that their effort brings change for generations. In their handling of DR Congo initiatives, they bring a special cultural awareness and true partnership with local communities. Their attention and forethought with their initiatives makes you feel like your money is really going to a good cause!

Harney Helping Organization For Personal Emergencies	63787		/users/profile/69728	Feather B.	Client Served	5	02/05/2011	I am very shocked that no one has written about the amazing people at the HHOPE Shelter for abused women and children.As a client, i know how many women and children have been helped just in the time I have been here.These people do all they can to help women and children get back on thier feet to live productive and safe lives again, giving them a safe place to be.I cannot say enough about this treasure in Burns. Right in the middle of nowhere is a Shelter for any woman that is afraid for their lives and the lives of their children.When I came here I was scared, lost and felt like a total failure. Laura, the Director, gave of herself and time to help me get past all of those fears, and gave me a place to call "home" until I find a way to get back on my feet again.I wish to thank Laura and the staff and all the board members for what they do and continue to do on a daily basis. I pray you are able to stay around for many years to come.
Ross Ragland Theatre	172908		/users/profile/228550	Lynne17	Board Member	5	10/02/2013	The Ross Ragland Theater and Cultural Center is celebrating its Silver Anniversary Season in 2013-2014, and what an amazing 25 years it has been! The Ragland opened in Klamath Falls in 1989 after years of grassroots fundraising and planning to save the Art-Deco Esquire movie theater from the wrecking ball and transform it into the arts, cultural, entertainment, educational and economic beacon of Southern Oregon.  In August the Ragland was one of the first theaters in the nation to buy the community theater rights and produce "Les Miserables" onstage with 65 performers and dozens of volunteers behind the scenes. It attracted audiences from across Oregon and Northern California whose consensus was the performance was as excellent as could be seen in Portland or San Francisco. Les Mis was the highest grossing production in the theater's history. The Silver Season formally kicked off Sept. 27 with a sellout concert by Lonestar and continues through next August with a variety of events for audiences of all ages and cultural interests: www.rrtheater.org.  Education is equally as important as arts and entertainment, with many performers visiting local schools. The theater presents 8-12 educational student matinee performances during each school year, after-school workshops and summer youth camps which teach students how to present a professional production from start to finish. Campers during summer of 2013 presented a fantastic version of Disney's The Little Mermaid. About 2/3 of children who attend workshops and camps qualify for full or partial income-based scholarships. In October 2013 the Ragland will reintroduce music and theater arts into Klamath County Elementary Schools in partnership with the school district, thanks to several major foundation grants. In 2004 when my husband were considering moving to Klamath Falls from a large city for a job offer, we may not have chosen to move had the Ragland not been here. I worked for a Ragland corporate sponsor from 2005-2008, have served on the board since 2009 and attended shows and events for over 8 years. We have an outstanding board, staff and volunteer guild. Executive Director Mark McCrary has both the performing arts and nonprofit management background necessary to orchestrate the million-dollar budget into events and programs that truly benefit the community. The Ragland is a community treasure in Klamath Falls, and a model arts organization to support and emulate.
Ashland Schools Foundation	183073		/users/profile/239981	JCarole	Volunteer	5	10/28/2013	The Ashland Schools Foundation (ASF) does incredible work to improve public education in our little town! By fundraising to help keep class sizes low, and by funding Impact Grants that keep arts and science and other classroom-based projects relevant. Just last weekend the ASF hosted a community-wide costumed fun run in our town's Lithia Park (called the Monster Dash!) and had nearly a thousand costumed runners participating! Every runner under age-18 gets a medal, no matter how fast they run (or walk!), and the community-spirited event earns money that goes directly back into the schools. I love the ASF, even though my own children are now in college, and will always be motivated to help with their mission - because it's fun!

Womens Empowerment Partnership Inc	155017	1	/users/profile/205873	laughlove	Client Served	5	04/16/2013	 I'm a grandmother raising my granddaughter. I've worked my entire life. I lost my job a couple of years ago.I searched for jobs non stop. When my unemployment ran out I wasn't sure what was going to happen to me and my grandchild. I knew of the Women's Empowerment Program and I turned to them. These people were so compassionate and caring. They talked to me and they listened. They helped me to be able to stay in my home, and food in our stomachs. Their trying to help me to find work. I've seen these women sit on street corners in 100 degree weather selling raffle tickets for an I-pad. After one of them had just had knee surgery. This organization goes the extra mile to help the people in our community. I've seen them pay for medications for diabetic patients. They've helped people to get back into school to give them hope for a life style that won't land them in poverty. That is their biggest mission is  to give them hope of getting out of poverty and making their life's better. To me they are guardian angels.

Oregon Food Bank Inc	206748	2	/users/profile/269211	nelsondrea	Volunteer	5	07/20/2014	I love volunteering for Oregon Food Bank. I have gone with school groups and with my children, and here's what I love about it: * It's easy. A very personable coordinator explains what the task for the day is (measuring rice, re-labeling product packaging, sorting potatoes), and the volunteers get right to work. It is very organized and the tasks are simple. * I feel very productive. I've been in other situations where the volunteers are standing around, looking for something to do next -- and it can make me question how much I'm really helping.* It's fun! Each table of volunteers figures out the best way to work together and gets into the groove. Good music is playing, and it's fun to chat with the other volunteers while you work.* It's great for kids. It is amazing how hard these kids work! And they often get into little competitions to see who can pack the most food. I also like that it reminds them that there are so many less fortunate people, and that they can help.* I FEEL LIKE I'M MAKING AN IMPACT. At the end of the shift, the coordinator tells us how many pounds of food we've packaged and how many people it will feed. I'm always stunned to hear how many people in Oregon are food insecure, and it feels good volunteer for an organization who's mission is to end hunger.

DO NOT send you child here they will not get the help they need. Staff do not have any therapy or medical certifications, you only have to have a high school diploma or a GED ( they send you for training) they do not run back ground checks. Do your research you will be surprised by what you find. Extremely dirty, urine, blood, fecal matter, no body cleans. Children have access to sharp objects and other items in order to hurt themselves or others. This is where violet offenders are sent who are unfit to stand trial. If you care about the success of your child this is not the place for them. This is a glorified juvenile detention center. Highly unsafe

Community Action Program Of East Central Oregon	50586	2	/users/profile/51107	ogjeff	Professional with expertise in this field	3	08/17/2010	Donna Kinnaman is the CCS Executive Officer and in the last two years 2009/10 has paid her self $140,000 thousand dollars. It's probable Ms. Kinnaman has paid her self close to 1.5 million dollars and has MGN staff who earn just under this. Staff at CAPECO exhibit what we term, trained incapacities and fail to meet the needs of the local homeless and transients who pass through Pendleton, Oregon. There is no shelter for the homeless and they are allowed up to eight showers per month at an RV Park which is a two mile trek from SE 2nd St.CAPECO and COC of Oregon with HUD say they have a plan to end homelessness in ten years. I say this is a lie. Jesus Christ said 2000 years ago, that the poor will always be with us. Two thousand years later they are still here. And ten years from now, Pendleton Oregon will still not provide basic lodging for the homeless or understand the needs of the area poor unless the area residents take an active interest in how CAPECO does business. Currently the State of Oregon has the highest unemployment in history and CAPECO MGN pay themselves salaries that rival private business. Over ninety percent of CAPECO funding is by US tax payers provided under Federal Grants. In two years CAPECO received 13 million dollars in GRANTS and to date, there is no place for the area needy to shower without waiting up to four hours for a voucher at Helping Hands. CAPECO does great work providing employement to area residents by over staffing. They do do good work with winter energy assistance, and like programs. However, the self sufficiency prgram is a failure when they supplement drug addicts not in recovery. These addicts take advantage of the program by depending on this and thus put more money towards addiction.
Work Unlimited	61525	2	/users/profile/67178	SGB90	Professional with expertise in this field	1	01/28/2011	This company is by far the worst company in the non-profit sector. They take advantage of the residents served and there is, no doubt in my mind, shady practice within this company from "residential program specialist" stealing money from clients and covering it up with "cash spent" in money logs to the higher ups embezzling money into their own family bank accounts. I know for a fact that one CONVICTED CRIMINAL had his background check pushed through so that he could be employed by this company. His relations to the company/family, (which is one in the same) a nephew. He had JUST gotten out of prison from a 2 year stint. Work Unlimited must be investigated! There is no reason for the residents in this company to suffer because the employees are trying to get something out of it. The outrageous spending on personal items with company money is unacceptable. The use of company vehicles for personal use is unacceptable. The use of company items such as vacuums, carpet cleaners, and food is unacceptable. Where is the justice for these residents!? Who is going to help them stick up for themselves!? When will the stealing STOP!? The resident abuse, STOP!?Please, take into consideration this review. Look into the shady practice performed by most all employees. These residents lives, homes and well being truly depend on it. 
Committed Alliance To Strays	235362		/users/profile/318410	Carianti	Client Served	5	12/12/2014	C.A.T.S. is a wonderful and dedicated organization in this small community.  I have had many dealings with them through the years as I own a small farm just North of town.  There have been three occasions where feral cats have decided to have their babies in my barn.  I have, of course, provided food and shelter and, when Momma and Poppa are available, have had them spayed and neutered.  All the kittens were welcomed by C.A.T.S. for adoption which at least provided hope for these beautiful creatures.  C.A.T.S. was most generous with their advice and care and the only request from them was that I handle the kittens as often as possible so as to socialize them so they would have a better chance for adoption.  This I did with pleasure! I have visited their facilities numerous times and found the atmosphere most loving, totally clean and non-odorous, well organized and staffed with trained professionals and many loving volunteers.  I know the kittens are in excellent hands! I have nothing but total respect and trust in this small organization and they provide such a needed service in this rural community.   And, by the way, I have a small stipend sent to C.A.T.S to help in their good work.  I have no reservations about this but give to the best of my ability.
Arthritis Foundation	287014		/users/profile/377086	Kaitlyn_W	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	A Personal ConnectionI share my time, talent, and treasure with the Arthritis Foundation (www.arthritis.org). I previously worked for the Arthritis Foundation-Northeast Region and now volunteer with the Arthritis Foundation-Metropolitan Washington Chapter. When I was a staff member, I always said my work with the Arthritis Foundation was personal and professional. The perception of this disease is quite different than the reality. Arthritis affects over 50 million Americans, including 300,000 children. It affects individuals of all ages and includes more than 100 disease types, including rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile arthritis, and other auto-immune diseases. The Arthritis Foundation supports scientific research, offers a variety of resources and support, and provides a community for those affected by the disease. I have been involved with the Arthritis Walk, Jingle Bell Run/Walk, Arthritis Advocacy Summit, and National Juvenile Arthritis Conference, among others. The highlight of all of these events is working with incredibly dedicated volunteers. These individuals give their own time, talent, and treasure and do so in addition to all of their other responsibilities. We all come together around a common goal  supporting those that live with the disease.  My work with the Arthritis Foundation continues to be meaningful because it is personal. I am motivated by the volunteers with whom I have worked over the years and by the special people in my own life. They are some of the strongest people I know.
Vernonia Emergency Radio Association	275840		/users/profile/365512	DawnChere	Volunteer	5	01/06/2016	I am a member of VERA / VARK during the 2007 winter storm that resulted in flooding, power outages, and loss of 911 capabilities on the coast, our first radio operator worked as a go between with our county 911 center where calls were rerouted if possible to the local emergency services on the coast to get responders where they were needed.  We also passed messages as needed for our own Emergency Operations center to the county for additional support and supplies. we have been attempting to get more amateur radio operators in our area to work with us on the city county and state level including offering classes as funds become available for new technicians.  in prior years we have purchased books for the classes offered so that the only cost for the classes is time.  with the help of individual, county, and state support we have added to our abilities as funds allow as well and hope to add more.  We need laptops and more mobile radios, antennae, and battery operability to be able to meet the needs of our town and area in the event of other disasters.
Friends Of Josephine County Search & Rescue	151181	2	/users/profile/201756	ernie_coffman	Board Member	5	03/16/2013	    As a Board Member and a SAR volunteer, with eighteen years under their belt, I feel qualified to do this review for Friends of Josephine County Search and Rescue. I served in a similar capacity with our neighboring SAR cuunty--Rogue Valley SAR. Although not as active as RVSAR is, JoCoSAR does a similar job when activated, although a good number of our searches or missions are for assisting our neighboring counties of CORSAR--California-Oregon Search and Rescue. When we're called upon, we have volunteers who respond at any hour of the day or night, as we're supposed to be on-call 24/7.     Our SAR unit is prepared for snow incidents, as we have a Snow Team with a snowcat, snowmobiles, and ATVs with the ability to ride in the snow. Our dive deam is active and assists the Sheriff when called upon, as the Rogue River goes right through the middle of our county and unfortunately, there are several incidents a year that require assistance or recovery of bodies. Our Radio Team is above and beyond with specialty people in their knowledge and expertise. Our Mounted SAR Unit is a little weak at present because of age and/or dropouts, but those in it are very informed with the latest skills with their horses; and, hope to increase their numbers this year. We have an Overhead Team that is called out to assist other counties with their skills. The Rope Team is highly skilled in climbing and assisting, as well as doing recoveries. And, our Grouppounders are the root of all these teams, as that is our mainstay in our organization. Everyone is qualified as a Groundpounder with skills in land navigation, GPS, compass and map reading, being prepared to stay in the out-of-doors in incoment weather as well as good weather. They've been taught tracking and are skilled in this activity, as well.  The ATV team is skilled in running the rough terrain of this county and/or other count roads and have assisted in locating subjects that are missing over the years.     All members purchase their own packs, boots, gear as needed and participate as much as they can. They work on road control incidents for the Sheriff, especially during fire season when roads need to be closed down.  SAR members have worked for the Sheriff in doing evidence searches, as more eyes and knowledge are very helpful for combatting crime.    
VOLUNTEERS IN MEDICINE CLINIC	90884	1	/users/profile/103808	vickyj	Volunteer	5	06/15/2011	I worked for Volunteers in Medicine Clinic as an intern while working towards my graduate certificate degree in Nonprofit Management. I also was a volunteer for the clinic in the eligibility department over a course of several months. I can not say enough how wonderful and compassionate the workers are at the clinic, as well as the numerous health care professional volunteers who dedicate their time. The organization is truly effective at providing extensive health coverage to unisured patients living in Lane County.

Beacon Of Hope	287013		/users/profile/377085	Jorge_G	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	Passion Project and Life PurposeI was just a 19-year-old college student setting out on a career path in business when the goal of my career became clear: not profit but purpose.At that moment, I realized that all of my life experiences and ambitions would combine to create something that was bigger than myself by using my business skills and education to bring about meaningful social impact in response to social injustices.The result was the co-founding of Beacon of Hope (https://beaconofhope.org) alongside my father with the goal of empowering children and families to overcome the many challenges they faced and create a better future for themselves and for all of us.It was more than a career goal, it was the unfolding of a  life purpose and that sense of purpose has only grown stronger with each passing day since then. 7 years later, I am as inspired as ever by the human potential and particularly the potential of children.I believe that every child deserves the opportunity to achieve his or her full potential and that given the right resources, they can do just that and change the world in the process.There is, to me, no reason why I was born into the life that I was born into, filled with opportunity, while so many others are born into situations where even basic survival is an uncertainty.I was born in a country where public education is a given and other public services abound, whereas the families we work with in Latin America and the Caribbean often don't know where their next meal will come from and their children have little hope of furthering themselves through education.It is the only way I can conceive of leading my life. I feel a sense of duty in working to create opportunities and provide resources to those who are currently underserved. It is a collective duty that we all share and that we can all work together to achieve. Indeed, we are doing so.With just one life that has been impacted and improved through our efforts, one child that will grow to overcome poverty, every single dollar, volunteer hour and ounce of effort has been worth it.So much has gone into this thanks to so many others joining the cause and believing in the vision of a of generation empowered children, and it is just the beginning. I envision so much more to come and will continue dedicating all I can to see this through.This is the greatest blessing I could have asked for.
MID-COLUMBIA CHILD AND FAMILY CENTER INC	91917		/users/profile/105297	tony	Volunteer	5	06/24/2011	As a CASA volunteer, I have been able to experience several different programs in Oregon that work with troubled children.  MCCFC has some magic that enables children who have been through multiple foster homes and multiple therapeutic programs to find success in overcoming their anti-social behaviors and move into main stream lives. The Directors and staff seem to have endless patience and the endurance to allow children to meet high expectations.  Oregon is fortunate to have this program -- for my children -- it was a "last chance" and they are succeeding.
Columbia Gorge Orchestra Association	219496		/users/profile/283102	tinacastanares	Board Member	5	10/02/2014	CGOA is fantastic.  In bringing beautiful orchestral and choral music to mid-Columbia residents in performances by serious local musicians (as well as guest musicians), and in sponsoring special events by other performing organizations, CGOA creates something for our communities that is unique and enriches us all.  In 2014, new offerings including community education about music history and theory deepen yet further our region's understanding and appreciation of great music.  I'm very proud to be associated with the organization as a volunteer Board member.

My support to them has lead to several local schools being built but I'm aware that they are a country leader in land rights and in the fight against human trafficking.

Adelante Mujeres	113089	1	/users/profile/153904	duckykitten	Donor	5	05/27/2012	I went to a board meeting of Adelante Mujeres and was deeply impressed by several things. One: the organization provides 91% of revenue to their programs. An overhead under 10% is phenomenal, and it works because everyone there is committed to serving their clients and running their innovative empowering programs. Two: young people spoke to the board, some of them volunteers and some young women being served by the organization's programs. In any case, the organization clearly values the voices of young adults, and especially young women. A young Latina explained to me how a year ago, she would not have been capable of addressing the board. Now she can describe an event she attended, speaking English, showing confidence and valuing her own experience.

Voices Set Free	156190		/users/profile/207227	Dixie Y.	Volunteer	5	04/25/2013	I met Louise Bauschard at a Reentry Council Meeting in Hillsboro OR and we hit it off. After telling her about my story, which includes domestic violence and incarceration while being pregnant and how I have overcome all odds and have been sober for 4 years now, she asked me to join her at Voices. I am going to school for computers and have been able to help with their website and social media as well as other various computer needs. Since I've been here I have learned so much about Louise and her mission. She has dedicated over 30 years to helping women who are suffering by the hands of abusers as well as women who have been incarcerated because of secondary actions stemming from being victims. I have gained a new understanding of what true "giving  back" really is and she and her organization have changed my life.
Portland Victory Center	270600	5	/users/profile/359320	CathyZ	Volunteer	3	11/01/2015	The Portland Victory Center is a legitimate organization but there is man named Lionel an older very friendly black man black and grey hair and facial hair small in stature maybe 5 foot 9 and maybe 150 lbs who is collecting money and giving out receipts in the name of the organization.  My husband has been giving Lionel money for the Victory Center for several years we have welcomed him into our home and shared our home cooked soup with him but in the last year or so the stories were not adding up so we called Pastor Sias at the Victory Center and he tells us Lionel has not worked with them in over 3 years.  Friday, Lionel came to our home and I told him we had called the Victory Center and we did not feel he was being honest with us. He said I am going to see one of your neighbors and I will be right back.  He then walked down the street got in his car it looked like a simple small sedan or coupe light color silver or grey he even rolled down the window as he drove away to say I'll be right back! Clearly we have not seen him since this time.  I regret not getting his license plate number.  
Blissful Acres Rescue Reserve	61541		/users/profile/67196	Lemon	Volunteer	5	01/28/2011	I was fortunate enough to learn about Blissful Acres Rescue Reserve at a Bend Chamber function.  I was there with a friend and she decided we were going to make a weekly date to visit the ranch and volunteer, lucky for me I went along with her plan.  It turned out to be a wonderful investment of my time.  I was able to spend countless hours doing exactly the therapeutic work I needed.  As a small business owner, in my fourth year of operation at that time, I needed some mind numbing, good old fashion physical labor.  Mucking stalls was the perfect fit.  I also got to groom, feed, learn about hoof care, horsemanship, horse teeth, proper body weight, and so much more.   I will tell you not to be fooled by the name Blissful, it is not all bliss, there is some hard work that must be done.  Fences need rebuiding, water tanks need to be scrubbed, horses need to be exercised, and buildings need to be erected.  Not to mention hay, it always needs to be moved from one place to another.  Character is not built by playing video games, it is built by contributing selflessly, working when you don't want to, completing a task and looking back on a job well done.  Our communities need to pull together as a united front and plug our youth, our adults, and our elders into positions where they are needed.  BARR is on the leading edge.  BARR is creating relationships between animals and humans, giving a place for our community members to gather and grow.  BARR is reaching out to educate people on proper animal care, giving a voice to the speachless.  BARR is providing an exceptionally realistic view of the cycle of life .  BARR is much more than a place to muck.After several years as a volunteer I decided to join the board and hope to help define our vision.  Please come visit and let us know how you think we are doing.
Corvallis Arts Center Inc	237338	1	/users/profile/321873	JohnLM	Volunteer	2	01/27/2015	The organization has suffered from inconsistent leadership in its purpose and role in the community. Several fabulous programs such as a "healing arts" program implemented in the local dialysis center and a "alley arts" program have made art more accessible within the community. However, other programs for raising funds (Chocolate Fantasy Art Auction) have strayed away from the charities original mission of making art accessible to the local community. Periodic opportunities to meet with artists help those artists get noticed, but are not well promoted and seem more for the benefit of the organization than the artist. Contentious relationships with artists guilds seems at odds with the charities charter and create a sense of "snobbishness" and "snootiness".
Move To Assurance	148899		/users/profile/198326	brickballoon	Volunteer	5	02/03/2013	This is a Christian ministry dedicated to sharing the gospel and equipping others to do the same. In 2012 they were at over 30 events and had 45 days of evangelism.  86 volunteers from 13 churches were involved.  They share the gospel Biblically using the law to show people they are sinners in need of someone to save them from the just punishment they have earned. Then showing how the grace of God is available to everyone who repents and trusts the promises of Jesus Christ. Everyone is a volunteer. No one in this ministry is paid.  I'd guess less than 1% goes to overhead. They are very focused on using all possible resources to bring the good news to as many people as possible.  They changed their name in 2010 to better reflect what they do, but they kept the same MTA acronym - MAT.  The new name is Move To Assurance

Quadriplegics United Against Dependency Inc	33572	1	/users/profile/34373	cheryl9	Former staff	5	03/19/2010	This strong organization does so much good with very limited resources! I've met so many people here who are severely physically disabled, but still believe they can make a big difference in the world.  They just need to know that they have a roof over their heads and can count on someone to get them out of bed and into the world every morning. This simple concept of affordable, accessible apartments combined with shared personal attendant care is a real blessing to so many people who thought their disability meant that they no longer had control over their own choices from day-to-day.  This organization presents game-changing living options for those who want and need supported personal independence.

Teens who feel desperate and are hurting them selves and their love ones by there actions are being taught how to love themselves and see the hope in the future.  I became aware of House of Hope from a Women of Faith Conference and have been supporting them with prayer ever since.  They do so much with with so little money it's incredible!  Teens are schooled and trained with life skills as well as learn about the loving gift of God's Grace.

After talking with her for just a few minutes you will she how much she cares for the horses who come to her for help. She will also help anyone who has questions on proper care of abused horses  jan 2013 I was asked by the Curry County Sheriffs office in helping remove horses from a owner who was starving them. Darla steped up to take them in. I transported them in two trips to Darla. If I was to call her right now, she would find room for others in need also. She is in contact with several Vets and ferriors for help, and works with UC Davis on proper start-up feeding of starved horses. Gives first aid for injuries, and shows them Love. Something these horses have not recieved for a long time.Darla has even worked with Law Enforcement in getting the abusers charged and convicted of abusing these animals.
BIRCH COMMUNITY SERVICES INC	166624	2	/users/profile/221361	Integrity Honesty	Volunteer	2	08/31/2013	While Birch has a wonderful impact on the community and those it serves there are many people skills it is lacking.  The treatment of all volunteers is generally good but on some occasions the behavior of the director especially and sometimes specific employees has come into question.The director can be too specific with clients and actually feel the need to discipline them by meeting with them specifically/confronting them with a "witness" (usually her bestfriend).  This makes the client feel picked on.  Sometimes she seems to literally stalk a person as they shop to make sure they are following guidelines (specific persons at times).  This is very awkward and makes the client have no dignity. Also, this director has been known to really upset people needlessly (people have been noted crying in the break room).  I have directly seen the impact on families that have been dismissed or "replaced" by other families loose their sense of well being in a mere day.  One miniute the family was a great part of the organization and being greatly blessed and then the next day they are gone.  This is really sad when this organization should at least give the family a reason for their dismissal and a notice. Some in the organization are favored like the directors and office staff to get food boxes made for them and be given the newest nice furniture as a reward.  It should be a fair system where "Everything" is a drawing done by the clients not assets distributed to any of the employees including the directors and employees.   This organization needs an outside management not influenced by the director or anyone on the board of directors to maintain its integrity and the utmost standards of honesty. Clients here actually pay " dues" so they technically pay the salaries and bonus of all staff.  This should come with the utmost integrity and NO taking of the goods for themselves unless they too are participants and happen to win a client led drawing!   Outside management is highly advised! The staff is payed a fair wage and should be held to the utmost highest standard in operation. Office staff has been overheard gossiping about numerous families within the office context where all can be overheard by others.  This is unfair and cruel to those participants who have overheard themselves being spoken about in a gossip fashion. The women in the office including the director need to learn more tact in serving the working poor! Favortism for any family for any reason is unacceptable! Security is lacking in the facility to make sure children, especially are safe at all times.  No background checks are given on any of the volunteer/participant childcare providers.  Criminal elements have been noted in the childcare area while dropping off their kids and sometimes helping in childcare facility.The overall plan of the non-profit does work to help the working poor. The manners of the company could be greatly improved!
Traveling Childrens Heritage Museum	319628		/users/profile/411364	Writer	General Member of the Public	1	11/30/2016	the childrens heritage museun in Greenleaf Oregon.  wow, I have lived there all my life. the town has a population of maybe 25 to 30. at one time it had a store and a post office until they shut the post office down and moved it to Deadwood , Oregon. that left the store. later the store shut down and it is now a house. basically what i am saying is that there is no such thing as a museum in greenleaf , Oregon. never has been and will never be.    in fact the town of green leaf had came about in the late 1850's.  there was only one way in and it was by horse back. the mail they received at the time was by wagon. in the early 1920 to 1930 the high way was put in and it was called  highway 36. it was narrow and had alot of corners do to the fact that they just followed the mountain slopes and built the road in the bottom of the mountain ranges. it is still very narrow with alot of corners today. But never the case as I was saying, there is NO such thing as a Greenleaf , Oregon Chidrens Heritage Museum.

I've been lucky to have been surrounded by books to entertain and inspire me all my life. Kids in poor communities don't have this opportunity. They don't see what's possible for them in books and in turn in their worlds. I'm fortunate to see families, high school and college students, and everyday folks of all ages give their time to help get books to kids in need. These volunteers are creating new stories and I love that I'm a part of building a better future. It's a thrill and a high to help others.The Children's Book Bank: http://www.childrensbookbank.org/

Homeplate Youth Services	286622		/users/profile/376692	McKenzie_B	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	Moments of Joy at HomePlateMaking connections with youth in my community is one of my inspirations. I am a Senior Social Work Major at Pacific University. This year I will spend at least 440 hours volunteering for HomePlate Youth Services. After interviewing with several agencies for my practicum placement, I chose HomePlate the only outreach team and drop-in resource center for youth experiencing housing instability in Washington County. HomePlate is special because they are a low-barrier, safe space for youth in the community to access necessary resources like a hot meal, shower, clothes, job resources, tutoring and more. My favorite moments have come from Wednesday night drop-ins when I get to share a meal and provide homework tutoring for the youth. Early in October, one of the girls asked me to help her with a persuasive essay. As I was reading over it, she told me English was her second language, and her teacher had set a goal for her to improve from 5th grade to high school writing level by the end of the school year. We worked tirelessly on the essay together and after three weeks of work, she turned in her paper and got an A. The way she persevered through learning to write a persuasive essay in a second language serves as an inspiration to me. Its these seemingly simple moments of joy which have meant the most to me.When asked, What does HomePlate mean to you? One of our youth responded, HomePlate cares for you and helps you find jobs and if you are having troubles they make sure they help you. I couldnt summarize it better, myself. HomePlates vision is to meet youth where they are. They have been providing services and consistency for youth in Washington County for ten years. I am inspired by the other members of the community who volunteer their time to make HomePlates vision a reality. Find out more about HomePlate at http://www.homeplateyouth.org. 
Kboo Foundation	286605		/users/profile/376675	Becky_M	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	Community radio empowers me, and KBOO has empowered community broadcasters since 1968. Unlike direct service nonprofits, the benefits that come from community radio stations can feel abstract! However, as someone whose life has fundamentally changed since first volunteering at KBOO, I can speak to the importance of radio stations that teach people broadcast skills (at no cost) and help inspire a freer media landscape. While commercial media tells you how to think, buy, and vote, independent media fosters civil, critical thought.I don't want to imagine a world where I'm not really free to think or speak.

WILLAMETTE HUMANE SOCIETY	287006		/users/profile/377078	Meredith_K	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	Generosity inspires generosityOver the years Don Bourne gave thousands of dollars to Willamette Humane Society. Saving animals was his passion. He gave $5,000 every year at the big fundraiser. He donated $75,000 to the sustainable fund. He gave. And he cared.The connection to WHS also gave him an excuse to visit his cat, Buster.You see, when Don and his wife, Eillea, moved into a retirement facility, they were only able to keep two of their three cats. Buster, a cantankerous old fellow, did not make the cut. But, used to dealing with crabby old cats, WHS took Buster in. It turns out, he's a wonderful office cat....who only bites and scratches occasionally.In fact, he continued to scratch and bite Don and Eillea when they visited. (Is it any wonder why Buster didn't make the retirement facility cut?!) Still, he visited and reached out a hand to pet his old friend.Until the end of his days, Don and Eillea visited WHS. But, really, I think they were visiting Buster. When Don passed this year, I made a donation to WHS....in his honor.My donation wasn't $5,000. And it certainly wasn't $75,000. But I am certain every little bit counts and that Don would be touched. I'm pretty sure Don will be on my mind each time I make a donation to Willamette Humane Society. His generosity inspires my generosity.

Ninos Del Lago	73393		/users/profile/80210	Joniwriter	Board Member	4	02/22/2011	Four years ago, a photojournalist friend and colleague who has worked on the streets of Brazil with homeless children told me about woman she had met in Mexico who started a unique program working with Guatemala's poorest, most at-risk children.  Her name was Arlaine Cervantes, and she had recently started Ninos del Lago. A nature camp overlooking one of the most beautiful lakes in the Western Hemisphere, Lake Atitlan.  The camp was being created as an inspirational educational retreat designed to give these children their first opportunity to play, to learn, to be creative and to dream in a safe, secure and nurturing environment.  I was immediately taken by the passion and unique vision of Arlaine, and she convinced me to fly down to Guatemala to see the camp site and the children for myself.  I never looked back.  There is not another program of this type in Central America, and when we are complete, Ninos del Lago will serve as a model program to help transform the lives of forgotten children throughout Central and South America.  Since that first visit I have been back to Guatemala several times and have seen the progress and momentum.  It started as one woman's dream but has developed into project that is now getting support from volunteers in the US, Holland and throughout Guatemala.  We still have a way to go, but we now a core team of dedicated volunteers and sponsors who have helped us overcome tremendous obstacles.  
Candlelighters For Children With Cancer	187579		/users/profile/176043	Sharla V.	Client Served	5	11/02/2013	Candlelighters gave us a place to "land" when we were swimming in the midst of our son's cancer diagnosis. Austin was diagnosed with Retinoblastoma, age 4 Oct 2009. Candlelighters provided dinners at the hospital when we didn't have time to grab a bite to eat. They provide events throughout the year such as a Snowmobiling outing, CandyCane Lane, Annual Family Christmas Party and swim events. They provide  two camps each year that we attend, Camp Harlow and Camp Agape. These camps brought us together with so many other families that are going through a similar journey. We no longer felt "alone".  I can not say enough about the emotional healing that Candlighters has brought to our family. We do not have family in the area and Candlighters has become family to us. Thank you!

Friends Of The Jefferson Public Library	286900		/users/profile/376971	Katherine_S	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	Raising progress above complacency.  I participate in my community of Jefferson, NH with the Jefferson Elementary School Parent Teacher Association; the Friends of the Jefferson Public Library; and the Jefferson Athletic association.   I feel they all work together to provide the best possible activities, programs, and outreach for our children and families of our community.  Providing all of these opportunities to our community without raising taxes on the residents of the town is a challenge during every season.  The investment is re-payed with each child that is included in a fitness activity; has a book read to them; experiences an author or presentation that otherwise wouldn't have impacted their lives.       Friends of the Jefferson Public Library is currently working along with a town appointed committee to raise funds to build a new Jefferson Public Library.  We are excited to see the efforts of our group prove to the town of Jefferson that the Public Library is a valid and valuable asset to the community.  Our current and original library is a historic building once housing one of the original school houses for our town. The building lacks running water, and ADA compliance.
Broadarts Theatre Inc	27919	6	/users/profile/28990	nubianphoenix	Board Member	4	02/11/2010	My experiences with this non profit began in 2005.  I first became acquainted with the founder and artistic director during a community meeting and workshop with non profits in Oregon.   As a performer we clicked right away. I was impressed with her (Melinda Pittman) interest in both the arts and the arts as a part of social justice/social change.   Over time we worked together and I eventually joined the cast of one of her shows as part of the city of Portland's Vision grants program.  The show was a great success as it blended great music, comedy, story, and social activism into a multi-generational show.  From that experience as well as others I was moved to join the board of directors and am proud to be part of the organization.Now we are actively working on improving the organizational structure and infrastructure to enhance the program and administration.  Soon BroadArts should be back on its way to operating in the black and making its unique blend of social change and performing arts.

It may have been set up wrong, but our school is Creative Science School, and the donation site says "PTA General Congress". We're told to "trust" that the money is going to our school. That's hard to do when I don't know anyone at Just Give, or at the PTA General Congress. This small change of adding our school name would be a great relief. 
REAL YOUTH TO YOUTH	190205	1	/users/profile/248305	narora	Volunteer	5	12/08/2013	REAL Youth to Youth is truly an exceptional non-profit organization. I had the pleasure of participating with this group for a little over a year in 2009 and had a wonderful experience. REAL is unique in that its purpose is two fold. The organization is committed to improving education and literacy in rural India, while at the same time, empowering youth here in the United States to be effective leaders throughout their lives.  The projects they are supporting are done so only after a multi-faceted analysis to ensure they are directly related to the mission of REAL. By contributing to this organization you are not only supporting their meticulously chosen education projects, but also encouraging local youth to incorporate the spirit of meaningful giving into the rest of their lives.  The youth volunteers are supported by a committed adult board who ensure that every dollar donated to this organization is utilized most effectively. I proudly support this organization, and hope others will do the same.

Volunteer	5	12/19/2012	Michael the Archangel pregnancy Center is one of the most loving and unselfish group of volunteers who serve the Salem Keizer area women and their children.  I have ever volunteered for them as a counselor for 7 years and have worked at St. Germaine Pregnancy Center, Family Building Blocks, the Fr. Taaffe Homes,   and Michael's is the best.  Everyone at the center is a  volunteer and they love mothers, babies, fathers and teens who come and ask for help; and they always help.  They give of their time and their funds and their items of clothing and furniture and talents at their fundraisers.  They fundraise through breakfasts and rummage sales and plants sales and Christmas Bazaars.   They give so selflessly that they are truely a Christ Centered organization and they ask for nothing in return.   Many of the volunteers ahve been involved in volunteer work with mothers and babies for more than 15 years.   The fundraisers of Michael's kepps amny other organizations afloat, like St. Germaine and Fr. Taaffe Homes.   They have a large volunteers force especially for the Oktoberfest and the rummage sale - 100's.   If anyone needs help and has children;  they need only to call and come to Michael the Archangel Mon to Friday from 12 to 3 and get the support and help they need.   And example of one volunteers love and support for women and babies is the time a pregnant mom came into the office and after a few minutes the volunteers realized the women was in hard labor and they closed the office and drove the women to the hospital and stayed with her till the baby was delievered.  They later help this mother with diapers, clothing, blankets, furniture and support.

Children are excited to come to the barn to ride their horse; they often forget that what we are doing is physical therapy. I have been touched by many parents, nearly in tears telling me they never thought they would see their child reach his or her goals. I have become teary eyed when a child who was slow to walk and had been riding about six months was eventually able to leave her walker and walk down the barn isle to grab my hand.I have been a volunteer at Forward Stride for over four years and I too have been healed by giving my time to Forward Stride.

Cascade Aids Project Inc	147437		/users/profile/194887	Kate J.	General Member of the Public	5	12/30/2012	Our daughter - in her 20's, before going back to school for a nursing degree - had a half-time internship with Cascade AIDS Project from late 2009 through 2010, and we were so impressed with what we learned of CAP's services.  She worked in the program supporting kids and families affected by AIDS and HIV.  The support to families is educational as well as emotional and psychological.  The team also trained other professionals to help them learn how to reach out and support the affected families and children of those who are HIV-positive.  Of course, they also worked with children who are HIV-positive.  Our daughter loved the experience of the once-a-month large family events - in part, the adults attended an educational session while the children separately did fun activities together.  She also served as a counselor at Camp Starlight, CAP's residential 1-week summer camp at the Oregon Coast for children with HIV.  She had a tremendously positive experience at camp with amazing children and wonderful co-counselors.  It's nice to see our thinking that CAP is a very effective and efficient community resource confirmed by its ratings at Network for Good.

As creators of original work, they are recognized around the world, and have earned dozens of awards, including four Emmy's. But they are far more than an amazing group of talented artists. They take their passion and skill, and real-world experience and pass it on to others through practical hands-on workshops, special screenings, internships, mentorships, and volunteer opportunities. In short, they invite people to engage in the creative process and empower their own voice, explore their world, and create meaningful human connections.  I am proud to be a NW Doc supporter.

If you really want to make a significant, lasting difference in both community and art, you can't find a more worthy and effective non-profit than NW Documentary!

Nami Multnomah	272854		/users/profile/361986	Writer	Client Served	5	11/24/2015	NAMI Multnomah's Family to Family class was a lifesaver for me.  I was struggling to understand my brother's PTSD and bi-polar symptoms, and between the class curriculum, the teachers and the other participants, I understood that my brother and I were not alone, and that a stable recovery is possible.  I cannot thank them enough!
Eaglehorse Foundation	51603	2	/users/profile/52326	linda46	Volunteer	1	09/02/2010	Limited amount of time but Google and local media sources would find that this nonprofit was corrupt and poorly run. It's director, Joann Sebby, kept funds intended to feed and house the animals. Taxes were never filed. Donations were not put where they were promised. Severely corrupt. From financial fraud to reports (check with Jackson County) of animal abuse. Bad, bad news.

OREGON DOG RESCUE	5558	3	/users/profile/7362	Ruby's Mom	Volunteer	5	06/24/2009	Oregon Dog Rescue is an all-breed, no-kill shelter. It is a 501(c) (3) non-profit organization started by two dedicated women with twelve years of experience with rescue dogs. We are an all-volunteer group who helps rehabilitate, groom, foster, run dogs for vet checks and help at adoption events. We at Oregon Dog Rescue are devoted to placing the dogs in the best homes and assuring the long-term success of the adoption. Volunteers do follow up calls to make sure all is going well with the new adoptive home. We are available for follow-up care and for the lifetime of the pet. Included in our volunteer base are a network of professionals who are available to assist with the well being of the animals and behavioral issues. The volunteers of Oregon Dog Rescue assess each incoming dog for medical and behavioral issues prior to placing them in homes. Each pet is wormed, flea-treated, spayed or neutered, and given necessary shots. Photos and descriptions of each dog are placed on our website which links into Petfinder.com. The dogs reside in volunteer foster homes during the week where training is continued. Weekly adoption events are held on Saturdays at the Tualatin Petsmart, except for an occasional off-site event. I have been active with the group since it's beginning July 2007 and part of my volunteering is networking, organizing outreach events and creating public awareness.
Josephine Community Libraries Inc	119183	2	/users/profile/162039	Busy grandmother	Volunteer	5	07/24/2012	This incredibly busy county-wide library has 8+ FTE staff and perhaps 300 volunteers.   Since the county ended funding, its circulation figures have increased, and, in my view, it's more fun.   Volunteers at the checkout desk are cheerful, the maintenance staff (volunteers) enjoys the perks of chatting with visitors and getting lots of videos, books, movies, etc.; volunteers are planning parties, children's events, and on and on.  It's really a great community center!   Free library cards,  And somehow it manages to have a decent budget for buying new items.    It exists on grants and donations and used book sales.   So lively.   Such an asset to this little rural southwest Oregon county.   
Osu Folk Club Thrift Shop Foundation	100305	2	/users/profile/121979	Volunteerguy	General Member of the Public	1	11/04/2011	I am a business major at Oregon State University, and visited the Folk Thrift Shop on my 24th birthday.  My Mom came all the way from Portland to visit.  Unfortunately we did not have a good experience.  My mom found 2 matching (very cool) old red vases.  She was carrying them for a bit and decided I should go pay for them.  As I am waiting in line a volunteer employee approaches me and says that she needs to check something on the vase.  I figured they were a little cheap, and she had to adjust the price.  5 min later the volunteer returns with nothing in hand.  Dumbfounded I ask her if there is a problem?   She tells me the vases were supposed to be put on hold and she had been looking for them.  She said they were not for sale.  I was very taken back by this.  Did she just take my items from me?  It turns out another employee had been looking for these vases and she took them out of my hand to hold them for the other volunteer.  When my mom and I talked to the gal in charge, she apologized and said she knew the situation and had already "made the decision."  After I tried reasoning with her, and explaining how ridiculous that managerial decision is, she shook her head and said "life is hard." (As if she knows my life) An overall frustrating experience to have on your birthday.  Will not return until they adjust their policies.  Keep a watchful eye on the items you wish to purchase. 
Southern Oregon Animal Rights Society	316772		/users/profile/62995	bluebird	Volunteer	5	10/30/2016	This is a very enlilghtened group of individuals who believe that our domestic and wild animals deserve ultimate respect.  Animals are living, breathing, sentient beings who deserve the care and respect of any living beings.  This group is educating the human species as to the extremely increased greenhouse gasses created by the huge working, cruel factory farms of our country.  This has all been scientifully studied, and this group is promoting a meat free diet in order to help save our precious planet.  They are also involved working hard to save our disappearing wildlife. Human over population is part of the huge problem existing today.   Our planet cannot sustained the increasing populations all over the globe.   Many changes must occurr to save our  precious wildlilfe, our magnificent wild horses who the BLM are intent on destroying in order to continue giving priorities to huge money making cattle businesses.  Our oceans, are in critical conditions from increasing temperatures and pollution due to human activities.   Our lands,  our waterways, simply our waters are all being polluted from fracking and pipelines.  We humans must awaken, our planet is dying.   This group known as SOARS works hard with hope of informing, and awakening individuals in order to save our planet for future generations.  Please consider this great work that they contribute to our world. 
Wildlife Warriors USA Inc.	239087	2	/users/profile/324690	LuckyDonor	Donor	1	03/10/2015	After giving for years and years to this group, we one day asked to see an accounting of where all the money is going.Since we knew first hand money had been given to them for specific things like saving the elephants in Asia or a new turtle rehabilitation pond/pool.  Yet NONE of this had been done. The real name of this charity is Australia Zoo, Wildlife Warriors.What we have been told by many of current and past employees of the Zoo and Wildlife Warriors is the problem is they take money from Wildlife Warriors and us it for the zoo saying its all the same.You give money for tigers and they use it on a tiger display... all the same! So they say. When we asked to see the books and show full accounting with receipts of things, we were told they are a "Private Charity" and don't need to show the books.We also can not find current and correct filings of the USA forms.Steve Irwin must be rolling in his grave to know this is happening.Do Not Give to this group.Many other great groups to help with Wildlife you can give to.

Computerbugs	234079		/users/profile/297981	Ernie C.	Board Member	5	11/20/2014	This organization was started about twelve years ago, as a break-off from another computer club, here in Grants Pass. Those of us who formed COMPUTERBUGS had a different agenda going and decided to work with seniors in a different manner. Some members still belong to both clubs, with assisting them with computer skills being the main agenda. We have been a non-profit organization since the beginning, when we formed our organization, wrote up our Bylaws and Constitution and proved to the IRS what we were doing was for the benefit of seniors in and around Grants Pass, Oregon. We had over 350 members, originally, but with the advancement of computers and going into Smartphones, IPads, etc., computers are being used less and less, so our membership stand around 80; thus, our funds are slowly disappearing and it is a little scary to understand that problem. We still have to pay rent and replace the laptop computer, every now and then, so we might have to adjust our membership fee's, which are quite low. Our group has a great newsletter that is put out monthly by our editor, Alan Burt. We are now meeting in a church, which is in the center of town, so that makes it easy for folks to travel to, whether one is a city or a county resident. We only meet twice a month, usually, for a Question & Answer ( Q & A) session and then on the second Wednesday, we have a presentation from someone on computer programs, photography, etc.  Our group is a very friendly and fun group that members respond to, especially when seeking answers about computer problems that they might have come up with. We have adjusted our age requirement from being 55 and above, to any adult, basically. We're always looking for new members, whether they're computer proficient or a neophyte.

I volunteered for this group for quite a while a few years ago and have been meaning to get more involved. They have gone through a few changes and gotten a new ED and are still moving forward with great results. They truly care for the animals in their care and you can tell. It is an excellent place to take your kids for a visit and will get them involved in active compassion. They also have a neat program that assists with vet care on a referral basis. Go in for a visit you will love what you see!

For an all-volunteer organization, the program presented to participants is amazing. I really feel as though I've connected to my community and made wonderful friendships that I never would have without Leadership Corvallis. I highly recommend the program as a way to get connected to the community, obtain a holistic view of the issues and challenges Corvallis faces and make new friendships!

World Pulse Voices	38705	2	/users/profile/39599	ellen7	Former Volunteer	5	05/12/2010	World Pulse's vision is to enable women's voices to be heard globally. The organization has created PulseWire, an online network that enables women to tell their stories and get feedback and encouragement from other women around the world. An example of one group that has formed on PulseWire is the Book Group that reads books written by women who tell their accounts of what has happened in their part of the world. What makes this group so special is you can get feedback and additional insights from women who actually live in the region where this book's action takes place.WorldPulse also trains women correspondents to tell what is happening in their part of the world. This provides an opportunity for women who would not ordinarily have a voice to speak out about the challenges they face in their communities. After the Haiti earthquake, women from Haiti were able to report on what was happening on the ground -- stories that needed to be told.

The kittens are in a seperate area as are healing felines.  There are dozens of overhead walkways and you never know where you'll find a friendly fuzzy!  This is a NO KILL facility and they receive no public monies, they could really use your help.  We adopted a pair of brothers, one with only 3 legs.  They were so happy, you could tell the volunteers really cherish each and every one.  They offer help with feral colonies, getting them spayed/neutered and let them be barn cats at no charge.  Seniors receive discounts, folks on low incomes can also adopt, the staff will work with you to provide a safe home.  If you love kitties, this is THE place in Central Oregon to go to.

Friends Of The Children Of The Klamath Basin	167878		/users/profile/222764	Jan_33	Volunteer	5	09/06/2013	Friends of the Children, Klamath Basin Chapter, is a unique, one on one adult relationship with a deserving child.  They hire paid mentors who select children in the first grade and see and work with that child for 12 years!  The main goals are that the children will graduate from high school or at least get their GED's, the children will NOT get involved negatively with the justice system, and they will NOT become teen parents.  Mentors work with their children at least four hours every week, one on one, 52 weeks of the year.  They help with homework, they introduce the children to community outings like parks, walking trails, museums, dog shows, bowling, etc.  A good deal of time is spent helping with homework or dealing with difficulties at school.  This is an amazing organization that truly makes a difference in a child's life by sticking with them through the good times and the bad times and letting that child know there will always be someone who cares!

The Center For A Sustainable Today	35199	5	/users/profile/36034	gordon2	Volunteer	4	04/09/2010	I find the ideas and the concepts innovative and cutting edge. I like The circle of sustainability which starts with people having access to health practitioners so they can achieve physical sustainability. This is done through a series of cable shows one is called The Doctors Corner where you can talk to a doctor in a specific medical field such as dentist for one month and a Natural Path the next for free.Then Sustainable today produces a cable show called Money Matters. This a cable show that helps people learn how money works. Sustainable today produces the hit one hour public affairs cable show Sustainable Today. This a show the helps the viewer experience new ways of thinking and doing. The show high lites organizations, people, and businesses in the Portland Oregon area that are laying down the path to sustainability. that is a monthly show where the host disects a certain topic  of sustainability such as solar or wave energy.

Mundo Exchange	63389		/users/profile/69305	Hlyons	Volunteer	5	02/04/2011	As someone who has worked in the non-profit community in the states for the past six years, I was very impressed by my experience with Mundo Exchange. I loved that Mundo was a small organization, the size ensured a more personalized experience and also meant that my volunteer donation went straight back into the local community. Nalinrat, one of the local Thai hosts, was a wonderful guide as we traveled through local markets, spent a night at a Wat, and even made a trip to another village to meet her family! My time in Bueng Khan was a perfect balance of travel to local attractions and experiencing everyday life in a small village while completing volunteer work. I would highly recommend the Mundo program to anyone who would like a personalized volunteer experience working closely with local people and organizations! I was an intern with Mundo Exchange for two months in 2009. I lived in Bueng Khan and helped to open a Cultural Center for the local Isaan community. As the project was just beginning there was a lot of infrastructure that needed to be put into place, from developing goals for the center to painting the floor! I was largely able to design my own goals and projects, I ended up focusing on organizing and inventorying the centers donated artifacts and its collection of photos. I also was able to help build the centers first exhibit. To give an example of how a typical project evolves- we first traveled a few blocks away to the home of one of Nalinrats relatives, where we went to the back yard and cut down 20ft bamboo stalks with a machete and saw. We then drove 20 minutes to someone elses backyard to barter for some palm fronds. Next we enlisted a neighbor (who worked on the sidewalk next to the center making baskets by hand) to help construct a model hut inside the center using our materials. The whole project, which would have taken a day and a trip to Home Depot in the states, took several weeks and the help of many community membersand was much more rewarding and fun as a result! 
Out To Pasture Animal Sanctuary	103512	1	/users/profile/138306	anindigogirl	Donor	5	01/16/2012	This is a wonderful, sanctuary for animals of ALL KINDS. The owners live on this huge farm filled with different animals. Out To Pasture is a not-for-profit, no-kill sanctuary, dedicated to providing permanent housing and care for a variety of abused, neglected or abandoned animals including large farm animals, pigs, rabbits, chickens and dogs. They believe animals value their lives as much as we value our own and deserve to live free of exploitation and cruelty. Some of the  animals that live on the farm were adopted from a variety of organizations. Other animals were adopted from individuals as a result of divorce, eviction or foreclosure. Some were intercepted on their way to auction or slaughter. Many animals came from sad situations. Feral cats as well, and mistreated horses. Out to Pasture is a place where all living beings are treated with kindness and compassion. The owners regularly have Open House at the farm so anyone can see for themselves how great the animals are on the farm. It's a beautiful place....Lorrie

White Wolf Sanctuary	135686		/users/profile/181565	carol gladwin	Volunteer	5	11/08/2012	As a volunteer at White Wolf Sanctuary for 4 1/2 years, I know how much this non profit would benefit from extra recognition and funds!  The Sanctuary is home to ten Arctic wolves, all born in captivity and rescued from less than wonderful living situations.  They cannot be released into the wild and this is their home for life.  The director, LoisTulleners, makes sure that each of the wolves is well cared for. and they are her #1 priority. The wolves are in 5 groups, one male and female to each group.  As breeding isn't the business of the Sanctuary, they are separated during February which is the normal breeding month.  The enclosures where the wolves live are quite large (some many acres), each has a house for escaping the most extreme weather, ponds for the summer heat, and the wolves can be moved from enclosure to enclosure for 'enrichment' so they don't become bored with the same scenery day after day.  I volunteer one day a week at the Sanctuary and have interaction with all the wolves, some more than others.  The work is hard and often less than glamorous but necessary for the care of the animals.  The wolves 'give back' in their response to visits at the fence with them and they are wonderful.  As a non profit, the only money comes from donations, the adopt a wolf program, and tours, which drop considerably during the winter months.  My life has been greatly impacted by my time at White Wolf Sanctuary.            Carol Gladwin

Humane Society Of Central Oregon Spca	235368	3	/users/profile/318581	twisted462002	Client Served	1	12/12/2014	In July of 2014 my son surrendered two of his three dogs to HSCO.  He had driven from Southern Calif. through Northern Calif and up into Oregon.  I live in Hawaii but was babysitting my grandkids.  It was the hardest thing he had ever done and if it wasn't for the four month quarantine I would of taken them back to Hawaii with me.  My son couldn't find a place to live, I will not bother you with the details of that.  Bottom line the shelter lead us to believe that they would be able to find good homes for Kenai (10 month) large mix and Luna (2years) pitbull mix.  We had Lunas mom so we had Luna since she was born.  She was a beautiful happy somewhat hyper dog, needed to get a lot of exercise.  It was almost too much to bear but HSCO never said anything about killing them.  They were dead in a week.  I donated $200 to the shelter not as a bribe just because they were  willing to take them and find them a home.  They out and out lied to us.  When I called to see how they were doing after ten minutes on hold they came on the line and said they were not adoptable and I said what does that mean and I had to say it.  They had already been euthanized killed unnecessarily.  They were only there for a week.  We would not of left them there, never never.  I emailed the director several times and no response.  My heart breaks every day when I see Luna in my head.  I told my son they had been adopted. But just a few days before Christmas I get a card from the director asking for a repeat performance financially because I was such a good friend of their organization.  She has no idea that they were the ones who killed Kenai and Luna.  She just saw dollar signs.  Talk about opening an already opened wound.  I think they should be clear about what happens when they take a dog in, they will probably kill them especially a bigger one they had no intention of finding them a home it is all about the money they can get from you.Now there is candid and very personal and I cannot tell you how much pain their actions has caused me and my son.  Even though I had to lie to him he had just come out of a very negative situation and he wouldn't of been able to handle the fact well I am not going to repeat myself.  I do hope that something can be done about their Mission as they call it.  They lie lie lie  Have a Merry ChristmasJacqueline Boone Hilo, Hawaii

House Of Dreams	192927		/users/profile/251958	fifigarrett	Volunteer	5	01/22/2014	House of Dreams (HOD) is a long-standing no-kill, free-roaming, all-volunteer cat shelter housing about 30 cats in a residential neighborhood in Portland, OR.  These kitties are frequently long-term residents, elderly and in need of medical attention. Many are adopted, but many remain in place.  HOD is one of the few shelters that takes in, and cares for, Feline Leukemia-positive kitties of all ages.  HOD raises money for medical expenses, food, dental care, cleaning supplies, and house operating expenses.  The shelter's rooms are cleaned every day by volunteer crews and the kitties have frequent visitors for socialization. It's simply the best place to be outside of a fur-ever home of your own!

Mountainstar Family Relief Nursery	286717		/users/profile/376787	Camas_C	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	The children at Family Relief Nursery stole my heart!Family Relief Nursery is part of the Oregon's Relief Nursery programs. They seek to stop child abuse and keep children out of foster care through early intervention and parent education.         When I was a child, my mom, a single-parent, was struggling to raise two small girls. She went the Relief Nursery for help, but the waitlist was too long and she didn't have enough risk-factors to meet the minimum criteria to receive services.         As an adult, I don't want anyone to be refused services when they ask for help. I joined the board of directors and served for 3 years. Our mission is to grow our facility large enough to reach all the families that need services in our community. Currently, our families average about 22 risk factors.         As a board member, I mostly give time, by attending meetings, volunteering at events, and at the facility. The company for which I work also would adopt a family in need each year, making sure they had a holiday dinner and presents for the kids.

Sanctity of Hope	25044	1	/users/profile/26037	Briena	Volunteer	5	12/28/2009	As a lover of volunteering, I was looking for an opportunity in which to really get involved, something in which I really felt passionate about. I feel lucky to have been aquainted with Sanctity of Hope. Unlike other volunteer positions I'd held in the past working with the homeless, SOH offered me the opportunity to have more intimate interaction with Portland's homeless. The hot dog barbecue every Wednesday simply exists to have one-on-one interaction with individuals. To get to know them. To understand them. Befriend them. To hear their stories. To better learn their needs. Their means of survival. I have gained many friendships among the homeless through SOH. It has played an essential role in my gaining a better understanding of the diverse situations of the homeless. It has helped me break down borders. It has helped to foster more appreciation, love, and acceptance of unfortunate situations.

Oregon Opportunity Network	94121		/users/profile/108695	Orion L.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/20/2011	Full disclosure: I work here, but for many years before that I was a volunteer on their speakers bureau. I volunteered with them because I am passionate about affordable housing and knew they are key players in the struggle to ensure all Oregonians have affordable housing, and because of their belief that housing gives people an opportunity to build better lives. They are not a direct service, but rather organize, train, and advocate for the affordable housing and community development industry across the state - the organizations working with people in need. When I was on the speakers bureau, we gave testimony at many important local forums, hearings and panels about the difference affordable housing makes in the lives of seniors, people with disabilities and hard working families, and I felt like government officials really listened to what I had to say. That felt great!

National Glbtq Youth Foundation	94393		/users/profile/109145	HLHimes	Board Member	5	07/26/2011	I have been with this organization for the last year and they are absolutely passionate and committed to improving the lives of LGBTQ youth across the country through the use of programs that are scientifically shown to be effective.  This is such an important missing piece in the LGBTQ community as so few resources are proven to be effective before we pour our money into them.  In the fields of social science, this is the standard for all service-based programs.  It's time that the LGBTQ community get the same, expert, research-supported services that are a given in other social programs.   Ultimately, supporting The Foundation is an excellent way to invest in the lives of today's LGBTQ youth and tomorrow's LGBTQ leaders.

PovertyBridge helps community build infrastructure to create a poverty reduction initiative, put on Opportunity Conferences that are structured to give people hope and help, which they have never had before.  Money does not erradicate poverty, People Helpling People and skills and education will erradicate poverty.  PovertyBridge's model helps communities achieve this.

The Arc Of Benton County Inc	237335		/users/profile/321873	JohnLM	Volunteer	3	01/27/2015	The Arc of Benton County primarily raises money through two thrift store operations located in Corvallis and Philomath. These stores are run well and pay slightly above minimum wage for workers who generally have difficulty finding employment at other employers. Item donations to these stores stay local and provide, in themselves, a reasonable benefit for people in the area; they have a modest collaborative effort with area charities to help keep prices lower and selection higher. Other funds come from periodic grants and rental of residential units to families of people with IDD. These properties are reasonably well maintained and run essentially at cost. A long term executive director provides inconsistent leadership that changes based on opportunity rather than purpose. A volunteer board is intermittently and minimally involved in directing the organization. The social benefits of the organization are modest and in good intention but do not provide leadership for social change or disruption of known problems.

Helping Hands Re-Entry Outreach Centers	212723		/users/profile/275801	NoScamsPlease	Client Served	1	08/29/2014	This place is a scam!  It is a rat infested, bed bug infested dangerous building with one toilet and one "meal" a day!  The junkies who are not in a program staying at the homeless shelter are allowed to do anything they want, but if a poor, cancer stricken old lady dares to complain, she gets censured.  The front doors are open all night long, the protect child abusers instead of reporting them, and if you are a cute female with a sizable monthly income AND a place to stay, sleeping with the "manager" you can steal a bed from a truly needy homeless woman to be close to him.  After I called the appropriate agencies to investigate, they found my concerns valid.  However, the "christian" managers accused a clean & sober, pregnant ex-addict of making the calls and threw her out!  The tens of thousands of dollars donated to this place are clearly NOT going to the people and services they were intended for.  I took pictures.  Lots of pictures.  This dump is anything but "christian".  Stand up.  Speak out.  Protect the most vulnerable members of our society.  This abuse must stop now!

They are treking to remote villages hit hard by the earthquake where other large charities have not been.  They have a team of 22 or more volunteers who take food, medical supplies, tents,soap, rope, and clothing to remote villages destroyed by the earthquake and in many cases are the first responders.  GNE is funding this operation with them directly and 100% of funds collected are going to purchase these items and provide fuel to get the volunteers from village to village.  Awesome job by this handful of volunteers.

NORTHWEST SARCOMA FOUNDATION	285951		/users/profile/375995	Becca Z.	Client Served	5	04/15/2016	NW Sarcoma Foundation is dedicated to helping sarcoma patients and raising money for research. They are caring and knowledgeable and their work and help is invaluable to those of us living with and fighting this disease. Sarcomas are rare cancers, often aggressive and resistant to treatment. I think of them as super cancers, big scary monsters. NW Sarcoma Foundation helps in many practical ways, including grants to help with expenses that goes far to alleviate stress when you don't know how you're going to pay your bills AND have gas money to travel to treatment (for example.) 
Sandy Actors Theatre A Non Profit Corporation	319866		/users/profile/411742	GrandmaRosie	General Member of the Public	3	12/05/2016	Thank you for this opportunity to write a review about SAT. I believe it is of great value to Sandy & the surrounding areas (I am writing from Estacada, about 15 miles from Sandy).  The ethic of the volunteers is amazing! Actors, stage hands   - -  creativity is flowing everywhere! However, I do wish I could have afforded to attend SAT's most recent production, which I heard was very good (The Odd Couple). The price for a non-student, non-senior citizen, was $18.00.   No can do!  I understand there are considerable expenses involved in putting on a play, but almost $20.00 for a non-"Downtown" play is ridiculous. Completely absurd. Are well-done community plays only for the middle class? What about the "working poor"? What about those who can not even afford Netflix or a Hulu subscription, & view TV without subscription? We do exist, & apparently are not welcome at a SAT production. (I gave 3 stars because I trust the friends I have who have volunteered for SAT, or who've seen their productions, & enjoy their experiences.)

Delphi Schools Inc	170012		/users/profile/225299	Suzan O.	Donor	5	09/16/2013	We have 3 graduates from the Delphian School in Sheridan and we are very happy parents with equally happy friends who have their children at a Delphi.  The Delphi Program provides model schools that are   needed in today's world.  Trends in education are now moving in the direction that Delphi implemented in the 70's such as proficiency based education--students progress as they demonstrate needed abilities.And there is so much more.  This school is worth supporting to help improve education. That is why our kids were there and why we donate, and why we support the school in other ways.  It is not just about our children--it is also about their children, and all those to follow. 
Ella Curran Community Food Bank	221425	2	/users/profile/285091	Tiffany40	Client Served	1	10/09/2014	I went to this food bank, in need of food to feed my family along with my brother in law who needed to feed his. As we are both experiencing hard times. Never have I been so insulted, as a human being in my life. The elderly lady whom says that she is in charge, as well as refused to give my brother in law the phone number to her boss, insulted us, verbally attacked us, screamed and made us feel completely unwelcome. She told us that we were late. We explained to her that online their brochure specifies different timing than she proposed it did. We advised her to change it, as it was 15 min off than time she told us. We explained that we were sorry, that we were misinformed, but desperately in need of food for our family. She screamed at us, wouldn't make eye contact. She left us , gave us no direction where to go, what to do so we did as another lady told us too, which we were than yelled at and attacked by the lady who claimed to be in charge. She was told on several accounts that she was yelling at everyone, that she was rude and out of line by her colleagues, and yet continued to treat us in a very unmoral, unprofessional manner. I had been in there one other time which she was also very abrupt and rude to a lady because she couldn't speak fluent English. Which is discriminatory and no one going to get help because they need to feed their families should ever be treated in such manner. The outcome of her treatment could cause someone with mental illness to leave and be destructive or even suicidal. She completely dehumanized us, and talked directly about us, in front of us, calling us liars to her colleges.  She mocked us and laughed. People who work at places that help the poor are usually volunteers, but even if not these mannerisms, should never occur, but most especially they should never be allowed! Its hard enough to go to a place in need and feel inadequate to care for your family in these times, but to be treated like we were makes it even more insulting. This lady has been rude on multiple accounts and there should not be a warning, she should be terminated for her actions. 
Kinship House	47306	7	/users/profile/48055	patti4	Client Served	5	06/30/2010	Kinship House provided excellent mental health counseling to our two foster children, whom we did end up adopting.  We had been to other agencies, but they didn't really understand attachment problems.  Kinship House also understands that much of the counseling is needed by the parents to help THEM meet the special needs of their children day to day.  Their support helped us hang in there.  They continue to be willing to provide us needed support on an occasional basis.

Portland Burn Survivors, Inc	95168	1	/users/profile/110330	Steve F.	Volunteer	5	08/06/2011	Everybody needs family, and someone to hang on to in times of trouble. We look to each other for support and understanding, making friends along the way. If you're ever in need of someone to "lean onto" or just talk it out, then PBS is definitely the place for you. They offer support for the burn survivors in our community and abroad. Its not enough to try and depend on our hospitals to educate those who are burned on what to do AFTER the incident. PBS can be your mentor and friend. Come check this group out. They're absolutely great for your morale!
Oregon C U R E	178381		/users/profile/234998	Kiko	Donor	1	10/17/2013	This organization does not disclose information about their mission, goals, identity of officers, no dates, times, or location of business meetings, etc. They do not provide members with any information what so ever that could be used to determine their effectiveness (at doing whatever they are doing). Once a year at their annual meeting they give a very vague "financial report" of their income and expenditures, however they give such broad categories for the expenditures that one cannot get a good idea of how the money is actually being used. They emphasize that all of their work is done by volunteers, but what that work is, or who's doing it, is missing. There is no information provided to members, or on their website that tells anything more than the dates and locations of their informational meetings and support groups. They have not published any type of activity report since 2012.

College Dreams Inc	286631	1	/users/profile/376701	Jessa_G	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	I know a young girl that strived to thrive in a broken home fraught with drug addiction and mental health disorders.  The day after her father attempted suicide the principal called her into his office to introduce her to a lady named Rebecca.  Now, Rebecca wasn't just any ordinary school counselor.  Her job title was 'Behavioral Specialist' and she worked for College Dreams; a 501 (c) (3) located in the young girls hometown in Southern Oregon.  The young girl was offered to join College Dreams, a program for students that aspired to go to college but need guidance and professional counsel because of life circumstances that could potentially prevent education success. The young girl was told that if she wanted to be in the program she would have to commit to maintaining at least a 2.75 GPA, be drug free, and stay out of trouble; that if she stayed true to that commitment then she could be awarded college scholarships among other privileges such as having her sport of choice paid for.  She was thrilled that she was asked to be a part of College Dreams and took home all the information Rebecca had given her to show to her grandparents.  From that day forward she was a College Dreamer! College Dreams provided her with wonderful adult guidance throughout high school.  Her counselor encouraged her and inspired her to pursue her dream to join the Navy and serve her country and attend college.  Not only did the staff at College Dreams shower her with genuine care, understanding and direction, but because of College Dreams she was also awarded a few small scholarships that she eventually used for college tuition.  She was also allowed to use her scholarship money to buy a laptop and printer for her online courses.Thirteen years later, this young woman is now a five year Navy Veteran and a full-time college student at UTSA majoring in Public Administration and minoring in Non-profit management.  I know this story so well because I was the young girl that is now the young woman living out her college dreams.  I don't know where I would have ended up if I was never called into the principles office that day.  Sadly, like many other predisposed youths I could have easily become a high school drop-out and addicted because that was the line I was walking when College Dreams had stepped in to re-direct me.College Dreams is why I give.  I understand the importance of organizations such as College Dreams because of my own experience and how my life was positively impacted by a local nonprofit.  I give because I have hope for my community and the youth in it that want to thrive despite their unfortunate life circumstances.  I want to give because I know that I am not the only person out there that has a positive impact story to tell.  It means a lot to me that I am able to give back to the organization that helped me to become the person I am now; a person capable of giving!  Every time I give back to College Dreams, no matter how small the dollar, it is meaningful for me because I am reminded of the wonderful people like Rebecca that pour their heart and soul into helping mold others in a beautiful and compassionate way.http://www.collegedreams.org/

National Coast Trail Association	120920		/users/profile/164533	David8868	Donor	5	08/17/2012	I should start by saying, that i typically do not take time to write reviews.   Having said that, i felt compelled to share my thoughts on the National Trail Association as well as their Executive Director Al LePage.  I first met Al in 1998.  Al knocked on our door one evening as he was out canvassing and raising money for NCTA.   I was blown away by Al's passion for the issue of trails and trail access along our coast.  His knowledge of the issue, his caring and his clear desire to work at a grass-roots effort to move the needle helped to persuade me to make a donation from what was a very tight personal budget.  Since that night, Al has kept us up to date on all the good work that is being accomplished at the NCTA.    I have consistently been amazed at the amount the NCTA has been able to get done with such a small budget.  Often, i see non-for-profits with bloated budgets that mostly go to overhead, salaries and fancy offices.  The NCTA could not be further from that model.   Al just gets it done and with such a small amount of resources.   That fact, along with Al's earnest and deep passion as well as knowledge of the issue - keeps us giving every year.   I would encourage others to take a meeting with Al and i am sure they will see what i have tried to explain in this note.  Namely, that the NCTA is a great group, doing important work and run by a skilled and passionate leader.
Cannon Beach History Center & Museum	244742		/users/profile/331743	Heidi58	General Member of the Public	5	06/06/2015	They are doing a wonderful Job of collecting the history of this very special town. This town has stayed true to its roots as a artist colonie. And controlled the growth with in the city to represent just that by focusing on strict building codes that has maintained a true feeling of a seaside village and gathered its history to pass on to home owners and businesses. Having purchased a home I was able to leaner about the history of the buildings and the people that lived there and their connection to the town and contributions to the development of the town

Team Eugene Aquatics Inc	172187	3	/users/profile/227920	13579	General Member of the Public	2	09/27/2013	This is a review of Team Eugene Aquatics, which was formerly known as Eugene City Swim Club (ECSC) until ECSC merged with the team at the Eugene Family YMCA in about the mid 2000s. Overall, the coaching on this team is fairly decent and there are one or two coaches who are very good. That said, there are some serious problems with the structure of the organization and members of the board. As a corporation, the only members with voting rights are the board members. This leaves the families on the team no recourse in resolving any issues that arise in a meaningful way.  There is a tendency for some board members to set a very negative tone when dealing with families, particularly when it comes to volunteering.  Volunteers go largely unacknowledged, and communications from the board to parent volunteers can be downright nasty and have been known to be extremely inappropriate. There are serious conflicts of interest within the board. Nepotism runs rampant and the head coach, who is a paid employee, is a voting member on the board and named as the organization's principal officer on tax returns. Additionally, there is no transparency on the part of the board.  At this writing, by-laws have never been posted in an accessible place, board meetings are not announced, and board meeting minutes have not been posted for over a year and a half. Again, the training for the kids is fairly good, but parents should enter knowing that they will spend a good deal of money for membership and meet fees and will not have any rights or influence when it comes to voting or decision making within the organization. 
Salem Multi Institute	48597	4	/users/profile/35691	salemfencing	General Member of the Public	4	07/22/2010	SMI organizes and manages the World Beat Festival every year, which is an amazing weekend of presentations by cultural organizations in and around Salem.  The organization that I work for has been able to share our mission and activities with far more people than we otherwise would get to, so I am appreciative of the festival and hard-working organizers.  We have had direct contact with over 400 people every year who stop by our booth, and we get exposure to thousands more who don't stop but who read about us.  SMI does a world of good by connecting organizations and community members in Salem.
Frazier Duo For Christ Ministries Inc	295517		/users/profile/386307	Blazrbug	General Member of the Public	1	07/12/2016	I would advise anyone who wants to be involved with this organization to do some research on the operators and compare their tax documents through guidestar, verify their revenue and expenses if possible, and look to see if there is any affiliation between their for-profit entities and their tax deductable organization.The photo that I have attached hangs in front of their business, but they claim that the building where this ministry is (their home), is where they operate the business.If they make any false representations, I believe that they should answer for them.
Cascade Policy Institute	311468		/users/profile/402820	rmeinhard	Client Served	5	10/17/2016	I was surprised at the professionalism of the staff, apparently many are college student interns. These people take research seriously. They want to know the facts behind public policy issues. The information they have is eye-opening. Talk to Steve Buckstein or John Charles. They have solid info.In particular, ask about light rail or minimum wage or about current issues or ballot measures. These folks lean Libertarian but they seem to back up their positions with lots of research. They are well connected to other public policy researchers in various specialty areas such as urban planning.It was especially interesting to ask them about counter opinions and their research. They seem to take all research into account.

ONDA fails to realize that thousands of people live and work in the High Desert of Oregon and have for generations. The current actions of ONDA, while well intended, are preventing any and all economic development in the area. The residents of Oregon's High Desert want to preserve it as well, but we also must live off the land. We must be allowed to utilize the natural resources. It is our belief that we can protect the envoronment and utilize it at the same time.

SNIPS has always been there for me providing vouchers that can get the job done at excellent veterinary clinics at a fraction of the cost.  They have been a lifesaver! Now that my finances have improved, I am able to send a regular allotment to this fine non-profit.  I know they are staffed by dedicated, reliable and loving people who only care for the lives of these helpless creatures.  I respect this organization entirely and totally recommend them for both their services provided and their worth as a charitable organization.

Tiger Preservation Center	301663		/users/profile/392639	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	1	08/27/2016	This is one of so many non-profits operating under the guise of "sanctuary" while really just exploiting animals. Year after year the facility breeds yet claims to be a rehabilitation center. The owners constantly schemes to make money, exploiting family, friends, volunteers and most importantly the animals. This facility breeds animals, sells animals, and exploits animals, yet they claim to be a santuary. USDA, should investigate their breeding for profit practices, and work to have the federal license revoked due to all the animal welfare violations. This non-profit organization is a failure to its community. ..claiming the county commissioners were going to "put down" ALL there big cats and close their facility for good...in reality it was a "cry-wolf" tactic that back fired on them. The owners of this facility have been crying out for donations and sending out newsletters begging the public to help feed their animals,  unbeknownst to the public, that they have a contract with walmart to get barrels and barrels of meat every week from over three different walmart locations, which is more than enough for ALL their animals. The Ringo-land circus has been exploiting animals since 1995, they have changed their business name three different times, they have moved locations over three different times. Everything about this so-called  santuary is a complete failure to the well being of ANY kind of animals, emphasis on BIG CATS!!
