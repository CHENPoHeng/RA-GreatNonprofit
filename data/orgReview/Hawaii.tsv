Project Hawai'i, Inc.	309621	2	/users/profile/400975	alohalehua	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/11/2016	Project  Hawaii gave my children  the best Christmas  when me and my husband  couldn't.  With both of us losing our jobs and had no income.  So depressed.  Project  Hawaii was there for us. Magen  became  my inspiration.  And I told God one day I'll be like her.  And give back. Years went by and today I'm a owner of a  restaurant that was always my dream.  And when a storm came and damage our town. My family  went and feed the community,  and now till this day we are the only restaurant in the Hawaii states, that has and runs a food pantry for our community open every day. And do a big thanksgiving  feeding for our community.  Feeding  over 1000. It all starts with a wish and of hope , for all our children  and families  in need. Magen gave my family that hope and answered  my wish. And today I am walking beside her in spirit sharing  the Aloha to all families . Project  Hawaii deserve top honors  for all they do for our children of all islands. Mahalo

Volunteer	5	07/15/2016	My mother found this Teen Mentoring Program online and it definitely became one of best experiences I've been able to go through. It lasts 3 weeks and during it I witnessed the increasingly heavy poverty that Hawaii suffers through. I was blessed to meet a some 25 kids and have the opportunity to care for and get to know them. I was able to see the hope and humility these kids still have in their hearts, even though they suffer from disadvantages every single day. After just a week with them, I have obtained a bigger heart and a better understanding of the real world and its difficulties. I absolutely loved being given the opportunity to serve those less fortunate and giving them the same resources most people are so used to having. Serving and being with children are two immense passions of mine and this program only made them grow. From fundraising on the streets to putting clothes on the keiki, I have a whole new perspective on life. Overall, this program has changed my life and I encourage every teen to take part in this adventure.
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	296675	2	/users/profile/387454	alyssanschneider	Volunteer	5	07/15/2016	I love these kids. They do not deserve to suffer through the hardships that have been forced upon them by their situations. Helping them did not feel like a chore, it fed my soul. The smiles every morning as I served them breakfast they would not usually eat, the beautiful voices singing along with me as I played ukulele, the "I love you for taking care of me's"; All of these things make all the work of being a teen mentor worth it.  I can only hope that the knowledge of appropriate and kind behavior I tried to impart on them everyday sticks and they can be successful in school and life. Magin and Cliff create a truly unique and amazing experience for these children, with countless elements they would not typically experience, being homeless. 
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	293252	2	/users/profile/383857	Itsy	Volunteer	5	06/18/2016	As we are gearing up for the 10th year of providing a summer educational camp for the homeless children it never cease to amaze me the dedication from these awesome volunteers. While I have not been involved the entire 10 years, I have seen ups and downs with all the issues to keep this camp going. Not only having to raise all the funds to provide a free summer camp for homeless children, but to coordinate the community volunteers, set up the transportation and schedule for the field trips, plan the menu and of course do all the shopping. These two dedicated souls have made this a mission beyond what any words can describe. Great Job Project Hawai'i and the two wonderful souls who make this what it is. Magin Patrick and Cliff Kama!!

Project Hawai'i, Inc.	290937	2	/users/profile/381278	HiSocialWorker	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/25/2016	I met this dynamic duo at a conference about people making a difference in the community. I was amazed at the dedication these two people put towards making the lives of homeless children better. Not just basic needs, but their emotional needs, and way beyond just a hand out. Project Hawai'i, Inc. seems to be a tiny organization because there is no paid staff, no office or building, but on the contrary, this program is operating on a large scale of production.  I personally work for another nonprofit organization and I don't put in half the time or energy these two do. Of course I love my job, but I don't make it my life like these two. I am very fortunate to have met these two.What a blessing they are to the community, and to our homeless children. Keep up the great work. A note to those who might be wondering who these two are, or if it is a great cause. Just do your research, google Magin Patrick, or Project Hawai'i. See the changes they make all year round. See their passion and their dedication for your self. Don't judge the fact that they don't have fancy names under their organization, or funding from the government. These two are real. 
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	290114	5	/users/profile/380393	waianaefamily	Client Served	5	05/16/2016	My family is blessed to know Cliff and Magin. We are so happy to have Project Hawai'i in our lives. Our family counts on their support all year long. We struggle, work two jobs and still can't find a place to live with our large family. Project Hawai'i helps with our needs. We rely on their support. I know that they get donations. Thank you to those who give. You help my children all the time. Thank you for not giving up on us
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	284263	3	/users/profile/374297	LocalDonor2	Donor	5	03/31/2016	What an impact my donations make for these precious children. I provide a $25. donation every month for Project Hawai'i, Inc., to use as the see fit to help the homeless. I follow on Facebook to see what a difference they make everyday. I know that I don't give much, but it seems to really change lives. Last week they were able to help a new found family with a tent, a camp stove, pots, emergency supplies, meal gift cards and of course giving that family hope! WOW, that was just one of the days that I know I was part of that difference. It is amazing the happiness these children receive from the dedicated volunteers who truly make a difference on this island.
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	282739	3	/users/profile/372903	Writer	Client Served	5	03/18/2016	Project Hawai'i and its volunteers have been so blessing to us. Our family was living in homeless situations for many years. We could always count on the support of Magin and Cliff to be there for our family. My children call Cliff Uncle...not just as respect but as a true family member. They feel he was part of our family and was there to help. I can't put in words how happy that is for us to have them in our lives. We are not homeless now. I am going to job training and my children are doing well. One thing that we are so grateful is that when the hard times come, we can still call them. We can reach out for help and know they will help. It has been a family tradition to attend their Christmas party with Santa. We wouldn't miss it for the world. That is the ONLY SANTA my children have ever known, and will ever know. It isn't easy being homeless, and isn't easy struggling to stay here in our appartment, but with Project Hawai'i, we know we will succeed
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	282686	2	/users/profile/372851	Writer	Volunteer	5	03/17/2016	In six months of fundraising with Project Hawaii, I have seen the absolute dedication of Magin and Cliff to helping Hawaii's homeless keiki.  Magin is very efficient with funding, and ensures that all money raised goes directly to those in need without any being taken by a middle man.  This is literally the most efficient and productive charitable organization I have ever seen or heard of.  -Tom 
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	282590	2	/users/profile/372746	Writer	Donor	5	03/17/2016	Aloha to Cliff and Magin.Mahalo for making Project Hawai'i, Inc., such a wonderful program for the homeless children on our islands. I have been a supporter for several years. Not only do I provide donations as needed, but participate in various activities to help raise the awareness and support the program. I have found after being involved with this organization, it is truly heart-led, and unmatched by any other I have been involved with. Keep up the good work. Congratulations on your successes with helping homeless children escape their cycle of poverty. 
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	282490	2	/users/profile/372647	Hrdolly	Donor	5	03/16/2016	Project Hawaii has made my children become better human beings. Hunter and Grace are teen mentors for Project Hawaii. They have learned how important outreach is and why we must be selfless. They know it is the duty of private citizens to help the unsheltered children of Hawaii. Where the government fails, we must provide. Thank you Magin for being such a great role model for my children. 
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	281384	3	/users/profile/371429	Writer	Client Served	5	03/01/2016	Just wanted to share how much Magin and Cliff has done for my family. I was a single mom for most of my children's life. These two found us living in a tent. They would come all the time just to check if we are ok and if we need anything. Of course we need a house, a job, but they always came with arms full of stuff for us. Food, blankets, clothes. One day they came with great news. They started working with a few local companies that would give us a chance for work. It was amazing. Places that were willing to hire people like me. Homeless and no education. We were so blessed to have this opportunity. I am not working thanks to them. Still homeless, but at least my children have more of what they need. At least I can provide for some of their stuff, not just hoping for a miracle.Cliff and Magin are the kindest souls around and they help because they love us, not because they have to. They help us every time they can. They truly care for all of us, even when we don't know what is best for us.
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	279122	3	/users/profile/369166	Writer	Client Served	5	02/05/2016	I just wanted to thank Project Hawai'i for being there for my family. This program is not just a hand out to those who are homeless. The people who run the program, Magin and Cliff, are truly caring people. They give us what they can every chance. I know they work hard in the community to get donations. I am so grateful for this program. Homeless people do have lots of resources , but none are caring like this. Project Hawai'i really makes the difference that our family needs to keep hope. I used to have a job, I used to have a home, and now my children and I are homeless. Magin and Cliff don't make us feel less, or look down on us. They make us feel welcome and want to help. They really want to help. No shame, just help. Mahalo to those who help this program going.

Santa will still come to our children. I kow I can count on you both. I kow my children will be good. Maybe people dont know what it means to have support. I kow my family is blessed to be helped by Project Hawaii. Even if it isnt Project Hawaii and just Magin and cliff, my family is good. This is our first Christmas in a house. This is our first Christmas getting a tree. We love you guys

We are happy knowing you are there for us. Without you we dont have basic stuff like toothbrushes or even soap. We look forward to the boxes of food when you guys come. I am glad to write a riview for you. I hope that it helps. My family is greateful for you both being in our lives. See you again soon.Love from the Kahani Ohana
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	262062	2	/users/profile/350728	Familyblessings	Donor	5	10/07/2015	I have been on the islands for over 20 years. Every year our family makes the effort to sponsor a child during the holidays. We typically see people in front of a store, or a toy box in a company. It seemed easy and we thought we were making a difference. I am sure we were, but not on the same level that we did giving to Project Hawai'i, Inc. Christmas Wish Program. Not only were we able to sponsor a child, this child was homeless living in a tent. Our family took last year one step further and volunteered at the Christmas Party and met so many homeless children. While we might not have heard their stories, know anything about them, the smiles on their faces, the laughter that filled the room was more than enough to know that we finally found the place our heart will stay. We hope that others will take the opportunity to really see how they can make a difference. We are forever grateful for the opportunity that Project Hawai'i has giving our family. The wonderful people who run this volunteer based program are truly the blessings that these children need. It is unimaginable what these children face on a daily basis. I am just glad that Project Hawaii's dedicated directors are there to make the difference during the holidays.Amazing people!!! Check them out for yourself.
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	259489	2	/users/profile/348010	passerby	General Member of the Public	5	09/25/2015	I was taking my granddaughter shopping for a few fun items at the local Walmart. I ran across a group of young children holding signs and fishnets collecting money for "Homeless Keiki". I was actually truly interested in what this program was about. I feel it is important for my children and grandchildren to understand what is going on where we live, and in our community. So, I from the parking lot, I walked my granddaughter to the sidewalk to talk to one of the volunteers. This volunteer was the father of a one of the young children holding the signs. This volunteers was actually a client at one time and shared his experience with me and my granddaughter. He stated that without this program his children would not be as successful in school as they are now, they would not have the hope a  better future that they have now, and they would not know the meaning of true care and compassion like they do now.While is no longer living in the car with his children, he feels connected to this program. He feels it is the least he can do, give back to those who helped his family so much. I was touched. I did realize that the director and her family were on the road as well. I am glad I was actually able to talk to the children and the father of those who this program helped, rather than the director herself. It is a wonderful experience to see good works in action. It was my pleasure to make a donation. I truly hope that the community takes the time to truly understand the importance of Project Hawai'i, Inc. I know for my family, we will continue to keep updated and provide donations when possible. 
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	251542	2	/users/profile/339497	Terri61	Volunteer	5	08/04/2015	Hello everyone,I wanted people to know how caring and generous Project Hawaii is. I was having a difficult finacial time because  of me having to stay home with two special needs children. I was unable to buy school supplies and I seen that they were helping homeless people, so I asked them for help. Within 24 hrs they had come to my house with backpacks full.of school supplies. They were very caring and loving. My kids can npw go to school without fearing that they would be bullied because they were less fortunate. Thank you Project Hawaii,ALOHA,MURAOKA
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	251438	2	/users/profile/339385	milaandrobin	General Member of the Public	5	08/03/2015	I ran across a lady and gentleman one day while I was out with my children at the park. I saw them with their camp shirts, assumed they were the group leaders, along with lots of little children. They seemed to be so involved with the children and truly wanted to be there. Just saying, because I have seen lots of out of control camps destroying parks, children yelling and running out of control, etc. The lady blew her whistle and all here children came running. It was very cute. They all came from all directions running and "landed" in two completely straight lines. Most the children had hands on their side, looking forward and ready to "go".I watched as she shouted out the requests to these children. Holding her hands up over their heads, "I need to see a girls line" with the other hand going up, "I needs to see a boys line" for those who need to go to the bathroom. The lines once again formed and the children were quite and calm. She then said, "quietly go to the bathroom, no running, and come back to line". Oh, right? I thought. Well the two little lines walked across the lawn and went quietly on their way.During this time, I took a minute to ask what this program was about. Magin Patrick, said quickly, We are Project Hawai'i Summer Camp, a camp for homeless children. Our nonprofit runs 100% by volunteers to help them escape their cycle of poverty. I thanked her for what she was doing and collected my children to go.After this experience, I did look up Project Hawai'i on line. I stayed awake far to long reading over their accomplishments and stories of whom lives they have changed.There was a small section, review our agency.I truly felt compelled to share my story, (and make a donation), with the public because what I witnessed in just the hour my children played at the park was amazing. Two people so dedicated to changing the lives of these homeless keiki.Congratulations on all you do!! Mila and Robin
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	251247	2	/users/profile/339167	44animalrights	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/02/2015	I have been involved in several nonprofit organizations across the county. After settling in Hawai'i and finding a great retirement home, I was so blessed to find Project Hawai'i. This organization has made it possible for me to give back to my newfound community and be involved with something special. Project Hawai'i is a different type of nonprofit from what I have ever worked for in the past. Being run 100% by volunteers is a strange concept I had not truly understood until being a volunteers here. There seems to be no real funds coming in, not much in the way of donations, and no stable support, yet these two people make EVERYTHING happen. Yes, I know it comes mostly from their pockets and hard work, but it is still amazing that the energy and time they focus to help the homeless children.Like many before me, volunteers come and go. They seem to give up  or become overwhelmed because the need is so great and the resources are just not there. I too have not been able to volunteer as much as is needed, and feel that this organization truly needs more support so it can continue. I have seen success in the children's lives and progress in the programs offered. It is truly amazing how much is being done with out proper support.I have heard, "starting on a shoestring budget", this organization doesn't even have the shoestring and yet are able to provide the children with the entire shoe.If you are looking for a great way to make a difference, please try Project Hawai'i. If you are looking to make a donation that will benefit the children, donate here. There is no waste, no red tape, no hassle. Just helping these precious children.
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	251032	1	/users/profile/338923	WaianaeOhana96792	Client Served	5	08/01/2015	My family is so grateful for having this angel in our lives. I only met her yesterday on facebook through a comment that she posted from another family who was looking for school supplies. I don't think that the people really understand what it means to come from Wai'anae. Wai'anae is not an easy place to grow up. Keiki are not always nice to each others and get bullied at school. Families are poor. They can't afford to get the things children need and the children suffer. My children were not going to school until I could figure out how to get them supplies. I did go places. No one helped because I didn't have the right paper work. Paperwork is what keeps my children from going to school.I answered the comment Magin put on facebook and hoped there was no paper work. How can there be paper work on a facebook comment. Well there was one little sheet that had my children names and ages and clothing size and where they went to school. Everything on the paper was for my children, not about me, not about where we come from, not anything that is so hard to get. Just my childrens needs!! NEEDS!!! nothing else.I didn't even fill out the paper work until after she gave my children new backpacks full of stuff. not just school supplies but with toothpaste and toothbrush, soap and so much other stuff for the children.I know it is strange to think that I would give a review after only meeting a lady for a few minutes. She changed my luck and answred my prayers for my children. She didn't ask any questions, just gave us what we needed, smiled and waved goodbye. Then today, she asked me and I guess others to write a review. I am glad to do this. This is important that everyone knows what this program is doing and how much they really care. they help without judgement. they help without trouble. They just help!! Mahalo Project Hawaii for helping my children and giving them the supplies they needed.

Project Hawai'i, Inc.	251025	1	/users/profile/338914	PrincessTBA	Client Served	5	08/01/2015	would like to share the exprience that I had with my family and Project Hawaii. I found them on a facebook comment. I saw a post that someone needed school supplies for their children and under the comment Magin Patrick responded that she would take care of everything including the backpacks. So, what if I ask? can't hurt since my children aren't going to school anyway and they have no supplies. That next day she came to help us, no hassles. On fb she asked the grades and gender of my children, not about their names, or what my situations is, just what she needed to get the stuffs.She came and gave it, I signed a paper saying I needed help, and then she went. Well after we gave her hugs and my children cried because they were so happy to be able to go to school with the things they need.My children have never had a new backpack. Never!! they always had others people that gave us, or were donations that were left by our area where we stay.I cannt believe that she is really there for people like me and my children. She is a blessing and an angle. I hope that Project Hawaii is able to continue helping other families like mine forever. She is truly a blessing to my children. This was two days ago and my children are still asking why the lady gave us so much stuff.
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	247552	2	/users/profile/24444	kaloli	Volunteer	5	07/06/2015	I am both a volunteer and a donor, and have been with Magin for past 11 years.  She is truly dedicated to  all these children  and can't imagine what they would do without her and Cliff.  However, it is very frustrating to see her work so hard to obtain the funds so desperately needed in order to provide all that they do for these keiki; often times, coming up short, but somehow she still makes it work!!!   Project Hawaii is the best!!  
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	228692	2	/users/profile/24444	kaloli	Volunteer	5	10/28/2014	I have been a volunteer with Magin & Project Hawaii since moving to the Big Isld 10 yrs ago.  She is totally devoted to helping these homeless keiki and their families.  If it weren't for her and Cliff,  I don't know what many of these families would do.  They work nonstop to raise funds to provide not only the necessities (food, clothing, hygiene items), but to also give them some joy in their lives; i.e., holiday parties/events, summer camps, etc.  It is unfortunate that Magin and Cliff must work so hard to raise the funds needed to accomplish these goals and that many of the local community organizations/business, do not step-up to help them.  Project Hawaii should be one of the top non-profits in Hawaii.    
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	136886		/users/profile/24444	kaloli	Volunteer	5	11/10/2012	I have been both a regular volunteer and donor for Project Hawaii since moving to HI over 8 years ago.  Magin has continually done an amazing job of always being there for any child/family in need while simultaneously organizing and offering all her regular yearly events for these children-- Christmas, Thanksgiving, Easter, summer camp, etc. She manages all of these tasks while working with only donations and volunteers. Project Hawaii is long overdue for major recognition and financial assistance!  
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	23360	1	/users/profile/24444	kaloli	Volunteer	5	12/03/2009	I have been with Magin and Christmas Wish since moving to HI five years ago. And I have never experienced someone so dedicated to their "cause" as Magin. As another reviewer noted, she will use her own funds if she does not meet her monetary goals for a particular campaign, i.e., christmas gifts, books, food. I also agree that she seems somewhat dis- organized but amazingly to me (since I am a very organized person) everything falls into place and works! She does so much for these homeless keiki, it is really heartbreaking to see how oftentimes the community does so little to help her cause. Many families would be much worse off it weren't for Magin and Christmas Wish.
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	247087	1	/users/profile/334577	WeekendWarrior	Volunteer	5	07/02/2015	Aloha, I was volunteering for this program at their last collection site in Pearl City. I was actually SHOCKED to see the lack of support this agency receives. The coordinator was there with her sign in sheet of all the people who inquired or "signed up" to help and the actual show up was quite different. The list probably had 20 plus people, some families, some with friends. I showed up about 10 minutes late, so missed some of the orientation, but there were only 5 people there to help. ONLY 5. Truly this organization needs more support and more commitment from the community. Yes, we do make a difference, but having double or triple the amount of people would CHANGE lives, not just make a difference.So, why did I help. 1. To make  a difference in the life a homeless child2. To help raise the awareness that our island is in a crisis and these children need change.3. To be involved with an organization that is out there doing what they say, and making the difference without red tape.WHY SHOULD YOU HELP? I suppose because Project Hawai'i needs you to continue their efforts to feed and care for the homeless children.I am not sure if everyone understand what Project Hawai'i, Inc. does, or WHO THEY ARE.Project Hawai'i, Inc. is a nonprofit that helps provide emergency and basic life needs to children living in extreme poverty unsheltered areas across the islands. They provide school support, emergency care, holiday events and so much more life changing opportunities to these children.WHO IS PROJECT HAWAI'I, INC????First let me say THEY ARE NOT a government agency, they do not have government funding and they do NOT have any paid staff.SO, who is Project Hawai'i, Inc.  As far as I can tell it is Magin Patrick and Cliff Kama, 2 people dedicated to make a difference on their days off. TWO PEOPLE who put together a huge organization to change lives and make a difference. TWO PEOPLE who invite the community to help, who struggle through the hard times, and still care for these children.I was amazed, it truly is TWO PEOPLE and a handful of people who help when they can, here and there to make a difference. YOU CAN BE PART OF WHAT MAKES THE DIFFERENCE. 
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	241149		/users/profile/327629	echolove	Donor	5	04/15/2015	While volunteering with Project Hawai'i over the holidays, I realized what a difference they truly make for the children living in extreme poverty. Some of us might think that a little gift, or a box of food doesn't really do anything to really make a difference. But from my experience it does. These children not only wait for Magin and Cliff to show up, they are so excited to just to see that they really do care for them. The children rely on these two people to bring them life needs, and LOVE. I couldn't believe my eyes to see the bond these two have with the children. To be a part of this program, weather it be a donor or a volunteer, it does make a difference. This organization is not just a general drop off stuff organization. They are hands on, and they do take it personal. Treating these children and families as if they were their own, Cliff and Magin really do provide care beyond belief and I am happy to have made a difference with my donations and time. Looking forward to continuing to know that I do make a difference on this island for these precious children living in poverty. Please support Project Hawai'i, Inc., any way you can.
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	236955	1	/users/profile/278254	Mahalos	Client Served	5	01/17/2015	Thank you for a wonderful Christmas for my family. I have 3 children and we have been homeless for 5 years living in the streets and not knowing what to do. When you guys found us a few years ago it really changed our lives. We are now on the way to recovery and we live at a tempory housing program. This is because of Magin and Cliff. They really care about us and they want to see us succeed. The support is not expected and more than imagined. Just happy to be able to know that no matter what we can count on Project Hawaii. mahalo and happy holidays
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	214931	2	/users/profile/278254	Mahalos	Client Served	5	09/13/2014	I just want to thank everyone. My children would not be going back to school with their supplies if you were not there for us. Thank you for always being there. We wish we didn't need to count on you two, but it is nice to know we can. Mahalo for all your care to my children-M.K.
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	228860	3	/users/profile/292538	hitrudy	Volunteer	5	10/28/2014	When I discovered Project Hawaii many years ago when I moved to the Big Island, I was stunned to find out how many kids were living in poverty and/or homeless.  Magin is so dedicated to these children and never judges them.  She knows they are "innocent bystanders" of their circumstances.    It is truly heartwarming to see what a difference Project Hawaii has made in so many children's lives.
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	224594	1	/users/profile/288351	SCH1	Donor	5	10/20/2014	Project Hawai'i has not only changed the lives of the children I donated to, but has changed my life in unexpected ways. I never expected to actually see the impact that might donation might make. As with everyone, you hope your donation is used as stated and truly makes a difference, but to actually have meet a child that was involved as a client served in a parking lot was amazing. This little girl, a bunch of her siblings and her mom were standing in the parking lot next to the entrance of Walmart. Fumbling through their overstuffed backpack looking for something, and blocking the way of my cart.  So, I kindly asked if they needed help finding something, as I could tell they were not going to be able to move. The mom stated to me that she had lost her gift card that the little girl got for Christmas, and they had spent all their money on the bus to shop with these cards, but couldn't find the daughters one.The little girl was crying and saying that her aunty was going to be mad because Santa gave her the card, and just went on and on. I was a donor of some of these cards. I donated 10 $10 Walmart Cards to help families in need through Project Hawai'i, Inc. So, I asked the mom what agency provided these cards. She replied that Santa gave them to the children in their stocking.  Not being rude for their sake, I asked if that was with Project Hawai'i. The mother answered, yes, Magin delivers for Santa because he can't come into the bushes with his reindeer. I gave the mom another $10.00 for the daughter and proceeded to conduct my shopping.As I was in the store, I really felt blessed to once again know that what I do makes a difference because I chose an agency who truly cares for these precious children. Of course I don't know if those were the gift cards I donated, but obviously the children are getting their blessings and their lives are enhanced, just as Project Hawai'i claims to do. Enhancing the lives of homeless keiki.

Magin and her staff are 100% dedicated to the children and their families.   They are there to fill in the gaps that families face when it comes to providing there children with educational opportunities, school supplies and shoes and clothes.   If not for this wonderfully awesome program I don't know what we would have done.   They are by far the best volunteer program we have had the pleasure of working with! 
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	216735	1	/users/profile/280237	VolunteeringHeart	Volunteer	5	09/24/2014	As a volunteer, it is hard to imagine that the little time that one gives will make such an impact on these precious children. I went in this adventure for a 3 hour volunteer shift...like a 3 hour tour, I was STUCK. Stuck helping these children have a wonderful life with this awesome program. I have volunteered for other agencies, at school and such, but nothing really seems to touch the heart like this agency does.The homeless children are so dependent on their environment, community and yes, Project Hawai'i, Inc., just to survive. That is all these children doing, surviving to live another day. Who knows what the other day might bring? At least they can look forward to fun activities and supplies that Project Hawai'i provides. Keep up the good work, and hopefully your dream of being able to save ALL the homeless children of Hawai'i will come true!
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	215489	1	/users/profile/278915	Chelsey E.	Volunteer	5	09/18/2014	I came from Pittsburgh, PA, to Hawaii to volunteer with Project Hawaii in 2010. Since then, the experience has still stuck with me as one of the best of my life. Magin works endlessly to ensure the children of Hawaii are taken care of despite the odds, and the rest of the volunteers do just the same. I am forever grateful for the work they do and I hope one day to be able to return to Hawaii and see what more awesome steps the organization has made to make the lives of the island's homeless population better.

Project Hawai'i, Inc.	215449	1	/users/profile/278859	WithAloha	General Member of the Public	5	09/17/2014	Aloha, I was newly introduced to this program by attending a charity event hosted by Project Hawai'i, Inc. My friend was invited to an event, so I tagged along. Not really knowing what to expect, as there are so many charities out there, and everyone claims to be "changing the world". Well this was a bit different, not only did they not claim any outrageous claims, they simply invited everyone at the event to make a difference in their own way. Not asking for a donation, or even time...just do what you can to make a difference in  your own way. They made the awareness of facts about homelessness that I don't think any of us realized, then gave simple solutions to how everyone can make a difference in their everyday lives. It was amazing that these two people can run an organization with such passion and NOT EXPECT anything from anyone...just the hope to do something to help these little children on our islands.I encourage everyone to see what Project Hawai'i, Inc. is truly about. Listen to what is going on within their organization and choose to make a simple difference in just a few hours of your life.I had fun at the event, my friend won a wonderful prize, and I purchased a silent auction item for a steal. I hope this review is helpful for those who might be wondering who Project Hawai'i, Inc. is really all about.
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	215447	1	/users/profile/110050	Aloha	Volunteer	5	09/17/2014	Aloha,Once again I am honored to be asked to write a review about Project Hawai'i, Inc. As a long time volunteer this program still continues to bring tears to my eyes as I am able to help so many children through the efforts of Project Hawai'i, Inc. I am so fortunate to be able to have found such a great organization that truly cares about the over all success of these children and allow the community to participate in their vision. While it is a "hard" position to volunteer because not many people show up to make the difference and help where it is most needed, it is well worth the time and effort. I truly wish to see more support in the year coming. Project Hawai'i, Inc. , has the most dedicated team of volunteers working year round to meet the needs of these children, and I am glad to be a part of it. Both by giving time, and giving a monetary donation towards their needs.
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	94994	2	/users/profile/110050	Aloha	Volunteer	5	08/04/2011	As the volunteer coordinator for the summer camp program I wish to say that this is an awesome way to truly get involved and make a difference in the lives of the children served. The community has the opportunity to work hands on with homeless and poverty stricken children and guide them through their daily routines.By participating for even a few days of camp can truly make the difference in the over all success.This year I was able to work with wonderful heartfelt and dedicated volunteers from all over the islands. Yes, we were even able to have college students from O'ahu join us in this years summer adventures. Volunteers came from Volcano area, Puna District and as far as Kona to help create a wonderful experience for our keiki.As the director, I am always looking for more community support and involvement from people helping to organize or conduct a fundraiser or collection site, to helping implement some of the daily activities. Volunteers are all encouraged to add and share their talents with our keiki, even if just a few hours during the day.Without the community support, this camp will not succeed. So, please make a difference today and join our efforts for tomorrow

Without all our volunteers and donors, we would not be able to provide support to the thousands of children we provide services to. It is because of you, our homeless keiki are growing healthy and happy, escaping their cycle of poverty. May all of you continue to be part of our organization for years to come.
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	192869	1	/users/profile/251863	BoatHarborOhana	Client Served	5	01/21/2014	I just want to say thank you for everything that you do for all of us. Not just our family but everyone who comes into your life, you care for. It is amazing how much love you share for all our children. When times are tough you are always there. I can't thank you enough for everything. I hope that someday we can repay your kindness that you have shown to all of us. I know that sometimes the families down here at the boat harbor aren't always grateful and they don't seem to care what happens to their children, but I know that you will always be there for all of us. Our family would not be as well off and not as happy just being alive it if wasn't for you and Cliff. We love you. We hope that you are able to continue to help those who come to our harbor and seek help.See you soon.

We had a wonderful time and the Christmas party. I know if it wasn't for your support, my children would go without a gift. Your party is more than just a hand out. It makes us feel like family and feel the joy of the holidays in these hard times.My children enjoyed the party so much they still talk about it. The prizes they won were such a great help, I won't have to buy shampoo for the month. We are so happy to have new blankets too.It is a life experience that we are blessed to have.You and your family are so great. Merry Christmas
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	172263	2	/users/profile/228007	Amazing	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/28/2013	I ran into this organization by chance and it changes my outlook on what it means to be a social worker. As Magin would state, "nothing is by chance and everything happens for a reason." However, being a social worker for over 15 years, dedicating my life to what I thought would change the lives I touched, was nothing compared to what I experienced working with this program.Project Hawai'i, Inc., truly makes the difference in the lives they provide services to. Far beyond filling the holes and gaps that other agencies face. I couldn't believe the dedication they have to help the children, even with the means. It never seemed to cross their minds that there might not be funding available, or to check the computer to see what was in their inventory. Never saying no, and never turning away children as they lined up for supplies. It was truly amazing to see them in action!!Here is my experience:My experience was a unique one I suppose. Just happened to be at their place of giving at the right time. I was watching from across the field lots of children gathering around waiting for their turn for something. I just sat back and watched as this little old van pulled up and opened the doors, children ran up to the passenger side, yelling aunty, aunty. She calmed them down and told them to line up, and they DID! That was enough to get my full attention. These children all sat nicely along a rock wall waiting quietly. She called them all one by one all by name. They went to her and got their backpacks filled with supplies, a lunch bag and other things I couldn't quite make out. There seemed to be several dozen children waiting on the wall never to be called. She looked at them and asked, "where did you all come from?" Mostly their replies where they knew she was coming and needed supplies too. She told them she would return with all their supplies and took down names.That is when I stepped in. I asked her where she was from, how she was going to get the supplies, and so forth. Her response to me was mind blowing!!She stated she was going to run to Walmart to pick up the items needed for these children. She didn't have enough because she didn't know these children were going to be here. Stating this happens to her often, children in need just seem to find her. She doesn't have extra and knows that not enough funds came, but these children need these supplies to succeed in school and therefore she is going to get it.Well, that is just amazing. The different agencies I have worked for in the past, including one's with major funding would not have even done this. They would have have told those children too bad, and put them on a wait list. They would go about their daily "job" and forget about the crisis.So, if you want to meet a truly amazing lady, please take the time to meet Magin, attend one of her events and be part of something great.Of course I am sure there are other involved, but this woman is really remarkable. I feel bad, as I didn't have time to meet the man she was with, assuming it is her husband, but he seemed to just follow her lead and they drove off to Walmart. 
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	164651	1	/users/profile/218828	Marya Mann	Volunteer	5	08/11/2013	Project Hawaii (PH) offers children a chance. Without good nutrition, a young mind and body cannot thrive. Knowing there are 35,000 children under the age of 5 on a daily average who are living homeless and without meals in the state of Hawaii'i, they're doing something about it. Going out into beaches, in parking lots, finding their way to the most indigent among us, they provide holiday meals, tutorial programs and guidance for youth-at-risk, reversing the life-long victim-dominator patterning because they have never known anything else. They have never lived outside the circumstances of poverty, the domination of hunger and the ensuing victimizing circumstances that surround such conditioning. With Project Hawai'i, children are offered a way through. By being fed as consistently as possible with nourishing food, encouraging messages and pathway out of their desperate situations, children regain hope. Magin and Cliff are doing what society ought in its right mind to do: to care for the children, beginning at the beginning: with good nutrition. Project Hawai'i is making a difference, and showing what individuals with the will to serve humanity can do to create a better world. 
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	164318	1	/users/profile/218365	Holiday Helpers	Volunteer	5	08/06/2013	Aloha,I am honored to be able to write a review and share my story for Project Hawai'i. I truly believe this organization is a blessing to the community and to those lives they touch. Not only life changing for the homeless children they provide services to, but for the volunteers and their families.I want to share my experience volunteering at the Christmas Party on O'ahu. It was truly amazing.When my family showed up to the park we were over whelmed with how much was going to be provided to the children, from the games, activities, meals and the presents. Van load after van load appeared packed with items for the party. I looked around and wondered where all the help was going to come from, but not too many people showed up. This didn't seem to frazzle Magin at all. She just kept moving, assigning projects to people and working like a whirl wind. Here and there volunteers would come, and she would put them in a spot that needed help. There never seemed to be enough help, and I really doubted the completion or readiness of the party.About 30 minutes early little children started showing up, homeless families and others from out of nowhere. This was also an experience in itself. Magin just quickly organized these impatient little bodies, telling them just hang on, she was almost ready for them. I looked around, questioning how she thought anything was "almost ready'. Then like a flash, more like a miracle, everything was ready just as she had hoped. All the food was ready, the games set and the presents sorted.I saw hundreds of children lining up, well not really "lining up" but more like crowding around all the activities and the games, the food and hoping for their gifts from Santa.Well, at the end of this quick as a flash party, there were so many happy faces, full bellies and tired volunteers.I wouldn't want to spend my holiday any other way!! Thank you so much for allowing our family the opportunity to provide happiness to so many children. There was no way to count how many children there were that day, but the directors stated that over 700 plates of food were served, and they had 481 children on the  list.  Well that would seem like enough, but over 50 children showed up unregistered. It was like magic, as this organization plans for everything. Truly a sight to see, She opened up the back of her shiny red car, like Santas sleigh and pulled out more gifts, some in the form of gift cards, some just marked "extra" and some needing to be wrapped. It was amazing to see that she does really have the heart and the magic that makes Christmas so wonderful for everyone.I would recommend anyone who wants to experience the spirit of the holiday, to volunteer for one of Project Hawai'i, holiday programs.I did notice that they do need more support, so you can be the difference that makes it even more special.

Project Hawai'i, Inc.	164093		/users/profile/217977	Friendly Comments	General Member of the Public	5	08/02/2013	Aloha,I was at the Wai'anae Boat harbor yesterday and saw a group of children hanging around. More than usual, and just sitting on the wall waiting for something. I thought maybe there was a sign up, or something going on as there are many homeless in this area. These children really seemed intent on "holding their space". Not really doing much, not playing or anything, just sitting.My family was at the park having lunch, so I was just curious to what they were waiting for. Then a blue van pulled up, all at once the children stood up and pushed their way to the van door. A lady jumped out and they all seemed so happy to see her. I heard them shouting, but not really sure what. Many children started coming from other cars, and out of no where to see her. There were two people there for about an hour handing out backpacks, school supplies and food to the children. They all just sat on the wall and waited their turn. It was actually amazing that they were so well behaved and just waiting. As if they knew their turn would come and no one would be left behind.I watched as many of the children crossed the parking lot back to the bushes, and some got in old cars. I knew these children were homeless and waiting for something, but it was amazing at what came for them. The children and the two adults exchanged so many hugs and laughter together. Really amazing the way they all came together in harmony.After the two left, I walked to my car and asked one of the ladies sitting their with her children who those people were. I wanted to know because it seemed like such a wonderful thing happening. They had nothing wrote on the van doors, no banners, no big productions but I would guess well over 50 children sat there waiting. She actually gave me their business card she said they gave her because she lost their number. She said they come all the time and care for the children who live in the harbor. Her children were able to attend the summer camp and went all over the place. I visited their website to see how I could get involved and then saw their request for reviews. I think what they do is truly something to be commended for. These two people put so much work and care into their support. I really was amazed to see this. Our family goes to this park once in a while, have seen churches have service and provide meals, other handouts of food, but nothing that actually touched my heart. This program is full of passion and after visiting their website, I hope they do get more people like me to notice them. To make a difference in our community.Thank you for helping our keiki of Wai'anae.
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	164092	1	/users/profile/217975	Homeless	Client Served	5	08/02/2013	To Magin and Cliff at Project Hawaii.If it wasnt for all your hard work and care for my keiki they would not be going to school with the stuff they need. My family lives in our van and it doesnt matter where we are you always seem to bring us what we need just in time for my children.I am glad that you are going to be reviewed and I hope that I can help you tell everyone what a wonderful program this is for my children.Please keep doing what you do. Tell everyone that you still want to help the homeless children. I hope that you always find the help you need to help us. We all thank you because we are not able to help ourselfes.you never make us feel like we are less or not good enough. My children always feel comfortable with you and dont feel like we are begging for help. We feel loved from you. We trust you and know you care for us. I am glad that you found us.Over the years we have looked for help but it isnt the same like yours. We dont have to go through so much it makes us give up. you dont care if we dont have all the papers needed and dont judge us. You are just there for us. I want to thank you and let everyone know that you do a great job.Love from all of our ohana 
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	163862	1	/users/profile/217647	OahuObserver	General Member of the Public	5	07/30/2013	Aloha,I want to nominate Project Hawai'i, Inc., for this years top rated charities because I believe in what they are doing for the homeless children on the islands of Hawai'i. While there are many programs out there that provide services for the homeless, I feel that Project Hawai'i takes "providing for" to a new level of "caring for". They truly care about the children on a different level and make them part of their own ohana. It is amazing watching these volunteers interact with the children.I was able to see their program first in action as an observer at the Wai'anae Boat Harbor during one of their "service days".  It was nothing like I have ever seen in an organization. Not only did the two directors know each child by name, they had a special bond that can only be shared by those who truly have a heart for those who they work with. The children openly hug them, show their appreciation and welcome them into their world.I was able to see this interaction and then watch them get the children ready for summer camp. They actually went into the bushes and brought the children out one by one. They gave them clean clothing and breakfast to start the day and then took them on a trip. Although I didn't go on the field trip, I did see the start of the day, and was really amazed about the level of care they provide for these precious children.I hope they do win some sort of recognition for all their efforts. Being solely supported by public donations makes it hard to provide all the children's needs, but with more exposure to the true Project Hawai'i impact, they can continue their efforts.
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	163783	1	/users/profile/217516	Sereina	Volunteer	5	07/29/2013	This year I was one of the few fortunate individuals that was able to make a difference in the lives of homeless children at the summer camp hosted by Project Hawai'i. I saw how much this camp truly makes the difference and touches lives of children living in poverty. These children go days without healthy meals, wear dirty clothing day after day, and don't have access to running water or electricity. Project Hawai'i puts an end to their daily routine of living and provides them with more than enough healthy foods to choose from, provides daily hygiene routine and has so much educational programs throughout the day.I was amazed that not too many people actually are involved through this volunteer program. It is life changing for everyone involved, and I am so happy to be one of the few!!I would like to share this with the world, letting everyone know what a difference just a few hours of your day can make.I saw how this camp helps the children with an over all sense of well being.Please reach out and be part of this program to assure it's success for many years to come.
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	159616	1	/users/profile/211787	ManaMae	Volunteer	5	06/05/2013	I found Project Hawai'i online through the United Way volunteer site. At first I was just looking for a one day event my child and I could participate in. It turned out to be a life changing experience for both my family and the homeless children we are volunteering for. The director asked us to conduct a food drive to help with the summer camp needs. We were given a menu list and set up a drive at a local grocery. This was an eye opening experience. Here my daughter and I sat, greeting customers as they walked by and asking if someone would like to donate a can of food to help homeless children. It was not as easy as I thought. People not only walked by ignoring us as if we were doing something wrong, but made rude and unwanted comments. By the end of the day we did succeed, but in the meanwhile, we learned about the communities true feelings about the issues we shared. This was  a learning experience for my daughter as well. I had to reinforce that what we were doing was a great thing, we are making a difference, and those who choose to be mean are not those we need to help either. It was an experience that is hard to express. I would encourage others to conduct a drive, as it is one of the most important links in the over all success of the camp, but be prepared to learn about people and the community in which you live.Over all, I am so happy that we had this opportunity to help all the homeless children that attended camp. I know that my contribution and time was greatly appreciated and did make a difference. My own family would not have been able to donate close to the amount of food we were able to collect. This shows that your time is more valuable than you realize. Putting a few hours in to good use does make the difference while volunteering with Project Hawai'i.I hope others will do the same, as I know this agency needs the support
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	158378	1	/users/profile/24296	Sonia	Volunteer	5	05/21/2013	I want to say that participating as a volunteer for Project Hawai'i is very rewarding. Not only for the volunteers but for the little homeless children they serve. As a volunteer you will feel the passion that the directors have for the program and the keiki. It is amazing to work with such dedicated people who never seem to give up regardless the trials they face.I know that I make the difference with any program I participate in. They are run by volunteers, and at some events they really need MORE. So, if you are looking to volunteer somewhere you know will make a difference in the lives of homeless children, then this would be a great place to start.
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	126248	1	/users/profile/24296	Sonia	Volunteer	5	10/17/2012	Aloha, I was a teen mentor at the summer camp and was able to work hands on with the homeless children throughout the summer. It was the most incredible time of my life. I was so impressed with the organization of the program as well as the care given to the children. In some ways these children are "spoiled" by the director. They are taken care of so well they are almost able to forget they are homeless. This organization changes their lives and their families lives to help break the cycle of poverty.  I am so happy to be part of such a wonderful program. Their summer camp is the best place on earth for the homeless keiki.  
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	89335	1	/users/profile/24296	Sonia	Volunteer	5	06/01/2011	Hello Everyone who wants to know about this wonderful experience. I am happy to once again participate in the survey to share my experience. I guess this year they want to know how Project Hawai'i Summer Camp cares for the health of the children. As well how my experience was. Well let me start with the health issues. Did you know that the children who attend this camp don't even have basic hygiene needs. They are homeless children living in tents and cars, in the bushes and along the beaches of Hawai'i. Did you know that these children weren't even able to brush their own teeth, or wash their own hair before this program showed them how to care for themselves.Well, Project Hawai'i Teen Mentoring Summer Camp allowed me the opportunity to help these children become healthy and learn basic hygiene skills. Every day we would show the children how to care for themselves, and help them learn the reason why they need to do so.The program was able to raise enough money with our help to even send them home with hygiene products they can use for months.While I was able to mentor the little children and help them grow, I too was able to learn more independence and learn that life isn't just about me. I had a bigger purpose in life....and that was these children.I am happy to share this experience. I hope that other teens are able to learn and grow and help others as well.I do recommend this program to be awarded for the the Healthy survey. This camp keeps the children healthy.Also, the camp offers very nutritious meals. We ate with the little children of course, but the food was soooo healthy. The children learned how to eat properly and not junk food. Every day was a new theme to learn to eat good foods. We had zoo day and we ate Bananas covered in peanut butter and rolled in cereal. Then at the ocean day, we went "fishing" we had celery fishing poles dipped in cream cheese and then fished for gold fish crackers. The children were so happy, but they were eating good food.If you have the opportunity to attend Project Hawai'i Summer camp, Do it!! It is the best time of your life just waiting to happen.
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	23221	1	/users/profile/24296	Sonia	Volunteer	4	12/02/2009	My experience with Christmas Wish Program was very rewarding. I am only giving 4 stars because I wasn't really sure what to expect and then I thought that there could of been more organization with the program overall.I was shocked to see how the children lived and what the difference we made in just a short time being with them.I was able to help with the delivery of the hygiene products that we purchased by the director. There was fundraiser in Oahu that I was a part of to collect supplies and money. At the fundraiser a few people came with small donations of products the agency asked for, and many people came with small monetary donations to help purchase items.The fundraiser fell short of its goal, but the director Magin didn't really seem to mind, she just purchased what was needed out of her own pocket expenses. I felt a bit confused because she didn't seem to care that it costs her hundreds of dollars to fill all the bags.The next day I went with her to hand out the bags and was amazed at that process. She just drove to the beaches and went up to every tent and asked if children lived there. She gave the bags to the families, talked with the children a bit and walked to the next tent. It was shocking that the children live in this environment and the items we brought were a huge impact on their daily lives. Anyhow, I never went back. Sometimes I feel sad for the children living like that, and then I also feel like it is too much to make a difference. Magin has a heart like no others and it is hard to match that. I just wish her well and hope for the best for her and the children she helps.

I want to thank those who helped me and my children. These people are amazing and really do what they say. It is hard to imagine anyone caring as much as they do about strangers. Not just us but all of us. She comes out and sees us and brings us food and helps our children. She never stops and is always looking for the new kids that move in here. She is even taking our children to summer camp for free. I know I cant afford to send my children to camp. I cant even afford to feed them all the time or even give them cloths. I am so greatful for those two who always come and check on us. She even baked us fresh cookies just because. I think she is my childrens gaurden angel. I want to thank both aunty and uncle for there help.
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	155246	1	/users/profile/24291	rockets	Volunteer	5	04/17/2013	Hello everyone...it is my pleasure to once again be able to give my review to allow this program to receive another award for their excellence in providing life changing service to homeless children in Hawai'i. As a volunteer, I know I made a huge impact in those lives I touched over the years. I felt very involved in the activities that were implemented and provided to the children.This program is a wonderful agency to be involved with, regardless how much time or money you have, you do make the difference working with this program.I am now on my way to college, and because of my participation in this program, I have all the recommendation letters, extra activity certificates and even more community service hours than needed. I know this program is really not designed to "help" teens with money, but they truly help everyone involved to make a difference with in their own lives. It is true, everyone involved make the difference and is truly blessed by their own actions.So, please consider them once again for a top rated charity. Keep up the good work!!
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	126246	1	/users/profile/24291	rockets	Volunteer	5	10/17/2012	As a volunteer I feel privileged to be able to make such a difference in the lives of the homeless children that receive services through Project Hawai'i, Inc. This organization truly makes a difference in the lives they touch from the clients to the volunteers. I have been volunteering since 2009 and have seen wonderful things happen for the keiki. Glad to be on such a hard working team of volunteers. 
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	99782	1	/users/profile/24291	rockets	Volunteer	5	10/26/2011	Aloha,I would like to say that this summer camp program provided me with a wonderful summer. I was able to mentor homeless children, teach them life skills and even how to read. It was a great experience. As a teen mentor I worked hands on with my camp buddies for 4 weeks. During this time I was able to experience the growth in their lives from educational awareness to general behavior growth.I earned 200 community service hours towards my own educational goals and helped homeless children spend their summer with excitement. 
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	89334	1	/users/profile/24291	rockets	Volunteer	5	06/01/2011	I had a wonderful, fantastic, incredible experience with Project Hawai'i Summer Camp as a teen mentor. Because of my experience I was able to earn extra credit in High School and use my volunteer hours and community service certificate to apply for the best schools. That is only the start of my benefit from this wonderful summer camp experience. My life as a teen mentor meant so much to the homeless children I worked with over the summer. We formed an ever lasting bond that helped me to grow as I helped them gain self esteem and life skills. Working for those less fortunate than others is a hard experience to get use to, but once you understand the impact on your own life and how you are changing others, it is the best feeling in the world. I am glad that I was asked once again to participate in this survey about my experience.I was able to learn so much about a new culture and life experience away from my own environment. I grew from this experience more than ever imaginable. My experiences included swimming with dolphins, learning hula, and other exciting Hawaiian traditions. I was blessed to have such a wonderful experience with a wonderful program.I say if you are a teen, like working with children, love to explore and travel....this is the best program around. If you like to help others and make a difference, then this is it!! Project Hawai'i is the best ever!!I was asked to write how "HEALTH" is incorporated in this camp for this survey.Well, helping to keep homeless children healthy is a major part of the program. Not only do the children get meals daily, they are nutritious and healthy for their growth. I saw the children "get fat" in front of my eyes from the nutritious meals they were served. I was amazed about how hungry these children really are. Even during the camp when they knew that food would be coming, they still over ate because of the fear of being hungry later. They were able to eat good food, lots of veggies and proteins wtihout the fats or fried foods. They also got milk and yogurt, fresh juice and natural foods. It was awesome.Also for the health factor....the children were given all their hygiene needs. They were taught how to brush their teeth proper, how to bathe and take care of themselves. When they left camp, the children went home with bags of hygienic products to help keep them clean and healthy for months to come. During camp a dentist came and showed the children how to brush proper. What foods to eat to keep their teeth healthy. This program is on it when it comes to health needs.
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	23217	1	/users/profile/24291	rockets	Volunteer	5	12/02/2009	My experience working with Christmas Wish Program, Inc has been amazing. The love that the volunteers share and have for the homeless children is amazing. I was able to work hands on with the children after working on fundraisers and projects designed to make their holidays brighter. My family was able to get involved and make a difference as well.I was able to see first hand how the children live in poverty and how this organization make a difference with the food and living needs they provide. It was shocking to see how the children actually live, but knowing that they will have a hot nutritious meal because of the efforts put out by Christmas Wish is truely a blessing.
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	153683	1	/users/profile/184706	Summer Camper	Client Served	5	04/09/2013	Aloha, I wanted to share my families story. Not just say thanks to all that was given to us, but how we got involved. One day a lady was searching for homeless children, and I am so glad she found us. I couldn't believe that our family was in her path. She told me that she is always led to those who need her, how strange that is.I was at first thinking she is just a crazy lady and would not actually come back. After all who tells anyone they are going to give your child everything they need for summer camp and take them for free. Just feeding my children is hard enough, and I can't do it over the summer with the food stamps we are give. So how is a lady going to do it? Then she did come back and took my children to camp. She gave them what they needed and took good care of them. I was amazed with all they learned, and what they did when I was at work. I am so greatful to have this program and these wonderful people. I hope she gets this award and gets to do summer camp again and again. I count on her for my children to have a great summer and to be able to eat and learn.
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	138631	1	/users/profile/184706	Summer Camper	Client Served	5	11/14/2012	HI CLIFF & MAGIN!! WE LOVE YOU!! Thanks so much for having us at summer camp. We love all the fun we get and going all over the island. Our family is really happy to be a part of this program. I want to say that without a camp like this my children would be stuck with nothing to do all summer long. I love my kids, but they need more than I can give them and this program did that. Feeding them is a great help. We don't have enough food stamps to last all month with 5 mouths to feed all summer. Our kids come home full and don't even need dinner sometimes. I can't thank you enough for all the support. I know my kids will go back to school happy and with all their stuff. This year was really important because we really needed those sleeping bags that you sent home with the kids. Thank you so much and keep up the good work. I hope that your programs never end.

I couldn't believe that you took your Easter Sunday to spend with us and all the other homeless keiki in Waianae. It always amazes me that you and your husband are so dedicated to our children and our health and happiness.You do make a difference and we all love you. I hope you are always able to be there for those families who need you. Mahalo nui loa!!

This organization has been there for us for the past years as we have struggled with being homeless, living in our car, and in a tent. Knowing that we can count on Magin and her team truly makes a difference and helps us to hold on. We all know we can count on her to bring us the supplies our keiki need in order to feel cared for. From Christmas gifts, to basic life needs, they are always there for us and many, many others like us. Thank you from the bottom of all our hearts. We love Project Hawai'i!!

By providing these hungry, poverty-stricken kids with Summer Camp, Back-to-School, Community Outreach & Support, and annual Thanksgiving & Christmas programs, they give these precious keiki the greatest gift of all which is HOPE for a better future.

Project Hawai'i, Inc.	138811		/users/profile/184892	spiritofaloha	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/14/2012	Project Hawaii is a selfless organization that takes caring to a whole new level. Having worked with homeless people in Canada I understand the enormity of the task. To be able to take that same level of dedication and empathy to the keiki is honorable. We, as caring people, should never have let this type of poverty exist, but since it does, we need organizations like Project Hawaii to right the wrongs. Thank you Project Hawaii for all your work and inspiration!
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	138632		/users/profile/184708	Magin	Board Member	5	11/14/2012	Aloha Everyone! Thanks for making our organization so great! Without all our support from our dedicated volunteers we would not be able to provide such great opportunities for our keiki to gain the self-esteem and life skills they need to succeed! Without our donors, well, we'd not be here at all. Your support is life changing for these precious children. Since we rely solely on public donations, your support is THE Difference we need to succeed. Thanks  to all for helping us to once again be nominated for another award! Our keiki are the winners with all of YOU supporting them. As the director of Project Hawai'i, Inc., I want to wish all of you and your families a wonderful holiday season. Thank you for keeping us in your hearts and minds through these hectic times. As you all know the keiki rely on US, and we rely on YOU. Mahalo Nui Loa with Aloha from Cliff and Magin!! xoxo
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	138629		/users/profile/184701	ProjectHawaiiVolunteer	Volunteer	5	11/14/2012	Aloha Cliff & Magin. It is great to be able to write this review for the agency and both of you. Your dedication is truly one of a kind. I enjoy volunteering at the events and helping where I can. Seeing the smiles on the faces of these children is a reward all in itself. I am happy to be part of such a wonderful agency. I invite anyone to see for themselves the difference this program provides for their clients. Going far beyond any expectations is to say the least. After volunteering for events and setting up parties one will really get the feeling of what hard work is. Why on earth anyone would do this over and over again being under supported both financially and volunteer wise...it is beyond me. But I know you two have the dedication and determination to continue your efforts. These children are blessed by having you both in their lives. I respect the work you put in to every event you have, and the efforts you put out to get the community support. I only wish the best for you both and this wonderful program.

From summer camps to Christmas to celebrating holidays and beyond they are always there. The amount of hours Magin and Cliff put in is absolutely incredible.

Project Hawai'i, Inc.	136040		/users/profile/181941	Thankful Hearts	Client Served	5	11/08/2012	I am a mother of 7 homeless children who live in a tent and a car because we always have to move it is hard to stay in one place. Can't seem to find the words that it takes to say how hard it is to live like this with children. I have a lot of troubles and really don't know what I would do without the support Magin and Cliff bring to my family. They never fail us, not even judging us for the way we have to live. Keeping my kids happy is not always easy but they always seem to put a smile on their faces and in their hearts. We have been with this program for years. I know with out this program, my family would really miss out on basic life needs and opportunities. My children got to go to camp, go to the parties and Magin always answers my call of need. I call her for all kinds of stuff and she does the best she can to get me what we need. I want to thank them for being here for us and all the others.  I read what others say, and it is true!! This program is life saving. These two people care so much and don't give up. I am one who really knows because we get the stuff they bring. We get the presents, the food, and all the program offers. They are really unique people and do care for everyone who comes to them. I am so happy to know that I have a safety net for all our needs. Someday my life will change, but I know that my children have better hope then me to make good choices and change their future. Thank you Magin, we all LOVE YOU!! You to Uncle

Their continuing help and support for our children deserves the highest honor possible. They have help so many many children never being discouraged always looking ahead as to ways to help these precious keikis.
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	23377	4	/users/profile/24462	Frances	Donor	5	12/04/2009	On a recent visit to Hawaii I ran accross Magin and her group outside of a store selling candy to make money to help feed the children in Hawaii. I knew of the Christmas Wish Program and have received literature for years, but to actually witness the dedication to what their mission is was inspiring. Magin's hard work and dedication is unbeleivable. The countless children she has fed and sheltered is truly a miracle in the works. We must continue to support such an important and necessary program.
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	134915		/users/profile/180781	GC808	Donor	5	11/07/2012	Awesome program for the keiki of Hawaii.  Magin and Cliff do an amazing job at making these homeless kids feel loved!
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	134634		/users/profile/180494	jennyhqnguyen	Volunteer	5	11/07/2012	I feel as though this organization is always aiming to help these kids in any way shape or form. They always try many methods in order to gain the most valuable resources and necessity for their kids. I hope that this organization can prosper and continue to grow. 
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	134386		/users/profile/180218	Trudy F.	Volunteer	5	11/06/2012	Magin, the founder of Project Hawaii, is one of the most giving, selfless people I have ever met.  I have volunteered for 5 or 6 years now during the Christmas season to help the kids have the kind of Xmas all kids deserve.  I have helped at the Xmas party for most of those years and if you could see the smiles on the faces of those precious children you would know how much good this organization does.  
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	134011		/users/profile/179777	Jalene B.	Donor	5	11/06/2012	I have found their work to be grassroots and hands-on. I volunteered at an event years ago and since then have on occassion donated to this worthy cause. I trust my money is put to good use in Megin's hands as she is extremely passionate about her work.
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	134010		/users/profile/179776	tabraham08	General Member of the Public	5	11/06/2012	I honestly have not hear of this charity but their heart to help homeless children is so warm and caring. This dedication to the public is so warm and generous because it demonstrates the love for one another. It also demonstrates the need to add value to one another by helping the youth because they are our future and helping them is important. I admire this charity for its honesty and value it adds to community by doing a way to end homelessness and help Hawaii's children because they are our future. I'm thankful for everything you do and keep up the excellent work and soon no children in Hawaii will go hungry.
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	132967		/users/profile/178657	TM51	Volunteer	5	11/03/2012	As a long time volunteer, it always amazes me the number of programs that offered from Project Hawai'i. When a need arises, Magin finds a way to "add" that program to her already over packed schedule. Of course calling on all the volunteers to see who and what is available. I just want to say that this program should not only be nominated for the BEST CHARITY of 2012, but DESERVES to win!! Going  over and beyond to assure that no child is left behind of their needs to succeed.
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	127500		/users/profile/172560	MuchMahalos	Client Served	5	10/21/2012	I am a mother of 5 that was helped by this program. I am so grateful for all the have done for my children. Without this program I would not have been able to provide for my children. Basic needs are out of reach when you are homeless living in a car. I do have a job and I do the best I can, but it is hard just to get basic stuff for my kids. When they need new shoes, or even school supplies, it can take way more than I make in a whole month at my job. I do get food stamps, but not having a place to store food properly, we tend to waste money on premade foods and buy from grocery stores that are over priced. So it is difficult to have enough to last all month. It is wonderful to know that my kids will be feed, and cared for. It amazes me that this lady continues to come and seek us out no matter where we have to move from parking lot to parking lot all over the place. I will say without Magin, my children would not have such a happy life and would go without many basic things. Mahalo Nui Loa to all those who help and support her. You support us and others like us in the end.
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	126793		/users/profile/171806	CIAs	Board Member	5	10/18/2012	Aloha, As a board member of Project Hawai'i, Inc., I am proud to nominate and write my review for this outstanding opportunity. I have been on the board for 2 years, and volunteer for several years before. I would say that this program is truly unique. With all the changes over the years, this program is still able to provide wonderful services to the children and offer great volunteer opportunities for the community to be involved. Furthermore, I will say that during the hard financial times, this program doesn't take from the children's programs. We just try harder, and try to find new sponsors to get the funds we need. I would invite anyone to take a look at this program and get involved where you can. The public truly makes the difference in the lives of the homeless children through Project Hawai'i, Inc.
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	126790		/users/profile/24379	Nanilani	Volunteer	5	10/18/2012	HI, I was one of the teen mentors that worked with the homeless children during the summer camp. I was really excited to be able to visit Hawaii and earn community service hours over my summer. Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine the difference I would be making in the lives of the homeless children. This program allows the children to gain so much from self-esteem to life skills in such a short time. The people who run the program are so kind and caring. You can tell they devote their lives to the programs success. Being run 100% by volunteers truly makes this a very unique program. I am glad to be a part of it.
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	23311	4	/users/profile/24379	Nanilani	Client Served	5	12/03/2009	I was invited to tell my story about how Christmas Wish Program helped our family. I am so glad to have been choosen to share my families story with the people who want to help Magin make this even better for others. Magin found us living in a tent. At first I was scared she might be with CPS or someone to take my children. She just brought boxes of food, dropped them at my tent and then left. She did this every weekend until we finally talked with her. She was always happy to come and help us, give us blankets and stuff we really needed. Then I started going to the hot meals and clothing giveaways that she hosted every month. I met other parents who were going through the same like us, and I even met people who are still my friends today.My life is much better now, I am in college and work part time. My three children are so happy and now have a place to live. When we moved into our section 8 county housing apartment, Magin gave us a couch, beds and kitchen stuff. She even helped with bath towels and stuff. Without Christmas Wish Program our family would still be homeless still. We would not have the self esteem or even the knowledge we have today. I am happy to share our story and love we have for Christmas Wish Program and all the volunteers who make a difference.
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	126789		/users/profile/171802	Sightseer	General Member of the Public	5	10/18/2012	I am really impressed with this organization.  When I first saw the woman in charge of the program in a neighborhood park setting up to conduct their monthly give away, I couldn't believe the passion and care she had for the children and their parents. She was so excited to welcome them, and they all seemed to really love her. I was then able to witness another encounter when she had them on a field trip for their summer camp. She had taken the entire summer camp to a live theater presentation. These young children were so well behaved and full of excitement. They all lined up, hands in front and quiet. I have never seen anything like it. I approached Magin and told her what an amazing job she was doing. She told me that wants the children to learn social skills to be prepared for the real world, and wanted to introduce them to something outside their regular daily routine. I truly enjoy seeing Project Hawai'i in action in our town year after year. I have contributed somewhat, but don't really have the means to be a regular donor. Keep up the good work!!
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	126266		/users/profile/32980	ms-nosey	Volunteer	5	10/17/2012	As a teen mentor at the summer camp, I can say that this program rocks. It is an awesome experience and I wouldn't have missed it for the world. I love my camp buddies and know that I helped to change their lives. Don't miss out on Project Hawai'i Summer Camp!! My mom said that I needed to do more community service to build my resume for college. I choose to visit Hawai'i and have a blast, little did I know my life would be changed forever. My friends said I was crazy, after all what is a teen boy going to do with all those children? I said, surf, hike, who knows, who cares, I will be in Hawai'i. Well, life is full of surprises and not only did I get the hours I needed, but I had a once in a lifetime experience thanks to my homeless camp buddies!!
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	89337		/users/profile/32980	ms-nosey	Volunteer	5	06/01/2011	Well I wasn't expecting this. I had a wonderful experience with Project Hawai'i Summer camp and didn't know that every year we would have to do a survey to tell our story. I had to think about all the fun I had all over again. This survey is about healthy living. How the camp helps the children live healthy.As a teen mentor I was able to help them with basic daily care of their hygiene. I taught them skills that I guess they don't have because they are homeless? I was able to help them learn to wash their hands before eating, and brush their teeth after. I was able to help them understand that it is important to take care of their bodies inside and out.We played lots of sports that keep them fit, and taught them to exercise every day. I was able to help teach them lots of outdoor games and sports. Over all my experience was great. I feel that the opportunity I was given by this program was great and wonderful.The children were hard work but worth every minute. I loved my camp buddies and my experience. Thank you for the opportunity and the lessons I learned.
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	32193	10	/users/profile/32980	ms-nosey	General Member of the Public	5	03/01/2010	My experience is some what different from what one might think. I wasn't a volunteer or a donor, or even a client. I was actually just someone who was interested in what was going on in a local park. One afternoon while walking through the park downtown, I saw a woman setting up a make shift service area and putting out tables with clothing, toys, books, all kinds of things. I asked if it was yard sale or something? She replied no, I just come down on Sundays and give away stuff and feed the homeless children. I was surprised about the calm in her voice and the excitement she felt to be there.I asked if she needed help, she just said if I wanted to help fold the outfits together. I kind of just wanted to know what was going on. I didn't know there were homeless children, and couldn't imagine how truck loads of items were going to be given away. Time passed, and I saw the park fill up with hungry, dirty children. Some had no shoes, or even shirts. They just kept coming over and getting food, taking clothing, and books. It was amazing. These children went home with arms full of stuff, and their bellies full. About one hour went by, and everything was gone, the families started leaving, and this wonderful lady (still smiling) started packing up the remaining items and tables. She seemed very content and happy. I was talking with her about why she did this, how she knew to do this. She just replied "Its my Kuleana. (In Hawaiian that means responsibility). She stated she was born to do this and wouldn't know what else to do with her life. I was amazed., and wanted to share my experience. This program is incredible and to think it is run by one lady with a huge heart.
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	126264		/users/profile/171317	Mahalo	Donor	5	10/17/2012	I am a first time donor to this organization. One thing I really like is that it is run 100% by volunteers and that allows the donation to directly benefit the children's needs. I was able to see my donation hard, I mean hard at work over the summer. Although I got plenty of advertisement in return for my donation, that was not the main reason for my donation. I was able to attend a day at camp and watch the children in action, wearing the camp shirts that carried my name was also exciting. These children are very fortunate to have such a dedicated person as Magin to provide such a wonderful experience for them. I know without my donation, this would not all be possible. I am proud to be a donor and know my donation does make the difference in their precious lives.
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	89152		/users/profile/101063	Frances	Volunteer	5	05/24/2011	Here in beautiful Hawaii  it is difficult to believe that 1/3 of the homeless are children under the age of 10 and of these 1/3 are under the age of 5. CHRISTMAS WISH PROGRAM helps these precious children with food, clothing, school supplies and many other necessary items. I am proud to be a part of this truly remarkable organization.

Project Hawai'i, Inc.	28949	13	/users/profile/29991	kylia	Volunteer	5	02/18/2010	I just finished helping this organization complete their Healthy Hearts Campaign for homeless children. It was amazing to see the director deal with all the obstacles that occur while just trying to make a difference in the community. Not only do volunteers not show up for their assigned shifts, they actually have the nerve to grumble about the conditions, or lack of support, etc. It is amazing that Magin can keep it together so well. She worked for a month to put together a collection drive to get new shoes for the homeless children and provide funds for the summer camps athletic program. During the 3 hour shift she was harassed by the public about "who are you?, or the homeless need to get jobs" all kinds of junk like that. All along she just continues to conduct her drive and hopes to get enough shoes to make a difference. One school group did a drive at their school, and there was another teen group helping with the collection, holding signs, etc. But not half the people showed up, and we were behind on donations. It was hard as a volunteer to see all this happening when the whole point is just to help homeless children.I was amazed that at the end of the 3 hour shift she thanked everyone and said we all did a great job. I know in her heart she felt bad for the homeless children, as she was about 50 pair of shoes short. I asked what happened next.Her response was pretty amazing. She stated she would never allow a child to be left out and would just purchase all the missing shoes. She said that these fundraisers are to allow people the opportunity to make a good decision and to help out. She continued to say that she never expects much, and is just grateful for whatever comes. She understands that not everyone can keep their commitments or give a donation.I just want to say Thank you Magin, and keep up the good work. I know the children do care about the difference you make, and that someday it won't be so hard to get this community involved with such great efforts.
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	24946	13	/users/profile/25935	Jill	Volunteer	5	12/23/2009	I've worked with Magin and the Christmas Wish Program this past summer for the Keiki School Supply Drive and collected toys this Christmas for the local homeless children on the island.  I love that this organization is so committed to making a difference in our community and has cut through so much red tape to give to those who need it most.  I would work with this organization any time and feel blessed to have found them.
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	24168	12	/users/profile/25273	Star	Professional with expertise in this field	5	12/16/2009	I've been aware of Magin Patrick and the Christmas Wish Program from when she first came to our island and started caring for the homeless people of our island.  From the first time we  met to discuss collaborating on some Domestic Harmony events for her families we had common ground and were/are committed to addressing the very real issues of domestic violence in homeless families by teaching them about Domestic Harmony.To that end, Magin and I have consulted and participated in events together, including a t shirt contest, and fund raiser. In  addition, she held the first Domestic Harmony event on O'ahu on behalf of the Domestic Harmony Awareness Initiative, where she read Mayor Hannemann's proclamation to her families on 11 11 07, while they  were enjoying the food she secured for them. Magin's organization has a number of volunteers, she has secured good press all along, she has made a huge impact on numbers of people here and on O'ahu through her steadfast commitment to her families and this work.   It is amazing year after year to see the programs she comes up with and then the effort she extends to see that those children have a Halloween party or a Christmas party and school supplies. More help and supplies, and materials which could be secured with more funds would only serve to help her provide even better services.  What she does matters. She's an Ace of Hearts.
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	23946	12	/users/profile/25082	steiconi	Volunteer	5	12/14/2009	I sew enjoy volunteering with the Christmas Wish Program!  Magin recognizes what I love to do, and gives me great projects that are fun and help the project.  I've made a Santa costume, elf clothes, and this year added a collection of Santa bags to transport gifts to the homeless kids.  It's great to feel good about helping others!
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	23913	11	/users/profile/25045	fevelyn	Volunteer	5	12/13/2009	Collecting money from cars passing by at kapolei was an awesome experience for me. I have never done it before, and i was kind of nervous at first because it was my first time volunteering for homeless kids. And the other thing was that I have not tried walking around the street wearing a huge sign before. After a while though, I felt more comfortable. Even though it kinda drizzled, and there were only a few of us, it was really a great experience, we collected a lot of money and it just feels so great when you know that you have done something to help kids or people who are less fortunate. I hope that we could help more homeless kids and anyone who can't afford things that most of us could. Imagine how many people we could help if we continue to do this.
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	23906	13	/users/profile/25041	Vicki	Volunteer	5	12/13/2009	For years now, it's been my pleasure to be able to work with those at Christmas Wish program in Hilo, Hawaii. This group is one of the most devoted and dedicated to reaching out to our homeless community, especially the children, that I have ever seen. Magin Patrick, our leader, is such a wonderful giving person, she is an angel! Without her, and this program, so many unfortunate people on this island would never have this opportunity to celebrate the holidays. The joy and laughter that is seen and heard from the families is astounding. PURE JOY!! I have learned when you reach out to the less fortunate, it is an undescrible feeling, like nothing else. We should all be so lucky to be a part of this movement and do whatever we can to keep it progressing. We ARE making a difference!!!!
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	23873	12	/users/profile/25010	Jennifer	Volunteer	5	12/12/2009	I have worked with the Christmas Wish Program by helping to collect donations for much-needed items for our island's children.  The Christmas Wish Program organizers are extremely dedicated and some of the most generous people I have ever met.  Their efforts are much appreciated by those they assist.  I truly commend them for the work that they do.
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	23871	11	/users/profile/25009	rodwatai	Volunteer	4	12/12/2009	This is my first year being involved with the Christmas Wish Program. My experience so far has been one of awe.  The time and effort that is put into organizing the events and activities that go towards helping families who are less fortunate is awesome and well thought out.  I highly commend this program for the effort and devotion to the keiki's and families it helps and I plan to continue my support of this program.
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	23860	6	/users/profile/24998	Melinda	Donor	4	12/12/2009	As the commercial property manager for the Hilo Shopping Center, I have worked with Magin Patrick and the Christmas Wish program many times to promote their Easter and Christmas events in the Shopping Center.  The organization has a tremendous amount of energy, commitment and integrity.  This is demonstrated by their constant marketing and manning of booths, "giving trees" and more to attract the public and educate them concerning the homeless children and others that they suport.  Every effort on the part of the public is rewarded with a handmade thank you note from the children that Christmas Wish supports; no small task and a lovely touch.  I commend this program for their year 'round and round the clock devotion to the families and especially the children that it supports.
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	23858	3	/users/profile/24995	PLHI	Volunteer	4	12/12/2009	Project Linus, Hilo chapter, found the Christmas Wish program to be a great recipient for the handmade blankets donated by Big Island blanketeers.  We gave them about 50 blankets for use by their summer camp kids, and Ms. Patrick was great about showing us how the blankets were used and appreciated.  Chrismas Wish really helped Project Linus meet our goal of providing "security through blankets" to a target group that really needed and appreciated them.  We will be donating blankets to Christmas Wish again in the future.
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	23852	4	/users/profile/24990	mycurls	Donor	5	12/11/2009	Redeeming Light International, Inc. has been a supporter of Christmas Wish Program for many years.  They provide a service, an invaluable service, to our island's homeless children and their families.  They have been able to bridge the economic and cultural differences that tend to separate us.  And can they ever stretch a dollar!  With more donations they could do so much more.  It isn't just for Christmas.  The reading classes for example are trying to provide a way out for the next generation.
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	23851	4	/users/profile/24988	bensempress	Volunteer	5	12/11/2009	This program is one of the best, I'm very grateful that it's in existance and I have every intention of helping in their efforts. A Huge thumbs up for all they do!
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	23638	4	/users/profile/24759	Dillan	Volunteer	5	12/10/2009	Ive been a volunteer for since the year 2000 now and every holiday we set up something for the homless kids. they provide gifts for christmas, egg hunts for easter, halloween competitions and costumes and set up other treats for the kids through out the holidays. As a volunteer Ive helped them serve food as well as set up and stick around for the closing of the programs.
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	23527	4	/users/profile/24637	YoYo	Volunteer	5	12/08/2009	My experience doesn't seem much different from others who wrote review, but I know that without the help Magin provides hundreds of children would go without basic needs like clothing, food, shelter, hygiene products. One step further, she doesn't just give them a hand out, but makes them feel loved and cared for. First hand I have helped make a difference by volunteering at activities provided throughout the year. One thing I am noticed about her events that I think really make a difference. At the parties children are able to play games that are made to "win". This helps build self-esteem and allows the children to take items they need with them. She does give fun stuff, but most everything given is useful and very much needed. For example, some prizes include shampoo, toothbrushes, soap bars, or healthy snacks. This is a very vital step to teaching children about their own personal care.My experience as a volunteer has been wonderful, and as a donor I know that my money goes directly to services and seems to stretch more than I imagined.
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	23466	4	/users/profile/24566	alohajune	Volunteer	5	12/06/2009	I have not had a great deal of personal interaction with Christmas Wish yet, but will soon be more involved. There are so many needy families in this area - some living in tents.  I know that this organization reaches out to families in dire circumstances.  I have met Magin only once when I delivered some backpacks and bags of food, but I did see her then in action with the kids during a summer camp and she is awesome - full of enthusiasm and positive spirit.  Magin is very busy, but she and I have traded numerous emails regarding some of her needs.  The Hilo Woman's Club sponsors the We Care Teddy Bear Club and this year has dedicated one of our projects to supply almost 200 stuffed animals for the Christmas Wish Christmas party. I plan to assist at the party and hopefully find more ways in which the HWC and I, personally, can help this wonderful organization. Groups like this can make such a difference in lives.
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	23462	4	/users/profile/24561	Shana	Client Served	5	12/06/2009	Aloha, our family (from our hearts) appeciate all the great help that the Christmas wish program has done for our family when my husband and I could not. We have been getting help from the christmas wish program for the pass 2 yrs. Our children loved the Halloween party, oh they had so much fun making costums and the healthy stuff they gave not candy. We also got help for Christmas that help alot. If they couldn't help then we would not have had any presents. We are a family of 6. My husband has been disabled for 13 yrs. and our 4 yr. old was diagnosed with (ALL) T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Luekemia on July 4,2009. This was a really devestating to our family. Staying home to care for my family is my highest priority. We are not homeless but we are low income. I don't know what we would do if their was no Christmas Wish program! Everyone we talked to at the program has been very nice and help full, some of they have been were we are today. Thank You so much from our hearts! ALOHA and Happy Holiday's to all espically those that help familys in need! Bless your hearts and souls.
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	23446	4	/users/profile/24539	Sylvia	Donor	5	12/06/2009	This wonderful program helps the most needy among us and I wish I could do more to support the homeless children it serves. My first experience was volunteering to help with the annual Christmas party, and I was so impressed with the uplifting event and simple joy of the children that I have sent a few bucks in continued support almost every month. I also donated some craft actvities to the summer camp program, and will continue to help this worthwhile organization whenever I can. Mother Theresa said that if you can't feed a hundred, feed one. This program feeds a hundred hungry children at least one good meal a year, and fills their little hearts with hope and true spirit of Christmas.
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	23428	4	/users/profile/24519	Kalapana	Volunteer	5	12/05/2009	My experience was wonderful. Amazing and crazy all at the same time. I was one of the volunteers who helped the first year of summer camp. Little did I know that Magin doesn't really live in the same reality the rest of us do. She doesn't understand the word can't or too hard. She only sees the goals she sets and the dreams that come to her. With that said, Magin we all love you, but you are really hard to keep up with.I was asked to share a story about my experience with your organization. I would like to share the bus ride on the way to camp. Yes out of a 6 week summer camp experience, the first day of bus stops was more than an eye opener.I got on the bus with Magin to pick up the children. Stop after stop across half the island was just the beginning of what I saw.Magin got off the bus at each stop and made sure all the children that were scheduled to be there were there. She walked them to their seats and gave them there snacks. Off to the next stop with a smile on her face. Well that is what I observed about her, but as a volunteer I saw a different aspect to the first day of summer camp. I noticed at each stop the children would get on the bus unprepared for this sleepover camp. I watched the children jump on the bus without extra clothing, no sleeping bags, and some without shoes. One stop was just amazing. Two little boys got on the bus, Magin asked, "Who are you"? The cousin stated said they could go to camp because their mom couldn't take care of them anyway for the summer. They boys didn't say a word. Magin got off the bus talked to the aunt and off we went with these two boys.The boys still not saying a word sat there, no shoes, not even shirts on their backs. They eat their snack and then spoke to each other in German. Yes, they never spoke English, and were here on a bus to camp with nothing. Magin didn't seemed phased, just smiled and talked with all the children about the fun they were going to have at camp.Finally after two hours we arrive at camp. Magin lined up all the children and took their names and clothing and shoe sizes. Then walked them up to the sleeping areas and told the children to choose their sleeping bags and pillows. Took them to the bathrooms told them to get their towels and personal hygeine boxes.Off she went, a few hours later she was back with outfits and shoes for all the children. Okay, I thought, this is crazy!!! CRAZY.As if that wasn't enough to send my head spinning, on Friday when the children went home for the weekend, Magin filled their arms with extra and left over food items. Amazing, this is only the first week, and she has done more for these children than any one can imagine. Monday morning once again we get on the bus, yet the children don't have their clothes, shoes, nothing....what is going on I thought to myself.Magin goes off to the store again, brought back all the supplies the keiki were missing like nothing at all. I asked her what was she thinking? She told me she never expected that, but obviously the children needed this. She asked some of the children what they did with the stuff she bought. They had different responses, such as: my sister needed my shoes, or I lost my toothbrush, or I don't know it was in my tent when I was there....stuff like that. So, she just smiled and gave them a hug and their new stuff.This is the most amazing thing I have ever witnessed. So, Magin keep up your good work, and never loose your heart. Without you, there is no Christmas Wish, and without you they have no hope.
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	23425	4	/users/profile/24517	Ito	Volunteer	5	12/05/2009	I have been a long time supporter of Christmas Wish Program. I have both donated and volunteers for this amazing organization. Who would think that one person would have the time and heart it takes to change the world for hundreds and hundreds of homeless children. This lady dedicates her life and soul to the program and really runs it on her own. She involves volunteers for the "fun stuff" and makes sure we are all taken care of in that as well. She has everything ready for the children and the party or event, and we just come to lend a hand to make sure everything runs smooth.I have been involved in several organizations, and never seen anything like this one. Not just the dedication and care she has for the program, but the fact she works with such low donation amounts and still does more than anyone would ever believe unless you were there to experience it yourself.I gave a donation first just to fill a stocking. This $15. donation, I figured the children would get about half the value since most nonprofits use donations for overhead and other needs. But, instead the keiki get MORE than the donation value I gave. I helped Magin that year fill 350 stockings and they were more than one could ever imagine.So, from that day forward I have always made a faithful donation for Easter, Christmas and Back to School. I wish I had more to give, it would all go to Christmas Wish Program. Keep up the good works!!
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	23421	1	/users/profile/24514	Nainoa1	Volunteer	5	12/05/2009	I really enjoyed volunteering for the My Xmas Wish Program last year.  I plan to assist some more this year.  This is a great organization that makes a huge difference in the lives of the homeless keiki and their families throughout the year and especially during the holidays.

Project Hawai'i, Inc.	23381	5	/users/profile/24467	Family in Need	Client Served	5	12/04/2009	One day an elf came to our tent and asked if we had children because Santa was looking for the children on the beaches. I couldn't believe my eyes, on Christmas Eve a real life elf comes to our family with gifts. No questions, or judgement, just gifts from Santa. I don't know who doesn't believe in Santa, we never did. But now we believe. Without Christmas Wish Program our children would have had another empty Christmas, no food, no gifts, nothing. But now we have everything we could ever hope for. Thanks to that little elf who just smiles and thanks us for being there to provide for. Funny, but she thanked us.
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	23380	4	/users/profile/24466	lamcryst	Volunteer	5	12/04/2009	Magin is awesome! She does this service from the goodness of her heart.  It is refreshing to meet someone with such a kind heart, who truly cares without benefitting themselves these days.  Thank you to people like her who help others in need.  It takes a lot of planning and time to do all the projects she runs.  AND she does it with a smile! She even provided the volunteers with snacks and drinks to show her appreciation for helping her HELP others! Amazing one-woman army!
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	23379	1	/users/profile/24464	IslandChildren	Client Served	5	12/04/2009	I am so glad to be part of this survey. I too have been helped by Magin and her volunteers for many years while our family was homeless. Without this organization we would not have healthy meals, or clothing, or even basic needs. Magin always would deliver to us no matter where we were. Sometimes we would have to move from beach park or to a parking lot. She never cared about how far to meet us, just to bring us food when we need, or to make sure we were okay and coming to the next event. She even gave us gas money so our children could attend the party in Hilo for the holidays. Without Christmas Wish Program our children would never experience fun at holidays, or an egg hunt, have photos with Santa, nothing like that. It is hard being a single mom, and even harder living in a van with 5 children.I am happy to be included in this survey. I hope that who ever reads this understands the importance of this program, and helps to support it, or whatever the contest is for, she deserves the prize. She would give us or other families any funds raised, but should be honored with any award.She is our angel sent to care for the homeless children of the islands. We can't live without her.
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	23375	1	/users/profile/24460	myeong	Former Volunteer	5	12/04/2009	I sent my two teenage daughters to volunteer under the supervision of Magan Patrick in Summer 2009. I was extremely pleased with the works they have experienced through the volunteer program. They were well protected and learned many life experience, and good values working with homeless children. The program also helped my older daughter Amanda to establish her career goal. For a while she wanted to be a doctor but was not sure what kind of doctor until after she finished this program. Now her heart is set to become a pediatrician so that she can help under previliged children. As a parent this is priceless.
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	23373	1	/users/profile/24458	makaiwa	Volunteer	5	12/04/2009	Aloha my name is Makaiwa Tong, and I am currently a junior at Kamehameha schools Hawaii Campus.  I lead several homeroom classes to participate in the Operation Christmas Child Project as part of our service learning.  It was most definitely a good experience not only for me, but for my fellow classmates.  This project was a good way for some of them to understand that there are others who are less fortunate than them, and that although these kids we are reaching out to live thousands of miles away, they are still our brothers and sisters.  And we were able to share our aloha spirit to them in a simple shoebox one child at a time.  I will definitely participate in this project again next year, because I knowing that I can make a difference in the life of a child brings me great joy.
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	23371	1	/users/profile/24452	Chential	Client Served	5	12/04/2009	I am a client who was and will be again this year helped by the Christmas Wish Program.  I have a fairly large family and it is quite hard in these economic hard times to provide for the during the holidays.  Magin Patrick by far has to be one of Gods angels here with us on earth.  She has helped so many families.  My family has had the opportunity to take part in many of Magin's yearly events such as her Halloween event that my kids just love.  They get to create their own costumes and just have fun and not worry about mom and dad not having money to buy them costumes.  They have more fun and take pride in their costumes they create.  The Christmas party that Magin holds every year for the kids is just beautiful.  The kids do arts and crafts, play games, eat dinner, take pictures with santa, and even get a present.  My youngest child always asks me, after the Halloween event, "mom when are we going to have the Christmas party?"  If it weren't for Magin Patrick and the Christmas Wish Program there are alot of families out there that would have nothing for the holidays which is the most stressful time of year for parents.  Thank you Magin for all that you have done for my family.Much Love....Chential S.

Magin worked very hard, veeerry hard, it is a blessing having someone like her that cares about people in your community.  I look forward to working with Magin in the future, and invite others to participate in the program; it's really a good program!
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	23226	1	/users/profile/24301	Kevin	Volunteer	5	12/02/2009	My story. I volunteered a few times for this organization. Not always fun and laughs, a lot of hard work, but all worth it in the end. The smiles on the faces of the homeless children are all worth the work in the end.My experience changed my life more than the children I helped. My heart is full of love for them, and I know that what I do makes a difference.I also donate during the holidays. It is fun to purchase a toy and sponsor a child. I also help at the summer camp with funds so they can provide educational programs during the camp.It is amazing how the summer camp runs completely on donations and volunteers.My experience is more than ever imaginable.I can only say that the smiles keep you coming back.
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	23225	1	/users/profile/24300	Kali Ohana	Client Served	5	12/02/2009	Aloha Magin, This is Kalilani. I am one of your families and want to say thank you. I hope you get everything you need to help even more families. I am happy to right a review. Without your agency, our family would not have had basic life supplies, or even holidays. My children never even believed in Santa until they met you. I am glad you are here to help all the families you do. You make our children happy and feel cared for. Even if you weren't able to help us as much as you do, we would still all love you. Christmas Wish Program has given our family food, clothing, shampoos and stuff. We also got household items and bedding. Our children were able to attend the Christmas party, and Easter. Christmas Wish gave us all our school supplies. I am greatful for everything we have gotten from Magin and her volunteers.
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	23224	1	/users/profile/24299	Barb	Former Volunteer	4	12/02/2009	My experience with Christmas Wish Program was wonderful. Having to drive 3 hours to attend the back to school graduation party was more than worth it. I only wish I could have been more helpful.I was able to help the children choose their back to school outfits and shoes. The program was overwhelming with all the responsiblity and opportunities that are given to the children.We were able to give over 100 children new backpacks filled with supplies, new outfits and shoes. Plus they were served a hot lunch and given a big bag of snacks for school time, and hygiene boxes. The event was more than I could ever imagine.There were 5 stations that the children had to go to in order to pick up all their supplies. Not enough volunteers to help, so the process took a long time. It was kind of frustrating, but at the same time I knew it had to be done.I wish that more people would be more informed and open to helping this program.
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	23223	1	/users/profile/24298	Martha cares	Donor	5	12/02/2009	As a longtime donor I am honored to be part of this review panel. I hope that this helps Christmas Wish Program receive all the awards it deserves for the services provided by the volunteers.One day as I was standing in line at the bank I overheard this little elf talking about going to the beaches to hand out personal hygiene products and lunch to the homeless children.I asked the woman when she was going, and how I could help. She informed me that there was  a fundraiser that day, and I could be a part of that, and the following day she was delivering to the beaches.I just wanted to make a donation and see where my money was going. I wasn't one to volunteer as I am busy and don't have time to invest in that. However, she wouldn't let me just go with her. She stated that she is very picky about who she introduces to the children for their own safety and protection. At first I didn't  understand was put off. But I then said, what if I go with you to do the shopping and help pay for some of the items.She agreed. I was kind of suspicious and wanted to see what it was about. I had never heard of anyone not wanting to just let people come to help.That afternoon after the fundraiser she took me shopping, told me to grab a cart and she did the same. About two and half hours later we were done filling the carts. She had spent over $1,500.00 on supplies, I was shocked. We spent about 6 hours wrapping all the items and filling stockings in a small hotel room. Well we had to use the hallways too, but it was amazing that this little elf was so dedicated.The next morning we headed out to the beaches, and one tent at a time she handed out the stockings to the families. Signing them up for the holiday delieveries and taking children's names and ages for Santa.Although I didn't go any further than that one time volunteer experience, I do donate on an annual basis. It makes me feel good knowing that my donations goes directly to the children's needs, and not someone's paycheck.It makes me feel that I can make a difference with my donation and the children won't go to bed hungry, or without supplies they need to be a bit more comfortable in their poverty stricken environment.I give every year, and encourage others to do the same.Thank you for inviting me to be part of this survey.

I know this is suppose to be about Christmas Wish Program, but you are that. Without you, there is no program. So, I want to thank you for all you have done for my family. I was homeless and hopeless for 2 years before I found your agency. Now I am on my feet living in an apartment and going to school. My children are doing well and we would not have been able to do any of this without you. I am going to be successful in taking care of my children and know that you are a big part of our lives.Here is  my story. I was 20 years old and alone with 2 girls living in a tent. When you found us, we were not sure what to think, but you kept coming back to us with food and clothes, blankets and stuff for the children. After I learned to trust you, our lives really changed. Without the support you gave and the love you shared with my children we would not be here today living in this new apartment of ours. Magin was even good enough to give us furnature for our new place. Helping to keep us here, and even paid our electric bills twice. She fills our food shelves once a month with two huge boxes of food, and helps when we need that extra support. Without her we would be homeless again. Thank you to all the volutneers and Magin at Christmas Wish Program.
Project Hawai'i, Inc.	23220	4	/users/profile/24295	Project Hawai	Client Served	5	12/02/2009	I am a client of Christmas Wish Program, Inc. My experience is probably not unique but I want to share my story. I am a single mom of 3 children and we live in a car in the parking lot near the boat ramps. I was given the number to a lady who could help me, so I called. I told Magin that I had all my children in the car with no blankets, food or clothing. Within one hour she was at our car with a box of food, clothing for all the children in nice bags and sleeping bags and pillows for the children. It was so wonderful. She even brought board games and other toys for the children. Then after giving us all a hug she drove off. It was like a mirical for our family. We had nothing and when she left I couldn't even fit everything in the car, the girls had to hold stuff on their laps.If I were to say my experience was less then wonderful, it would be a lie. I couldn't get help from my church, or friends or anyone the way this stranger gave to me and my children. She never even asked us questions about why we were homeless, never judged us, or questioned our intent. She just gave from her heart and thanked us for calling her.Christmas Wish Program services changed our lives and helped  us throughout the year to feel normal again, to exprience the holidays with cheer, and go back to school prepared. Thank God for her and Christmas Wish Program volunteers.

What can you say when you first meet with the director. At first she seems overwhelmed and maybe not organized, but then when you realize all she does, it is a bit much for one person.They you work on the project at hand, thinking, is this really going to work out? There is so much to do and not enough hands. Then you realize Magin doesn't work in the same world as the rest of us, she works in the world of magic, where everything comes together, and everyone is cared for. This is how I can explain my experience with Christmas Wish Program, Inc.
Pacific Primate Sanctuary, Inc.	303773	1	/users/profile/394939	francoj8	Volunteer	5	09/12/2016	As an aspiring primatologist who believes first and foremost in the ethical treatment of all living beings, I chose to apply for an internship at PPS after reviewing primate sanctuaries across the globe. PPS stood out to me for their deep level of compassion for primates in need and their high level of caring for their animals which, in my opinion, is second to none. I was lucky enough to be chosen as a full-time intern at PPS, and knew immediately upon arrival that I had made the right choice. Every person who volunteers at PPS does so with the greatest level of empathy and respect for these wonderful animals, doing everything they can to give these wonderful creatures the highest level of animal care. 
Pacific Primate Sanctuary, Inc.	303626	1	/users/profile/394802	elarami	Volunteer	5	09/12/2016	I choose to volunteer at the Pacific Primate Sanctuary, Inc. because like my fellow volunteers and interns, everything we do at the sanctuary is in the interest of the monkeys. The primates we care for are not exploited, and are treated with the upmost respect. This volunteering positions allows me to become introduced to the fields of biology, behavior sciences, nutrition and caregiving. I personally enjoy learning about dietary needs for the varied species of primates, monkey identification, and sanitization of the enclosures.
Pacific Primate Sanctuary, Inc.	298185	2	/users/profile/389029	RachelMK	Volunteer	5	07/26/2016	I began my journey at this organization about 4 months ago and it has truly exceeded my expectations! The monkeys at PPS are taken care of with such love and compassion; you can tell that they are comfortable, and happy. The values at PPS continue to be held and highest standards by the numerous management, interns, and volunteers that donate their time to the needs of each unique monkey. Being part of the Pacific Primate Sanctuary has been a true blessing. 
Pacific Primate Sanctuary, Inc.	287520	2	/users/profile/284336	Erin84	Board Member	5	04/28/2016	I have been Volunteering at Pacific Primate Sanctuary for over 8 years, and it has become my life work.  PPS is a place that brings me so much joy, gratification and satisfaction.  In a world where deforestation, extinction, and exploitation of animals and natural resources abound, it feels so amazing to be able to donate my time and skills to a place where the animals come first, where every single life is valued and respected.  Through my work at PPS, I feel that I am able to make a difference and do something positive. I have watched with wonder and pride a a marmoset who didn't "speak" the language of his kind ,because he was taken from his mother as an infant for the inhuman pet trade, learn to vocalize and communicate with other marmosets. I have seen a pair of tamarins, who spent the first 10 years of their lives in a sterile, cold laboratory environment, take their first tentative steps outside and eventually leap and bound across branches with the sun on their back and a light breeze rippling through their fur.  PPS makes these things possible for beings that have been exploited, abused and traumatized, and allows them to finally become monkeys.  
Pacific Primate Sanctuary, Inc.	220664	5	/users/profile/284336	Erin84	Volunteer	5	10/07/2014	Pacific Primate Sanctuary is committed to providing compassionate, skilled care to New World Primates.  The monkeys are given refuge from tourist attractions, research laboratories and the inhumane exotic pet trade.  As a volunteer for 7 years, I have had the great joy to watch animals who spent 10 years in windowless laboratories take their first tentative steps outside to see the sky and feel the wind  and sun.  I have heard monkeys, who were kept as pets their whole lives, make brand new vocalizations. These calls were learned from being in contact with their own species- who they had never been able to interact with before.  Each individual monkey is treated with respect and kindness, and special attention is paid to their own specific needs.  The monkeys are not the only ones who benefit at this wonderful Sanctuary;  PPS has an amazing Internship program.  Resident Interns come to the Sanctuary for one year to learn all about New World Primate Care, including general husbandry, special individual care, emergency procedures, medical care and enclosure design and maintenance. Local Volunteers are provided with a unique opportunity to care for Threatened and Endangered primates.  The Sanctuary also offers free educational outreach to local schools.  I am honored to be a part of Pacific Primate Sanctuary! 
Pacific Primate Sanctuary, Inc.	287184	1	/users/profile/347300	jwormser	Board Member	5	04/24/2016	A truly great nonprofit organization that provides unconditional love and care to primates in need. 
Pacific Primate Sanctuary, Inc.	285577	2	/users/profile/345261	Writer	Volunteer	5	04/11/2016	It is truly a privilege working with these primates, many of whom are critically endangered.  They receive so much love and attention from their caregivers.  The facility is meticulously maintained for their health and well being.  PPS strives to give the primates the best life in captivity possible, allowing them to live naturally and break free from the cycle of exploitation.  PPS' compassionate approach succeeds in counteracting some of the abuse that has been inflicted on the primates in the past by recognizing the intrinsic value of all living beings.  
Pacific Primate Sanctuary, Inc.	256862	3	/users/profile/345261	Writer	Volunteer	5	09/12/2015	The Pacific primate sanctuary is a truly exceptional non profit!  Their primary objective is to give monkeys whom have known cruelty, abuse, and exploitation a chance to live out the rest of their lives with the peace, dignity, and respect that all creatures deserve. The animals are given the highest quality of care (spacious clean living space, healthy fresh food, and medical attention) with every consideration for their physical and mental well being. It is comforting to know that there are people out there compassionate enough to try and right some of the wrong that has been done to these animals. In a world facing mass extinction and serious habitat loss, it is high time for humans to be leaders in environmental stewardship and show compassion for all living things. 
Pacific Primate Sanctuary, Inc.	285572	2	/users/profile/375575	Mady W.	Volunteer	5	04/11/2016	I started volunteering at this organization 10 months ago and it has absolutely been one of the best decisions I've ever made. PPS is a model sanctuary, where the staff does everything in their power to care for the wellbeing of the individuals over anything else. The monkeys here are incredibly unique - each with their own personalities, quirks, and stories. They have found refuge at PPS, where they can live out their days playing, grooming, and lounging in the sun just as they would in the wild. I plan to offer my support to PPS long after my time as an intern ends.  
Pacific Primate Sanctuary, Inc.	285493	2	/users/profile/375483	Jordan37	Volunteer	5	04/11/2016	I began working for the Pacific Primate Sanctuary almost a year ago. This organization is amazing in so many ways.  I could tell right from the beginning that the needs of the animals took priority over the needs of all of the caregivers and that the caregivers were joyful about this. What makes this sanctuary unique is that each individual's needs are met in such an intimate way. We are constantly adapting our protocol to ensure it is in the best interest of the monkeys.

I have been working with the sanctuary for about a decade and am honored to help with this life giving program.  These primates are beautiful people whom deserve the best life possible.  I will continue to help this non profit in as many ways as possible....as with everything worth doing in life it takes time, energy, resources, and of course lots of love.  Thank you monkeys for making this planet a better place by teaching us how to live with it.  love y'all.

Pacific Primate Sanctuary, Inc.	258621	3	/users/profile/347124	Writer	Donor	5	09/21/2015	My story is about 2 spider monkeys that will always have a place in my heart. The story of Carlos & Montana began quite awhile ago at the Maui County Zoo, I have not a lot of details to share on their lives there, other that the cages weren't big & the zoo was closed down because the County could no longer care for the animals properly. There next "home" was at a tourist attraction on Maui where i worked and met the two brothers. We did the best that we could for them, the "cage " was bigger but it still was a "cage". I remember that the Pacific Primate Sanctuary came & gave us lessons on how to properly care for them. I know it wasn't the "right" home yet for them but we honestly & lovingly did the best we could for them. we grew fresh fruit on the farm which they received & the restaurant kitchen prepared their meals. They knew us & we knew them. As with life, changes happen, my boss & i were laid off due to the economy, we were their "care givers" and we were leaving. Both of us were more worried about them, then for us finding new jobs. The last day that my boss fed & cared for them, the two brother spider monkeys touched him at the same time, almost to say good bye & this "macho" man cried.The new replacement "care givers" were not interested in having 2 monkeys to take care of & there were rumors going around that the brothers would be put down. The twosome must have a guardian angel, because somehow word got to the Pacific Primate Sanctuary to come & rescue the spider monkeys and they did.PPS took so much care in getting the brothers ready to travel to PPS from the Maui tourist attraction and then the preparation for their new enclosure for Carlos & Montana at PPS was just unbelievable! The two have been at PPS over 5 years, the enclosure has been expanded, has live plants & so much more. The boys are truly in paradise which they so deserve. When I receive newsletters from PPS, I look for the photos and any stories on Carlos & Montana first. I am so impressed by all the articles in the newsletters and how much professional care goes into taking care of the residents at PPS. You feel the love that is given to each one of them and the respect that all of them receive. Please support this nonprofit for giving a second chance to all the primates at PPS!  
Pacific Primate Sanctuary, Inc.	257862	2	/users/profile/346331	Abbycyn	Volunteer	5	09/16/2015	I've known about the PPS for about 10 years now.  Seeing it first hand, is nothing less than you would expect. Hard working volunteers, clean environment, and most importantly, the primates are loved and taken very good care of. 
Pacific Primate Sanctuary, Inc.	257804	2	/users/profile/346273	Luriajoseph	Volunteer	5	09/16/2015	PPS is a gift to the community and the world. It embodies the compassion and care for all creation that imbues all religious and humanistic traditions. The founder and all the volunteers are incredibly dedicated and skilled. PPS is a bright light in our troubled world.

Pacific Primate Sanctuary, Inc.	256703	2	/users/profile/283996	tauridvm	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/11/2015	I have had the privilege of working with the Sanctuary for over 15 years in a consulting role concerning the health of the monkeys. The facility is exemplary and its nutrition, husbandry, and preventive health program as well as any necessary health care are far beyond what zoos can do for their animals. Their animals live to old age in a beautiful habitat where their physical and mental needs are met. The Sanctuary program is visionary for these animals. Lucy Wormser as Director has established a fabulous program and facility. 
Pacific Primate Sanctuary, Inc.	220348	4	/users/profile/283996	tauridvm	Advisor	5	10/06/2014	I have the pleasure of having worked with Lucy Wormser and the Pacific Primate Sanctuary for over 15 years. The program has expanded and continues to deliver fantastic care for rescued New World primates. As a non-profit in addition to the actual animal care, they serve to educate the public on the natural history of these animals, behaviors, the ecology, and the role man is playing in their status as either threatened or endangered species. PPS plays an extremely important role in getting the work out. 
Pacific Primate Sanctuary, Inc.	256607	2	/users/profile/344998	mickey336	General Member of the Public	5	09/11/2015	I just visited a wolf sanctuary  North of L.A.  They care for wolves, but rent the wolves out to  movie studios, in other words, profit is part of their makeup. Pacific Primate is not in that business of renting  their primates for $1200  a day profit. They are trying to keep the delicate ecological chain from losing another link by nurturing these seemingly exotic, but human like primates.Every contribution goes right to the care and protection of the monkeys they accept or see born there.
Pacific Primate Sanctuary, Inc.	256556	2	/users/profile/344942	Hulagirl	Board Member	5	09/11/2015	Pacific Primate Sanctuary is a place of compassion, love and understanding for all the animals that have found a home there.  The staff (composed entirely of Volunteers) all have one goal in mind- the wellbeing of the monkeys.  Every task, from cutting up produce for breakfast, to cleaning enclosures, is done with purpose and passion.  This creates an environment that is ideal for healing and rehabilitation.  The monkeys at PPS have come from tourist attractions, the pet trade and research laboratories.  At PPS, these animals will never have to experience pain or suffering at human hands.  I consider it an honor to be a part of this wonderful organization.
Pacific Primate Sanctuary, Inc.	256411	2	/users/profile/283470	Danette S.	Donor	5	09/11/2015	We are so thankful for the wonderful sanctuary PPS provides for the monkeys.  When we made the heartbreaking decision to place our marmoset there after realizing it was the best place for him (other than a natural habitat, but it was too late for that), the staff was so kind and helpful.  He's been there 9 years now, and they continue to provide excellent care, and communicate with us how he is doing. I very much appreciate how they strive to nurture the monkeys while educating others and running an excellent intern program. Thank you Pacific Primate Sanctuary for all you to make a difference in the lives of the monkeys!!
Pacific Primate Sanctuary, Inc.	219842	3	/users/profile/283470	Danette S.	General Member of the Public	5	10/03/2014	Pacific Primate Sanctuary has been a huge blessing in our lives.  We once had a pet monkey, which was foolish, irresponsible, and unfair to the monkey.  While we loved him very much, it became apparent that he would be better off with animals of his own kind in a natural environment.  PPS has given him that.  Caring volunteers have made such a difference in providing Pacey with what we could not, and what he deserved; to live out his life in a safe place, with other marmosets.  We are so thankful for all that Pacific Primate Sanctuary does to better the lives of primates.

Pacific Primate Sanctuary, Inc.	256013	2	/users/profile/344401	Writer	Board Member	5	09/10/2015	Pacific Primate Sanctuary is run entirely by Volunteers to selflessly serve threatened animals who have suffered because of human ignorance and greed. It is a small light which illuminates a great darkness.  PPS stands for the sacredness of all Beings and an end to "Speciesism" which threatens to destroy all life on Earth.
Pacific Primate Sanctuary, Inc.	250903	2	/users/profile/283496	admin53	Donor	5	07/31/2015	I've been following the work of this brilliant and loving primate sanctuary for decades. It's almost impossible to find enough superlatives to describe the healing salve that Lucy, Erin and the dedicated team of volunteers spread liberally on the animals which find at PPS a place of safety. These wonderful primates - who fill such a vital niche in the wild - have been claimed for the most abusive and selfish reasons, totally unnecessary reasons. PPS stops at nothing to rescue those who have suffered so needlessly. Not only does PPS provide a tender and professional sanctuary for each individual monkey, but their work day in and day out has been helping to educate the public, helping to instil a deep respect for all animals. Follow their work online and please consider providing a donation to help this important charity continue its work.
Pacific Primate Sanctuary, Inc.	219870	3	/users/profile/283496	admin53	General Member of the Public	5	10/04/2014	Having known PPS founder Lucy Lerner Wormser for over 50 years, it came as no surprise to discover her determination to provide a caring sanctuary for monkeys who had been so badly abused and exploited. Nearly all traces of their spark of life were dimmed, but with her tenacity and her inspiration passed along to a dedicated team of volunteers, friends, and family, PPS has gone from strength to strength. Although the sanctuary's primary purpose is to envelop the animals in an atmosphere of inter-species care, I've witnessed its work over decades become a valuable educational resource for professionals and students alike. It's a true exemplar of how nurture and nature can meld together for the benefit of all primates, including humans. Lucy and PPS deserve every accolade. Thank you PPS! Beth Porter, England
Pacific Primate Sanctuary, Inc.	231747	2	/users/profile/295313	capecod	Donor	5	10/31/2014	I am just a donor.  I live on the shores of the North Atlantic, some 5,000 miles from the Pacific Primate Sanctuary.  I have never been to the sanctuary;  never been to Hawaii.  One evening in 2008 I was half-listening to NPR as I prepared dinner.  They were running a series on sounds that are common in the lives of some people but might be virtually unknowable to the rest of us.  I heard a woman's voice and what sounded like the chirping, chattering of birds in the background.  As I paid closer attention I learned that the "birds" were actually monkeys, as heard by the sanctuary volunteers as they entered the enclosure each morning.  And, of course, the voice was Lucy Wormser's.  Lucy said that before the monkeys arrived at the sanctuary they had never felt the sun, the wind, rain on their fur, or seen the sky.  Those words  struck a chord deep in my soul.  The next day Google delivered me to PPS's doorstep and I made a donation.  The following day I received a kind, welcoming email from Lucy.   We have been friends ever since.  Over the years I have learned much about the serious research and other work  performed at PPS.  But, as a layperson, what touches me most is the love and compassion for the monkeys that I feel every single time I interact with PPS.   And best of all, of course,  are the monkeys.    In every picture or video clip, they positively glow with well-being and joy.  Just thinking about the monkeys living out their natural lives together in such a loving place brings me a special kind of peace.   I can sit quietly in my chair here and, soon enough, I  hear the monkeys "singing"  in their beautiful safe haven provided by Lucy, her staff, and all the dedicated volunteers.   
Pacific Primate Sanctuary, Inc.	223992	1	/users/profile/286063	april0416	Donor	5	10/17/2014	My husband and I have been part of a team that has donated automation products to PPS to assist in the day to day life support for the primates that live there.  Each time we come to check in on our products we get to see miracles at work.  Erin, Lucy, and the  rest of the group at PPS are some of the most compassionate and  caring people that I know. They treat each primate with as much care and love as one would bestow upon a small child.  Thank you so much for making our world a better place and caring for these very important members of our rain forests!!  
Pacific Primate Sanctuary, Inc.	222618	1	/users/profile/286354	Nick47	General Member of the Public	5	10/14/2014	Pacific Primate was the most welcoming in taking care of an imperial marmoset that I had as a pet. I called and Lucy answered the phone and was eager to take him into the sanctuary. i'm not quite sure what it was, but I trusted that she had the purest intentions of empathy and love for the monkeys. Five years since they have taken in my marmoset and whenever I ask for updates one is sent to me by Erin. I'm sent the most in depth and descriptive updates of whats  happening at the sanctuary. They feed the monkeys the proper diet and are constantly trying to make the sanctuary better. The monkeys are groomed and are treated with respect which is something I would love to be a part of one day. I couldn't be more satisfied with Pacific Primate and don't know what the world would be like without loving and compassionate people like them. 
Pacific Primate Sanctuary, Inc.	222235	1	/users/profile/285933	Tez C.	Volunteer	5	10/13/2014	I had the privilege to undertake a year long Internship at the Pacific Primate Sanctuary, this was an amazing year of my life. The staff were all so caring and with so much love in their hearts for these beautiful monkeys. You could tell how much people enjoyed volunteering with the monkeys and I quickly started to feel like part of the family. Some of these monkeys were rescued from laboratories or from being ex-pets, it was disturbing to see the condition they were in when they arrived at the sanctuary and the un-natural behaviors they showed. But to see them in this safe and beautiful environment, with dedicated carers who allow them to just be monkeys again was amazing to witness.

As a member of the Board I am able to see how this organization benefits both the Primates they serve and they volunteer staff and interns that keep all aspects of the sanctuary running smoothly.  I applaud all the past and present members of this organization who have given so much to make Pacific Primate Sanctuary a place of refuge for all the animals it serves.  It is truly a model of how compassion and caring can create a positive impact. I encourage anyone who can contribute to Pacific Primate Sanctuary's work, physically or financially to do so knowing their contribution is directly benefiting the animals and furthering this important work. Blessings on Pacific Primate Sanctuary.
Pacific Primate Sanctuary, Inc.	221054	1	/users/profile/284752	AlliLea	Volunteer	5	10/08/2014	As Lucy Wormser puts it, Pacific Primate Sanctuary is truly an angel magnet.  The people who come to volunteer their time and positive energy are compassionate, caring, and dedicated to providing care to new world primates deserving of a better life.  I was fortunate enough to be selected as a resident intern at PPS and can't say enough about my experience there.  The primary concern was always the well being and health of the primates entrusted to our care, first and foremost.  The primates were treated with love, respect and dignity; PPS was THEIR sanctuary, THEIR home.  One of my favorite Dr. Jane Goodall quotes reads "If only we can overcome cruelty, to human and animal, with love and compassion we shall stand at the threshold of a new era in human moral and spiritual evolution and realize, at last, our most unique quality; humanity." Pacific Primate Sanctuary has always been a beautiful representation of this type of humanity, and I am honored to have been able to be a part of it.

Pacific Primate Sanctuary, Inc.	219450	2	/users/profile/224720	AvonCOGirl	Volunteer	5	10/02/2014	This Sanctuary currently is home to many species of primates.  Currently there are 4 interns and one Manager on staff.  All help is volunteer and the food is mostly donated.  A solar system was recently installed and they could use some funds to help pay for that but it will greatly cut down on the electric bills.As a volunteer, I help prep food and clean enclosures.  The monkeys are not on display to the public and live peacefully with superb care from everyone involved.  The property includes an organic garden to help produce fresh, healthy food for animals and interns.  I knew very little about this organization when I signed on to volunteer and am impressed with the professional demeanor of the staff and the wonderful care given to the animals.

Ku Aloha Ola Mau	274006	4	/users/profile/285387	EPower	Professional with expertise in this field	5	12/08/2015	I've been honored and privileged be around the Ku Aloha folks for six years and I can say that my experience of them is an humbling one.  I have never seen such unrelenting positive care and aloha!  Their staff work tirelessly to make sure people receive the best care, and learn lifelong skills that make a positive difference.  The number of people they serve in each site is amazing, and the efforts they go to be respectful and help people develop dignity and community are very high.  They work to maintain positive mana and aloha, and do a really good job in spite of limited resources.  In the six years I've been affiliated with them, dropping in or making a scheduled visit, I've never seen anything except the highest standards of professionalism.  I feel confident, safe, and cared for as a part of their community--and I think the over 13,000 people they have served are lucky to have chosen Ku Aloha! 
Ku Aloha Ola Mau	241894	2	/users/profile/328590	MissNurse	General Member of the Public	1	04/30/2015	While the goals and mission statement of Ku Aloha are admirable the day to day practices are shameful. I have seen dealers that care more for their clients than Ku Aloha and they frequently lie about policies if it makes their jobs easier. Client documents are left in plain sight and they do not hesitate to discuss client details loudly in public. Clients who are on insurance suddenly find many more procedures are required while private pay clients are pushed out the door as quickly as possible. Every day there is a bad day for the staff and you can plan on being met with loud sighs, frowning faces, and derision your entire time there.  The biggest issue I have with Ku Aloha, and to a lesser extent other programs of similar nature, is that your recovery is not a priority; often street dealers will express concern for their customers and advise that they quit or take breaks from drugs use.... Not Ku Aloha, they have monetary interest in keeping you in the program and will intentionally make it difficult to leave or lower your dose. Drug addiction is unhealthy, even legal drugs like methadone, keeping a client addicted is deplorable. They make it easy to raise your dosage but requests to lower dosage are met with argument and belittling.  Many of the counselors and especially the doctor will deride clients in truly unnecessary ways, treating them as sub-humans, merely cattle to be processed and more money in the bank. If you look through the reviews for them on this site there is a conspicuous lack of client reviews, only staff.  However it isn't all doom and gloom, the nurses don't seem to have acquired the same attitude towards clients and can be helpful; the same for many of the clients themselves, many of the more experienced addicts can be a font of useful information(if only cautionary!).  I hope my more honest review can be of use to somebody!

The staff's respect for the land, values and elders of the community are exemplary.  The agency holds a high respect from the community they serve, community and State partners, and vendors.

Ku Aloha Ola Mau	221349	1	/users/profile/285046	traumaresponsivesystems	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/09/2014	When I first encountered Ku Aloha Ola Mau as someone who helps organizations become more Trauma-Informed, I was curious about how their traditional values-driven program worked.  The more I came to understand the focus on helping the haumana (students) learn and practicing reconnecting to health, learning how to build sturdy relationships grounded in acceptance--shame-free acceptance--the more I realized how powerful their work is.  I am convinced that the success of their work, grounded in values and practices that are life-restoring and healing, welcoming instead of shaming, connecting and restoring, is because of its' grounding.  Ku Aloha completes the circle of healing, and helps people extend their own.  It's Pono at the highest level.

Ku Aloha Ola Mau	173786	2	/users/profile/229936	Jon_12	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/04/2013	As a practicing addiction psychiatrist, i make many referrals to Ku Aloha Ola Mau.  I am so pleased with the results - they improve lives, allowing them to become productive again.  They provide a range of supportive services, and profit is not their motive.
Ku Aloha Ola Mau	113308	2	/users/profile/154193	IslandAndo	Volunteer	5	05/30/2012	     I've been volunteering with Ku Aloha for roughly 9 months now and the experience I've had has been nothing short of wonderful. The aura of family that encompasses the organization is unlike anything I've ever seen. To be able to see both the staff and the clients working together so as to always be bettering the services for everyone involved is both novel and inspirational to me. Over the course of my time here I've learned that one's own culture plays a major role in any healing process. Ku Aloha fully recognizes this and factors culture into nearly every decision made regarding our clients. The counselors work with the clients on an incredibly personal level and never hesisitate to assist me with any questions that I've had (More often they're offering help). I have nothing but the highest respect for this place of healing and would fully recommend it to anyone seeking treatment for addiction.

We  maintain strong  fiscal responsibility  and  constantly  seek  improvements  in the  outcomes  of the people  we  serve.  It  is  amazing  the  number of  people I meet  that  have  been impacted  by  our  organization.   All  is  kept  is  the greatest  confidence  because  of the  social stigma that  addiction has .
Three Ring Ranch, Inc.	142266		/users/profile/35639	greenhawaii	General Member of the Public	5	11/24/2012	Norm & Ann Goody are genuinely interested in the welfare of every single animal in their sanctuary, big and small.  They have helped many injured animals and have the professional skills necessary to use the correct treatments,  procedures and medicines.  They have released the ones that have had a complete recovery back into habitat where they came from. Some of the animals can never be released and remain on the property in safe and clean conditions.  This takes a tremendous amount of dedication and hard work.  They have taught others how to respect wildlife and have worked with the community and schools to educate children and adults about what is best for animals.  This ongoing project  is a living work of art and if anyone has the opportunity to visit and donate or just donate, I highly recommend it as a worthy cause.  Mary Lovein
Three Ring Ranch, Inc.	34777	4	/users/profile/35639	greenhawaii	General Member of the Public	4	04/06/2010	We are pleased to live so close to the beautiful Three Ring Ranch and to have Norm and Ann Goody doing so much for our community.  They are both educated and informed on all aspects of their work and are happy to share their knowledge.   These devoted individuals work hard for the good of the animals and live up to their mission statement on a daily basis. The grounds are well maintained and the animals could not be in better hands

Three Ring Ranch, Inc.	64567		/users/profile/70603	James	Donor	5	02/08/2011	The Three Ring Ranch does an amazing job working with wildlife and the community in Hawaii.  They provide invaluable services that would not exist without them.  There have been numerous birds and other animals that they have saved and a tremendous number of humans who they have influenced positively through their programs in the community and teaching at the Ranch.  I have the upmost respect for all that Ann and Norman have accomplished.
Three Ring Ranch, Inc.	63650		/users/profile/69589	Malu Gray	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/05/2011	The Three Ring Ranch is a terrific wildlife sanctuary and an excellent resource for information. I'm a rehabber on the island of Maui and sometimes I receive an animal that I'm not familiar with. On numerous occasions Ann Goody has offered her advice and patiently walked me through difficult rehabilitation steps. The Three Ring Ranch is the best wildlife organization we have in Hawaii. They are knowledgeable, professional, and willing to share information with others. 
Three Ring Ranch, Inc.	63631		/users/profile/69571	Geneva	Volunteer	5	02/05/2011	When I graduated from high school, instead of handing me the keys to a new car, my parents handed me the opportunity to volunteer at Three Ring Ranch. I had first heard about the ranch my sophomore year in high school, but being to young to be involved in any of the college programs I had to wait, so this opportunity was the most exciting thing I had ever received. I spent 2 weeks working with and learning from Ann Goody and can confidently say that she is a unique and special person with the most fantastic sanctuary, a place safe for animals and a safe place of learning for people. I have never seen a place so wild with so much care put into the well being of these beautiful and exotic creatures anywhere else. I volunteer at the zoo, I've worked in animal clinics, but The Three Ring Ranch is uniquely pure in its intent to care for animals and pass on the knowledge about them to others. Three Ring Ranch runs only on donations, but Ann and Norm Goody do an amazing job in making sure the care for the animals is the best of the best. Whether the animal is a permanent resident, being rehabilitated for re-release, a mouse, a monkey, or a blonde zebra, you can bet that they are in the care of their strongest advocate. Since my first volunteering experience, I have gone back to Three Ring Ranch to help build new facilities for incoming animals, and I hope to return again to work on whatever project Ann and Norm need done!
Three Ring Ranch, Inc.	63600		/users/profile/69540	Michelle F.	General Member of the Public	5	02/04/2011	I was fortunate enough to go to the Three Ring Ranch with my parents, I had been to The Big Island several times and if I had known about this facility I would have been honored to be a volunteer on any of my previous trips (the beach wasn't going anywhere!). Immediately I was impressed by the love and care given to each and every creature lucky enough to rehabilitate for hopeful release or those who need a home.The fact this is solely run on donations says so much about the true mission of this facility. Ann and Norm Goody want to make a change in the way we all see the creatures around us all. The educational program is an excellent way for all of us to learn what we can do to help animals of all shapes and sizes, and that does include our bird friends.One of my all time favorite pictures is of Ann with Zoe, true love for all. I feel so lucky to have had the opportunity to experience The Three Ring Ranch!See you next time I am on the Island!
Three Ring Ranch, Inc.	63596		/users/profile/69536	Scott Eckert	Volunteer	5	02/04/2011	Three Ring Ranch is an amazing blessing to the animal kingdom. The experience of the care taker Ann Goody is exceptional and rare to come by. These animals are so lucky to live on the ranch, they could not find a better home and provider. I have visited the ranch twice for week long stays as a volunteer, once in 1999, and once in 2010. I was truly amazed to see the growth and hard work put into the ranch. Ana and Norm Goody are truly dedicated to the ranch and give it all they have. The love and emotion between the animals and Ana is unbelive and you can see how thankful they truly are. Anyone who visits the ranch or even sits down for a conversation with Ana will not walk away unimpacted. The knowledge you recive is top knotch and accurate, proven by the sucess these injured or abused animal have made.
Three Ring Ranch, Inc.	63534		/users/profile/69466	Elissa	Donor	5	02/04/2011	I came with a friend for a tour and was not expecting such a clean and well run place. Wow, looks like these people work 24/7 to care for the animals and teach visitors. We will come back each year to see what's new.
Three Ring Ranch, Inc.	63178		/users/profile/69072	jgkona	General Member of the Public	5	02/04/2011	three ring ranch is a wonderful organization.  Ann and Norm Goody are dedicated individuals who put their own needs aside to rescue, rehabilitate and release ( when needed)and care for the animals of this sanctuary as well as educate children and adults on animals and our environment   The service they provide to these creatures and to our environment are 24/7,which is obviously not an easy task physically and financially.  The Goody's and all the volunteers love this mission and carry it out beautifully.  I had the opportunity to work with Ann many years ago in the health field and I know she left an excellent career to take on this self-less challenge. I no longer live in that community but I follow 3RR on its website.  It is a very deserving organization.
Three Ring Ranch, Inc.	62781		/users/profile/68646	Cathy W.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/03/2011	3 RR is fabulous in 3 ways: they do outstanding scientific research in exotic animal care, they rehab and care for exotic and endangered animals and they educate the public on the care of the earth and how important these animals are to all of us! The world would be a much worse place without them!
Three Ring Ranch, Inc.	35720	4	/users/profile/36525	sonoflars111	Volunteer	5	04/14/2010	I have been a volunteer at Three Ring Ranch for 3 years and cannot wait for the days I go in to help.  To be there getting to know all of the animals and socializing with them is incredibly rewarding.  I don't know how Ann and Norm do it because this is absolutely a 24/7/365 endeavor.  Many of the birds that have been captured, rehabilitated, and released have flown back to this place on their own many days later.  They know how great it is to be able to trust.
Three Ring Ranch, Inc.	35620	6	/users/profile/36439	anitag	General Member of the Public	5	04/13/2010	This is a terrific organization where animals, reptiles and birds of all types receive top notch care and love.

Three Ring Ranch, Inc.	35403	6	/users/profile/36239	gfurry	Volunteer	5	04/10/2010	Three Ring Ranch is a wonderful outfit that rescues, rehabilitates and returns injured wildlife to their natural habitat. They also provide a home for animals that can't be returned to the wild. They teach children about the importance of wildlife. All of this is done in the spirit of freely giving of oneself. You have to look far and wide to find another place such as this. I have visited the sanctuary many times, and I have watched it grow under the passionate direction of its curator, Ann Goody.  I marvel at her energy and expertise. I am particularly impressed with the way animals thrive under her care.
Three Ring Ranch, Inc.	35367	2	/users/profile/36200	natalie9	Volunteer	5	04/10/2010	Three Ring Ranch Animal Sanctuary has been my passion for the past five years. Working to preserve endangered wildlife has had a profound impact on shaping who I am today. The opportunity to work with exotic and endangered animals gave me an understanding of our worlds intricate and delicate balance. The clinic provides services for low income pet owners who's animals would other wise be uncared-for. In addition the Mobile Clinic addresses the feral cat population that is decimating Hawaiis endangered species population. I have had the amazing opportunity to work side-by-side as the surgical assistant with visiting veterinarians.
Three Ring Ranch, Inc.	35300	2	/users/profile/36134	norm1	Board Member	5	04/09/2010	Three Ring Ranch has grown from a home for a few animals from the Molokai Safari park and a place where injured wildlife came from the Humane Society to a full fledged rehab & educational sanctuary. With the new Hands on Science Center it is a really fun place to come visit year after year. You get to see animals you remember and meet new ones. I highly suggest visitors email in advance and book one of the educational tour programs.

Three Ring Ranch, Inc.	34888	8	/users/profile/35747	lorlor123	Volunteer	5	04/07/2010	I volunteered at Three Ring Ranch to learn anything about any type of animal. This ranch has provided such an open understanding knowledge to each animal and volunteer that works there. They not only take care of the animals, they put out such a love and kindness with every individual one. Three Ring Ranch is educational and teaches you everything about an animal and what they are like as well. Putting you in the position of the animal, and what the animal would expect from there care owner. Thus making them the most understanding ranch of all, to all animals. Each animal is so well taken care of and helped with, with such hope. No ranch can compare to Three Ring Ranch! They inspired me to become a veterinarian to provide as much care they do to animals I can care to!
Three Ring Ranch, Inc.	34758	4	/users/profile/35621	konatimn	Volunteer	5	04/06/2010	I have been a volunteer at the Three Ring Ranch for about three years or so. It has been such a joy for me to be a part of such and amazing place. I have been witness to the painstaking recovery process some of the injured wild animals have to go through before being able to be released. I am amazed at the love and dedication Ann has for every creature in her care. I certainly don't know many people willing to spend many nights sleeping next to an injured sea bird, attending to it's needs throughout the night. But that is who Ann is and what makes this place such an incedibly special place. And a true gift for the animals who are lucky enough to find their way to the sanctuary when they are in need of help.
Three Ring Ranch, Inc.	34736	7	/users/profile/35603	kamana001	General Member of the Public	5	04/05/2010	Three Ring Ranch is one of the most deserving and unusual organizations on the island of Hawaii. Visiting this place will leave you with a new appreciation for the resident animals which are being lovingly nursed back to health. Ann, the director of Three Ring Ranch, has unending loving energy and the sense of humor needed for this endeavor. A visit to this place will make a memorable and rewarding experience.

We can say that ALL students on campus have the supplies that they need, our students are ALL wearing footwear DAILY and have the basic necessities needed to feel good about his/herself.

Keiki Cupboard	219014		/users/profile/282632	kumusantiago	Volunteer	5	10/01/2014	As a teacher here on Maui, the Keiki Cupboard is a welcomed and valuable resource to our students' success in education. The Keiki Cupboard has been able to provide the essential items for young children to ensure their academic success. Due to the ever changing and difficult economy that we live in, our students are not always equipped with the right tools to aide in their learning. Often times, their parents have to decline purchasing school supplies just so that they can provide for their families. Keiki Cupboard makes it possible for each kid to feel confident and not worry about the stressors of life, but rather focus on gaining the knowledge and power to grow in their learning. *Mahalo*

Keiki Cupboard	84897		/users/profile/94339	toby neal	Board Member	5	04/06/2011	My years as a school counselor, frustrated with children not having what they needed, sparked the idea that led to developing Keiki Cupboard. I love being a part of channeling resources straight into the schools and into the hands and backpacks of those who most need help.It's been awesome, and Keiki Cupboard is doing it--all volunteer, 100% donations go straight to the children. 
Keiki Cupboard	84881		/users/profile/94320	kealohilani	General Member of the Public	5	04/05/2011	I am a 6th grade special education teacher who has sent several of my students to the counselors to get supplies from Keiki Cupboard.  Some of my students have experienced life circumstances that would stop many adults from persisting and yet they keep coming to school and keep trying to overcome the academic, economical, and  social issues that make learning so difficult for them.  I have often spent my own money trying to make sure my students have the supplies they need for school.  Keiki Cupboard has been there to provide when I just can't cover for all of them.   I appreciate the extra support for my students and my students appreciate the fact that there are people who care enough to help them have what they need to participate and be successful in school.  I have had students pick up shoes, locks for lockers, backpacks, binders, notebooks, etc.  It is convenient to have on campus.  I hope the program will continue becasue with the economic downturn lately, we have students who sure need the assistance.  THANK YOU KEIKI CUPBOARD!!!

Keiki Cupboard	84850		/users/profile/94279	Sue Wilson	Board Member	5	04/05/2011	100% of donations go to stocking the cupboards.  All the rest is volunteer.  There are a few Angel donors who pay specifically for office supplies, and other minor expenses. Keiki Cupboard is filling a real need in the schools, and the children directly receive their supplies without red tape.  In many instances, the teacher themselves would provide supplies out of their own (shrinking) pocketbooks. An organization of good will, and good cheer.
Keiki Cupboard	84817		/users/profile/94218	Linda L.

I have seen the process and dedication of the all volunteer board and wonderful volunteers that make this program work. It is the generosity of those who are able, that can make a huge difference in those who are unable.  Something as simple as a backpack, pencils and paper or a pair of shoes can make this difference in a child that has none. Keiki Cupboard, with the help of teachers and counselors, can give these items to the child in need on the spot.  No red tape.  No forms to fill out.

The Jewish Congregation of Maui	22683	9	/users/profile/23680	markblacknell35	Volunteer	5	11/14/2009	The Jewish Congregation of Maui offers a multitude of opportunities to explore the Jewish faith and/or reconnect with your cultural identity. This organization, more than any other I've ever been associated with, has helped make me a more conscientious and fulfilled person. Being part of the Jewish community of Maui is not reliant on social stature, appearance or any other outward factor. If you are a positive person, willing to contribute to the betterment of the collective energy of the whole, you will find your niche and flourish within the community of Maui Jews. Congregation Rabbi David Glickman is a human being who will be the first to point out his own flaws, and it is precisely for this reason that he is a special leader and teacher worth getting to know.
The Jewish Congregation of Maui	22666	9	/users/profile/23670	poeteur	Board Member	5	11/14/2009	I have been involved with the JCM since 1984. We use to meet at each others houses and our torah was moved to different locations. I called it "Have torah will travel." The JCM has grown to where we are able to help many people in all situations. Having a building and a full time rabbi has put a huge strain on us financially. We are a community with a great heart, and great love for humanity. The most satisfying experience for me has occurred many times in the years since I have been on Maui. Many are the times when we help a fellow Jew and the family while visiting the island who has an emergency, usually life trhreatening health type, and our small, caring community mobilizes to help the family by providing assistance with their needs - spiritual, social, and financial. We are small; we are not too wealthy, but we give from the heart.
The Jewish Congregation of Maui	22646	7	/users/profile/23651	grumpybear	General Member of the Public	5	11/14/2009	This congregation is one of the friendliest communities.  They are very accommodating to all visitors to the island. Their shabbat services are great, and the high holiday services top all other congregations that I have ever been part of.  Tashlich services at the beach are awesome.  It sure beats going to a river or creek on the mainland.  If you are ever in Maui, you need to check it out!  You won't be sorry.
The Jewish Congregation of Maui	22632	6	/users/profile/23643	jerrold	Client Served	5	11/14/2009	i have been the welcome recipient of the weekly drash and sense of community offered by the Congregation for the past several years.  it has been uplifting and a connection to Maui and the islands, combining my religious and love of nature into one.  it has caused me to think, contribute, expand my beliefs and experiences in an attempt to bring that sense to my life here in California.
The Jewish Congregation of Maui	22211	9	/users/profile/23281	Reepacheap	Volunteer	5	11/11/2009	JCM has helped my learn to read hebrew, understand to a greater degree the Tanach, helped me in every way possible.  The people are friendly, personable, helpful and it is a good place to visit.
The Jewish Congregation of Maui	21997	9	/users/profile/23117	Sharlee	General Member of the Public	5	11/09/2009	I am just converting to Judaism and JCM is the first congregation I have been a part of.  I love it!  As I am trying to figure out where I fit in all of this, I have a lot of people that are willing to share their thoughts and views to help me out.  I adore the Rabbi and his family.  He has an interesting balance to find for our community and he is amazingly successful at it without compromising integrity.  I feel very safe here and am grateful they are here on Maui.
The Jewish Congregation of Maui	21913	1	/users/profile/23049	perlawolf	Volunteer	4	11/09/2009	My experience with the congregation has been overwhelmingly wonderful. It really helps to serve the comunity and bring people closer together. Rabbi Glickman and Jody have been very supportive and very personable. It is a wonderful place to have here on the islands as we are so separated from the mainland. With the friendships I have made it really has made me feel like part of a community.
The Jewish Congregation of Maui	21877	1	/users/profile/23018	surfer_jew	Client Served	5	11/08/2009	My experience has been very positive. Rabbi Glickman is a knowledgeable and inspiring steward. The members are very welcoming, supporting, taking interest in newcomers and Maui visitors, genuinely, with open heart. Beit Shalom offers a wonderful warm foothold of Judaism on the Hawaiian soil, a Jewish "island" within the tropical paradise island, where not only locals but also visitors can keep their connection with the tradition, have a home away from home. I, personally, not only attended the Shabbat services, but also was "hooked" into participating with Israeli Dancing, Torah learning sessions, Hebrew lessons and Passover celebrations. I found it time and again, meaningfully, spiritually enriching to be able to connect with my faith during vacation time. My guess is, it is not only me, but many Jews may find less time during their busy "mainland" lives for their Judaism and spirituality. Because of Jewish Congregation of Maui, I am looking forward to my vacations not only for recharging the batteries needed in the hustle and bustle of everyday worries and commitments but also for a spiritual replenishment.
The Jewish Congregation of Maui	21820	1	/users/profile/22962	bigrich	Board Member	5	11/07/2009	My involvement has been since it's inception. I am a better person fot it. This congregation can be supportive in all aspects of life.
The Jewish Congregation of Maui	21800	2	/users/profile/22944	Jody-Lynn	Volunteer	5	11/07/2009	I love the people, the place, the atmosphere.  It is friendly, warm, and accepting.  Some people attending don't know anything, while others know a lot, but everyone feels comfortable at their own level because of the guidance of the rabbi.  The synagogue also serves as a place for people to socially interact and meet other Jews.  It's overall a wonderful place to be.
The Jewish Congregation of Maui	21775	2	/users/profile/22922	kula	Board Member	5	11/06/2009	In 1980, one could count the Jews of Maui on one's hands. Those of us who were parents or expected to be parents, wondered how our kids would have any idea of what it means to be a Jew. Today we have our Rabbi, our Beit Shalom (one of only two synagogues in the State of Hawaii), our cemetery and the opportunity to live as Jews from cradle to grave.The population of Maui has more than tripled since 1980 when most native to Maui, if they thought of Jews at all, pictured a people who only existed in the Old Testament of their Christian Bible. Today, most know us as a vital part of the immigration tapestry of our state. Like the Chinese, Japanese, Phillipino and others who (mostly) came before us, we are the people of Maui.On a small and relatively isolated island, the Maui community prospers by unity. Although JCOM was founded to serve the Jews of Maui, and continues in this role, I am proud that our organization can today serve the Maui community as well as our membership. JCOM faces daunting challenges. We have faced them before, we will face further challenges in the future. We no longer face them alone, however.
The Jewish Congregation of Maui	21763	2	/users/profile/22896	Anniea24	Volunteer	5	11/06/2009	I had never been to a synagogue before, just when I was a child, and we were there for a relatives wedding, etc.The first time we came,it felt like we belonged. Rabbi Glickman and his wife are such wonderful and welcoming people. I had always looked at being Jewish as an ethnicity, like being part French, or Italian. Because of Rabbi David, my son and I, are learning about our religion.
The Jewish Congregation of Maui	21735	2	/users/profile/22868	Ace	General Member of the Public	5	11/06/2009	The Jewish Congregation of Maui welcomes all Jews from all walks of religious life from non observant to orthodox. The Rabbi is the most amazing person I have ever met in my life. The community is warm and has an atmosphere of one large family. They care for one another and help each other out in times of need. It is truly a humbling experience to take part in any activities with this congregation.
The Jewish Congregation of Maui	21734	2	/users/profile/22865	mauimom	Volunteer	5	11/06/2009	I was raised in a synagogue on the mainland... My Babbie and Zaddie were very religious and most of my favorite memories about growing up would be all nights we spent at their house after services... other favorite memories about the way I grew up was when we would ditch Hebrew School with the Cantor to eat ice cream... now many many years later I realize I learned more sitting and eating ice cream with the Cantor than I did sitting in class...I tell this story because when I look and listen to the Rabbi at The Jewish Congregation of Maui I see the same love, caring, patience and knowledge to teach that I had with the Cantor I grew up with... This incredible congregation in the middle of the Pacific, has a bond stronger than you can imagine... different people from Professionals to people living in their car... it does not matter... they are all welcomed and then invited to stay longer... It is my hope that when my children are grown they will have similar memories of growing up in the Jewish faith... I think attending and being a part of The Jewish Congregation of Maui they have a very good start... Shaloha from Maui
The Jewish Congregation of Maui	21288	3	/users/profile/22273	Moon Willow	Volunteer	5	11/03/2009	Aug. 14 2008, I moved to Maui and did not know a soul. The Jewish Congregation of Maui was very warm and welcoming. It was easy to become envolved with volunteering to help with the activities and events. Rabbi David Glickman is an amazing man. He puts his whole heart into teaching and helping the congregation grow. The times have been difficult this year; Rabbi's determination and perservance have been encouraging. He is committed. The Board of Directors have pressed through and looked at every possibility for growth and endurance. I feel blessed to be part of a congregation that loves the Jewish people, their community and Israel. JCM is an inspiration!
The Jewish Congregation of Maui	21269	2	/users/profile/22391	Michael4	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/03/2009	The Jewish Congregation of Maui is a soulful, vital organization, providing Jewish learning and a sense of roots for those living on Maui as well as providing a base for international travelers who visit to Maui during the year and especially during Jewish holidays.  JCM is flexible in its religious practice, accommodating different Jewish perspectives.  All parts of the community are acknowledged: the Rabbi is knowledgeable, there is folk dancing and there is even a support group for those having difficulty.  Come visit.
The Jewish Congregation of Maui	21019	3	/users/profile/22138	eleiter	Client Served	5	10/31/2009	A gem of a jewish congregation. One of the few I have ever encountered where a traditional rabbi welcomes all comers and encourages them to worship "as their heart dictates".
The Jewish Congregation of Maui	20914	2	/users/profile/22033	Baylelev	Donor	5	10/30/2009	My husband and I found this treasure by chance after a cruise. The Rabbi and members were warm and welcoming. Friday it's Reform, Saturday Conservative and the Rabbi is ordained Orthodox and is Shomer Shabbos so all feel accepted. I have been to Chanukah celebrations up in the town of Makawa where many non Jews come to enjoy the food and singing. Not only is this the Jewish presence on Maui but  it is also involved with the local community. I especially appreciate that each week I hear all the news and a drash by the Rabbi via email.This full service congregation needs all the help it can get to continue the many vital and enjoyable programs it provides - from ritual to folk dancing. At least once a year I visit to "restore my soul."
The Jewish Congregation of Maui	20796	10	/users/profile/21921	capndave	Former Volunteer	5	10/30/2009	When planning my move to Maui, I thought it impossible that I would find a Jewish community.  My brother, with whom I was talking with on the phone at the time, said simply, "mauijews.org."  I suppose he was also on the internet while talking with me.  I thought it's worth a shot when I get there.The Jewish community that I found on Maui was one of the most inclusive, positive, and inspirational I have ever been a part of.  They are a true island of people on an island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.  My time spent in the community and with the synagogue has been some of the happiest times in my life.  Due to unfortunate circumstances, I found myself moving away from the community I love to a place full of Jews, but not full of soul.  I now lament my situation on a daily basis and I eagerly plan my return to the warmest Jewish community I've had the pleasure of belonging to.My wish to others is for them to be able to feel what I felt.  I can only call it a true Jewaiian  experience.  With times like these, Jews everywhere need a community like this and, simply, the Jewish Community of Maui needs Jews everywhere.  With my hopeful return to the community, I can only aspire to provide the welcome, the aloha spirit, and the warm Jewish soul with others visiting that tight-knit community on an island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.

I applaud the work they do, which can only continue to inspire a greater Pacific Island dialogue worldwide.

Islands Society	270236	2	/users/profile/358951	MichaelOD	Client Served	5	10/31/2015	The Islands Society has played an intrical role in educating our students on current issues facing the Pacific islands. Our school, located in Southern California and less than a mile away from the Pacific Ocean, has a deep interest in our island-nation neighbors and has found the tools and resources this organization provides to be most useful and informative. We look forward to continuing to work with you in educating our students on the impact they can have for this region of the world.

Pacific Islands have very few resources so collaboration and pooling together of resources among educators is an important way to maximize resources. Fortunately, the Society provides a digital platform that brings together educators. 
Islands Society	270128	3	/users/profile/358852	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/30/2015	This is a non-profit tackling real-life issues for Islanders with the greatest passion I've encountered. The leadership team is highly qualified and connected. I also admire the inclusive nature of this organisation, especially their dedication to mentoring global island youth. With a focus on current and future Island social, political and technical challenges and solutions, I'm sure the Islands Society will continue to soar!
Islands Society	260290	2	/users/profile/348867	BoardMember989	Board Member	5	09/30/2015	The mission of our organization is to inspire and empower islanders around the world to participate in foreign affairs and overseas engagement. It has been wonderful to watch our staff work to fulfill this mission over the past two years. I have been particularly heartened by the testimonials that our next generation leaders provided at the end of their 2014 programs. It has been truly rewarding to play some small role in our organization's success! I would therefore encourage others who are considering serving on the Board to do the same.
Islands Society	260286	2	/users/profile/348862	eu_lau	General Member of the Public	5	09/30/2015	Living on a european island, I've long been concerned with the ecological issues that are becoming more and more important to us. Browsing through the web, I've been delighted to discover the "Islands Society". I just love how dynamic they are and, thanks to them, I discovered many more aspects of what being an islander can mean throughout the world, both through our differences and our similarities. Keep up the good work !
Islands Society	260096	2	/users/profile/348659	baltic_islands_society	Board Member	5	09/29/2015	I was excited to recently become involved with the Baltic constituency of the Islands Society. Having lived in, and worked on, the region it was a pleasure to see a young new organization seeking to fill vital gaps that have long needed to be addressed in the field of public diplomacy and foreign affairs. This is especially true in the Baltic Sea region where recent events have brought into question the regions continued peace and prosperity. As the organization continues to grow and expand its work in the Baltic I feel it will become an important player in developing robust foreign policies that will not only enhance human and regionally security, but ensure a diverse group of voices are empowered to become part of the debate.  
Islands Society	260092	2	/users/profile/348655	tkoalo	Volunteer	5	09/29/2015	The Islands Society's ambitious undertaking to support islands communities around the world fills a gap in the global community that is a welcome and much needed movement.  By celebrating the diversity of island communities while cultivating common ground between them, the Island Society builds a unique mechanism for developing greater international partnerships, cooperation and ultimately promoting better understanding and peace between and among people from around the world. With programs that range from promoting equality and empowering young female leaders to programs that help foster the next generation of foreign policy makers, I'm look forward to seeing how the organisation will grow in the future !
Islands Society	258474	3	/users/profile/346970	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	09/19/2015	Over the last few years, I have been following the work of the Islands Society with great interest. As a resident of an island off the coast of South Carolina, I was excited to hear a few yers ago that the Islands Society was working to promote equal opportunities for islanders from my community and others around the world. I was particularly excited to hear of the launch of the Sea Islands Society last year. Now, we not only have an international nonprofit working to advance our interests. We also have a local society that is committed to promoting the interests of islanders from South Carolina and Georgia! I can't wait to see what is next for us.

PATCH	87911		/users/profile/98718	ileana kainoa	Client Served	4	04/28/2011	Well I had just had my daughter and in just 3 months i alredy had to return to work.  Being a single parent here with no family in the same city as me, I was faced with the delima of placing my new born in (I had no idea where to start) a strangers arms to take care of daily.  It literally bought tears to my eyes as i felt so hopeless as to what would happen next.  After seeking help in the community to find the appropriate resources I was directed to the PATCH office in wainaku.  I immediatly felt the load lifted as I wus sitting there being assured that ALL Child Care Providers are licenced by PATCH have gone through the health education & Training process. Then wen she printed out a list of providers for me to call & interview, I wuz blown away by the pages & pages of Providers to choose from.  Going to that office that day had changed my perspective of my situation completly. I had hope again, I was restored with the faith that I could find safe, resonable, affordable child care.  I dont know what I would have dont were it not for PATCH to be there.  I also inquire about the courses needed to take to be a licensed child care provider myself, for that has always been a passion for me. Sincerely, I. K. Derouin 
PATCH	87908		/users/profile/98715	Angela C.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/28/2011	PATCH has been an asset to our preschool program in offering free or low cost workshops/classes to our families.  The resources given to us through PATCH allow us to educate our families and ultimately benefit the little ones we serve.
PATCH	87849		/users/profile/98645	Theresa Heinrich	Client Served	5	04/28/2011	I am a single working Mom.  My daughter was only 1 year old and I just got a full time job.  I was terrified about how I would make a living to support the two of us, and be a good mother, and find and afford childcare.  In addition I had just moved to Hawaii and had no friends or community knowledge.  Thank God for PATCH.  I called this organization multiple times, often in tears, and they always took the time to give me the answers, knowledge and references I needed.  Every program I have worked with involving any type of child care connection or information was introduced to me through PATCH.  Thank you PATCH.
PATCH	87835		/users/profile/98618	Angeline	Professional with expertise in this field	4	04/28/2011	People Attentive to Children Hawaii is a wonderful organization.  They provide so many services.  Families can go to them to request information about child care options in their area, they provide much needed training for Early Childhood Professionals.  They have taken on daunting task of maintaining and revising the Hawaii Registry of ECE Professionals as well as administer the disbursements for Preschool Open Doors.  The County Co-ordinators of PATCH are dedicated people who truly believe in the importance of early childhood education.
PATCH	87746		/users/profile/98504	pho2	Client Served	5	04/28/2011	The Hawaii PATCH program was wonderful.  The online listing of providers made the initial search for childcare immensely helpful to those of us with busy work schedules.  The program's selection, training and credentialing requirements ensured a standard of care that put my mind at ease.  I've recommended the program to other parents and am glad at my good fortune to have moved to a state where such a wonderful program exists for working parents with young children.
PATCH	87737		/users/profile/98494	Naias House	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/28/2011	PATCH has provided me with the support I needed to grow a successful childcare business and work in the field I love -- helping families with young children. Through PATCH I have been able to receive educational grants, equipment grants, training classes and referrals to my family childcare which has allowed me to provide childcare for numerous families over the last 5 years.  PATCH is definitely a great nonprofit that supports the families and young children in Hawaii to help ensure that the first five years of a child's life are met with educated and qualified professionals that provide a great foundation for future learning and success.
PATCH	87707		/users/profile/98451	ekoji66	Client Served	5	04/27/2011	When my childcare provider decided to take a extended vacation, I was horrified and didn't know what to do. I had a 1 year old and didn't feel comfortable leaving my child with just anyone. A family memeber advised me to call PATCH. The staff was wonderful and friendly. They addressed my concerns and answered all my questions. They printed out a list or shall I say lists of providers in my area. It was comforting to know that these childcare providers were screened and licensed. It made me feel good. I found the perfect childcare provider with the help of PATCH. I always recommend people to PATCH if asked about childcare services.

I was contact by a patch and a mother that has a child with unique learning. Because I am experienced in this field due to two of my adopted sons with this same unique learning PATCH was able to help this mother.

PATCH	87696		/users/profile/98438	joserene	Client Served	5	04/27/2011	PATCH has helped me to finish my college degree while also bringing my family together.  Prior to using PATCH, I had difficulty in finding daycare for my sons.  However, not only did PATCH help with this issue, they were also able to identify potential problems with my sons, which we've been working on together with the school (including the teachers), the therapist, and our case manager.  However, what I am most thankful for is they were able to teach us how to be better parents, and futhermore, they helped us unite our family.  Although we are still working through some issues, my boyfriend and I have learned how to better our children TOGETHER.  Personally, as a mother, I found it difficult to do things with my children; however, with the help of PATCH, I've learned how to be a better mother and primary teacher for my kids.  
PATCH	87695		/users/profile/98437	jengaspar	Client Served	5	04/27/2011	I used PATCH services to find a licensed and reliable child care provider for my infant son. Because I had just recelty moved to Maui, I didn't know many people and didn't know how to begin looking for someone I could trust with the care of my son. PATCH gave me a listing of reputable and licesed providers, and I was able to find the best sitter, one who I will definently use again. Without the listing, I wouldn't have been able to do it. They also provided classes to the child care providers to help them with their licensing.

PATCH	87148		/users/profile/97755	Desiree	General Member of the Public	4	04/26/2011	Thank you to the staff of the Kauai PATCH Office and Dept of Human Services, I am well on my way to opening up my own daycare at home.  Not having a natural sense of business, I called the PATCH office to get more info.  They walked me through the process step-by-step and were encouraging and up-front on how to fulfill the requirements without having to do my own guess work.  They didn't mind answering several questions for the second time or explaining things in different ways so that it was easier for me to understand.  Also, my daughter attends Tutu&Me which is a travelling preschool where caregivers need to attend with the child.  Stephanie from PATCH visited on several occassions to educate the public about services PATCH offers to find qualified and screened caregivers in their area.  PATCH realizes that there are families in need and are always looking for new avenues to reach them to provide help.
PATCH	86542		/users/profile/96926	Faith Rex	Board Member	5	04/20/2011	I've just completed my final year of nine years with the PATCH Board - PATCH staff is incredibly dedicated to helping families in Hawaii find quality childcare.  I first contacted PATCH many years ago to help find care for my then new born son - options were sorely lacking at that time.  That's why when asked to join the PATCH Board I eagerly accepted, to better understand the challenges they face in attracting and training new caregivers & matching families with a caregiver who is right for them.  Every year the number of caregivers and matched families has increased, training options have expanded and children are receiving quality care.  The credit goes to a great staff and an active Board who pitch in to support the PATCH Team.  PATCH will always hold a special place in my heart.
PATCH	86518		/users/profile/96880	Elaine	Professional with expertise in this field	4	04/20/2011	I am also a board member for the last two years, but my relationship with PATCH goes back much further.PATCH on Maui continues to be responsive to community needs and requests for information.  The support of the PATCH staff has been invaluable as we work together as part of a community to increase the quality and amount of early learning opportunities for children.  In my role at University of Hawai'i Maui College, I have been able to partner with PATCH on many things - from providing space for PATCH classes to accessing important, up to date data from PATCH.  PATCH has grown and evolved as a resource and referral, adapting to the times and continuing to stay healthy despite the economic downturn.  
Hawaii Wellness Institute	42511	6	/users/profile/43213	tryfit-girl	Client Served	5	06/01/2010	I met Sunny over 9 years ago. I first saw her as a client receiving counseling and later as a student in her Counselor/Motivational Coaching Training. Her nurturing and straight forward approach gave some real tangible skills to help redirect my energies and help change my life both personally and professionally. Since then she has become a real friend and a valued Mentor.
Hawaii Wellness Institute	42424	6	/users/profile/43138	dawngold	Client Served	5	06/01/2010	Aloha,My first experience with Sunny was when I met her at a Women's Health Expo several years ago.  I was so encouraged by the fact that there was such an organization as HWI!  A few years later, I met Sunny again while she was providing training to a new group of Hospice volunteers which I was with.  Her training and coaching was both amazing and empowering!  Finally, I signed up to take the Certified Wellness Counselor course in 2007.  What a huge asset Sunny's training has been to me!  I use these skills in so many different areas of my life, it is just wonderful!  When I volunteer to provide Reiki services to residents of a nursing home, hospice and rehab center, the CWC way of re-framing, has helped me tremendously to provide my services with extra ease.  I sometimes watch an almost instant transformation and a glimmer of light in other people's eyes as I go through the steps which Sunny taught us help our "clients" to feel empowered.  I even have found these skills to be very helpful when dealing with the general public, whether it be at the grocery store or dealing with a customer service situation at a business.  Of course, my family and friends appreciate the way I have learned how to be a better listener and once again, re-frame as appropriate.In closing, I am very grateful for the extreme dedication and hard work which both Sunny and Roshani have put into this organization.  They are extremely accessible and have always offered to help whenever I have reached out to them.  -Dawn Gold

She seeks to empower women to become the best they can possibly be, with an iron fist encased in a velvet glove.  She cut me no slack, made which is what made her so effective in my life, and helped me to stretch beyond the boundaries I had set for myself to create a new (and greatly expanded) comfort zone.  In short, she moves people to take responsibility for helping themselves.

Surfing The Nations	244875		/users/profile/331909	Invest_in_what_counts	General Member of the Public	5	06/09/2015	This is a really good organization that makes a positive impact on the community where ever they go. I was stationed in Hawaii from about 2006 to 2008 as a military service member and volunteered in leadership in a small local chapter of another nonprofit. I was very thankful to have STN president, Tom Bauer, mentor me in this role. I was never a formal part of STN but I was invited and welcomed into their community events, and personally saw the positive work their were doing their food distribution and youth programs. My experience with the people and organization was one of encouragement, and giving, without taking or asking for anything in return. I'm in a graduate nonprofit management class now and in retrospect I am even more impressed.  Based on their 990 tax forms, and assuming there is no error, they have to be the only nonprofit I have reviewed during this course that does not have paid staff. 
Surfing The Nations	160024	6	/users/profile/212241	Zach K.	Volunteer	5	06/07/2013	I have been living on Oahu for a couple of years. I remember back in 2010 driving up through Wahiawa to the North Shore and noting how absolutely sketch the area was. The particular area was home to a nasty bar, liquor store, X rated picture shop, lady club, and a house of ill repute. Some people might consider that a wonderful example of civilization at its finest, but I personally thought the sight of it all was not cool.  I heard that this group, Surfing the Nations (STN), was going to try to move in and clean everything up. I had heard of plenty of these types of endeavors over the years and did not really think these STN guys had a chance. I left for the war in Afghanistan, and when I came back, my reaction was, what happened to Wahiawa? The place was completely transformed. STN somehow figured out a way to buy up all the nasty businesses and create a nice, regular piece of civilized Hawaii. The local kids were getting free school mentorship and being taught to swim and surf. Plus somebody convinced Walgreens and some other third party players to move in. The place no longer looks like a slum from a Banana Republic with the worlds oldest profession hanging out by the street corner. Upon this revelation, I decided that I was believer in STN. They had done what they set out to do, and it was good. Now, it is only good if you happen to think the idea of the words second oldest profession hanging out on the street corner is bad. Some people might think that the loss of the take-their-clothes-off club, bar, liquor store, etc. is a bad thing. If you are the kind of person who misses the good old days when Wahiawa was known for being a happy place for perverts and drug addicts, by all means, please do not donate to STN. STN will use your money in a creative fashion to continue to ruin your ideal world of child slavery, drug addiction, and alcohol abuse.  Bottom line is that STN is a regular non-profit run by nice people with the intent of helping the community. Helping the community is something that nice people believe very strongly in doing. If you have a problem with the idea of nice people helping their community, please join the communist party USA and do not donate to STN, you have been warned.  While my personal, empirical experience with STN has been positive, some of the reviews on this site would lead one to believe that STN is the second coming of Charles Ponzi. I beg to differ; at least until proven otherwise. I just wish the reviewers: Tadd, ChrisR, and Jacob E, would provide additional information so that their concerns can be taken more seriously.  Here are my responses to each of them. Tadd refers to STN as a scam. This is a very serious legal term that would mean the leadership of STN should be in prison. However, Tadd gives no proof for his serious, reputation-harming charge. If he had something to back up his claim, I would be inclined to believe him, but he does not give any references for farther investigations. As for the licensed teachers thing, I have never heard of a non-profit after school program that requires a licensing procedure. And since a vast number of the volunteers have bachelor degrees (and beyond), I dont see the point. Would you prefer STN to pack up and leave the poor kids with nothing? The Starbucks thing is my favorite, the lame and bizarre attack on the quality of Surfers Coffee Bar did very little to convince me of the complaint that STN is a scam. Please use stronger arguments next time.  ChrisR.  says some intense stuff too. Personally, I dont understand why it is a red flag to have a family highly involved in a cause they believe in. I would agree with him perhaps if he could show me that STN never does anything and the Bauers are making millions, but my own eyes tell me differently. My favorite part of the post is when he says, I could write pages about it but I think my point is made. Your point is not made, and the fact that you could not even provide a link to a Hawaii Star Advertiser story highlighting the abuse (perhaps because there is no such story) just makes you look intellectually retarded. Maybe you are actually Steve Jobs back from the dead and are brilliant; but please, try to back up your massive claims with more than 6 sentences.  Jacob E. actually wrote a review that had some content to it! Not that I agree with the content, but I thank him for at least attempting to make a coherent argument. His basic idea, as I understand it, is that STN is setup for the soul purpose of making money for the Bauers. I have been trying to do the research Jacob recommended (990s, etc.) but have yet to find any of the extreme money making operations he describes. Besides highlighting some of the brilliant (and I think recommendable) financial systems used by STN, he also mentions to following. With Marcus Oshiro sitting on the chair of Finance and Appropriations Commitee, the marriage of State, STNF, and Yamada was in line for the gentrification of Wahiawa, primarily the Ohai district. Oh yes, the conspiracy of gentrification! It is almost like they actually intend to follow through on their plans to improve Wahiawa! We must all start stocking up on liquor and X rated pictures immediately as these do gooders might actually end up doing what they have been saying they plan to do the entire time; make the world a better place. A big thanks to Jacob for agreeing with my central thesis, that STN is an organization dedicated to improving places like Wahiawa.  Bottom line is this is a wonderful organization that is actually, physically, making a difference in Hawaii. Some people dont like positive change, but for the rest of us, STN is an awesome outfit!
Surfing The Nations	157885	9	/users/profile/209392	Jacob E.	Professional with expertise in this field	1	05/14/2013	Chris R  review is an accurate account.  STNF was a family partnership STN Tours and Travels which converted to STNF.  I have met with the State Representative's Office (Marcus Oshiro) and have been told "I am singing to the choir."  Tom Bauer directly lied to me when asked about using a lobbyist to receive state funding; Oshiro's office confirmed STNF (Tom and Cindy Bauer) came into their office with a lobbyist and a big name donor. Do the research.  Read the 990's.  STNF is a marketing machine (social media).  They bought a 12  apartment building.  They receive higher than market value by recruiting Christian students/interns to pay 1300  for a 3 month internship and put them 4 - 6 to an apartment.  Look at their reports, 50% is travel and a big chunk of that is recruitment. Tom and Cindy were booted out of YWAM for years of allegations, took sabbatical on the money of another  of their nonprofits (Hawaii's Kids), and then returned to Hawaii.  Got Grace Chapel and Jimmy Yamada (BIG DONOR and owner of A1 Electric, the biggest electric contractor in Hawaii) and the rest is history.  The state helped them to get the building in Wahiawa.  With Marcus Oshiro sitting on the chair of Finance and Appropriations Commitee, the marriage of State, STNF, and Yamada was in line for the gentrification of Wahiawa, primarily the Ohai district. I reported improprieties in STNF Food Certification and GE License to the appropriate authorities.  ALL monies coming into STNF's businesses were considered DONATIONS and ALL employees are VOLUNTEERS (no taxes or employee responsibilities).  Oshiro's office set themselves up for a win-win.  State gave 150,00 Capital!!! grant.... meaning no responsibility in how they use it.   By giving the money, if someone like me pushed the issue there is a stipulation in the laws to have STNF's books opened.  If STNF was found fraudulent or innocent Oshiro' office wins.  Cindy Bauer told me once that she was concerned about me; I understand now, the crusader gets worn out before the corporation. The majority of positive reviews are written by STAFF or Christian students who are having a great time surfing and feeding the homeless.  STNF is a marketing machine, if you do the research it is easy to see.  STNF is using the YWAM playbook, it is very corrupt here in Hawaii.  Tom and Cindy Bauer position themselves at all important committees and are respected;  the regular person in Wahiawa see the for what they are and smiles when they pick up their free food.  In general, STNF has lost respect in Wahiawa. STNF is a nonprofit to be learned from.  The Perfect Scam.  if you want to learn how to make millions from nothing, study Surfing The Nations.
Surfing The Nations	156982	11	/users/profile/208192	ChrisR.	Professional with expertise in this field	1	05/02/2013	Unfortunately, STN is a horrible non-prof. First, all the board members are family, and this should be a red flag.  They're breaking the law in a multitude of ways and believe because they are serving the Lord its ok.  I was apart of STN for two year, and all those who write positive comments really were keep on the outside and never saw how things were really done.  Working with Non-prof's now I look back and laugh at how horrible STN was.  I believe if you are a Christian and you know of all the horrible things STN does, you can not support their organization.  I could write pages about it but I think my point is made.  
Surfing The Nations	151895	8	/users/profile/202863	TADD	General Member of the Public	1	04/01/2013	ALL REVIEWS WERE WRITTEN BY THE STAFF!!! What a scam! This is supposed to be a church that is how they scored the property.  Same for the coffee equipment they got it for free from Starbucks because they said they needed it for their church, and instead turn around and open a coffee bar.  They have been buying up property in Wahiawa claiming to help the community when really all they are is a youth hostel cheating the system.  They say they are tutoring children in an afterschool program, first of all any licensed Teachers? Any background checks, finger printing done?  They help people from foreign countries get visas and stay in Hawaii to surf.  What good do you think they have done for the community?  Do you really think you should be supporting this business to look into the STN group and history? This non-profit organization has some incriminating history surrounding (Tom and Cindy Bauer). Tom Bauer spends a lot of time in Starbucks, his place must not be so good if even the owner goes somewhere else to drink his coffee.

One of the main reasons I love volunteering here is that its focus is on people, and selfless acts of service. To give whether that be food, hope, love or a smile, is both healthy and fulfilling.

I first volunteered for one of their international humanitarian trips during the summer to Indonesia. I can confidently say that this nonprofit has changed countless numbers of individuals and family lives. The reason I know is because my life has been changed and matured by serving others as a volunteer through STN. Not only do they have traditional ways of helping communities but creative "out of the box" ways like the Annual Freedom Surf Contest which is a drug free awareness event. Stoked on STN.
Surfing The Nations	106988	1	/users/profile/144775	janelle.cadamia	Volunteer	5	02/23/2012	Surfing The Nations is one of the best organizations I have ever been involved with. Their open door, open arms approach to reaching out to the community has taught me how to see the needs of those around me and immediatly and practically meet those needs. I have never seen a community transform as quickly as Wahiawa and feel that it is an honour and a joy to be a part of this transformation.

NA Hoaloha-Maui Interfaith Volunteer Caregivers	131879		/users/profile/177476	michelleonmaui	Volunteer	5	10/31/2012	I started volunteering with Katie in July of 2011.  It started out where I was visiting her and taking her to doctor's appointments and grocery shopping.  Then we were including her in Holiday gatherings as she became a part of our family.    She is such a blessing to me and my family.  She is a very sweet, generous and strong woman.   After being married for 60 years, her husband passed away.  She had no children and her remaining family all lived in Japan.  It's because of Na Hoaloha that someone in this situation would be able to be matched up with a friend.  I really feel God set us this friendship.  I learned a lot from her and am so glad she has been a part of my life!  I wish you all well and thank you for being part of such a great organization.
NA Hoaloha-Maui Interfaith Volunteer Caregivers	122240		/users/profile/166460	faithinaction	Advisor	5	09/12/2012	Na Hoaloha is providing a valuable and needed service in the local communities it serves.  The previous Board of Directors came on simultaneously at a time of crisis and immediately and directly started dealing with all the issues confronting the agency.  They have done a splendid job as is obvious from the progression of the organization and the improvements achieved.  The Board members are to be commended not only for their commitment and dedication, but also for their willingness to act.   As they have now passed the crisis-survival stage, the Board determined it was time to look to the future and develop both intermediate and long term plans and objectives.  Accordingly, a Board retreat/strategic planning session was held.  Issues were recognized, opportunities identified, ideas shared and options discussed. Often, when working with non-profits, we are told that if only they had more money their problems would be solved.  And as we often discover, there may be far greater issues that would still be in place or even exacerbated if they had more money.  However, here this is clearly not the case.  They are being good stewards of their resources, but are in a precarious position unless additional resources are attained. It was a privilege to have had a part in the planning session for the Faith In Action program, and I would like thank the staff and the Board of Directors for their commitment to helping the people of this island, and especially for their kind and gracious welcome to me. Bill NorthcuttFaith-in-Action Strategic Planning Consultant

NA Hoaloha-Maui Interfaith Volunteer Caregivers	120948		/users/profile/164565	MarilynH	Volunteer	5	08/17/2012	I want to share what I consider a very important story about Na Hoaloha and my experience with this GREAT organization.  I quit my job about 5 years ago. I have worked  since I was 16 years old and now I am a senior citizen here on Maui.  Since I had worked all of my life I felt the need to do something besides just sitting home and taking it easy so I checked with Kaunoa RSVP to see what kind of volunteer work was available.  I have always wanted to help others but was too busy with work to do anything.   I met with Gerri Shapiro from Na Hoaloha - Neighbors Helping Neighbors and was happy to find out there was a need.  I have always worked in an office and was good on the phone with people so I started with calling people who were homebound or people who just wanted a friend to talk to.  I have talked with a young man in Lahaina who was disabled and had no family here on Maui.  I talked with an older woman in Haiku who just wanted someone to talk to so she didnt feel lonely.  I talked to a man who lost his wife last year and was feeling down and lonely.  I had so much FUN talking to these people and guess what??  It made me feel better too!  One day as I was talking to Gerri I asked her since I live alone here what would I do if something were ever to happen to me.  She said youll call us and we will help you.  I never forgot that sentence because I knew if I had a problem that I could call Neighbors Helping Neighbors.   I wish that this was the end of the story but........   two months ago I had a horrific car accident.  My car was totaled and so was I.  I had one of my friends call Na Hoaloha to tell them that I could not continue to make my calls because I was in  the hospital without a phone.  They called the man that I was talking to as part of my volunteer work and he came to the hospital to visit ME!  It meant so much to me and showed me what a difference you can make by volunteering. The end of my story shows what good comes from volunteering .  I have been home for a little over a month now (after spending a month in hospitals).  My friends were trying to help me, but I could see that it was becoming too much for them.  So I called Na Hoaloha and asked for help.  I dont know what I would have done without them.  My two volunteers are Irene and Art.  They are wonderful, caring people who have taken me to my doctor appointments (I have had over 20 appointments since I got out of the hospital, and I have many more to come).   All though all 3 of us are disabled, we still help others.  Just putting a smile on someones face is part of volunteering.  I found that out when I spent time at Hale Makua.  There were so many people sitting there all alone and I took the time to stop and talk to them.  I am sure that it helped me to recover faster as it put a smile on my face too.  Thank you Na Hoaloha!

They were very gracious in encouraging and accepting Halloween goody bags from my son's class for the children served by IHS.  Their staff member, Kate Bepko came to the school to personally thank the children and help educate them about IHS and the good they do. They also graciously accepted our donations of candy immediately after Halloween and toiletry items.

I look around and see the homeless population in Hawaii grow every day.  The Institute for Human Resources attacks this problem head one and with compassion.  I've been to their shelters.  I've seen how much they do with the little they have.   It's not much, but I organize an event every five years or so to bring to light what we can do together to give back to the community.  The latest event in 2010 was called "Towels and Toiletries".  It is a hard economy for everyone, but my associates at work were able to collect over a dozen boxes of well needed items on IHS's wish list.  Items we often take for granted.  The event was fun, and it felt good giving.  I chose the Institute for Human Resources as my charity of choice because their help to those in Hawaii that are not as fortunate as me is tangible.    It is the one charity dedicated to helping homeless men, women, many children, and families, keep their hope alive.

IHS' urban farming initiative is especially commendable, as well as the willingness of the staff to work with other organizations all over Hawaii.   Not only does IHS help its guests with temporary housing and assistance, it also offers the local community a change to engage with the people affected by homelessness.  This is so important because it allows everyone to become involved in solving a issue that can be prevented through community effort.  
IHS, The Institute For Human Services, Inc	65769	2	/users/profile/71890	drdonna	Donor	5	02/09/2011	For those unaware of the situation here in Hawai`i homelessness has grown to a problem of epic proportions. The reason we donate to the Institute for Human Services here in Honolulu is that they are not a "warehouse" for the homeless.  Rather, in addition to providing shelter they provide services that help their guests to get back on their feet and into permanent housing.  The Institute also helps persons who are in danger of becoming homeless.  Children receive school supplies and have a place in the center where they can do homework. The center also has grows vegetables to serve to its guests, becoming a part of the green movement here in the Islands.  The programs at IHS not only provide sustenance for their guests, they also provide a model for good citizenship.

I am glad to be part of such a wonderful organization. I see what little resources they have to work with, but they make sure all guests are cared for.
IHS, The Institute For Human Services, Inc	64300		/users/profile/70300	Zarina	General Member of the Public	5	02/07/2011	IHS does so much with so little! It is great to witness how far they can stretch a dollar and still give so much to the community. Not only do they shelter and feed the homeless, but, they also work hard to keep those that are housed from becoming homeless again. Their support also extends to education on how to manage finances and good nutrition. They are also able to harness wide-spread community support for volunteers, they are an invaluable asset to Oahu.
IHS, The Institute For Human Services, Inc	64110		/users/profile/70079	worldpeace	Volunteer	5	02/07/2011	IHS is a spectacular homeless shelter.  Not only does it provide shelter for the homeless, it offers a variety of beneficial programs for the homeless children including Teen Group, Homework Club, and Head Start (a program geared towards toddlers).  These programs really assist the kids at the shelter, as it relieves them of stress from school as well as family.  At programs such as Homework Club, they interact with their fellow peers happily and learn respect, responsibility, and discipline, all the while having fun.  For example, they are expected to complete as much homework as they can during the two hour time frame.  If they do not have homework, they are allowed to do various other activities, such as playing a board game.  As a current tutor at Homework Club, I personally witness the progression of these wonderful kids on a weekly basis.  
IHS, The Institute For Human Services, Inc	63997		/users/profile/69958	makikiresident	Volunteer	5	02/06/2011	In my role as the adviser for a high school club that does community service projects, I have participated (along with the students) in several volunteer workdays at IHS over the past 5-6 years: sorting donated clothes & household items, cleaning, and serving meals.  As the primary homeless shelter in urban Honolulu, IHS provides a critical service to the city's homeless population.  As well as providing bed space in their two shelters (one for men & one for women/families), they provide case management and various types of services to help people get back on their feet.  I love their recent initiative of growing vegetables & fruit trees in all the available bits of land around the edge of the shelter!
IHS, The Institute For Human Services, Inc	63813		/users/profile/69759	Paul Takenaka	Donor	5	02/05/2011	Throughout my life, I have donated to various charities for no particular reason  save for the fact that I had received some form of solicitation.  A number of years ago, I began to pay attention to the plight of the homeless in Hawaii.  The problem is readily apparent.  In looking at the various entities that addressed the issues and problems of the homeless, I found that the name of the Institute for Human Services came up repeatedly.  I looked into its history, its background, and its operations.  Needless to say I was very impressed.  From that point forward, I became a regular donor.  As a recent retiree, I began to take a closs look at my needs and what I could spare.  As a result, I have increased my donations to the IHS because I trully believe in what they are doing and their mission.  As time goes on, I suspect that I will increase my contributions further.

IHS, The Institute For Human Services, Inc	63629	2	/users/profile/69569	pohakuopapa	General Member of the Public	5	02/05/2011	I've experienced the professionalism and friendliness of IHS first hand, although I've never been homeless or worked at IHS.  My first type of experience was in donating food left over from professional meetings or large private events.  When I pull my car up to IHS, one or more clients comes up and politely offers to help me carry in whatever I've brought.  They gently direct me to a parking place and lead me to the donation receipt office.  It's obvious that IHS has inspired good morale and modeled friendliness to engender this kind of response from their clients. The second type of experience was occasioned by my need for a strong person to help with small chores like carrying some heavy buckets down 30 steps to my garage - I'm elderly and not strong enough to do heavy work like that.  It's impossible to find anyone to do brief work like that in the regular labor market.  After a little thought,  I called IHS and was referred to their social worker, who immediately identified a couple of gentlemen who would help me.  I use the term gentlemen accurately.  From the time I picked up my helpers til I dropped them off again, they were considerate, polite and very willing to help.  Of course I paid them generously for their time! The social worker was courteous and immediately understood my problem.   I've repeated this experience a couple of times with the same great service through IHS.   IHS really provides a service to the community in many more ways than one might think! 
IHS, The Institute For Human Services, Inc	63584	1	/users/profile/69523	pbmxo	Volunteer	5	02/04/2011	When our State was in economic trouble and we were furloughed two days a month, I wanted to make the new time I had available count.   At IHS they were receptive to me volunteering in the Family Room as a tutor, but they were also very thorough in checking my background and providing appropriate training before allowing me time with the guests.  I did get assigned to tutoring kids after school but the surprise was how I ended up doing as much or more learning then the kids I was tutoring.   The compassion and professionalism of the staff at IHS is outstanding.  Each day Miss Angela teaches respect by example and breeds confidence and success in the projects she plans for each child.  Her rules create discipline and allow everyone to have fun in the space.  It's easy to see how this program has such a positive effect on its guests.

Hawaii Wildlife Center	143642		/users/profile/190108	Jason U	Board Member	5	11/28/2012	I have been involved with the Hawaii Wildlife Center since 2007 - first as a pro-bono consultant, then as an Advisor and finally serving on the Board of Directors.  I first became involved due to the site of the Hawaii Wildlife Center being located on the former Halaula Sugar Mill and plantation, where my father's family lived and worked.  They attended the adjacent Halaula Elementary School (now called the Kohala Middle School).  However, it took just moments to become affected by Linda Elliot's infectious enthusiasm for her concern for Hawaii's native bird and bat populations.  It was easy to understand what an important function the Center would provide for both crisis and on-going rehabilitative treatments for injured birds.  Beyond the rehabilitation and release efforts for native birds, Hawaii Wildlife Center is a resource for conservation, education and community volunteerism.  Now that the Center is operational, Linda has been able to begin realizing all of those goals and now has a talented staff, a dedicated group of volunteers and Board to support her efforts. HWC and Linda are an inspiration to witness and participate with.  I am excited to be able to part of this journey and look forward to the future.  Jason Umemoto
Hawaii Wildlife Center	134282		/users/profile/180094	LORIN	Volunteer	5	11/06/2012	When I first heard of the creation of the Hawaii Wildlife Center, it immediately jumped to to the top of my list as THE place I wanted to be involved with. Hawaii's extremely unique and threatened native wildlife needs ALL of us to help, in whatever way we can! Having worked in wildlife care at wildlife centers in other states, I've experienced both good and bad wildlife rescue and rehabilitation practices; at Hawaii Wildlife Center, not only is it the top priority of the Director and staff to save and sustain ALL our endangered native wildlife, but they truly appreciate what they're striving for, including anyone who is interested in helping them! I feel extremely privileged to be working with them as a volunteer in wildlife care. Please consider helping in any way you can, too, be it volunteering, donating needed supplies to the Center, planting native trees and plants in your yard, or simply leading the cause by example!

Hawaii Wildlife Center	132878	1	/users/profile/178557	Suzan H.	General Member of the Public	5	11/02/2012	When I lived in Kailua Kona Hawaii I was looking for a place to volunteer.  I found the WIldlife Center and met Linda.  I believe in what they do and am so proud to have been even a little bit of a part of their growth.  I was impressed with LInda and the community and how they pulled together in some of the toughest economic times in a while and were able to get this center up and running!  Hats off to all of the crew!  Not only are they helping the wildlife in Hawaii, but I know that the plants that children planted in the front part of the Center are also native species.  What a way to teach the kids about their native island!  This Center is not only helping the wildlife but also the culture!
Hawaii Wildlife Center	132042		/users/profile/177637	janwiz	Volunteer	5	10/31/2012	The Hawaii Wildlife Center is a stellar effort to further the conservation effort in the islands and the Pacific as a whole, as it's the only center of its kind in the area. Linda's enthusiasm and well thought out efforts have caught hold in the community and not just people; Linda tells me that a pue'o did a careful fly-over inspection and then perched atop a pole to indicate approval. What better stamp of approval can you have? Mahalo Linda! Jan Wizinowich
Hawaii Wildlife Center	131268		/users/profile/176827	Linda130	Board Member	5	10/30/2012	As the HWC Director I am immensely grateful to work with a highly qualified and wonderfully dedicated team working tirelessly to achieve our mission to conserve native Hawaiian wildlife through hands-on rehabilitation, education and research. As president of the HWC board of directors I am also honored to work side by side with the diverse group of board members that are accomplished professionals, compassionate, committed and resourceful supporters of HWC. The journey to realizing the dream of this critical resource for Hawaiis endangered birds and bat has been entirely a community effort and a heartwarming experience. Our enthusiastic volunteers have put forth untold hours and expertise to bring HWC to life. HWC is truly an outcome of Aloha!
Hawaii Wildlife Center	130852		/users/profile/176358	scastioni.bue	Volunteer	5	10/29/2012	I volunteer at the Wildlife Center.  The first time I went, I was given a tour of the facilities.  I am really impressed with this state of the art place.  It is amazing!  I am also glad I have met such dedicated, knowledgeable and friendly staff!  It is very important for Hawaii's future to have a place like this that will protect and preserve Hawaii's native wildlife.

Hawaii Wildlife Center	130038		/users/profile/175485	wruhl	Advisor	5	10/26/2012	Linda Elliott and her crew at the Hawai`i Wildlife Center an amazingly committed group. Linda spent more than 12 years getting this wildlife rehabilitation organization off the ground, then battled through the deepest recession our country has seen since the Great Depression raising money and awareness for the cause of protecting Hawai`i's endangered wildlife and building a state of the art facility to ensure the survival of these endangered species. Hawai`i has more endangered species than the rest of the country combined, and yet Hawai`i used to be the only state that did NOT have such a facility. No longer! Hawai`i's endangered species now have a much better chance of survival, thanks to the HWC. As a volunteer architect, as a donor, as a bird-lover, I feel so blessed to have met Linda and her team, and to have been able to play a role for such a critical cause.

Hawaii Wildlife Center	129908		/users/profile/175342	Jojo G.	Volunteer	5	10/26/2012	From the first day I started volunteering at the Hawaii Wildlife Center, I knew it was a special place. The energy in the garden is not unlike the feeling of being in Waipio, of returning home. The more time I spend here, the more I believe that the Hawaii Wildlife Center was destined to be. The proof of that can be seen by the continuous support from the community, to the efforts and backing from the other Hawaiian Islands and beyond. This place has a natural healing vitality and I feel so privileged to be a part of it. I am fortunate to be here at this time, as the facility is opening and growing in all directions. From the education side that offers children and adults a unique look into how life evolves and how our actions can affect the environment and the wildlife within it, to the opportunity to research our findings and most importantly to rescue and rehabilitate the sick and injured native species found in this part of the world. Linda Elliotts vision truly is inspirational and an important part of the history and culture of Hawaii. Lets keep it alive, lets help it thrive! 
Hawaii Wildlife Center	129797		/users/profile/175208	VickyK	Volunteer	5	10/26/2012	A need for Hawaii & one person's passion have been realized in the dream facility that is the Hawaii Wildlife Center. With the dubious distinction as the "endangered species capital of the world," Linda Elliott has provided a ray of hope for Hawaii's wildlife through the Hawaii Wildlife Center.  Many have contributed to the dream but the vision Linda has had from day one has never wavered. The combination of state-of-the-art rescue and rehabilitation facilities along with education and cultural awareness from vegetation to  the building's design make for a Center for which all Hawaii - and the world - can be proud. Mahalo to Linda for her tenacity, to her board of directors for the their support and to her team at the HWC for providing hope for our children's future....and for Hawaii's wildlife!
Hawaii Wildlife Center	129795	1	/users/profile/175206	Katherine G.	Advisor	5	10/26/2012	The Hawaii Wildlife Center has done everything right .  Through a variety of fundraising efforts they have built a state of the art facility for native birds, they have involved the community and its native culture from day one, they have not only focused on the much needed rehabilitation aspect of the mission (prior to the Hawaii Wildlife Center being built there was not a facility in the entire State of Hawaii that could take in the number of birds for rehabilitation in the event of a disaster such as an oil spill), but they have integrated education into the center, which is conveniently located behind the middle school in this rural island community.  The Hawaii Wildlife Center has the capacity to build and shape a new generation of biologists and naturalists.  It is not only a haven for wildlife, it is a much needed opportunity in this community, and the State, for children to experience and be a part of real science at work.

The care and dedication shown by the staff is an incredible model for the youth of Kohala and those who will visit from afar.  The grounds are filled with Native Hawaiian plants, and the facility if filled with aloha for the creatures who populate these beautiful islands.  Director and founder Linda Elliot is a leader with true passion and deep knowledge.  Her consistent perseverance, along with the help of her Board and many volunteers, has been responsible for developing this much needed facility that will serve all of the Pacific come true.  
Hawaii Wildlife Center	129446		/users/profile/174814	Cara G.	Volunteer	5	10/25/2012	Hawaii is a unique place and there are many things we take for granted as part of history and culture.  The work that the Hawaii Wildlife Center does helps preserve today what we can share with generations to come.  The Hawaii Wildlife Center is a state of the art native wildlife recover facility that restores Hawaii's indigenous birds and bats and returns them to the wild so they can prosper.  Each employee at the Center has a passion for what they do.  Also what makes the facility and the work that they do even more special, is that they also give back to the community, they support other organizations, and teach students about Hawaii wildife to the young and old so they may learn the value of what the Hawaii Wildlife Center is all about.
Na Kama Kai	214168		/users/profile/277412	StephEsp	Client Served	5	09/09/2014	We children and I absolutely love attending the Na Kama Kai ocean clinics.  We haven't gone in a while though because our schedules are extremely busy but look forward to going back sometime soon.  We went to our first clinic in January 2011.  My daughter was 10 and my twin boys were 4.  Prior to this day, my boys didn't really enjoy going in the ocean.  I'm not entirely sure why, I think they were just scared of the waves or something.  But I have to say, they really loved their first time out.  It was their first time paddle boarding and it was such a great experience!  For all of them!  After this first time they would ask when they could go back.  So from then we have been back quite a few more times.  My daughter also enjoyed her first time surfing out in Kahana Bay in September 2012.  She was so determined to successfully stand up at least once.  And after several tries, she finally did it.  Then she decided to ask for a surf board.  Thank you so much, Na Kama Kai, for the wonderful opportunities for my kids.  We truly appreciate you all and this program!

Na Kama Kai	131313		/users/profile/176874	Raquel T.	Client Served	5	10/30/2012	This is an amazing organization that takes kids from every walk of life and teaches them not just about the waves but gives them a deeper understanding and respect for the ocean, it's ecology, their safety and the culture that surrounds them.  I've watched my son grow confident and brave just by spending a couple of hours with these volunteers.   There is no other program around that can do or teach a child as much as Na Kama Kai does in such a short amount of time.  
Na Kama Kai	128241		/users/profile/173380	Layla D.	Board Member	5	10/24/2012	We have been associated with Na Kama Kai from the very beginning and are glad to have done so. It is doing great things for our local keiki and our ocean. Imua Na Kama Kai!
Na Kama Kai	127688		/users/profile/172783	Vickie N.	Client Served	5	10/22/2012	This organization provides an amazing opportunity for children to both learn the joys and the responsibility involved with caring for the ocean. The education is provided in a fun and culturally significant way, which teaches the children of Hawai'i - and those visiting - how to appreciate the ocean and how to enjoy it safely. I cannot rave enough about the volunteers that put this project together, and how that ohana became a part of mine. 
Na Kama Kai	127685		/users/profile/172778	Joshua9	Client Served	5	10/22/2012	I've taken my two sons to two events held by Na Kama Kai this year.  Each time the boys came away very happy and excited.  I normally take my kids out on canoes and surfboards myself, but this provides me with a way to get both of them out at the same time and also to learn a little more.  We'll be attending future events as well and would encourage more people to bring their kids down.  This is especially good for those of us who want to take their kids out but just don't seem to have the time nowadays.  Mahalo Na Kama Kai for all you do!  Aloha!

They got a lot of hands on experience sanding down a papa he'e nalu (surfboard) the traditional way, catching waves on a SUP, and riding for the first time in an outrigger canoe.  So much fun for everyone!  Na Kama Kai is lucky to have so many great volunteers teach the keiki their love of the ocean and to be responsible stewards our oceans.

Na Kama Kai	127441		/users/profile/172502	Bud A.	Board Member	5	10/20/2012	While serving on the Board of Directors of Na Kama Kai for the last 3 years I have received tremendous satisfaction in knowing that we are having a positive influence on the lives of youth in the state of Hawaii.  Na Kama Kais mission is to empower youth by creating, conducting and supporting ocean-based programs, specifically targeting ocean safety and conservation awareness in order to increase the capacity of youth in the community through Hawaiian values, culture and environmental education.Na Kama Kai guides youth to become safe, responsible participants in recreational ocean activities and helps them fully appreciate and understand the importance of the ocean as part of our natural world.   In essence they become ocean intelligent.  Such learning occurs through guidance and experience in a nurturing environment where keiki (youth) learn how to be safe in the marine environment, grow physically and emotionally through interaction with the ocean, develop an overall respect for nature using the ocean as a connecting force to all living things, and learn that it is their responsibility to provide the stewardship needed to conserve our ocean recourses for future generations. To date, close to 4,000 keiki have participated in our free clinics. Our success is based entirely on the dedication and commitment of volunteers. These talented volunteers experience tremendous fulfillment as they empower the keiki to practice ocean safety and conservation. Such awareness saves lives and leads to stronger stewardship of our fragile island environment.
Na Kama Kai	126718		/users/profile/171719	CarolG	Board Member	5	10/17/2012	I have been on the Board of Directors for Na Kama Kai for over a year, and within that time I have seen positive growth for both our keiki and efforts towards teaching stewardship to our community.  The benefits for all that have experienced the clinics, whether as a participant, volunteer, or a parent,  have been enriched by the positive message delivered.  The smiles from the keiki having their first experience of being in and on the ocean has given them the confidence needed to reach beyond their comfort zones and try something new.  In many ways Na Kama Kai has empowered so many, in so many different ways.  Mahalo to good people that make Na Kama Kai happened each month. 
Na Kama Kai	126024		/users/profile/171137	skkm	Board Member	5	10/16/2012	N Kama Kai (Children of the Sea) is an excellent organization that shares its passion of the ocean with all children (young and old).  Not only has N Kama Kai made a positive  impact to the children but also to the volunteers that have the wonderful opportunity to work individually with each child.  Through generous volunteers, donations, and sponsors, N Kama Kai has been able to provide free monthly ocean clinics around the entire island of Oahu and has even made special trips elsewhere.  I  joined N Kama Kai, first as a volunteer then as a Board Member, because I strongly believe in this organization and its mission of "empowering youth by ...specifically targeting ocean safety and conservation awareness to increase the capacity of the youth..."

The volunteers of Na Kama Kai are down to earth and focused on the keiki, and make the organization what it is: a grass roots effort to teach ocean skills, Hawaiian culture and values, and share love for our keiki and ocean.

Ho ola Na Pua	202023	4	/users/profile/263650	jody.allione	Board Member	5	06/06/2014	The development of this organization has been amazing. The dedicated professionals involved have created awareness of the depth of sex trafficking on many levels of the community to thousands of people. The core goal to build a  home to restore the lives of the domestic minor survivors of this crime has raised a response from people who want to support this effort in many ways. The work ahead is daunting and this has energized many talented professionals who want to be a part of this huge effort. Three years ago I didn't even know sex trafficking of minors was an issue in Honolulu. Now I am aware and determined to be a part of doing whatever I can to change this issue in our state. 
Ho ola Na Pua	201976	6	/users/profile/263578	AlohaGirl24	Volunteer	5	06/05/2014	Ho'ola Na Pua is an organization that has the complete vision of what is need to rescue underage girls from sex trafficking as well as what needs to be done to prevent it & stop it from continuing. The heart of the organization is amazing. The volunteers are completely selfless & are working night & day to educate, rescue, restore, legislate & research this issue. I highly recommend getting involved with this organization. Whether its donating, fundraising, event planning, educating, administrative work, marketing, etc. - whatever your skill set is, Ho'ola Na Pua can use your help. Knowing you did something that rescued someone's life or prevented someone from being dragged into the unthinkable lifestyle is so rewarding...it truly is PRICELESS!
Ho ola Na Pua	201714	6	/users/profile/263218	Candice G.	Volunteer	5	06/02/2014	Think the world of these volunteers and what Ho'ola Na Pua is doing in the community! They are amazing to work with. Their aim to fight sex trafficking through education and awareness, rescue and restore victims, decrease demand, and work with legislation to improve laws is a huge undertaking. I believe they do a fabulous job and would recommend them to anyone!
Ho ola Na Pua	201681	4	/users/profile/263178	tamzpua14	Volunteer	5	06/02/2014	Bringing awareness to a community is not an easy task for such a subject and domestic minor sex trafficking ~ this organization brings awareness and them some.... how can a community make a difference it takes one volunteer at a time and collectively the changes will be life changing for that one girl who is restored.  
Ho ola Na Pua	201625	3	/users/profile/263112	drexchawaii	Volunteer	5	06/02/2014	Such an amazing group of dedicated volunteers working towards a very noble cause. Ho'ola Na Pua not only aims to rescue and restore victims of sex trafficking, but raises awareness of the reality of sex trafficking through educational and awareness programs in our local community.
Keiki Kokua, Inc.	88151		/users/profile/99025	edmaryLee Greenlee	Volunteer	5	04/30/2011	My journey with Keiki Kokua began as a volunteer at their thrift store. Now, several years later I am a member of their Board of Directors. And, I must say I have never met a more dedicated  group of people working together to insure a brighter future for Maui's foster, adopted, kinshipship and or guardianship children. 
Keiki Kokua, Inc.	88074		/users/profile/98919	WongFamily	Client Served	5	04/29/2011	Keiki Kokua has helped our family in numerous ways over the years.   Their knowledge and experience in working with foster and adopted families is invaluable.  They have helped us through challenging times with their experience of working with other families in similar situations.  We are so thankful for Keiki Kokua.  Our family wouldn't be what it is today without them.   
Keiki Kokua, Inc.	87948		/users/profile/98767	melissa4peace	Volunteer	5	04/29/2011	I am a previous Foster Parent Recruiter from California and have recently started volunteering with Keiki Kokua, Inc. Thrift Store.  This establishment is not only raising money for the children that need it most, it is also spreading the word about the need for Foster/Adoptive parents on the Island of Maui. It is also educating the public on the need for services for children and families who have been through the the foster care system.  While volunteering, I have been able to talk with Jim and Alda (who run the thrift store).  They have been Foster/Adoptive parents and advocates for children and families for several years. They have huge hearts and only want what is BEST for the children!  I am so pleased to see how many people donate to the store and can't wait to see it expand and grow, also expanding knowledge about the foster care system and how community members can help! 
Keiki Kokua, Inc.	87945		/users/profile/98763	robbie	Client Served	5	04/29/2011	My husband and I recently got licensed for foster care. In March we got a call to care for a 4 year old that needed everything. We needed a car seat right away  so of course I called Keiki Kokua thrift store and spoke with Alda .She had one there and said she would hold it for me. I couldn't make it to the store that day so she brought it home for me to pick up later.WoW ! We also needed bike helmet which I found a week later. And to top it off a nice crisp Easter Shirt. We also received a store discount as foster parents. When the children have a need Keiki Kokua was there for me.
Keiki Kokua, Inc.	87843		/users/profile/98638	kalemo	Volunteer	5	04/28/2011	Shortly after becoming a volunteer at Keiki Kokua Thrift Store, their annual August Beach Party was held. Do you have any great memories of your childhood? Many foster children on Maui might not have any if it was not for the good works of Keiki Kokua, Inc.  The horse, the games, the clown, the pizza. Da beach. These kids can treasure these memories for the rest of their lives. I know I will.
Keiki Kokua, Inc.	87742		/users/profile/98498	MauiJim	Board Member	5	04/28/2011	Foster families have little support from state and federal agencies. Keiki Kokua fills this gap, helping Maui's children most in need. Being a foster parent myself, I have personally benefited from the programs Keiki Kokua runs.
Keiki Kokua, Inc.	87710		/users/profile/98454	Lauri	Volunteer	4	04/27/2011	 On Maui programs and services are a big help to the public as a whole. The services that Keiki Kokua brings are outstanding. Scholarship for youth for educational purposes is very rare on Maui and Keiki Kokua is heading the field in that department, they are wanting to expand its reach.. The services are donations by the local community through a variety of ways. Opening a Thrift Store was a good call that serves the community and a method of providing that very important funding. I wish the Charity a successful 
Keiki Kokua, Inc.	87674		/users/profile/98411	Donna	Advisor	5	04/27/2011	Kids what do they know? They know love, they also know sadness, sorrow, they want to play have fun go home, get a big hug. What do they know, well they know when they are not wanted, getting made to move from 1 place to another, no friends, strange places.What Keiki Kokua's objective is to provide the tools and the means for a child to be adopted and become part of that family. Families that are seeking to adopt a child get the best information and guided in a professional way to achieve their objective. We need this on Maui and the other Islands.
Keiki Kokua, Inc.	87648		/users/profile/98384	Craig	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/27/2011	Having been up close and personal with the local children and young adults of Maui, I am shocked at the sheer amount that has no or little support or parental care. Keiki Kokua goals are to make it easier for fortunate families to adopt these kids and thus the kids have a chance at succeeding in life as we had. Look at the potential couples who can't have kids or the lucky parents that have the finance and heart to adopt a child and give them love , support, a home, a start, a chance to succeed in life. Keiki Kokua's support and programs make this possible  "Good Job".
Keiki Kokua, Inc.	86436		/users/profile/96754	Arthur	Donor	5	04/19/2011	I've donated to Keiki Kokua for past four years.  With their help we started a scholarship program for Maui High School graduates who have been either foster children adopted or in legal guardianship or raised by grandparents or relatives. This year Keiki Kokua will award three $1,000. and as of June 2011 Keiki Kokua will have awarded thirteen $1,000 scholarships.   Most recipients are going to school and working at the same time.  A number have graduated and gone on to four year colleges. It's been a pleasure meeting, mentoring and helping these very special and deserving youth.   Alda and Jim St. James should be heralded for all their loving and patient effort in enriching the lives of foster children on our fortunate island.    
Keiki Kokua, Inc.	85619		/users/profile/95581	Mauigal98	General Member of the Public	5	04/13/2011	Keiki Kokua helps foster and adoptive children and their parents. They have been a non-profit organzation for about 5 years, and when the recession began, they decided to open a thrift shop to raise money for continued support of Maui's foster and adoptive children. The store is an enormous winner, that has found wonderful donors, and awesome customers too. It is run with employees and volunteers. The store has just about anything you need, and the prices are very reasonable. Everyone in the store is extremely helpful and courteous. They have just celebrated their 2nd anniversary in Feb., and customers constantly tell us that they'd be so disappointed if we ever left the existing location in the Haiku Marketplace. It's a must visit store, if you have not experienced it's friendly, clean interior, and happy employees and volunteers. Thank you!
Gentle World Inc	134823		/users/profile/180667	Michael130	Volunteer	5	11/07/2012	Everyone there is a pioneer of ethical, compassionate, healthy living, and I continue to reflect upon what I experienced during my stay.  As soon as I arrived, I was met with love, patience, and acceptance; and the learning started immediately.  While I had stopped using animal products for some time prior to my trip, I didn't fully understand the role and virtue of veganism until I went to Gentle World. The food was delicious, the people were great, and the work on the farm was intensely satisfying; and I also enjoyed doing my "cheers," a word they use instead of "chores." Maybe the best way to sum this review up is that I hope to go back as soon as possible!
Gentle World Inc	134033		/users/profile/179802	aikido1986	Volunteer	5	11/06/2012	The 3 weeks I spent at Gentle World changed my life forever! It was the first time I felt so much honesty and connectedness in a group of people working towards a common goal. After one week of staying there I adopted a vegan lifestyle which for me until today, is the most profound transformation I ever allowed my self to experience! A blessing for my life and the entire creation! Thanks so much to you dear people at Gentle World! You make a big difference in many lives!
Gentle World Inc	133661		/users/profile/179405	Dan C	Donor	5	11/05/2012	Gentle World distinguishes itself from other nonprofits promoting nonviolence by focusing on veganism as an essential and integral part of avoiding unnecessary violence in our lives.  First and most importantly, veganism avoids unnecessary exploitation and violence inflicted on innocent nonhuman animals.  Secondarily, a plants-only diet (i.e. the dietary component of veganism) has far reaching effects in sustainability and reducing our ecological footprint by reducing consumption, waste, and pollution.  A plants-only diet also solves the most widespread health problems facing large, affluent human populations, including heart disease, high blood pressure, strokes, cancer, diabetes, and many other diet-related diseases. Gentle World engages in vegan education -- online, through  multi-day, overnight education programs, and through special events -- to inform and inspire people from all over the world about the many diverse benefits of veganism touched on above, as well as how to go about adopting vegan attitudes and living, from the big picture of a philosophical paradigm of avoiding unnecessary violence in our lives, to the small details of label reading and delicious animal-product-free recipes for traditional favorites such as lasagna. After over nine years of experience in exploring many nonprofit organizations dedicated to reducing unnecessary violence toward both human and other animals, I am convinced that Gentle World is one of the most, if not the most, undervalued nonprofit organizations in existence today.
Gentle World Inc	133585		/users/profile/139696	Jim_5	Volunteer	5	11/05/2012	Gentle World open hearts and minds to what is possible. Compassion, sustainability and health are at the core of this group. They offered me many opportunities to do outreach for myself and with them. They are an inspirational and dedicated group to making this world a better place for every being.
Gentle World Inc	132962		/users/profile/178652	BenDaisy	Donor	5	11/03/2012	When I first went to Gentle World I wasn't entirely sure what to expect.  What I found there was a group of people dedicated to living a compassionate life and to teaching others about it.  Though I can be an introverted guy at times, I found myself wanting to spend every possible moment that I could with these remarkable and inspiring people.  They will always hold a dear place in my heart.  The dreamer in me hopes that more individuals like them are growing every day.  They are a blessing to this world and to all those they meet. 
Gentle World Inc	132934		/users/profile/178619	karunaveg	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/02/2012	I've been impressed and inspired by Gentle World's valiant efforts to spread the vegan message for many years. I have found the articles on the Gentle World website to be consistently  excellent in terms of both creativity and skill in articulation, as well as passion in articulating the ideas that i feel are the most important for people to be considering today. I especially appreciate Gentle World's consistent insistence on liberation for all nonhuman animals, as well as their awareness of the spiritual, cultural, and psychological dimensions of the issues. Besides their website, Gentle World does hands on outreach and activism, and also works as a living/learning/education center to demonstrate the viability of vegan community in our world today. They've also published a terrific vegan cookbook and other materials to help spread the vegan message, and thus to me stand out as one of the most benevolent, insightful, helpful non-profit organizations.
Gentle World Inc	132901		/users/profile/178581	Alice T.	General Member of the Public	5	11/02/2012	Finding Gentle World's website was a revelation to me and continues to inspire me to continue my quest to help others to follow the path of respect for our fellow creatures and our planet. To know there is a working environment that is sustainable with no use of animal products is important to the world at large, to teach the students that are involved with it as well as to prove it is possible in a society that might say it is not. Gentle World is a shining example that is a comfort and an inspiration to all that hope to create a better future for ourselves, the planet and all its creatures. 
Gentle World Inc	132890		/users/profile/178569	Darley	Donor	5	11/02/2012	Over the years I have contributed to animal rights and animal welfare organizations, but since discovering Gentle World two years ago, it has become my favorite foundation. The main reason is that the members of this community live the lifestyle that they teach. And they welcome everyone to come and learn firsthand what they have learned from decades of experience about creating a harmonious world for all sentient beings.
Gentle World Inc	132567		/users/profile/178210	robin and austin	Volunteer	5	11/02/2012	My grandson and I were so inspired and encouraged by this organization and the community members. We viewed a powerful film called Earthlings that we would recommend to any one who is searching for the truth about how the commercial animal businesses are processing our fellow beings. We volunteered at the community in Hawaii where we where treated in a fair and supportive way. The food was tasty and the accommodations where clean and beautiful.  I would recommend this organization to anyone who is open to learning by immersion about eating ethically and for well being.  We hope to return to this lovely place where we met new friends!
Gentle World Inc	125461		/users/profile/150548	angelflinn	Volunteer	5	10/15/2012	I began volunteering for Gentle World in 2000. Since then, I have become so inspired by this organization's mission that I have made it my life's work. I am now Gentle World's Director of Outreach, and I am excited to see what we will be able to achieve in the years to come. I encourage all those who are passionate about building a more peaceful world to get in touch and volunteer your time. You won't be sorry!
Gentle World Inc	123603		/users/profile/168286	BellaFortuna	Volunteer	5	09/27/2012	Gentle World is unlike any non-profit that I had volunteered for before.  Two years ago I joined the crew to help for three weeks and I loved it so much I'm still volunteering for them today. My experience with Gentle World was and continues to be truely life changing. 
Islands Society	222901	2	/users/profile/286649	BenMann,	Volunteer	5	10/15/2014	The Pacific Islands Society is doing some incredible work- in particular the speaking series and events promoting global dialogue on international security issues in the Pacific Islands Region is of paramount importance. In addition, the work supporting young artists in the region is truly brilliant, and a testament to the vision of the PIS. I am extremely inspired by the work in supporting young professionals to become leaders on a wide range of important policy issues as this is at the heart of not just a more positive and equitable future for the Pacific Islands Region, but part of a whole new development paradigm and vision for a more prosperous world. Thank you for all your brilliant work!
Islands Society	231611		/users/profile/295185	masaono2009	General Member of the Public	4	10/31/2014	The Pacific Islands Society is  a young but very active organization to promote awareness and discussions on various issues surrounding the countries in the region and also promoting human resources development. It provides readers/members with opportunity to have active discussions/debates globally. I congratulate the funder, the board members, staff and readers to keeo the society active.
Islands Society	229815		/users/profile/293462	VainiTekiTeki	General Member of the Public	5	10/29/2014	Pacific Islands Society, since inception, has branched into an informative and interactive  organization.  Covering a plethora of engagements  beginning with the Ambassador speech series, then the Security Scholars Programme to the  brilliant interviews, just to list a few, it brings to the fore intellectually stimulating perspectives and discussions  that  cover the Pacific region  and for good reasons.  As a  Pacific Islander, I am promoted to be more aware of the issues affecting the region and to critically think of  the future of my children  and the next generation and how to best protect their environment , livelihood and  security - Thanks to Pacific Islands Society. Keep  up the great job!
Islands Society	225888	1	/users/profile/289640	bagoduwahine	General Member of the Public	5	10/23/2014	Pacific Islands Society is  an exceptional organisation. It informs and empowers us to be aware of events and decisions that affects our beautiful islands and its beautiful people. Thank you for keeping us abreast on issues that affect our nations. Keep up the awesome work!!
Islands Society	225285	2	/users/profile/289059	MaeekSea	General Member of the Public	5	10/23/2014	Much of my interaction with the Pacific Islands Society has stemmed from working with students interested in the issues facing the Pacific region today. An educator based in the Middle East, it has been a great pleasure working with PacSoc in assisting student participation in Pacific affairs. With this organization, my students have learned about policy issues that include climate change, disarmament, public health, food security, education and technology. PacSoc has helped give these passionate students an avenue for pursuing their endeavors both in collaboration with their schooling and outside any formal education. 
Islands Society	222894	1	/users/profile/286644	claudiagigliok	General Member of the Public	5	10/15/2014	As young Papua New GuInean and Japanese, I have found the Pacific Islands Society to have been incredibly helping in educating and creating discourse in and amongst Pacific Islanders both at home and abroad. As well as creating a platform on which pacific voices and issues can be heard and discussed locally PACSOC has enabled and created an international space in which dialogue is enabled amongst individuals both from the pacific regions and abroad. PACSOC represents and symbolizes the exciting new developments and changes of motivated and passionate individuals who share a common interest and passion for the pacfic region. It is both educative and creates and facilitates opportunities to individuals in the pacific to engage with interests and ideas that educate both the international community as well as having a local impact that benefits the pacific community. PACSOC is a much needed platform and I congrarulate them for the incredible achievements they have achieved so far since it's formation and can only see the organization doing more in having a wider and greater impact that promotes and benefits the people of the pacific and the global community. 
Islands Society	222619		/users/profile/286355	ManuelVarela	Volunteer	5	10/14/2014	Sorry for my problems to write in english... i prefer to do it in spanish as Its my language.Siendo de Uruguay, America del Sur, es difcil tener conocimiento sobre las injusticias y daos irreparables a la tierra y a la vida que ocurren al otro lado del mundo.Viajando por el mundo conoc varias personas provenientes de Pacific Islands que me contaron sobre lo que suceda en esa zona del planeta... De vuelta en mi pas deje de tener noticias sobre el tema,  hasta que por medio de  este grupo PacSoc las noticias volvieron a ser fluidas y la campaa que estan llevando a cabo estas personas para que el mundo sepa que sucede en de Pacific islands.El trabajo que esta haciendo este grupo por la comunidad local es admirable.
Islands Society	221557	1	/users/profile/285245	ekrivanek	General Member of the Public	5	10/10/2014	As an Australian the welfare of the Pacific Islands features prominently in my mind. As a student of Philosophy, and an educator, the future of this region seems to me both fraught with danger and with promise. My firsthand experience with the people at the head of PacSoc has offered me hope that there are dedicated, passionate, and most importantly, honest and honourable individuals working to provide opportunities that will aid the people of the Pacific Islands to realise more of that promise.Having had the virtual galleries project, which helps Pacific Island art achieve broader recognition, outlined to me firsthand by Director of Development Keiko Ono I am convinced that Pacific Island artists are now, thanks to this initiative, capable of connecting with global audiences in a way that was before difficult and obscure. I encourage you those of you who have an interest in education, artistic practise, and the Pacifc Islands themselves, to find out, as I have, what you can do to assist this worthy organisation.
Islands Society	193369		/users/profile/252556	misima	Board Member	5	01/28/2014	Having been a part of the Pacific Islands Society for the past year as a participant in the Pacific Young Leaders program, my involvement in the organisation has grown alongside the impact it has created within and beyond the Pacific Island Community. The organisation provides a much needed platform for intellectual exchange, discussion and innovative thinking on a wide range of issues affecting the Pacific Islanders and the world at large. The Pacific Islands Society has gone from strength to strength as the sole organisation to focus on providing a PICs perspective on global issues - a much needed voice to compliment representatives working in the international fora. Given PacSoc's broad and active group of participants within the diplomatic community and PIC diaspora and its recent registration as an official non-profit organisation, the New Year can only bring greater opportunities and achievements for the PacSoc community!
Islands Society	193234		/users/profile/252405	alohamahalo	Board Member	5	01/28/2014	The Pacific Islands Society has truly established itself as one of the most influential nonprofits in the Pacific Islands region. The organization's pursuit of a world that respects, inspires, and empowers Pacific Islanders is both important and necessary for our collective future. And, its programs are already helping to turn that vision into reality. By providing Pacific Islanders with the knowledge, networks, platforms, and exposure necessary to realize their full potential, the organization is seeking to eliminate all barriers that undermine the security, equality, and cultural integrity of Pacific Islanders in the international community.

Islands Society	193233		/users/profile/252402	cporotesano	Client Served	5	01/28/2014	I'm a participant in the Pacific Young Leaders on Disarmament program. When it comes to Asia-Pacific issues in general, the region is very diverse and so oftentimes the voices of smaller island countries aren't heard as loudly and especially those of the youth. The program does an excellent job of providing a platform for the Pacific Island youths like myself. I could not have published a blog article on a divisive issue facing the Conference on Disarmament (CD) and written a statement to the CD --outlining the concerns of Pacific Islanders-- without the guidance and networking the program provided. Through PacSoc, I have access to  disarmament experts and diplomats, whom I am able to ask for interviews and direct mentorship. PacSoc also tries to create spaces for my classmates and me to have discussion despite our distant time zones. :)  
Five Mountains Hawaii Inc	136741		/users/profile/182677	liverichlyhawaii	Volunteer	5	11/10/2012	I really can not say enough great things about this organization.  We were brought to Five Mountains Hawaii (FMH) by our involvement in Kohala Coalition Against Drugs.  We found their program North Hawaii Drug Free Coalition (NHDFC).  We quickly became part of that leadership team and the ball has just continued to roll forward. I have been blessed to attend training at CADCA in Washington DC. NHDFC has supported our efforts in our non profit, Roots Advocates For Youth, as a positive youth engagement activity to help keep youth involved and healthy.  I was blessed to get training as a mentor through Five Mountains for another project of theirs, Life Plan.  I was able to volunteer for a school year and see one entire 8th Grade Class go through this program.  To see and hear what this program has sparked in these youth has made it a complete success story for me.  The icing on the cake for me is how FMH supports volunteers in building personal leadership/capacity skills. FMH investment in my personal training received through FMH for my current training in Nonprofit Management course I will be able to not only take with me but have skills for my future and potential job opportunities. I have huge hopes and wishes that FMH will be around for years to come. My experiences with this nonprofit I will always hold dear and forever be grateful. Sincerely, Kimberly Lepold, Roots Advocates For Youth, a 501 c(3)

It strengthened no only my health but also my ties to the community which ultimately serves to improve a sense of well-being. I also volunteered to help compile the program materials and present a healthy food recipe at one event. Congratulations to Robin and all who made this program come together
Five Mountains Hawaii Inc	92539		/users/profile/106188	jkooler	Volunteer	5	06/28/2011	Amazing outreach to provide young people the Lifeplan experience.  Five Mountains has taken on the leadership role in connecting young people to a process to design their future.   They have provided the infrastructure to support training adults to work with young people in Lifeplan.  They have helped create the first Lifeplan Institute in a local area.  It is a pleasure to work with a great organization like 5 Mountains.
Five Mountains Hawaii Inc	92323		/users/profile/105922	Roots S.

We present NHDFC with information and data concerning youth trends and encourage the involvement of FMH to support and fund youth specific facilities to empower children.
Five Mountains Hawaii Inc	91983		/users/profile/105374	BIgirl	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/24/2011	I have seen the positive impacts of Five Mountains Hawaii throughout my community. Some of our worst local health issues are confronted by Five Mountains programs that offering proactive, preventative solutions.  What inspires me the most is that way that so many Five Mountains programs directly empower other organizations and grass roots groups to reach and engage individuals. 
Five Mountains Hawaii Inc	91914		/users/profile/105294	kathiepomeory	Volunteer	4	06/24/2011	Excellent upgrade of Take it off HI organization, using tech. Lifeplan addresses the economic base of poor community health - smart!

Having seen each and every 8th grader in our community go through this program has totally inspired me! I can see how this program... and all the program can literally CHANGE OUR YOUTH and their futures. In 4 years, those 8th graders will be Seniors... and hopefully, every kid in the entire high school will have gone through this program. I expect to see HUGE change in the DREAMS... PLANS... and PURPOSES of this upcoming generation in our community... and more importantly... IN OUR WORLD! I believe I have had a part in training LEADERS! I am so privileged! 
Five Mountains Hawaii Inc	91902		/users/profile/105278	Dennis M.	General Member of the Public	3	06/23/2011	I recently attended the N. Hawaii Drug Free Coalition meeting in Kohala.  I have attended a few meetings in the past and it seems that we still have committed people in our communities who care to put some time into solving this problem. As in the past the meeting was a review of individual problems and no real solutions. I feel that our communities are more aware of the problem, which makes it easier for families with abusers better equiped to cope with their problems. I feel that it still takes more education for both sides of the drug problem, both the abusers and their families and communities which they effect.   So I feel we need more education, and more ENFORCEMENT!  We need a constant flow of events which, number one get the families out and having fun, and also give our educators and social services groups the opportunity to show case themselves and hopefully help someone.  Again we have to provide more healthy alternatives for our communities and show them that there are better ways to spend their free time. Thanks for your efforts in trying to make Hawaii a healthier place.
Five Mountains Hawaii Inc	91901		/users/profile/105277	Avab	Volunteer	4	06/23/2011	At a time in my life when I needed something constructive to do, I decided to volunteer some time to Five Mountains Hawaii. I was respected for my skills and for my time. In time, I participated in some of the programs offered by Five Mountains. I was a team leader and organizer of Take It Off Hawaii, I am a certified trainer in the Life Plan, and I have helped organize many meetings and trainings.I have seen every program Five Mountains Hawaii offers is run in a professional manner with respect for all participants. A lot of the time put into the programs is volunteer and the communities and schools have gotten behind most of the programs of Five Mountains Hawaii.  I am proud to be both a volunteer and a program participant of Five Mountains Hawaii.My only feedback for the organization is that they need to be able to hire organizers for each program while it is running so the programs will be more organized and effective. Right now, all organizing and implementing is left to volunteers and the Five Mountains Director.  This makes for an inefficient organization for most programs.
Five Mountains Hawaii Inc	91029		/users/profile/103995	Kast Associates	Volunteer	5	06/15/2011	I volunteered to be a teen mentor through Lifeplan Institute of Hawaii, a program of Five Mountains Hawaii.  I'm excited about this mentoring program because the first year results are in from the middle and high school students and they are outstanding! Our local Dept of Educ has included this program as part of their curriculum and the kids have reported a significant understanding of their life goals, risk factors they face as teens, strengths they possess to achieve their goals and are confident they can thrive as a teen.  This is so beneficial to our community:  healthy, confident teens = healthy community :D
Arts of Kona	61518		/users/profile/67172	mantis	Volunteer	5	01/28/2011	The first Youth Artist Showcase sponsored by Arts of Kona generated a response from students and parents alike that had them talking about the experience for weeks after the event.   Students already involved in the Arts generated a lot of interest to a number of students and the parents of students that were not involved in the arts and inspired them to become involved.   During the second Youth Artist Showcase, it was truly heart warming to see the look and awe on the faces of students who came to share their art with the various artistic expressions of their peers; each participant, learning and growing in the process.  Arts of Kona made this tremendous transformation possible by providing the vehicle for students to share their art with their peers, friends and ohana in a nurturing neutral place.  
Arts of Kona	61009		/users/profile/66532	Lydia Weiss	Client Served	4	01/25/2011	I attended the Arts of Kona fundraiser on January 16th.They presented a wonderful variety of music and arts displayed.This was especially delightful since it was in the outdoor gardens of a private home.  The music presented showed the vast contrast of performers in Kona.  There were youth, opera singer, flute and keyboard with ancient and modern Hawaiian, and a variety of lovely music from around the world and centuries.Helen Beljean is bringing out the talents in our small community. She was also very inclusive of other musical organizations by introducing them and allowing for announcements.Just a lovely Sunday afternoon to enjoy music and make new friends. Thank you, Lydia Weiss, President Kona Music Society
Arts of Kona	60826		/users/profile/66281	ropa	Advisor	5	01/24/2011	Arts of Kona plays such a valuable role in the local community, especially in these difficult economic times. The events and programs the Arts of Kona sponsors, provides food for the soul for the local residents and helps in making this community a place where we all want to help each other. The Arts of Kona's programs bind the community together and help to create a sense of belonging for many of the residents.
Arts of Kona	60326		/users/profile/65546	Judy Carr	Volunteer	5	01/18/2011	I have been involved in several fund raising events for this non-profit, and have been impressed every time with the focus on details, the joy (especially from the children) of the performers, and the clear focus of each and every event. In addition, I am a grant writer and have assisted with multiple grant requests from Arts of Kona.  It was a pleasure being able to wax eloquent - honestly - about the worthiness of the organization, which any grant writer can tell you is not always the case! This is one of the most passionate and able group of people I have ever worked with, and they deserve to succeed.  On this small island, this type of vision and focus is exceedingly valuable, and I am grateful to be a part of this effort.
Arts of Kona	60275		/users/profile/65460	Ldatta	General Member of the Public	5	01/17/2011	Many organizations "talk the talk" with wonderful missions and visions. I saw Arts of Kona "walk the walk" again ysterday, as I have at all their other events.  It's a Sunday afternoon, with about 60 people gathered outside in a private home. (NOTE: this was donated for the event by a local physician who supports Arts of Kona, very generous).  First, a 13 year old with a becoming-a-tenor voice opened the music with a beautiful chant (an "oli") in Hawaiian, which is our island custom.  This was followed by one of the most beautiful hula kahiko (traditional, ancient style dance) I have ever seen, the 15 year-old dancer expressive, graceful, doing a vigorous and demanding performance.  Then a flutist and pianist shared their traditions with us: two exquisite Japanese pieces, some French classical music, ending with a czardas where notes seemed to fly faster than hummingbirds' wings.  After an intermission, the 13 year old fella became Frank Sinatra and other performers from the 50s and 60s, bringing "the moves, the voice, the style" with great aplomb.  "Performing," he told us, "is my passion and thank you for giving me an opportunity."  Then a golden snior who had sung in opera showed she still had the verve and the voice in three arias. The grand finale was a trio of 15 year olds from a Hawaiian language immersion school who sang in complex, luscious harmonies, a polished performance where each young person was featured as well as ensemble. Arts of Kona aspires to give performers in all the arts a place to come together, to share their talents with the public and their peers, to promote all the organziations that individually create an artistic community.  With severe budget cuts---we had 17 days of public school furlough last year!---arts are almost non-existent in our schools.  Arts of Kona is a 100% volunteer organization; the funds it raises go 100% to making event such as this possible.  And it is 100% making a good difference in the Big Island of Hawaii (we are the one with the volcano). Five stars plus!
Arts of Kona	60251		/users/profile/65428	drdarin	Board Member	5	01/17/2011	As a Board Member of Arts of Kona I have been given an opportunity to be on the ground floor of an exciting adventure. Arts of Kona is a collaborative effort to bring a modern and all-encompassing performing arts center to the Kona area. In working towards that goal we are sponsoring adult artists of all venues to "young artists" of all venues. Watching the young artists blossom, in whatever their skill might be, is so rewarding. Afterall, without them the arts will vanish. AOK has a commitment to these wonderful singers, dancers, potters, painters, photographers and craftsman. It is for them that I work for Arts of Kona to someday bring a venue that will allow them to exhibit with pride. The AOK October "Young Artists' Showcase" has grown each year with the young people and the attendees to experience what these performers have to offer. Let's not let them down and support AOK and our dream of a Performing Arts Center for all mediums of art that shows off what the Kona area has to offer.
Arts of Kona	60201		/users/profile/65372	Jo Ann Iwane	Volunteer	5	01/16/2011	The Arts of Kona organization promotes the performing and visual arts in the Kona area on the island of Hawaii.  My involvement in the organization is with the student showcase that is held annually.  Over 200 students from grades 3-12 participated in the 2010 showcase.  It is a wonderful opportunity for students to share their talents with family and friends.  The Arts of Kona plays a vital role in keeping art ALIVE in kona.  I completely support it's mission and vision for Kona. Sincerely, Jo Ann Iwane

It works on the instituiopnal transformation for gender mainstreaming in agriculture and in NRM at all levels, from ministers' to farmers' level. Women and men I met in Kenya as well as in Nepal are really focused on improving the lifes of female farmers.

Women Organizing For Change In Agriculture & Natural Resource Man	40525	8	/users/profile/41440	fboakye	Professional with expertise in this field	4	05/25/2010	WOCAN is an expert and passionate organization in providing a voice for women in all spheres of life.  WOCAN ensures that women's voices are heard and contributing in the development of their communities.  In August 2009, WOCAN organized women involved in cassava processing in three communities in Ghana in a research being undertaken by the Meridian Institute of USA, in a project to add value to cassava funded by the Bill and Berlinda Gates Foundation.  WOCAN mobilized to provide a platform for the women to speak their minds and to ask the scientist questions that affected them. WOCAN aimed at ensuring that women had a say in all this and were not left out in the research but participated actively. The organization ensures gendermainstreaming in whatever project is undertaken to add value to agricultural produce by rural women by providing opportunity for them to express their concerns and to provide appropriate suggestions for improvement.WOCAN advocates on behalf of women to ensure they are not left out in discussions on issues affecting their families and communities and provides avenues for women to improve on their incomes. WOCAN does all these with passion and commitment and I am confident that WOCAN to continue to spearhead the cause of rural women involve in agriculture and the food security for thir families.

I have met some of the women who have benefitted from WOCAN and its heartening to see them spreading the good work. This also adds a multiplier effect to the work done by WOCAN. In terms of the network building, I have directly been incolved and have seen how this effort benefits professional women not only in developing countries, but also in developed countries like USA.

I was very impressed in 2009 with how they managed to organize the female Ministers of Agriculture and Forestry to come together and recognize their common issues and problems. It was especially li8berating for the African Ministers who had been somewhat marginalized by males.  Talking to one another under the auspices of WOCAN they managed to draft various common needs and to more effectively raise the issue of women's involvement in agriculture. WOCAN also ran a learning desk at the UN which also drew a large number of people, and has developed numerous permanent connections with female's in decision making positions all over the globe.
HAWAII ARTS ALLIANCE (Hawaii Alliance for Arts in Education)	115490	1	/users/profile/157266	Aurora Fruehling	Board Member	5	06/15/2012	When I was a Hawai'i public school student in the early 1940s and 1950s, there was some form of art class or art with the lesson at all grade levels:  painting, drawing, drama, embroidery, singing, dance, blockprints, music, embroidery, among others.  Even penmanship.  We constructed and painted custumes, and made papier-mache puppets for our dramas.  Rhythm bands consisted of sticks, tambourines, and triangles.  I took choir, cartooning; learned creative writing in journalism.  Girls took home economics, and boys took shop.  These are a few examples of what I learned that I carried into adulthood:  linoleum blockprints for Christmas cards, singing in church choirs, using home economics lessons, and encouraging our children (as my parents did) in the arts.  I was a Speech and Theatre major in college.  What I learned influenced me as a supporter of the arts, in general, and the Hawai'i Arts Alliance, in particular.  Its three-fold mission of teaching, supporting communities, and promoting the arts is evident  as it works and collaborates with partners, educators and youth throughout the state.  As a Kennedy Center Alliance for Arts Education Network member, the Alliance is recognized nationally.  It has successfully promoted legislation for arts education in the schools.  Its dedicated staff and board members have demonstrated that a small investment in the arts has a big impact on the lives youth and the vibrancy of the community.
HAWAII ARTS ALLIANCE (Hawaii Alliance for Arts in Education)	114633	1	/users/profile/156195	Roberta W.	General Member of the Public	5	06/11/2012	The Hawaii Arts Alliance has been in my life before I knew what the Alliance was! Having grown up in HI and attending school here and going to functions at Marks Garage I never knew that most of the programs available could not have happened with with the help of the Hawaii Arts Alliance. The incubator programs like the ARTS at Marks have truly made a difference in the Chinatown community as well as their support of new art groups like Playbuilders and Youth Speaks Hawaii encourages creativity in the community. More importantly, it's how hard the Alliance works to keep art programs alive in schools. Having been in many an art class I have seen the decline in a lot of funding for classes. One year I remember all of our supplies had to be brought from home. There was no funding available for supplies, so if the student was of low income, that student wasn't going to get to paint without a helping hand form another student. This is a wonderful organization.

HAWAII ARTS ALLIANCE (Hawaii Alliance for Arts in Education)	113255		/users/profile/154131	Laurel P McGraw	General Member of the Public	5	05/30/2012	The Kauai Performing Arts Center received matching grants from the Hawai"i Arts Alliance for two of the last three years. This center, which creates a for credit theater program for the middle and high school students for the entire island of Kauai, has been in danger of being eliminated for lack of state funding since the beginning of the recession . When the community comes year after year to the shows they present the comments are always that their expectations were exceeded. The students relate that their learning experience was one that carried over into all areas of their lives. Many years later they say how their ability to cooperate in work situations, their language skills, etc. were all hugely enhanced by their experience in this theater program. 
HAWAII ARTS ALLIANCE (Hawaii Alliance for Arts in Education)	113227	1	/users/profile/154083	Marcia Wong	Board Member	5	05/29/2012	The Hawaii Arts Alliance has and continues to promote and shape the arts experiences of the entire State of Hawaii.  The organization has been a leader in arts education as the major factor in the Arts First program, coordinating schools and artists throughout the state in a unique process of teaching and mentoring.  It has also worked closely with the Hawaii community in bringing arts to people at a grass roots level.  Two important projects: the refurbishing of the King Kamehameha statue in Hawi on the Big Island, during which the curator worked closely with community members and eventually restored the statue to the community's specifications.  This was a project that went beyond restoration to a uniting of the people of Hawi through education, arts participation, community dialogue and hands-on restoration.  A second important project was the establishment of the Arts District via the development of the Arts at Marks facility which houses visual arts exhibits, office spaces for artists and arts organizations, and a performance space used for dance, music and theatre presentations.  This downtown/Chinatown venue was the catalyst for the now thriving Arts District with galleries, restaurants, a restored Hawaii Theatre and other shops and coffee houses.  The Alliance has become a force in the arts as well as in the community at large.  Board members are drawn from many sectors including business, education, social services and especially the arts.  The executive director has held that position for over 10 years and serves the State in many consultant and committee capacities beyond her duties at the Alliance which continues to grow and exert constructive influence in the Hawaii Society.

Volunteer	5	10/16/2012	Doris and her PIAA team of volunteers have tirelessly helped the Hawaiian Islands and Samoan kids secure scholarships and entrance into D1 to D3 and Junior college teams in Football, Soccer, Volleyball, Baseball and Air Rifelry (plus more sports).  She's even helped student-athletes who were not enrolled out of the goodness of her heart. Her relationships with coaches across the US/Mainland from Coach Ken at the Naval Academy & Coach Manson at the University of Washington to Coach Taps at Western Oregon makes this non-profit the most beneficial for the island student-athletes. I hope she continues  her good work in giving the student-athletes an opportunity to better their lives through education and athletics and to help their families too.

Pacific Islands Athletic Alliance	109931	2	/users/profile/149727	Reizo	Client Served	5	04/16/2012	This organization's expansive and detailed knowledge of the industry (college scholarships for student athletes) and the clients it serves allows it to bring huge benefits to its clients.  The interactive nature of this organization promotes "teamwork" in order to attain goals, and therefore gives the clients the opportunity to become stakeholders and active participants in the core function of the organization as well as its successes.  This group has impacted not only my son's life, but many other student athletes, in a positive and significant way.  We are, and always will be, eternally grateful for the guidance and direction PIAA has given to us.

PIAA not only helped him get recruited for little cost to our family, but they helped him get academically eligible with SAT workshops, helped us doing our financial aid paperwork, they got him exposure with combines and gave him a scholarship to pay for his recruiting video. This is an excellent organization and I would encourage giving.  Their staff is all volunteer so the money you donate goes to the students served.

Hawaii Education Matters	98769		/users/profile/117353	AD Copsey	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/30/2011	Hawaii Education Matters (HEM) has developed an organization with a variety of resources for parents, teachers and community leaders to address issues related to learning and policy that influence outcomes in Hawaii's schools.  HEM encourages family and community involvement at all levels of education and have partnered with various organizations to help implement appropriate programs for our communities.  Initially developed to address 17 furlough days implemented in the public schools in 2009, HEM has expanded their programs to include health education and other tools to help children excel in schools and parents get involved.  In a state with limited resources and a notoriously poor public education system, HEM has provided a measurable impact with validated programs that improve the quality of our public schools.  As a parent and an educator, I highly endorse HEM.

Every child in Hawaii deserves an excellent education, and every family deserves a choice in how they pursue that.  HEM not only raises awareness of how a healthy public school system benefits everyone in the community, they also provide tremendous vision with their child-focused initiatives that are applicable to all Hawaii schools, both public and private.  I subscribe to the HEM newsletter and personally make every effort to incorporate HEM ideas and suggestions into our parent organization activities. 
Hawaii Education Matters	98707		/users/profile/117267	Pume	General Member of the Public	5	09/30/2011	When Hawaii public schools choose to implement school furloughs on Fridays, as a member of the public I was pretty angry.  I wanted to protest somehow but did not know what to do. I came across Hawaii Education Matters and learned that they were doing a rally at the State Capitol to protest the furloughs.  I was able to meet HEM's organizers, members and volunteers. Everyone was working together collectively to get their voice heard. It was a great experience for me to be with concerned parents who were making themselves heard through peaceful protest. I have kept in touch with HEM through their website, following their activities  after  the rally. 
Hawaii Education Matters	98705		/users/profile/117266	Judy Hall	Donor	5	09/30/2011	In my experience, HEM has both the passion and people-power necessary to reach their goals. When asked to partner in a high profile education Town Hall, their leadership jumped in with both feet. They assisted in networking with over 25 other education-based nonprofits to create a Take Action area, organized education professionals for a panel discussion and participated in follow-up activities. In the world of nonprofits, this level of organization, collaboration and follow-up deserves an A+.

For her, having the opportunity to do activities with other children she's known through the foster system and her very disconnected past of multiple homes, has made a huge difference.  She refers to these kids as "my people" because for so many years, those kids without forever families were the only people she could count on seeing again.  They have a strong sense of kinship and caring for one another. The joy on their faces when they see each other is so amazing.  The fun they have together through Sunday's Child Foundation events has been so healing and comforting for my daughter and has provided chances to do things that, in some cases, we could not have provided for her.  I am forever grateful.

My children and I found love and support from the staff and we were provided with so much, they tried their hardest to help us get what we needed to move on and start our new lives.  They were there when we needed to talk, to cry they kept us safe.  The shelter was the first place we were able to sleep and live peacefully.  
Women Helping Women	82579		/users/profile/91121	zebrafem	Professional with expertise in this field	5	03/18/2011	Women helping Women on Maui is a Non profit organization that supports battered and abused women by providing a shelter for women and their children,  a TRO office for restraining orders and hotline advocacy to women by phone. I have worked the hotline line for four years and heard the heart wrenching calls for help and taken pictures of women entering the shelter with harrowing bruised and wounds. WHW provides a safe haven for women by help[ing them get county services until they can become fully indepentdent in mind as well as body. Thousands of women each year would be without help and no place to go if WHW were to close its doors. With the County of Maui cutting grants to non-profits we have been forced to find other funds to keep our doors open. We need donors, sponsors, and women to take out a membership to help fund this organization to keep the doors open. Will you step up to the plate with a monetary donation?  We are also trying to set up a resale store to help fund our programs, voluntering  time, items for sale and montery donations in this area are needed also.

Those who left these negative comments below should be ashamed of yourselves! All you cared about was yourselves. You are all previous "board members" who were kicked out because your true intentions became apparent. You are an embarrassment. Where are you today? What have you done with yourselves? What have you done for the community? What have you done for others?  Shame on you. You are a disgrace to all Polynesians. Dr. Loia Fiaui - rest in peace with our ancestors. Thank you for everything you have done for us all during your lifetime!  It was an honor to know you!

He is not a bad man, he does not take advantage of his people. He loves them and cares for them. If you sit down and converse with Dr.Fiaui you will find out that he is not a bad man. He is far from bad. What you hear about him is bogus. He helped me and my family when we almost lost our house. I'm mixed, Samoan and Hawaiian.

He is incompetent and incapable of uttering a word of truth.  He has set up this organization as a country hideaway for himself and his girlfriend; his cancer-stricken wife resides in the same district.  He and the entire Board of Directors are frauds.  There is no infrastructure, no record-keeping system, no paperwork of any kind to indicate a non-profit operation. Fiaui also claims to be a Ph.D., however trascripts in this regard are non-existent. Fiaui and former Board member Fituina Tuanaetau were pursuing a FOR PROFIT opportunity for themselves.
Imua Family Services	187701		/users/profile/244755	NuiBrown	Client Served	5	11/03/2013	We searched high and low for services to support our child with a speech delay. It turns out the services provided by Imua are so superior, we had to look no further. We were ecstatic with our son's speech service provided and loved the community we were able to be a part of at weekly Parent Toddler Group.  The staff at Imua quickly started to feel like part of our family. Our son made huge strides with Imua and eventually stopped needing services. Although we were thrilled for his successes, we dearly miss our Imua family.  
Imua Family Services	183786		/users/profile/240701	Ivana R.	Volunteer	5	10/28/2013	My daughter Jewel was born premature is a surviving twin.  We were not prepared for needing so much specialized help for her.  Jewel has cerebral palsy and received early intervention from Imua Family Services, which consisted of O/T, P/T and SLP.  On Maui there are not many options to obtain this high level of specialized services.  Even after Jewel phased out of the early intervention program, she continued receiving SLP through the Fish fund at Imua.  Jewel's cp effects her whole body, all her limbs and internal organs including her muscles.  Through these early lessons, she is able to eat her own food and speak, though not as clear as you and I, yet.  She is wheel chair bound and depends on 24/7 care.  I have volunteered to fundraise for Camp Imua which Jewel attends, and has attended for the past five years.  It is what she looks forward to all year long.  Here at Camp Imua dreams come true, best friends are made and potential is nurtured and enhanced.  Our sense of community has amplified since going to camp and being a part of the fundraising team.  Imua Family Services is an integral part of our community, changing the trajectory of our children's lives and their world through Camp Imua.  Thank you to all the Staff at Imua Family Services and all the volunteers that make Camp Imua continue to thrive. Respectfully, Ivana
Imua Family Services	183735		/users/profile/240646	Lynn65	General Member of the Public	5	10/28/2013	Imua Family Services has been providing support services to Maui residents for the past 65 years; it is an amazing organization.   As parents of a child born prematurely, we were woefully unprepared and uncertain about our sons future. We had no experience and no idea of where to turn for help. In a very short time after his birth, we were contacted by the angels at Imua who were ready to become a part of our life and, more importantly, the life of our son Riley. They were there with welcoming and comforting arms assuring us that a bright future lay ahead. We simply do not know what we would have done without the help of these angels.
Imua Family Services	102842	1	/users/profile/136039	Raven2	Volunteer	5	01/04/2012	Imua Family Services has many wonderful programs for children with special needs, but the one that has affected me the most is their summer camp for school-aged disabled children, call Camp Imua.  It's a weeklong summer camp in june for 50+ kids with all kids of disabilities.  I have been volunteering for 4 years now, and it is the best community driven volunteer opportunity out there.  I'm 17 now, and have volunteered at Camp Imua since I was 14, and I have seen children's lives change because of Camp Imua! It is a wonderful program that has been going on for over 30 years, and it is FREE for disabled kids to attend!! There are all kinds of "normal" summer camp activities for these kids to get to participate in, including a swimming pool, arts and crafts, horse back riding and more!! So many opportunities that these special needs kids wouldn't have gotten the chance to participate in without Camp Imua.

Each young person showed composure and poise while delivering their speeches to an audience of 350 community leaders, including Governor Abercrombie.  The Boys & Girls Club deserves to be proud of the teen leaders coming out of their organization.  These young people are a shining example of what happens in a Clubhouse every day.  Congrats to all!
Oahu Society for the Prevention of Cruelty of Animals	272091	1	/users/profile/361056	BradSaintGeorge	Volunteer	5	11/15/2015	Hi, I've been involved with the Oahu SPCA for well over year now. I found the staff to be very concerned for the welfare of the animals within within their care.  I was speaking with one of the staff, she was talking to me about a dog named Malu who passed away due to the neglect and abuse suffered before the Oahu SPCA discovered and intervened.  She started crying when she told me Malu's story and I could tell that she had great empathy towards all the animals she tries to help.  On many occasions I have personally spoken with all the staff and some of the volunteers and found them to all be competent, courteous and CAPABLE  to help the MANY animals they rescue. The Oahu SPCA is a wonderful and valuable organization in Hawaii and I'm glad to leave my opinion about them to anyone interested.
Oahu Society for the Prevention of Cruelty of Animals	272090	1	/users/profile/361055	GemmyGem	General Member of the Public	5	11/15/2015	The Oahu SPCA is a wonderful non profit - they do so much work and help so many animals.They give a voice to the voiceless, and fight to ensure that such beautiful loving animals find new, safe loving homes. Their new website is so easy to navigate through, and is filled with lovely images, beautiful galleries of animals that need homes and they even have free activity pages for children! They are also very social on Facebook and Instagram which is lovely to see, they really strive to make sure that all the animals in their care are noticed and given the exposure they need to find their new FURever home. Well done Oahu SPCA - keep up the good work!! :) 
Oahu Society for the Prevention of Cruelty of Animals	147941	6	/users/profile/195778	LittleFish M.	Volunteer	1	01/10/2013	The Oahu SPCA has done a lot of valuable work to rescue and find homes for abandoned and abused dogs and cats in Hawaii.  They operate on a shoestring, relying on a few core volunteers.  They claim to rehabilitate all the animals they take in, but that's not really true.  They do basic nutritional and some medical rehabilitation, but can only deal with relatively easy behavior rehabilitation.  There is no trained staff or plan or program to deal with aggressive dogs or dogs with serious psychological issues.   The organization offers no transparency to its governance or financial information.  It holds closed board meetings.  It does not release any minutes.  It has a web site, but it is out of date and does not show current board members.  It does not publish any financial data such as financial statements or annual reports.  Form 990s are available for 2009 and 2010, but no later years.  If frequently runs advertisements for special project donations, but does not provide any feedback on how the collected funds were actually used.  Volunteers who offer constructive suggestions for improvement are dismissed.  
Pacific Aviation Museum Pearl Harbor	233167		/users/profile/296857	Mike130	Donor	5	11/07/2014	We are long time supporters of the Pacific Aviation Museum on Ford Island. The reason we continue providing grants is the Team "stands head and shoulders" above other non-profits in maximizing and managing the impact of our donations. They utilize each dollar as if it is their personnel money (which says a lot). We have seen the Museum truly blossom not only as a truly awesome home of historical aircraft but as a educational organization with its deep commitment to providing true context and depth in its exhibitions as well as in its STEM programs for kids and as a truly effective site preserver/restorer of grounds and facilities of major national historic importance.    
Pacific Aviation Museum Pearl Harbor	192931		/users/profile/251965	staggerW	Donor	2	01/22/2014	The failure to post a current 990 sounds the alarm.  But the 2012 Annual Report tells it all.As a donor to many aviation museums, cause and a couple top rated university flight programs I was introduced to this institution (PAMPH) by two highly professional fundraising experts who burst onto the scene with a keen knowledge and understanding of aviation and military history.  The trust and relationship that grew due to these two fine fellows who were running the museums national campaign effort resulted in, over time, several significant gifts to what I thought was fast becoming a world-class aviation museum.	Sadly, however, an inept and insecure management team led to the harsh and sudden removal of these two professionals who single-handedly built an unparalleled successful nationwide major donor network that accounted for the museums steady growth and era of respectability within elite aviation circles.	The last year these two gents were on the job accounted for year-end revenues topping $10 million with a $4 million year-end surplus.  Just one year later without these pros revenues were down to $5.7 million with a year-end balance $13 thousand in the hole  someone needs to be fired or removed from the Board of Directors!	This drastic nose-dive in funding the museum has experienced in 2012 (as indicated in the 2012 Annual Report) clearly reflects the loss of these fundraising pros and highlights the folly of poor leadership that has exhibited a total lack of any sound non-profit business experience.	What could have been a museum that had the attention and continued funding support of such defense industry giants as Lockheed-Martin, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, Rolls-Royce, General Atomics, GE Aviation and others is now lost.	Perhaps the most glaring laps of business judgment can be seen in the handling of the museums direct mail campaign.  The new direction the museum is headed in can only be compared to the mismanagement of the Federal Government.  Direct mail revenue, $1.4 million in 2011 dropped (off a cliff mind you) in 2012 to a dismal $157 thousand.  Again, the removal of experienced non-profit pros highlights inept management decision-making  if I were a Board member I would demand someone be fired immediately!	Compounding the management woes was the decision to keep one of the lower-valued employees to carry on the national campaign effort.  This resulted in a colossal miscalculation.  This poor stooge when asked to explain the difference between a P-38 and a Lightning had no clue that they were actually the same aircraft.  Over four years of relationship building and donor cultivation was erased overnight and the continuing effort by this buffoon only further removes any desire to donate in the future.	The lack of any significant future funding prospects from defense industry giants, the loss of high dollar aviation supporters such as myself, the total destruction of a successful direct mail operation, and the loss of respectability within the aviation community has dropped this museum from almost achieving world-class status to a want-to-be hopeful destine to remain in obscurity  do yourself a favor, enjoy Waikiki beach and stay away!
Pacific Aviation Museum Pearl Harbor	10267	11	/users/profile/12137	254lafayette	Donor	5	09/12/2009	It appears guidestar has the incorrect name, it should be the Pacific Aviation Museum.

Neighborhood Place of Puna	294500		/users/profile/385238	Writer	Former staff	1	07/01/2016	I am very disappointed at how the agency is run by the director. There have been incidents in which some of the employees have inappropriate relationships with family members specifically the males when working. I feel that since these people are still employed the director is not teaching them proper boundaries in order to be effective in their job as well as being professional. It seems that this director is someone that just wants to collect a paycheck instead of securing a good relationship with the community, donors and having a respectable reputation
Neighborhood Place of Puna	294498		/users/profile/385236	Writer	Former staff	1	07/01/2016	The community service workers are unprofessional. They do not know their boundaries with people especially men. There are a few workers that have had inappropriate relationships with men whether it's the family they are helping or volunteers of an event that they are part of.The director continues to have them on staff and is one of those administrative leaders that only wants to collect a paycheck. 
Neighborhood Place of Puna	163328	1	/users/profile/216812	Sean12	General Member of the Public	5	07/22/2013	I am writing to say a few things about the programs at Neighborhood Place of Puna. I heard about this program through my friend Stacey. She is someone who is always working to improve things here on the BI. I knew right away that I should try to get involved somehow. I participate in their SPORTS RESCUE Program and my OPEN MIC at Hilo Burger Joint is an official drop off site for sporting equipment that will then be given to children in need. I think that having a program that offers an safe healthy alternative for kids is a great idea!! Brilliant. I learned how to play hockey when I was 3 years old and hope that kids out here in Hawaii can have some of the same opportunities that I have had ( Maybe not hockey,haha), it gave me a reason to love something, a way for me to socialize. It gave me strength and confidence. This is only one of many programs that NPP offers. I know that they also help people by providing rentals for people in need of a place to live. I only hope that more people learn about their great programs and that they will double in size and resources and make it possible for them to touch more lives!! Many Mahalos to Stacey B and the rest of the hard working humanitarians that have chosen to take this same path!! OH , please drop off your used or new sporting goods at Hilo Burger Joint any Sunday 7-10 pm !! Sean  O
Taoact Foundation The Advancement Of Alternative Cancer Treatment	274648		/users/profile/364106	Writer	Client Served	5	12/18/2015	The TAOACT Foundation helped my husband when he had skin cancer.  They provided the natural, alternative treatments that he was receiving and visited with us often to see how he was doing.  Ki MiChele, the executive director of the foundation, had him help with a fund raiser for the foundation during one of the Christmas seasons. She provided the Santa outfit for him and he found the experience to be very rewarding.   It is the belief of the foundation that to be involved in raising funds for ones own treatment is part of the natural healing process as it helps towards the balance of body, mind and spirit.When my husband passed away last September, Ki MiChele, who is also an Hawaiian minister, performed a memorial ceremony for him on her cliff overlooking the sea at Maulua Bay. During the ceremony, an 'Io flew over and it is a belief that this royal hawk carries the spirit of our loved ones.
Taoact Foundation The Advancement Of Alternative Cancer Treatment	273503		/users/profile/362738	OffStagePro	Volunteer	5	12/01/2015	The TAOACT Foundation has been helping to raise funds and awareness for the alternative treatment of cancer and other degenerative diseases since 2000. This nonprofit, tax exempt organization has helped many people since it was first established and no one with the required documentation has ever been turned down when they have asked for help.  One of the fund raisers of the foundation is "Friends Helping Friends." Friends and family of the person in need are notified of the purpose of the fund raiser and all donations made by them are tax exempt and are given to the person requesting help with the cost of alternative treatments.  Since in part, the mission of the foundation is to seek alternative treatment through the connection of Body, Mind & Spirit, knowing that friends and family are willing to help with monetary assistance, the person in need is receiving emotional help as well which serves as part of the healing. This was attested to by one of the foundation's recipients Quentin Sam Holt.

Pacific Whale Foundation	91777		/users/profile/105095	OceanBlue	Volunteer	5	06/22/2011	I have been involved with this organization for more than 10 years and can only say great things about them. I've helped with their marine education programs for local schoolchidren on Maui. You might think of Maui as a rich place, but there are many families who are scraping by, even with parents working two jobs in the hotel industry. Thanks to Pacific Whale Foundation, these kids get to go out on the ocean to view whales and other marine wildlife and learn about conservation. Pacific Whale Foundation also built an Ocean Discovery Center with classrooms and lab equipment for school classes; their staff does a great job with leading hands-on science  programs. Pacific Whale Foundation also has research projects to study whales in Hawaii, Australia and Ecuador, and a study of wild dolphins and toothed whales in Hawaii. They are a hard-working, dedicated group of people who are really passionate about protecting the oceans.

It has become an international organization, with 30 years of ongoing research in Hawaii, Australia, Ecuador, Tonga, and other parts of the Pacific. It works with the international community to promote whale research and protection, and it leads the field in environmental education, and conservation.This doesn't sound like the organization you are describing. Perhaps you have the wrong name? How long did you work there and what did you do for them?
Pacific Whale Foundation	50401	2	/users/profile/50988	Mauireview	Professional with expertise in this field	1	08/15/2010	To my understanding, after reviewing and working for this organization my opinion is that majority of the money in this organization is funneled away to pay the CEO and Founder large salaries, to promote there tourism snorkel business, and to expand and promote there store. Compared to salaries and tourism, very little of there cash flow goes into actual research and conservation here in Hawaii. I am very surprised as I thought this organization was top notch, but now im very disappointed. I am also currently trying to get ahold of there 2010 & 2009 federal tax records to see exactly how this money was spent.

The organization and its participants has embarked upon making family poi boards and poi pounders, a traditional Hawaiian hale and an outrigger canoe. Learning by doing, helps families to bond, to forgive and to learn about each other. They bring so much joy to Kalihi Valley. My son and I were in Kulia I Ka Nu'u, a parent education workshop series to teach parents to be the best teacher they can be for their keiki. The lessons were immersed in Hawaiian cultural values such as family storytelling. I had the best kuma named Kamaile. She was full of grace, ideas and practical wisdom. My son, ohana and I have flourished with the love of the kumu and the lesson plans she helped to implement with us.

As an adult I had struggled with reading and writing my whole life, yet I was a successful Account Executive at the number one radio station in Hawaii.  I had not graduated from High School due to family issues and moving schools so many times in my life.  No one knew just how bad it was for me, so when my 16 year old son wanted to quit school and he said to me, But mom you didnt graduate and look at you, youre doing great. I told him it wasnt something I was proud of and that I had to work ten times harder to do everything than anyone else.  I pleaded with him to stay in school and told him that I would go back and get my GED if he did.  The rest of the story goes like this: I went to Kalaheo High School for continuing adult education. My first 3 nights of school I drove home in tears!  Thinking how can I do this?  I was all over the place and confused about how I could be doing the JOB that I did not be able to understand anything the teacher was asking us to do.  It was OVERWHELMING to say the least.  On the third night driving home, I heard a commercial talking about if you have issues with reading and think you might be dyslexic there is help... well I called that night and left a message then called back the next day and was connected to the most patient, kind and giving person, Margret Pang.  She walked me through the process and I was on my way. Twelve weeks later I walked across the stage with a HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA!  The day I took my test I was promoted to be a manager and 6 years later became the GM of 7 amazing Salem Media of Hawaii Radio Stations.  I cant thank her enough for giving me the ability to achieve all of my dreams and even some I didnt realize I had.                                                          Thank you GOD for Margret Pang!!!!
Dyslexia Center Of The Pacific Inc Dcp	49469	1	/users/profile/50679	renee14	Client Served	5	08/10/2010	A year ago my son was diagnosed with ADHD & Dyslexia. I went to his school for help in assisting him with his disability. The school turned me away saying that he is not eligable for assistance. I did not know where to turn. I called back the doctor that diagnosed my son and she gave me a list of about 6 places I could call for private tutoring. I called all names that was given to me. The next day, my prayers were answered. Margarette Pang was on the other line. She spent almost an hour on the ohone with me explaining what her center would do to help my some overcome his Dyslexia. From the first time we walked into the doors of the DTCH, we felt like family and we knew this is where we belonged. Margarette was and still is the only person that ever called me back to help my son. That just goes to show how much heart & soul she puts into each child that walks through those doors. I can't imagine where my son would be today without her and her amazing staff. I thank them everyday for everything they have done. God sure put an "Angel" on this earth to do good in the lives of others. Thank you Margarette for being our "Angel". We love you.
Dyslexia Center Of The Pacific Inc Dcp	8887	1	/users/profile/10662	cherylz	Volunteer	5	08/08/2009	I would like to let everyone know about a very special woman by the name of Margarette Pang. She is the Founder and Executive Director for DTCH and received the 2008 Kapolei Outstanding Achievement Award for Education, the 2009 Certificate of Award for Outstanding Community Service Award from the Daughters of the American Revolution, and the 2009 Jefferson Award. She overcame her battle with dyslexia and understands the hardships and stigma that are partnered with this disability. Margarette has the passion, heart, and drive to keep this non-profit center open, but DTCH could definately use your contribution to help all the children that they have reached out to. Not only do they help the children that no one else wants to help, Margarette and DTCH opens their hearts and doors to the ones that can't afford it. They try their very best to accomidate everyone. I've come across quite a few people that wish they could recieve tutoring from DTCH, but it's out of their budget and they can't find help anywhere else. They want their chilren to get tutored at DTCH and their children want to be tutored at DTCH. This is a place where DTCH's current students want to be! Students at DTCH come from all over the island just to be there. Margarette and her staff have done so much, not only for children, but adolescence as well as young and older adulds. Tutoring isn't the only thing they do at DTCH. Margarette does so much, including giving a wealth of information to better understand your child, your self, or Dyslexia in general.
KONA FAITH CENTER, INC.	308887		/users/profile/400262	konagrandma	General Member of the Public	5	10/07/2016	From the day I first visited Kona Faith Center 5 years ago, after leaving church, friends and family behind on the mainland to retire in Hawaii, I felt the overwhelming love of our Lord Jesus here.  This love has multiplied as I have made this church my home and come to know the caring pastors, Terry & Jason Meechan, and the many loving members.  One of the best things about our church is the classes offered (e.g.  Secret Place Prayer, Forgiveness, Faith & Grace, Grief, Overcoming Addictions) that encourage us to be in God's Word and learn how to live the victorious Christian life.  We also have lots of fun activities for adults and children that keep us connected, like baptism picnics at Keauhou and Manini Beaches, Youth Camp, Vacation Bible School, and Women's/Men's Retreats.  The worship is God-centered and powerful, often ushering in the presence of God so strongly that people experience healing in the service--in body and spirit.Come check us out for yourself!  You'll feel welcome and loved!
KONA FAITH CENTER, INC.	308382	1	/users/profile/399767	Sokach_3	Volunteer	4	10/06/2016	I have been healed and have seen many healing in the services at Kona Faith Center.  My wife and I had a struggling marriage with enough pitfalls to cripple it.   If was not for my wife along with Our Pastors Jason and Terry Meechan we would be a statistic. The Church has grow as we have grown with it, through leading in classes, serving in ministry and being instrumental in a move of God taking place. Praise the Lord Jesus Christ from whom all good things come.  
KONA FAITH CENTER, INC.	308313	2	/users/profile/399703	favoredone	Client Served	5	10/06/2016	After the death of my husband and daughter I was brokenhearted. I was angry and disappointed in God and my life. BUT God has taken my grief and given my life beauty from the ashes, joy for the mourning and praise for the spirit of despair. And this  is  because of the support of the Pastors, the encouragement of the people and love I learned to receive and give at Kona Faith Center.  Experience the love of God for yourself, there is nothing that God cannot turn around for good for those who take a  step toward Him.  I am alive because Jesus lives and Kona Faith Center's  Pastors Jason and Terry and the community of believers   were  there for  me through this time.  Sandi
Aloha United Way Inc	189489		/users/profile/247349	bigb087	Donor	5	11/27/2013	This is a great organization to donate to.  They are able to allocate the funds to specific areas to assist the people of Hawaii.  If you prefer, you can even designate which non-profit agency receives 100% of your donation.  I've been giving to AUW for over 20 years now!
Aloha United Way Inc	59622	1	/users/profile/64509	Bdelima96814	Donor	2	01/07/2011	You should analyze their form 990 to see where the money goes, how it is spent, and where it is wasted. I was a long time donor until someone showed me their taxes. I no longer donate to Aloha United Way. An example is their Society of Young Leaders activities which breaks even and doesn't profit. SYL should focus less on social activities that benefit themselves and focus on the community which is what they get paid for. Tax info is public information and the public should look at it to assess overall management of donations. I give monies directly to programs and avoid these non-profits.
Aloha United Way Inc	58806		/users/profile/62909	dnakamura	Professional with expertise in this field	2	12/14/2010	I believe that Aloha United Way used to be a good organization with a solid foundation, good leadership, and a strategic vision for its future.  Under its current leadership, however, AUW has foundered.  It has lost some major corporate donors, and most likely it will continue to lose major sponsors, to the point that I fear it will no longer be able to sustain itself as a non-profit.  To any individual considering making a donation to AUW, I urge you to take a closer look.  AUW cannot tell you how the funds it raises are really helping the community.  You will be better off donating directly to the charity of your choice rather than giving it to an agency with such a vague mission and an eroding support base.

Hawaiian Acres Rd Corporation	192776	1	/users/profile/251744	paganhorse1	Volunteer	1	01/18/2014	Hawaiian acres road corp. is the most dysfunctional , hostile, self serving board I have ever experienced. They do not fulfill their responsibility to this community, refuse to release financial information when requested and assume that they "own and control" all easement rights in this sub. Div. . They have destroyed property owners property value by continuously trenching in to privately owned acreage, yet refuse to repair the roads they do not have some personal association with.You may not question them at meeting without disparagement and a refusal to respond.I have recently noticed that in spite of professing they have no money from community donations, to repair roads,  (which, they request in bill form twice a year) they  spend nearly twenty five percent of what community funds they do receive on office expenditures.??????! ! should you request matching funds for a road project as a property owner....chance is you are denied.Hawaiian Acres Road Corporation needs to be placed into receivership as well as Hawaiian Acres Community Association. Both for failing  in their  responsibility to this community. Both boards want the authority just not the responsibility.

U-Turn For Christ Kauai Inc	287507		/users/profile/377610	Tyler84	Client Served	1	04/28/2016	I went through the first phase of turn for Christ and a bit of the second. I went to the Kauai location. I was charged $3500 but none was spent on me. They live in tents with no electricity, no restrooms, no sanitary cooking area, and outside showers. All food is donated and old. It is dangerously unsanitary! There are rats, mold in tents, roaches, and everything else that comes with outdoor living. There are no counslers or any info about addiction. You just work for free daily and read the bible and go to church. Nothing is allowed or tolerated and I mean nothing! Not even talking about drugs or listening to music! Your stripped of everything and abused till you are even more broken then when you arrived! I love Jesus but trust me when I say you don't need this joke of a place to become sober or to know the lord. There is NO form of treatment whatsoever! Not even an indoor place to get healthy or the correct food your body will need. I finished because I had no other options and I am no quitter I wanted to finish for myself and now I can speak the truth about what I experienced without any bias. I don't know where the $3500 went and there was no planning as to my next move when I had completed the 1st phase in July the director, or any of the two (yes 2) staff volunteers helped me figure out what I would do when I left since I learned nothing and they offered no help! They discipline you and make you dig a 5x5x5 hole if you swear, smoke a cig, or disagree with any beliefs or reason, or question anything! What they are doing is brainwashing addicts while taking they family's money and trying to justify it. Anytime I brought up the conditions or begged for help I was told to leave if I didn't like it. There are 2 pastors and one overseer who is 20 years old. He is a power tripping Jesus fanatic with a closed mind and the other two pastors are Polynesian bobybuilders I only saw maybe 5-7 times over the 2 month period. I was abused mentally and it appalls me to think of my time there. Please ask every question you can muster in your mind before even thinking of sending a loved one there. The intake coordinator says everything is paid for yet it does not even exist (living quarters,food,etc.). Ask for photos or their view on personally helping the people there and how they do that. Why are there no progress meetings? Or any meetings to see how an addict suffering is doing? Why is the woman on the phone saying room and board and meals yet it's a campsite with canfood? What if you get ill? What if you try to reason? What do they personally do to help with your addiction? Not what Jesus does. And what is the $3500 donation go towards!? This place needs to be shut down immediately. If you don't believe please ask the neccesary questions and see for yourself. If it could save one person I would be thinking different. I helped myself while being subject to tremendous mental abuse and a brainwashing atmosphere which was unsanitary and disgusting to say the least. I am sober because of my mindset and the lords help! Everything I said can be proven 100%. This review needs to be posted everywhere to actually find a way to change the program through awareness and to help those who are suffering there now. Call the intake coordinator and get the number to any of the 2 leaders to ask these questions and see credentials. I've seen many people arrive then leave that day with no refund. The 3-5 people who are usually constant are there because they are lost and family will not take them back if they leave, but the family does not know the trial the addict faces. Please help me to help make a difference.
U-Turn For Christ Kauai Inc	241834	3	/users/profile/328503	Chaas1	Volunteer	5	04/28/2015	In 2008 our family was rocked by our son's addiction to heroin. We didn't know what to do, and we began to search for somewhere to send him that would get him far away from the associations he had developed that had brought him  to this place and almost killed him. We found Uturn for Christ in Kauai, and it was a complete Godsend. Besides being extremely affordable, especially at a time we were hurting greatly with the real estate industry going down, the program changed the direction of our son's life and the legacy of our family. He now has been sober, has a family and is happy and well adjusted.  Thank you to Uturn for Christ Kauai for causing a true U-Turn in our son's life!

The history of lion dancing dates back to 2,000 years ago during the Tang Dynasty.  Over time, the people of China admired the animal and adopted the lion into their culture as a prominent symbol of bravery, righteousness and peace.  The significance of the lion dance is that it is believed to bring good luck, prosperity and happiness to every joyous occasion. The cultural significance of the lion dance is that it is believed to bring good luck, prosperity and happiness to every joyous occasion.

Hawaii Island Humane Society	7290	2	/users/profile/3612	kristen_ucc	Donor	5	07/24/2009	I can't recommend HIHS highly enough.I was visiting Kona a couple weeks ago, staying at a friend's house. The less-than-friendly neighbor next door had several older dogs and at least 5 puppies running all over the neighborhood. The pups couldn't have been more than 10 weeks old and were already frightened of people- they hadn't been socialized at all. But they were adorable and with effort I managed to get them to come over and say hello. Once one had decided I was all right the rest just piled on. There was a momentary flurry of furry puppy happiness- they were licking my chin, eating my hair, rolling over for tummy rubs, and collapsing in my lap. Then I realized these poor pups were covered in fleas and sores and had no collars, and getting a good look at the other dogs, I noticed they were in advanced stages of mange.I called the Society and was told they do visits, so I gave them the address. Today, less than two weeks later, I got a call from the officer who had performed the conditions check. He told me the owner had surrendered all the pups on the spot and had been given a notice to comply to get his other dogs licenses and medical treatment. The pups are all up for adoption and being furry Golden retriever mixes I am sure they will all find loving homes. HI Humane Society just made my year! I just gave them a donation for their efforts and I hope, perhaps later at end of year time, others will do the same.

Punahou School	188712		/users/profile/246274	Kauakea	Volunteer	5	11/16/2013	I am an alumna, former parent of four students, and weekly volunteer at Punahou. Unlike most who would choose to "move on" once their student days or the days of their student children are completed, I still faithfully come to Punahou each week. (I have condensed my full-time work week to do so!)  I currently manage a project that honors the school's history and love every moment I spend there. I respect the school, its mission, and the individuals who are a part of its historic fabric. That I can codify the daily life that is and was experienced at Punahou both excites and helps me grow intellectually. The individuals with whom I work are respectful and give me both the latitude and the tools to do my job. I feel that I am supported and valued while I work in a pleasant environment. What more can I ask for in a volunteer opportunity? Punahou gave me a great start in life. Punahou gave each of my children a great start in life. I am truly thankful for that. I am also thankful that I can offer something back in return for the priceless gift that was given to me and my family. Go Punahou!

And the programming is not just "all NPR" it's locally produced and BBC, Deutsche Welle, CBC, PRI, etc. And an incredibly talented on-air team with arguably the best jazz DJ in the nation like Don Gordon and it's a winna! I can't say enough good things about this station which most other public radio stations could take a lesson from.

HAWAII LITERACY INC	211066		/users/profile/273920	RSSimon	Board Member	5	08/18/2014	Hawaii Literacy empowers people to better their lives and to better serve others through literacy.  We believe that greater literacy builds stronger families and communities. It's never too late for an adult to learn to read and write, and our dedicated volunteers have been successful in teaching adults to read and write. We believe that parents are their childrens first and best teachers, and that parent and family support can help any parent, regardless of literacy level, help their child succeed.  Our programs also provide learning centers and opportunities to youth in underprivileged communities. Key programs:Adult Literacy - 1 on 1 tutoring;Bookmobile - a classroom/library on wheels that serves the Leeward coast of Oahu;Family Libraries - books, technology and literacy services in Oahu public housing communities;English Language Learners - classroom literacy instruction in the English language with a focus on practical skills. Hawaii Literacy is very efficient in leveraging the effort, time and talent of dedicated volunteers to deliver services to thousands every year.

East Maui Animal Refuge	86872		/users/profile/97308	DeborahJ	General Member of the Public	5	04/23/2011	This is the most amazing, wonderful animal rescue refuge I've ever known.  Sylvan and Suzie who run the refuge 24/7 are true angels, they care for each and every rescued animal as their own children, knowing them by name and temperment, likes and dislikes.  They call the EMAR The Boo Boo Zoo....orphaned and injured wildlife, birds of all kinds, cats, farm animals, you name it, they take care of them all, even endangered wildlife.  They will cure and release back into the wild all the animals that are fit to return.  Otherwise, they have separate living quarters designed to give safe access to the outdoors for all animals, even felines with AIDs, keeping them protected and the other animals protected as well.  Instead of being rewarded for their efforts, however, Sylvan and Suzie get harassed by paper pushing, animal hating bureaucrats.  These people deserve a medal of honor, the Nobel Peace Prize.  Visiting their sanctuary is like visiting the Garden of Eden...lots of love and harmony.  They are angels.
PUKOA KANI AINA COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AND FINANCIAL INSTITUT	142638		/users/profile/187134	DeeannC	Professional with expertise in this field	4	11/26/2012	The multitude of Native Hawaiian organizations that have emerged over the last 20 years is a testament to the interest, knowledge, and hard work Native Hawaiians are willing to commit to bettering themselves, their communities, and Hawaii as a whole.  At the same time Pkoa recognizes that there is a significant need amongst these developing organizations for capacity support in various forms including; management, strategic planning, facilitation, and access to capital, that if provided, could significantly improve organizational functioning and increase their impact in providing services to meet the needs identified by their communities.  The intended impact of Pkoa is to create collective socioeconomic equality for Hawaiians and their communities.

The Arc of Kona has been around for 44 years and is always self improving, changing with the times, but never losing the mission or the passion for the vision,Supported employment and self employment through the arts are two areas that showcase how the Arc of Kona is making the dream of work a reality for persons with a diagnosis of a diability. By working all around our Big Island community, the Arc of Kona is trying to educate the public and employers about "who" our participants are and put a new "face" on the image of the person with a disability. By doing this the Arc has been creating better job opportuniies and is able to bring resouces to the table to develop our artists, musicians and film makers who want to use their cretivity as their source of income rather than just a hobby. I have seen and  been part of this great shift in community attitude, and I thank the Arc of Kona for stepping out and being a leader.
Winners At Work Inc	147598	3	/users/profile/195240	Sam_14	Professional with expertise in this field	1	01/03/2013	I previously served writing grants and contracts for the organization, and the program staff regularly met the quantifiable goals and objectives outlined in each of the grants that we received.  The fiscal administration, however, was very lax and sloppy in keeping track of expenditure of funds from these grants.  The result was that the organization finally reached a point where requisite final reports were prepared for funders of a program titled "Healthy For Life," and I was able to empirically demonstrate in written reports that the goals and objectives outlined in the proposals were all met or, in most cases, exceeded.  However, the executive and financial side of the organization continually refused to provide me with any fiscal reports and, as a result, I was told by the current executive of the organization that I would not be allowed to submit the program reports I had prepared; reports which I still have to this day.  At that time, the organization had a President who made more in compensation than any preceding executive, yet only worked part time so that she could continue full time work with a for-profit business.  At the same time, the organization had a full-time fiscal administrator who was allowed to hold her title and receive compensation while she lived in the Philippines, where she was almost completely unavailable to provide the fiscal data needed to prepare proposals and contracts and to provide requisite final fiscal reports to funders.  I was told that they did not have any receipts or other documentation on the Healthy For Life project, so I provided them with the names and contact information of contractors who could provide them with such information.  With a part-time President and a fiscal administrator living in the Philippines they informed me that they would be unable to provide this information, thus leaving the organization disqualified for any future funding from any of the foundations in question for failure to submit required final reports.

Our Grayson was 5 when we uncovered he had a cancerous brain tumor of the most aggressive kind.  Hugs supported us in the hospital with their kind volunteers and cherished siblings program.  Grayson has a younger sister who was 2 at the time.  When we were admitted to the hospital, she was stuck in the room with us for long periods of time.  She looked forward to the Sibling night on Tuesday.  A volunteer would pick her up from our room in the evening and take her to play one on one in the playroom.  She always felt loved and so special.  Our son earned his angel wings and we weren't sure if we were still welcome in this community without our sweet son.  Hugs welcomes families at all points in their journey to their loving support.  We continue to attend monthly dinners, mom's night and dad's nights.  Olivia loves the respite night where she is partnered with a buddy and allowed to dictate what she wants to play.  They enjoy dinner and movies during the respite night and she continues to feel loved and cared for every time.

Holualoa Foundation For Arts And Culture	58766		/users/profile/62826	Tomoe	Volunteer	5	12/13/2010	I never considered myself as an artist until I worked with the Holualoa Foundation for Arts and Culture as a volunteer. I was introduced to the process of artmaking instead of the product. Therefore, as I gingerly experimented with paper making I gained an understanding of the history of Hawaii as it was influenced by Polynesians who set out to settle in a new home. Other media related to fiber arts and concepts that led to artmaking continues to influence my life. The mission of this organization to enrich lives of persons of all ages and abilities through art education is indeed applicable to my life.

Family Programs Hawaii	287051		/users/profile/377123	Kathleen_M	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	My Giving StoryI grew up as the third child in a middle class family of six.  I always felt I was loved unconditionally and felt safe and secure in my family home.  Never, ever, did I expect to be uprooted from my family or my home!Well, foster children are uprooted from their homes!   These children have left everything familiar  to them and are taken to a strange place where they will now live. The horrible truth is there is NO CURE for this!   I thought I was aware of how the foster care system worked.  I thought the system provided the foster child with all their needs-from clothing to food.  That is not the case at all for the foster child.   Not every foster child has a foster family that would have their best interest in mind.  I have learned that foster children need so much more support. I realized they need and deserve the same support I would give my own children!   I know now that there is much to assist in helping the foster care system that is why I volunteer and give to Friends of Foster Kids.  I found that this wonderful organization supports the foster children who have been removed from their home due to abuse or neglect.  Friends of Foster Kids provides Christmas  to foster children and also provides essentials to college bound foster children and assists foster children who are transitioning into independent living.  Friends of Foster Kids is a 100% volunteer organization.  It is a 501(c)(3) non-profit.

Hawaiian Acres Community Association	290936		/users/profile/381277	lomi	General Member of the Public	1	05/25/2016	dysfunctional , self serving , no transparency these are the words that best describe a handful of people that have appointed themselves to the board of directors of  the Hawaiian acres association. there are approximately 4000 lots in the subdivision yet only about  200 owners have given money to the organization.  meetings are never announced , and there are no recorded minutes of the meetings . the non profit status should be taken away ,  the building should be closed up and placed into a trust . 
Friends of Volunteers Initiative Nepal (FVIN)	143903	1	/users/profile/79831	AngieJones	Volunteer	5	11/28/2012	Friends of VIN is a small but mighty organization. I have really enjoyed working with them and seeing them develop over time. Participating in the year-end fundraiser to sponsor education for disadvantaged girls in Nepal has been particularly enjoyable. Working with them has has inspired me, and I hope that I one day have an opportunity to volunteer in person in Nepal as well! 
StarWish	197204	1	/users/profile/257786	haileyanela	General Member of the Public	5	04/07/2014	StarWish is a great organization headed by an amazing board. They are a non-profit group whose sole purpose is to award scholarships and assist local charities. StarWish has positively impacted my life by graciously presenting me with a scholarship this previous year. With the aid from this award I was able to purchase all of my necessary books and supplies to help me prepare myself for my freshman year in college. Thank you StarWish for the amazing opportunity to be apart of your Ohana.

ALOHA DREAM CENTER	301005		/users/profile/391884	ittaum	Client Served	5	08/19/2016	Aloha dream center is a great nonprofit that helps families that are single or struggling with children.  They make it possible for the people that are struggling  to get what they need to support their family.  Such as putting notices out there of a donation that a struggling family requests. They have helped my family by putting an event together that gave away donations and brand new baby things such as clothes, strollers, car seats and etc to expecting, single or struggling mothers. The donations did not only help me with my son but   it will also making it easier for me financially since im expecting again. 
Island Breeze Ministries	88780		/users/profile/100220	nabale	Volunteer	5	05/17/2011	I just wanna say that this ministry have been one of the highly recommend ministries that reach so many people in the christian world and also in the circular world I may say. In my experience within this ministry I have seen that they have been in the pioneering stage of most cross-cultural and inter-relational with in the indigenous community and also in the bright city life. I believe we as christian dont or do little of appreciating all the hard work and the boldness that this men and women has done in world mission. They deserve our thanks and appreciation for their hard work and obedience to God.  
Hui Laulima O Hana	11867	3	/users/profile/13832	Angels	General Member of the Public	5	10/03/2009	I have seen this organization blossom over the years in working closely together, for the betterment of their community, and the people on dialysis with a dire need. A small grassroots organization who have brought great difference to the rest of the nation, by ending the long trips dialysis patients endured throughout the years, is remarkable! A model of its- first of its-kind communal home dialysis, where community members can now receive dialysis treatments, assisted by trained and certified health aides. Hui Laulima O Hana oversees and lease a government property & home, and compensate health aides to support and care for loved ones on dialysis.
MAUI ACADEMY OF PERFORMING ARTS	275811	4	/users/profile/365482	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/06/2016	 I am so impressed with the level of professionalism in the work done by the Maui Academy of Performing Arts.  They always bring out the very best in the dancers, actors, and singers in their programs.  A man from the Mayor's office made a speech recently in which he said. "Imagine for a moment Maui without MAPA.  It is a hard thing to imagine.  It is such an important part of our Island home.  The plays in the summer are a way of bringing brilliant theater to our islands, otherwise we would  have to travel to New York to see that type of quality."  This is very true.  I am so grateful for MAPA.  
MALAMA NA HONU	10930	1	/users/profile/12877	Nami	Volunteer	5	09/24/2009	This is an excellent group - really nice people.  In a nutshell, volunteers give Naturalist talk to the tourists and protect the 20+ Hawaiian Green Sea Turtles inhabiting the beach from harrasment (humans trying to touch them or block them from coming ashore to bask on the sandy beach.)  It's a fun group to belong to and the turtles (Honu) are adorable.  Most of the tourists/visitors are really nice to talk to and seem to enjoy receiving turtle related information from us.  Beautiful sunsets at Laniakea Beach is another plus.
Hawaii Childrens Cancer Foundation	305964		/users/profile/397233	Gabby G.	Client Served	5	09/21/2016	HCCF provided much needed financial support when our son was diagnosed with an aggressive cancerous brain tumor, rare in children. In an instant your family is faced with this  unexpected journey, and it is impossible for both parents to continue to work.  Living in Hawaii is expensive, and faced with not only the grave illness of your child, you have the weight of constant living expenses on your shoulders. HCCF provided immediate support with the easiest access.  They continued to support us on our journey at Christmas, inviting us to their Santa celebration.  We were able to take our son to see Santa while admitted in the hospital and watch joy unfold as my son and daughter both opened their gifts!! Thank you HCCF!
Bay Clinic, Inc.	40032	1	/users/profile/40970	345mlk	Client Served	5	05/22/2010	I had to go to the Pahoa clinic a few weeks ago and just wanted to say that the doctor out there was really great. The nurse that helped was also really kind. It was a good experience for me. I know it gets busy, but I didn't feel like I was being rushed at all, real professional and took care of me well.
Kahua Na Au A O Ma Pu Uhonua O Honaunau Nhp Inc	96670		/users/profile/112883	plskokuakahua	Board Member	5	08/26/2011	Kahua Na`au A`o ma Pu`uhonua o Honaunau NHP, INC. is all grown now.  It has weathered the 30 years of building the foundation in order to teach others.  Kahua Na`au A`o founded and hosted many signature events at Pu`uhonua o Honaunau including the annual Establishment Day Cultural Festival since 1976 whose 3 day attendance is a modest 8,000 visitors.  Kahua Na`au A`o has impacted and uplifted the lives of many especially  our Hawaiian people, like myself to attain the `Ike insight into my family history.  I learned to search my Na`au my "gut" to look for the A`o the enlightenment.   Kahua Na`au A`o has provided an alahele a pathway to discover, get to know and collaborate with other Hui, organizations who think in like mind.  Although miles away on islands or continents we share a global sense of  compassion for our own, each other and human kind.  Kahua Na`au A`o has now come of age and  is sanctioning teachers who have completed the course of study so that the continuity of  the A`o, the learning moves forward.  I am so thankful to my family especially my mom, known to many as Aunty Grace who named  our organization and to Jerry Y. Shimoda retired Superintendent of Pu`uhonua o Honaunau NHP who practiced the Hawaiian tradition of Ohana and with this vision mentored Kahua Na`au A`o to stare adversity in the face and look for the oppotunities in the light.   Kahua Na`au A`o sheds its skin regularly so that the dawning of the  new skins enable the organization to  makaukau,  be well prepared for the future.
Keaukaha One Youth Development	248193	3	/users/profile/335888	sok_hawn	Volunteer	1	07/13/2015	This guy is a scam.  He has no youth organization anywhere in Keaukaha.  And his physical address is at the Hilo Lagoon Hotel.  His non-profit status is to scam the Federal Government of tax money.  No one from Keaukaha has ever heard of Stanley Roehrig.  SCAM ALERT!!!
WAIKIKI HEALTH CENTER	46318	5	/users/profile/47182	paul-smith	Client Served	5	06/28/2010	Excellent Health Center. Friendly, Knowledgeable & Caring Medical Staff. Ohua clinic admin staff are super helpful & friendly. I have on several occasions been very ill and the Medical & support staff have helped me get my health issues under control so I may get healthier and take back my life. Dr. Kalauawa has monitored my conditions and allowed me to make decisions in how my care will be handled. My recent health issue has been dealing with the diagnosis of Throat Cancer. Waikiki Health Center (WHC) has made it easier for me by being available to answer questions and help me co-ordinate my recovery. The WHC has shown that they truly care for their clients.
Hawaiian Monk Seal Response Team Oahu Inc	112662	5	/users/profile/153346	TGxx	Volunteer	1	05/22/2012	I have been a volunteer with HMSRTO for the past couple of years.In this time I have been dissapointed over and over again. HMSRTO consists of a board made of a group of women who are highly disorganised and secretive.They do not disclose anything related to the organisation, its plans, its strategies other than to board members or people they consider "close". They do not care, reward or cater in any way for all those volunteers who are at the beach constantly.They do not train volunteers, inform them of protocols or even safety/liability issues.  Although they get a substantial grant from NOAA and other donations, they do not produce anything. HMSRTO get all the material from NOAA and do not give any of that to any of the volunteers. It is up to the volunteers to figure out how to do things and how to do outreach. You will rarely see any of the board members at the beach, doing the harsh tasks.You will see them though at events with NOAA or places with press.Although they declare in their 990 Form 200 volunteers, the truth is they can only hold that amount of people during pupping events (2 months a year) and the rest of the year there are 15 volunteers if lucky. Those volunteers that do not enter the "club" of the Board members, are demeaned and ignored. They lie about their achievements to NOAA in order to justify the grant received.As a summary, do not become a volunteer for HMSRTO or invest in them. This is a private club not an NGO.
