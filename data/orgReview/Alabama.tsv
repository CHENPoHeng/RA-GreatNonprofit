KultureCity	232601	6	/users/profile/296149	wrinkles08,	General Member of the Public	5	11/02/2014	Kulture City is a non-profit organization that truly cares for the children They understand the issues that the children are going through. They listen to the parents about the needs of their child.  They then  help the parents to obtain the needed items that will help that child to get through their day, the school day or their night. Which in turn helps the whole family function easier. Kulture City is definitely a God-send. Other organizations should take a good look at themselves then follow in Kulture City's footsteps!
KultureCity	298836		/users/profile/389724	Angelicwolf7	General Member of the Public	5	08/01/2016	Kulturecity has helped my child and my family.

KultureCity	286795		/users/profile/376865	Kathie_B	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	The day the nightmare became a reality.I am a very active member of the disability community in my area.  I work with several families and I help them navigate the system.  I also have a child with multiple disabilities.  Having a child with a disability has made me hyper aware of her actions and surroundings because simple things become hazards to her.  She doesn't stay with me and has wandered out the door when I was simply using the bathroom.  These struggles are real.  You read about them in the paper and listen to them on the news but it just sounds like words until it really happens.  I received a phone call one night from a friend with a child with autism.  Her son had made it past 2 security gates and a locked door and made his way outside.  He is attracted to water and fell into the family Koi pond.  When he was found he was unresponsive.  She called me on the way to the hospital screaming in the way only a hurting mother could scream.  I met her at the hospital and held her hand all night watching her son as they did procedures and tests and poked and prodded.  He was very lucky and has pulled through.  He has permanent irreversible damage.  I set out the next day to find a way to prevent this.  I found http://kulturecity.org/ and their LifeBoks program.  LifeBOKS are kits provided to autism families designed to prevent wandering.  The kit contains an emergency plan, a QR code patch and shoe tag for first responders to scan for child's information, a Buddy Tag bracelet that children can wear to alert the family when the child goes out of range, and information booklets on autism and wandering.  This kit saves lives.  We need to get this kit in the hands of every special needs family in the world.  I immediately donated to the cause and I will continue to donate monthly until this kit is in the hands of every family with a special needs child.  Please help me save lives by giving to this charity.
KultureCity	286794		/users/profile/376864	Megan_W	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	Why Kulturecity inspires me...I've never seen an organization that truly cares as much as Kulturecity, they are not simply involved in what they do, they ARE what they do! Every person that is a part of Kulturecity has invested their entire hearts into what they do to help touch the lives of so many families across America. Not only do they help families in a multitude of ways but they also inspire them to make a difference in their own communities. I can honestly say this because not only have I seen it but I to have been inspired by them to reach out in my community to help others. Kulturecity is AUsome!
KultureCity	286793		/users/profile/376863	Elaine_S	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	By Giving I Have Received Blessings Tenfold! Kulturecity.org (Toys AUcross America) started a little over 2 years ago. I was one of the first several members so have had the priviledge to see the magical transformation that started with 'just a dad mailing trains'  grow into a phenomenal act of changing our Autistic kids by giving them voices,  offering ways to keep them safe, and as parents, giving us the opportunity to receive support from each other, and since Autism is a Spectrum,  there is not a 'one size fits all'...our kids are each unique in their own amazing ways!Giving to this organization just came natural, and in return I have received so many blessings and grown to love this 'family' Dillon and I belong to! Being Dillon's Guardian and having the support from Kulturecity has been life changing for me and I am forever thankful to Michael Miller and Juilan Maha for being such an inspiration to me!
KultureCity	286792		/users/profile/376862	Danae_B	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	Kulturecity.org helps autism families in so many ways. They are an organization near and dear to my heart. From giving away iPads to help children with autism find their voice to their LifeBOKS project to help keep children that wander safe and many things in between kulturecity is making a difference. As a parent to three children on the spectrum I can't begin to express how grateful I am for such an amazing organization. We have received help from them and that it why I donate to Kulturecity because it is an organization that I believe in and would stand behind 100%. Kulturecity.org could do so much good in the world of autism if they were to win.
KultureCity	286494		/users/profile/271451	wolfheart4499	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	I gave to Kulturecity because I personally have seen the miracles they have done for the autism community and the lives they touch. From the toy given to a child who wonders if anyone else cares, to a weighted blanket given to one that gives them peace to sleep through the night that the family couldn't afford, so the parents can finally rest themselves. Just a sounding board for those that need to know a group exsists that understands the trials it takes raising these blessings and how special each one truly is.
KultureCity	275440		/users/profile/271451	wolfheart4499	General Member of the Public	5	01/03/2016	Kulturecity reaches out to so many they bring families hope, smiles, voices, and joy. Many families suffer with lack of ability of communication they bring voices to those children and families making communication possible. Other families suffer sleepless nights due to fear and lack of comfort they provide heart warming weighted blankets providing the much needed help children need and the sleep so many of us parents need to continue the next day. Lastly so many children feel no one understands and cares about them Autism Santa lets these kids know there is someone who understands and cares for them he reaches out and brings a little bit of joy and a smile to there loving faces and a warm smile to the families knowing we are not alone there are others who care, others reaching out to help us others who care and are holding out there hand saying take it and we will guide you. If there is anyone out there who supports us as parents with a child on the autism spectrum it's Kulturecity 
KultureCity	286455		/users/profile/298129	Deborah V.	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	'Treat people the way you want to be treated', this is a quote I learned many many years ago from my parents. Little did I know, I would be repeating this same quote day after day to my son, hoping to raise him to be a kind young man who is diagnosed with Autism.  Although our family is unique with his special needs, it is non-profits and friends like Kulturecity that have given us so much joy and spread the joy to so many other families like our own.  It feels good to give, and to see those that 'get' is even more rewarding. They have an infectious giving theme that just keeps on giving.  Whether it be an iPad, a special surprise toy, a fun contest, or just a kind post on their Facebook page, they have shared many smiles across the country. Kulturecity deserves to win this grant, it will benefit many families across the miles.http://kulturecity.org/
KultureCity	238766	1	/users/profile/298129	Deborah V.	Client Served	5	03/02/2015	KultureCity is an amazing place for ASD families to feel welcome. Not only do we all get to chat in social media, but many get to meet in person and feel "normal" for once.  The gifts that KultureCity have provided to many families nationwide have been amazing and so well appreciated by all. We all have daily struggles, but just for a moment, the generous gifts give so many people happiness all around.  What an uplifting place for ASD families.
KultureCity	234052	2	/users/profile/298129	Deborah V.	General Member of the Public	5	11/19/2014	KultureCity is a fun way to feel like we belong in this society like every other typical family. With an Autistic child, it is hard to relate to many others on a daily basis. They provide us support on social media and many ways to win prizes for our kids and make each and every one of us matter.  
KultureCity	286450		/users/profile/271720	brat296405	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	I give because I can.  I have donated on a few occasions to Kulturecity. They help children and families affected by autism. This is a cause near and dear to me since I have a nephew and my son with an autism diagnosis. This organization goes out of their way to make a child's day. Www.kulturecity.org
KultureCity	208962		/users/profile/271720	brat296405	Donor	5	08/06/2014	I have followed these two groups for a few months now and have been amazed at all of the lives they have touched.  They are helping kids with autism to gain confidence and see that they do matter.  Not only are they helping the kids but they are also helping the parents.  It helps us see that the world is a caring place!
KultureCity	286449		/users/profile/272718	blumoonchick	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	Why I chose to give to Kulturecity! As a autism family. We had many doors shut  in our faces. I signed up through every autism organization I could find for help and not even getting a reply back. Then I was told my son needed an ipad for educational and communication needs. I knew there was no way I could ever afford a ipad. We were told about a brand new autism orgsnization from our home state. We were invited to kulturecity's very first Gala. There they gave out not one but five ipads to kids with autism from multiple states inside the U.S. Three from Alabama, one from Georgia and  one fromTexas. I knew right then. They were created to truly help kids with  autism. A community of acceptance is truly what they are. They also help teens with autism as well which makes them different than the rest. They stand with us  and we stand with them.! They more than deserve to win this contest. Please visit their page. www.kulturecity.org the number of children helped in the short time they have been open speaks for itself.

KultureCity	209983	2	/users/profile/272718	blumoonchick	Client Served	5	08/10/2014	I thought I already wrote a review but I can't seem to find it.  So I'm going to write another. I knew of Toys Aucross America. He and his son sent my son a stationary set because he loves to draw. I loved what eh was doing to help put a smile on kids with autism faces. One day he asked me to attend a event Kulturecity was having in Birmingham last February. A little back ground on my son.... he has learning disabilities and he don't write well. Unfortunately a few years back we had to sue our school system to get him the help he needed in school. They were suppose to provide my son with a ipad for his educational needs and to use as positive reinforcement ( they found a loop hole). Anyway After Michael contacted and told me about Kulturecity being a nonprofit for kids with Autism  and said the founder invited a specific number of families from his toys page to attend. I said sure I'll go I will support anything that helps kids with autism.  The only specifics I knew about the event was it was a night of basically relaxation and adult conversation for families with kids on the spectrum.  We got to meet other families who's children had autism, had a great time, great food and heard stories from other families that live with autism daily just like we do, We also heard some great music. At the end of the event Julian took the stage announced to the audience they had a special guest table that night and told that we represented Toys Aucross America and told about what TOYS done and also told them that everyone at our table had a child/children with Autism and he said that Kulturecity wanted to present each family with a ipad for their child on the spectrum. I was floored. I felt kind of bad because everyone else cried during the autism video presentation ( I didn't). I just sat there nodding my head like yepp that's right that's how it goes. Then when names were called for the ipads others were crying as they got theirs, I didn't all I could say was he's not going to sleep for a week lol. Why did I not cry? I think it's because my son is 17 now I have done had many years of crying  for many reasons and I'm not going to allow it to make me cry anymore. Autism is not our enemy its our teacher. People like Kulturecity and toys Aucross America are the people who truly raise up and take a stand to help our kids make milestones that others say they will never achieve. My son is older, never took a note in class until after he got the ipad from Kulturecity. Two weeks after he got it he came home from school all excited showing me the notes he had taken in Englsih class on his ipad.  Since his ipad his socialization has gotten better, his sentence forming has gotten better. I have to say his "friend" james used to say all the time he needed an ipad and how much one would help him. I was like no way it couldn't help that much.  Boy was I WRONG! I'll admit it, I'm not perfect I thought he was nuts for thinking that lol. But after  the progress he has made since having it. I'm the one that's nuts for not believing this one thing could have such a positive impact on my son.  After my experience with Kulturecity I decided I was going to back them full force. I started volunteering had others I know do the same. It's organizations like this who truly help kids/families of autism and they give the most back to these kids who need them the most! I am proud to say I STAND WITH KULTURECITY! 
KultureCity	286448		/users/profile/324161	blapee	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	Yes Garrett, there is a Santa Claus! About three years into the autism diagnosis of my son, I was at a very low place. The first year is filled with shock, denial, grief, and finally acceptance. The second year is a whirlwind of research, and phone calls, advocating and paperwork. By the third year, the emotional realization hits you. Autism is many things. It's a constant challenge. It's exhausting! It's EXPENSIVE! All of that, I expected. What I didn't expect, was that it would be so lonely. Even the family and friends that stick around, really don't get it. You can explain and explain, and unless you live with this thing day in, and day out, you don't get it. Fortunately, around year three, I stumbled across a post that was about Autism Santa. A dad, with a son on the spectrum, that wanted to give gifts to children on the spectrum. I was immediately intrigued. So, I joined a group that supported him. Through this group, I met lots of autism parents. Parents like me. Parents that GOT me. That understood my challenges, but more importantly, my triumphs! Autism Santa sent my son a gift. Just because. A spongebob flashlight. My son was so happy. He got mail. It was so much more than a flashlight! It was a lifeline. It was a community! A community where we were accepted. With all of our struggles and challenges, we were accepted. That single gesture, renewed my hope! I could face the struggles. Things were not so overwhelming that I would just sit and cry. I learned with time, that Autism Santa was just one piece of KultureCity. A nonprofit that supports the autism community. They provide immediate needs for families, as well as advocating for and executing initiatives that promote inclusion and acceptance for all autistic people. Through KultureCity, I have met the most amazing, fierce, giving people I've ever known. It is community helping community. It is family! I have supported many of KultureCity's projects. Wizard Talk, that provides Ipads to children, so they can have a voice. Toys Aucross America, that provide toys to children on the spectrum. The LifeBOKS program that provides lifesaving tools to wandering children. Why do I give? Because KultureCity gave me hope, when I needed it the most. Because KultureCity is a family, and that's what families do!
KultureCity	238751		/users/profile/324161	blapee	Client Served	5	03/02/2015	KultureCity is all of what is best about nonprofits and charity. They listen to the needs of the autism community, and find solutions for families. They give smiles and voices to children. It doesn't get any better than that!

KultureCity	286445		/users/profile/271682	Kayleen S.	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	Giving the gift of a smile.Doesn't get any better than that. We live basically paycheck to almost paycheck and things have always been tight. But a little over 2 years ago my 2 year old was officially diagnosed autistic. And honestly I'd barely heard of it. I cried for days, I sank into a pitty of tears and why me, why my daughter. I felt scared as if I had failed her. Then I googled, I searched, I looked high and low. I found many sites the first one not so helpful, I won't name any names but I'll say they offered me a packet to do a fundraiser and walk for them. However they were unable to help me with any other help as my daughter wasn't in their criteria as considered she was a girl and not a boy and I guess they is more of a boy issue ( funny I've got three girls on various end of the spectrum and not a boy one ) . Then I found Kulturecity and was instantly welcomed, I got various opinions from their 'groupies' on their page . My girls were sent a toy and man the smile on their face that someone they've never met cared enough to send them a gift in the mail was more than enough to warm my heart. I've donated and helped out as much as possible because everything they have it paid forward. However my most memorable donation was a couple of gifts I sent to Santa for autism Christmas. I bet you didn't know we have a special Christmas for our special kids. Many of us received mail to be opened on April ( autism awareness month ) 25th . And many of us cooked and celebrate ( toned down a bit ) same as we do for December 25th. I now try to set aside a little a paycheck for when special events or fundraiser are being done. Because I can not think of a better way to pay it forward. They are the all about the smiles of our kids, my kids, your kids.
KultureCity	238725		/users/profile/271682	Kayleen S.	Client Served	5	03/02/2015	I have not one or two but three little wizards ( autistic ) I can not give enough praise for this organization.. They help us, you, me and our kids with not only material things but a shoulder and resources for us struggling with the understanding of this new world we've entered. They will help with weighted blankets for the kids ( not weighing the CEO's wallet ) iPads for the voiceless  ( not trophies for walking ).. They mail out Birthday toys and surprise toys mailed out to our kids ( and the smile from this is one of the best things you'll ever experience when you've got a socially awkward kid who feels so sad ... And let's not forget about autism Santa.. He brought such heart into making sure he could help as many kids who might of otherwise gone without have something for Christmas ( don't see any other speaking charities do something like this ) When you choose to stand with kulturecity you are choosing to be a part of the solution for acceptance and helping the kids. I stand with kulturecity . And they stand for me!!! We can and we will.

KultureCity	275499		/users/profile/365114	Jennifer512	Client Served	5	01/04/2016	Kulture City is absolutely AU-mazing! So many organizations out there when a parent like myself starts the search for information and help after learning of our childs diagnosis. Over time, you begin to realize a majority only operate at their "face value" - or what people "see". Most just spit out duplicated information, never listen or hear us and rarely help. Kulture City is NOT one of them! Through their various programs they offer help in so many areas to our special kids - BouqKulture - for us relentless SuperMoms, TabletKulture - to help our kids learn and grow in ways they GET, Toys AUcross America has made my son smile with a special gift just for him!, LifeBoks for other parents like me that are terrified of their childs wandering tendencies, and so many other things they do daily - NOT for the bottom dollar THEY can earn but for OUR KIDS! PLEASE support Kulture City and all the amazing things they REALLY do each and every day

KultureCity	275496		/users/profile/365110	Writer	Client Served	5	01/03/2016	Kulturecity is a remarkable nonprofit. You may think they just supply toys to autistic children, but it's so much more. For many, they supply the first smile seen in weeks, the hope of acceptance, the glimmer of understanding. They send toys to our children who struggle being accepted, making friends. Not only do they offer support and understanding, with their Lifeboks campaign, they are also providing our children safety....what more can you call an organization who helps differently abled children feel wanted and accepted, provide parents toys for their children they might couldn't afford, and most of all look out for the safety and well being of our children? You can't call the organization anything but remarkable. The numbers of autism diagnosises are rising, but thanks to Kulturecity, so are AUsome smiles.
KultureCity	275491		/users/profile/365106	Sue_130	General Member of the Public	5	01/03/2016	Kulturecity is a wonderful nonprofit organization that really makes a difference in the autism community. They help us parents feel a connection to other autism families we otherwise wouldn't have. All of the money raised helps these families, not some faceless CEO buy another house. They allow the family to fundraise for an ipad! I was the lucky recipient of 2 dozen red roses on my birthday no less. They partnered with the Bouqs to send flowers to show they care about us as caregivers. They give us a voice, they give our kids a chance at some kind of normalcy we usually don't get to experience much, if at all! Thank You Kulturecity for all you do!!
KultureCity	275489		/users/profile/365102	Joni11	General Member of the Public	5	01/03/2016	This is a fantastic non profit organization that provides much needed support to the autism community. Not only do they reach out locally, but they're always looking for new ways and new ideas to help families affected by autism across the world. It is a truly amazing organization and I'm glad to have found them. I've been an autism sister for years but just started my journey as an autism parent.

KultureCity	233761		/users/profile/297689	Jennifer428	General Member of the Public	5	11/15/2014	Kulturecity not only encourages, but empowers families on their autism journey. There is so much expense involved that we may not be able to provide every device out there. Through their acceptance they make it possible to provide extra opportunities to those that may not be able do personally. They go above and beyond to provide, advocate awareness and teach acceptance. They allow us an outlet to further help our children outside of school and therapy without limitations. Everyone's journey is different and Kulturecity treats us as individuals and not a statistic. I am forever grateful for this amazing group.

KultureCity	275481		/users/profile/365098	jenannhayden	General Member of the Public	5	01/03/2016	I am the parent of 2 sons who have Autism. It definitely has been a challenge to be a parent to two children with special needs and I am so fortunate that there are nonprofits like Kulturecity. What I love about Kulturecity is that they provide actual support to individuals with Autism and their families. So many nonprofits take so much of their money for administrative fees or to fund research that does not actually benefit anyone who has Autism. Kulturecity actually supports individuals with Autism in a very meaningful and tangible way.  One of my favorite projects that they support is lifeBOKS, a kit that has many helpful items to help keep children with Autism who wander safe. Both of my boys wander and I can't even begin to explain the terror I have felt when they have gotten out of my sight for even a moment. This project truly can help save lives. Just this past week a child with Autism lost his life because of wandering. I have been proud to support Kulturecity and lifeBoks.  They also provide tablets to individuals with Autism. For our oldest who is non-verbal, an iPad truly has been life changing. It is amazing to hear him communicate (and sometimes argue or nag!) with his device. It is something that every child with Autism should have access to and Kulturecity has provided 972 tablets and counting!! Kulturecity has also very deservingly received the following awards: Microsoft Upgrade Your World - October 29, 2015,  Toms of Maine 50 States of Good-December 3, 2015 and Winner of Great Nonprofits 2015 non profit award- December 23, 2015 Every dollar that is donated supports individuals with Autism. Let's all stand with Kulturecity!

KultureCity Worked with our favorite restaurant (Post Office Pies) to make it sensory friendly for our little guy. Thank you!!
KultureCity	275477	5	/users/profile/365093	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	01/03/2016	Kulturecity's battle cry is acceptance, inclusion, and a limitless future for those affected by autism. But what separates this non profit from others is it isn't just words for them, it's action. The amount of work this organization puts into changing the way the world views autism is breathtaking. They get it. They get what it feels like for your child to be stared at in restaurants. They get what it feels like for your child to be grossly underestimated in school. They get what it feels like to not be able to take your child places like the zoo because the sheer amount of possible meltdown triggers is overwhelming. They get it. And because they get it, we get an organization fighting for us. Helping us. Showing us. Because sometimes, as a mom with a precious 4 year old little boy with autism, I need someone to fight for me. I need help. I need someone to show me. They have been a light for my family, and for countless other families that need them. Here are just some of the things they do:Send free LifeBOKS to families to help educate about and prevent wandering.Send free toys to children that provide social, emotional, sensory, and communicative stimulation for families that cannot provide them.Provide free camps, zoo nights, science museum trips and holiday parties to families with children with special needs. Send free iPads to children with autism so they may learn and communicate in a manner that is tailored to them. Have global goals as well as domestic, such as aiding children in Uganda where 97% of special needs children are denied a primary education.Help businesses through their Sensory Friendly Initiative to recognize the needs of people with sensory issues. Through therapy designed training they work with businesses and organizations to help create more sensory friendly environments so people like me can bring our families out with minimal problem. This in particular has been and will continue to be the most helpful for my family. It's a phenomenal organization, and we are eternally grateful that they care enough to help us.

As a mom with a child with special needs including autism, it makes me hopeful for all kids like Jacob that people do care and the world will be a more friendly place for him to live in.
KultureCity	275467		/users/profile/365082	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	01/03/2016	KultureCity is an organization that cares about the needs of special families! They see the needs of those families and meet them with no questions asked or anything expected! As a family, we have been able to have our very first family portrait taken because of their generosity! KultureCity also heard about the struggles that our son had sleeping and had a weighted blanket made specifically for his needs!We are exceptionally thankful for KultureCity and their efforts to support those with disabilities and the families of those individuals who are oftentimes unseen! Thank you so much!

KultureCity	275465		/users/profile/365080	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	01/03/2016	After my son was diagnosed with autism & SPD, I knew it was solely up to me to reach out & find the resources to help my son. Being a single mother is hard. But being a single mother to a child with special needs, has truly shown me the strength & willpower that I have to do what is best & needed for my babyboy. After finding Kulturecity, the generosity & genuine concern that is given from this great organization is truly an empowering & amazing feeling. After being blessed with a weighted blanket for my son from Kulturecity, I cried tears of happiness. My son was FINALLY able to sleep through the night, & so was I. It was truly a lifesaving experience for me, & me and my son are both so much more healthy that we are getting an adequate amount of sleep due to the generosity of this organization, versus the maybe 2 hours of sleep we would get at night before the weighted blanket. There are not enough stars in the sky to be able to thank you for all that you do by blessing these special needs families with all of these wonderful & resourceful items. I am sure that I speak for many when I say you are so very appreciated!!! Always looking forward to being taught more & given the generous opportunities to have resourceful & beneficial things for my son. Thank you for being there for me, Kulturecity. I dont know what I would do without you!

So we got a zoo membership.Now our family goes on a regular basis. We can take our time at the zoo and we are never have to rush to see all the animals. Now learjng about animals is fun and we have a fun place to go on a regular basis. The difference they had between last year and this year with the boo and the zoo was huge. I would only want to go to a boo at the zoo by kulture city. I look forward to more experiences created for children with autism by kulture city. 
KultureCity	275458		/users/profile/365071	Sunny6	General Member of the Public	5	01/03/2016	I first found out about Kulture City when the Autism Society of Alabama posted on their Facebook page that they were offering reduced cost family memberships to the Birmingham Zoo. I emailed with Mallory and sure enough it was legitimate! I could not believe it since we had been wanting a membership and then this seemingly fell into our laps! I would bring it up to my son's Early Intervention coordinator and she mentioned that she had recently met someone from KC as well and was very excited for the things they were doing in our community! Since then we have seen Kulture City popping up everywhere, sponsoring lots of events and spreading awareness and education in our community. As the mother of two little ones on the Autism spectrum, I am so thankful for everyone who works at KC and what they are doing for my children.
KultureCity	275456		/users/profile/365069	Ruby9	General Member of the Public	5	01/03/2016	KultureCity is such an AMAZING non-profit organization. My son was diagnosed earlier last year. I had NO idea what I was doing, what it meant. I was completely lost until I found KultureCity. I am so unbelievably blessed to be apart of this "family". 
KultureCity	275452		/users/profile/271467	MRSheila	General Member of the Public	5	01/03/2016	What can I say that hasn't already been said; I found Kulturecity shortly after my youngest son was diagnosed with autism and immediately knew I had stumbled upon something life changing. I knew very little about autism but was quickly connected to all the resources I needed to better understand and deal with my sons diagnosis. I have found support through this organization that I couldn't get even from family and friends. When my older son was diagnosed with autism, GDD, SPD and ADHD several months later I wasn't as overwhelmed because I knew I had Kulturecity standing with us. Along with the support and resources, I have received a pair of noise canceling headphones which have, in my opinion saved us from multiple meltdowns when sensory overload struck. In addition I received a LifeBOKS which in itself has helped me be able to sleep better at night and relax a little more when we are out in public thanks to the buddy tag. All of these things are great but the thing that impresses me most about Kulturecity is 100% of the donations they receive go towards their cause; no one is kicking back getting rich here, they are truly a non profit in the sense that they are not making a profit, they did not venture into this to make money but instead they did it to make a difference and a difference they have made.
KultureCity	238738		/users/profile/271467	MRSheila	Client Served	5	03/02/2015	I discovered Kulturecity through the amazing Michael "Autism Santa" Miller who runs Toys AUcross America and fell in love with them from the start. All you have to do is hear about the great things they are doing within the autism society to know they truly care and are not in this to line their own pockets like other so called charities out there. There are many out there who claim to be working for those with autism but Kulturecity is a charitable organization that actually fulfills those claims. I have two sons with autism and my family and I are proud to #StandWithKulturecity. My youngest son received a very nice pair of noise cancelling headphones from them last summer  to help with some sensory issues he has and they have made a huge difference in his life. I will forever be grateful to Kulturecity for this and will continue to share and promote them every chance I get.
KultureCity	208719		/users/profile/271467	MRSheila	Client Served	5	08/05/2014	Kulturecity and Toys AUcross America are amazing non profits supporting the autism community.

Toys AUcross America sent them both several Thomas the Train toys and we also won a weighted blanket through a giveaway that they sponsored. My youngest son was also chosen to receive a pair of Bose Noise Canceling Headphones which have been great with his sensory issues. They are doing wonderful things to raise not only awareness but also acceptance. 
KultureCity	275451	1	/users/profile/365065	Writer	Client Served	5	01/03/2016	When I felt like all of the air had been sucked out of my lungs by my 11year old daughter's delayed ASD diagnosis, I stumbled upon an irreplaceable family on the Internet. I found "Michael, the Autism Santa" and Kulturecity. With a touch of a finger on an IPad, my world was suddenly filled with support and hope. I had immediate access to parents, just like me. We are all on our own unique journey to be the best parents to our amazing children, who happen to have their brains wired in a unique way. Not only did my daughter receive help from Kulturecity, we learned how one toy at a time can change the life of so many children and families across America. We began to send our books, toys, clothes, and prayers to others too.  My children have learned by example. From the concept created by Michael's son to share his trains that he no longer played with, to opening up a world of speech and assistance by creating a fundraising program to gift IPads to our amazing spectrum kids, Kulturecity started a revolution. Not just our family, but so many others have risen to the challenge to improve the lives of our children, one gift at a time.I'm no longer alone. I'm no longer breathless. Because of Kulturecity, I'm able to breathe and am filled with hope. Now that you have finished reading my review, ask yourself this question: How can you make a difference? Now...go do it!Photo is of my ASD daughter and her weighted blanket...thanks to the remarkable people connected to Kulturecity.

Kulturecity and their Lifeboks program have given us another level of safety for our son who has Autism. Our boy is the world to us and we do what we can to keep him safe. But because we are human there are always those possibilities of a split second being too much and something could happen and he could be gone. With the tools that are provided with the Lifebok we can keep him even more protected. This is an organization who has taken it upon themselves to care not for just one child with autism but ALL people with autism. They strive to make the tragedy we see in the news of another autistic child taken too soon do to wandering a thing of the past and protect our kids. Angels on earth is the best description I can put into words.

KultureCity	271023		/users/profile/359781	Writer	Client Served	5	11/03/2015	I can't even begin to express just how wonderful they are!  My almost 4 year old son has delays due to being on the autistic spectrum.  They provided him with his own ipad mini to work on!  This is SO good for him because he can practice his speech therapy, do his learning activities and all he needs to do on his own device.  No more having to try and do it on our old shared and worn out tablet!  This is going to be such a great tool for him to reach his goals.  Very thankful and excited for him!  Great organization that really helps children in need!

Now they are trying to provide LifeBoks for wandering autistic kids.  Since autistic kids have no fear, they often wander on streets, railroad tracks and into the water. Every penny they raise goes toward helping the kids.  Last year, my grandson escaped from a second floor classroom and was located only a few minutes later, walking down the railroad tracks toward a busy street. We are waiting for his LifeBoks to be delivered.

They've helped my son more than I think they even know, because they have not just helped with one child providing an IPad to my oldest son, but later finding out my youngest son is on the Spectrum as well has helped him too! They helped both of my sons, and doing so has helped me. I can help my children learn and grow because of them, if it wasn't for KultureCity's generosity there would be parents not sleeping because they're children can't sleep who now sleep better because of weighted blankets, providing IPads for our children to speak, learn and grow... for helping to put smiles on our children's faces through Toys....

KultureCity	238753		/users/profile/324164	Mae P.	General Member of the Public	5	03/02/2015	I came across this organization by accident on Facebook. I thank god everyday that a friend commented on a post and it randomly came across my feed. I have a autistic 3 yr old that says about 20 words. I have a iPhone and he has learned so much from playing on it, but I couldn't let him have it cause it is my only life line. I have tried for 7 months now to try and find a way to get him a iPad. My husband was in a motorcycle wreck last year and we have been playing catch up with the bills so we couldn't afford one. No one has been able to help us. I tried to get his speech therapist to recommend a dinovox for him, and she works in the school Dist so she said "no he will be exposed to all of that when he gets to school". All I have wanted for him is the tool to help him be more verbal. The worst thing in the world is not knowing what your baby needs. I imagine the worst thing for him is knowing what you need and not being able to say it. I've waited 3 yrs to hear the word mommy. I was about to give up hope until by accident the wizard talk ipad thing came across my feed. I thought, well it doesn't hurt to try. So I did. I made a fundraiser for the iPad thinking it was a longshot. I could barley breath from crying so hard when we hit the 200$ mark and I knew we had done it. 3 days later our iPad came in the mail. I have NEVER felt so relieved in all my life. I have never had a organization that was so quick to help us in our time of need, and made it so easy to get the help. I am FOREVER GREATFULL to everyone involved in this amazing organization. They have given us a LIFE CHANGING device. It might just be a iPad to some people, to us it's the gift of speech. I would recommend this organization to anyone that is looking to donate to a reputable org that actually helps REAL people. I thank you all!!! MY FAITH IN HUMANITY IS RESTORED. BECAUSE OF YOU. God bless you all. Mae and Harry Pennington

KultureCity	238728		/users/profile/324131	Rae B.	Client Served	5	03/02/2015	KultureCity is really a one-stop source for everything.  They bring together multiple smaller groups under a larger umbrella to serve the larger Autism community.  If I have a need for my child, I look to KultureCIty.   If KultureCity cannot fore-fill it they will find someone who can.  And then they go the route of "how many others would benefit ...." and if find a larger need they look into bring another group under the umbrella.  They exist to help parents find the small business  "supporting Autism one child at a time."  Their existence is for the CHILD not the attention!  Other large Autism groups are about the money not the child!

He has had to take medication just to fall asleep and a different medication to stay asleep, for years.  After having success with a weighted vest to aide with focus and attention during school, we decided to look into the weighted blankets, but due to financial issues at home, we were unable to afford one.  Thanks to the kindness of KultureCity, we were provided a free blanket for our son.  He has started using it and is slowly lowering the dose of medication.  Some nights he has even gone without!

KultureCity	236143		/users/profile/319951	CGreenawalt	Client Served	5	01/01/2015	Kulturecity gave me the ability to fundraise and earn an IPad for my son. He has Autism and is nonverbal so this was a huge help to us.  We  earned an iPad and it came in a few days later. At the advice of his Speech Therapist we purchased a communication app and now he is learning to communicate through the iPad. Meltdowns are happening less and my little man is less frustrated because we are able to understand him better. He's no longer trapped in his own head and he finally has a voice. In time he will learn to communicate all of his needs through the app. Kulturecity made this possible for us. My son's quality of life is better and it has made my family's life easier. This is an amazing gift to us but it's not the only thing they do. Kulturecity also provides weighted blankets to children who can't afford them otherwise. They are advocates for children on the spectrum and their families. They are selfless, generous, amazing people who seek not just awareness, but acceptance of Autism. They are an inspiration and they have  touched the hearts of so many families in the autism community.  I'd give them a million stars if I could.

My two boys received an iPad to share through their project called Wizard Talk last summer. I can't express how much that iPad has helped us out. My younger son who has ASD and a severe speech delay has used therapy apps to improve his speech and with learning apps has even started to read. My older son who has Asperger's and severe disgraphia has used the iPad to type papers and do schoolwork that used to be so hard for him. Just regular games have helped my boys function in public settings that were previously nearly impossible for them to function in due to outbursts. The visual schedules on the iPad has saved me hours of drawing my own picture schedules for them like I used to do in the past. Thank you so much Kuturecity for making this all possible for us.

KultureCity	236134		/users/profile/277615	MamaKat816	Client Served	5	01/01/2015	I heard about an organization that gave toys to children with Autism to simply make them happy and I checked them out via Facebook. We have a 4 years old on the spectrum and we were having a difficult time affording sensory therapy toys to help her be comfortable in her own home. I assumed like most charities associated with Autism the need would overwhelm the resources available, but applied anyways. I kid you not the very next day I had an email from KultureCity asking what would make my Sophia happy. Just that simple. They didn't want to "cure or fix" her, they just wanted to give her the excitement of getting a package in the mail with the gift of her choice inside. We settled on a color changing wave projector that played mp3s and put ocean waves on her bedroom ceiling. If I could post a video you would see a very excited little girl squealing in delight. When Sophia has a good day I am allowed to have a good day. When I see my little girl that happy I am over the moon, so its just huge for us. KultureCity is an organization that sees the importance of the little things in life which means the world to us because that is how having Autism in our home has taught us to live. Its about the good days, the squeals of excitement, the full nights of sleep, the smiles, and the reassurance that there are charities out there that see value in the same things as our ausome community. Thank you KultureCity for all that you do. Big love and support from Kansas City, Missouri. **Update** Since my review KultureCity has launched a fundraiser called WizardTalk. This miraculous fundraised raised over $21,000 and gifted over 70 iPads to children with autism in just 4 short months, including my daughter Sophia. We could have never been able to afford this for Sophia on our own, and because she is non verbal this is a tool that will help her literally find a voice in the world. Her therapists recommend apps and I can now carry over her therapy lesson over into a home setting. My daughter is now thriving, and I owe so much of her success to Kulturecity. They don't do what they do for money or recognition. Unlike other big name so called autism "non-profits" every penny goes towards helping our community. Those big names could learn a thing our two from these guys. Amazing people, doing amazing things, for amazing people.

Client Served	5	11/27/2014	I have two children on the spectrum, both diagnosed this year...(after years of incorrect diagnosis)...All I can say is I am beyond grateful that was introduced to KultureCity.  I have only been on this sight for a couple of months and have seen this organization truly give 100percent back to the community.  I have watched as they have blessed families and children in the autism community.  I feel like we are all family here, there is no bashing and everything done is for the uplifting of our kids.  (And when they are uplifted, we the parents/guardians cant help but to be uplifted as well) If I hadn't connected to this Ausome group, I would not have learned to advocate for my own children, but seeing that this group cares so much...it has empowered me to speak up not only for my two, but others as well.  I don't honestly know that I could have done that on my own, but it is definitely something to be connected to so many others that are of one mind and one accord.  Truly there is strength and power in Unity and I am just honored to be part of this Amazing organization.

I am a single mother and things can be very hard. I have very little help locally, knowing that there is a group of people out there who truly care and want to offer support is inspiring. Matter of fact, I have had direct dealings with Michael and he has inspired me to reach out in my community locally. I am unable to offer financial aid, but I do volunteer at local fund raising events, and I am a parent support. I have witnessed the incredible impact one person can make.  I don't feel so alone when I see organizations working so tirelessly in ensuring families have the support they need. I see this to be true of KultureCity. I will be forever for being a recipient of their generosity. This can be a hard road to travel...this world is not accommodating to those with ASD. To see KultureCity work so hard to ensure children are provided the tools needed to make their life just a bit easier is heartwarming. Not only do they work tirelessly to provide devices for children, they offer moral encouragement and support to families. I hope that they are around for years to come. I will do what I can to make that happen.

In April of 2014 we finally got the final answer and my daughter was diagnosed with Moderate Autism, and others. I was lost how to help her. She could say maybe 15-20 words, and total meltdowns. I had not been able to receive any grants or help with anything for her autism- till I found KC! They helped get my daughter an ipad mini which has amazing apps that help with transitions, speech, simple things we take for granted. I literally cried when I got the approval email. Had to verify to make sure it was "real", because nothing like this has EVER happened to us. Thank you so much for giving my baby a voice, and to help with the struggles that she shouldnt have to deal with this young.  Love an Autism Mama,Krystle.
KultureCity	234245	1	/users/profile/298393	Rae R.	Client Served	5	11/22/2014	I have been both a donor and a recipient from KultureCity.  I am a single mother with three young kids, all of whom have special needs, two of whom have autism.  Through KultureCity I was able to receive an Ipad mini for my son who is considered nonverbal due to his autism.  It has helped him so much.  He is able to communicate what he wants or what he needs or what is wrong with him where as before he was unable to do this.  It has brought such peace to our home.  My son was also a recipient of a weighted blanket through blanketKulture.  The weighted blanket has helped my son feel safe at night, it helps him to relax, it has provided much needed sleep for all members of our house.  Both of these things that we have received from KultureCity have tremendously helped our family.  KultureCity truly cares about children and families dealing with autism.  They have provided the means and ways for families with autism to empower those living with autism.  They have programs for multiple things, from ToysAUcrossAmerica, blanketKulture, therapyKulture, and tabletKulture to help families living with autism.  Much of what is needed to help a person living with Autism is not covered by insurance and the items are not cheap.  Families living with autism are often living with fixed or limited income and KultureCity has provided a way for those families to obtain much needed items to help and empower them.  KultureCIty truly cares about families affected by autism!  Thank you KultureCity for all that you have done and all that you continue to do!!!!

KultureCity	234241		/users/profile/298390	Andrea119	Donor	5	11/22/2014	I love this organization, and the branch they support ToysAucrossAmerica. My son has autism and it is difficult to find programs who get the struggles we actually face. They break things down to the simplest form, a toy in the mail, that completely transforms a  child with autisms day. Which in turn affects the whole family. I know they also give families iPads for the child with autism, which is amazing because a child with autism sometimes cannot speak, and those that can  have a hard time relaying what they want or need. The iPad program differs from any other organization because all fundraising is directly sent to the families raising the money in the form of an iPad, no money is going to "corporate bigwigs" which really directly and immediately impacts the families.

KultureCity	233777		/users/profile/297715	Sawyer W.	Client Served	5	11/16/2014	My son is 9 year old and has moderate to high functioning Autism.  Through Kulturecity.org we were able to raise enough money for him to receive an iPad mini!  I cannot tell you just how much that will mean to my son or how much the support of kulturecity.org has meant to me and my family.  Before I found this organization I was beyond stressed about helping my son to communicate when he is overwhelmed, anxious and/or scared.  You see, Aidric is verbal but like many kids with moderate/high functioning autism will shut down when overwhelmed and iPad has an amazing FREE texting app that will allow him to communicate with me during these times.   The iPad also helps him to self calm in stressful situations and without Kulturecity.org my son would not have a voice.  Kulturecity.org is in my opinion the BEST non profit organization for autistic kids!

While we haven't received anything from them, I've been pouring through their sites looking at all the amazing work they do. They truly are the autism Santa. I have set up a fundraising page for my son, who is 7 and has autism and sensory processing disorder. I'm hoping to win an iPad for him. I can't say enough good things about the great work of this organization. I've shared it with my local autism support community as well.

KultureCity has an amazing program that arranged for many families to enjoy a special needs/sensory friendly night at the Birmingham Zoo. Today, my son received his iPad and that is a gift that cannot be valued monetarily. He didn't want to go to bed without it and that changed his routine, which never happens so it is priceless in our minds.  
KultureCity	233700		/users/profile/297616	Kim_168	Client Served	5	11/14/2014	I think wizard talk is amazing. I raised over $300 in less than a week just by sharing on Facebook.  This $  went to an iPad for my autistic daughter with a language disorder. The left over $ went towards another iPad to benefit a child.  We have some great apps on there that are teaching her more words. She also loves to color so she is coloring pics on the iPad instead of my walls!! It's a win win situation. Having a child with autism is challenging and it's hard work. Anything that helps our children to express themselves or learn is "ausome"! I'm so thankful for this project as I'm in no place to afford an iPad right now. I had complete strangers donate. People DO care. Raising autism awareness is so important!

KultureCity and Wizard Talk made it possible for my daughter to receive a little bit of sensory relief through an iPad mini through there fundraiser page.  It has been a little over a week since they blessed my daughter with her iPad and I can already see changes in my daughters sensory disorder. Noises and sights that are hard for her to handle  are becoming easier and the smile on her face, so much brighter! KultureCity has also helped me in knowing that I'm NOT alone and my child deserves a voice! Thank you KultureCity and Wizard Talk! Set up a fundraiser page and help your child and someone else's receive there little bit of sensory relief.

I am so very impressed by what they do that it has inspired me to make donations on my own to help other families with children on the autism spectrum.  Our family has been touched by autism several times and we count ourselves blessed to have our family as it is.  The folks at Kulturecity see it the same way!  We are all blessed by our lot in life!  Most impressive is how Kulturecity manages to put iPads in the hands of so many children...  I aspire to do as much good as they have done and continue to do.

They are a group who center their whole effort and attention on the children with Autism. Their humbleness is notice immediately and are daily working and looking for ways to receive donations for the children to receive a gift that will bring benefits to them, but mostly smiles by simply seeing that a box arrived with their name on it. All donations go strait to purchasing toys, iPads, mini iPads for the children. May God continue to bless this organization including their partners.

They have touched so many lives including my own when they sent my son a Minecraft toy that made him so happy. The toy's the iPads the love and caring of this Organization is just amazing and they are REAL! They don't take the profits and pay for garbage like wages of big corp. members, pricy advertising, they do it the cheap old fashioned way, Word Of Mouth and oh has it spread from one happy parent to another! This is the new wave of love, acceptance and genuine care of our children in the Autism Community and they go by Kulturecity  I wish there would of been organizations like this back when my son (17) was diagnosed. Even though he is older and we had to go through a lot of the struggles alone, Organizations like this are a blessing giving me resources and guidance though his teenage years when it can be very trying. I look forward to getting to become more involved and meeting other wonderful parents.

Amazing enough I put my app in and she called with some question about my son and she so sweet , understanding and the most non selfish person on this earth , two to three weeks I ago I received he's blanket and I cried I was so happy and it has been have on earth having this blanket and I owe it all to yall. Thank you beyond words. And in between the time of waiting for hes blanket I won a beautiful bracelet that I adored.

LOVE,  what I found and read.  I always find answers to questions I may have in regards to my grandaughter which I have gained custody of and is 4 years old and just diagnosed this past summer with Autism an she has a lot of other health issues . I can say that Kulture City goes  above and beyond to help families, weather they are providing weighted blankets, iPads, advise or support. They are always there to help,answer questions. An are truly caring of your needs. I have to say Kulture CIty Totally ROCKS!!!
KultureCity	233532		/users/profile/297376	Chrissy E.	General Member of the Public	5	11/12/2014	Awesome people. Caring people. They seem to really genually care about what they are doing and the children they are helping. I follow the toys across America FB page and just seeing the children that are benefiting by receiving an iPad or a toy puts a smile on my face. Genuine people are very few and far between now and days. When you find someone genuine you have to make sure to keep them close and treat them right. :) I hope these people continue to be able to do what they are doing and are able to keep helping these children. It's such an awesome amazing thing and I hope that maybe one day I can do something of the same.

It's hard to put into words the way that these things can effect our kids and knowing that someone out there is just as concerned and aware of the struggles we face is what makes this organization truly shine.

KultureCity	233016	2	/users/profile/296670	allisonmacintyre	Client Served	5	11/05/2014	When I first heard about KultureCity it was thru a news article a while ago.  They provided a sensory box with an iPad included to a restaurant in Birmingham for children with Autism to use to prevent meltdowns, and keep them calm so a family could sit down and truly enjoy a meal.  I immediately wanted to learn more about their program because we have found ourselves in tough situations while trying to eat as well.  The main thing I learned about KC is how a REAL charity should operate.  I've seen them donate countless iPads, weighted blankets and even sending mothers of children with autism flowers.  A true reminder letting them know that they are not alone.  Which is beyond beautiful and amazing.  I made the decision to apply for my son to get an iPad after seeing the application on their website and he recently received one in the mail.  We are SO SO SO incredibly thankful.  We did make the decision to apply for one child while knowing that the device would actually serve our family in many ways.  Two of my three children have autism and the third was diagnosed with a language disorder.  A device such as an iPad would have always been a complete game changer but with having three very special and sweet boys the funds were never there to make it a reality.  Thru KultureCity's generosity, it has become a reality.    I truly can't wait to see the mountain of progress unfold.  This has been such an amazing day and it's BEYOND refreshing to find a charity who actually HELPS families instead of merely claiming to.  KultureCity is the real deal and the people behind the program are simply amazing.  From the bottom of our hearts, thank you, thank you, thank you.

KultureCity	232901	2	/users/profile/296532	donorone	Donor	5	11/04/2014	i have done quite a bit of research into this organization and some things about their approach are very unique. They started out by looking at what was wrong with autism charities in general and fixing those issues (transparency, accountability, engagement, embracing technology and impact). Because of this, they have truly been able to impact so many children, families and individuals in a truly amazing way. This nonprofit also has almost no overhead which made donating to them such a joy because I knew all my money went to the actual population served by KultureCity.  I would encourage everyone to look closely at the nonprofit you donate to. DON'T just donate becuase it is a name brand non profit. A donation should be treated like an investment and you should ALWAYS know your actual money's impact.  Please consider supporting KultureCIty and taking a stand for autism acceptance.

The zoo regularly has an event like this open to the general public. But our family, along with many others in our area, don't get to go because of the crowd issue. I was amazed and touched deeply that they would open it back up on a day that is just specifically for our kids that they may also enjoy the fun of Halloween! I was also told they would be doing a Christmas event for our children as well! It feels so good to be able to take my son to events and activities that he will enjoy! Also looking on their website, they do so much more for the autism community and for our kids! So proud I found them and I have signed up for their newsletter and hope to be able to attend more events and also volunteer and help in any way I can!

If they selected your picture, you won an ipad mini. Taking pictures of my ausome autistic son Avi can be challenging. The first contest i couldn't get him out if his room. First picture blurry but he smiled :) later they announced an upcoming second chance to win an ipad mini. Avi is 10 and in the 3rd grade. When Avi was 16 months he, well he just stopped stopped looking at me. Talking stopped. It's been a very long journey with autism and it's only the beggining. I can say one thing " we got this" .  So on the fourth we headed downtown Indianapolis, to watch the fireworks. Picnic, headphones and our sign. In the middle of the show i called to Avi infront of me and asked was he liking the fireworks. He turned and said" i like them". I handed him our sign and snap. Perfect! In the end my Avi got a virtual standing ovation. Sitting happier than ever fireworks in the background headphones secure :)  winning the ipad was awesome! Very fixed income. I have banned cable from my house , i just don't care for it. But the ipad was the best gift ever. I can give him all the efucational and  netflix :) he can handle. It's also a great source of stsying on task and being responsable with charging. Thank you Kulturecity for thst opportunity.

Now thanks to Kulturecity he has an Ipad all his own that he can use to tell us what he wants, how he feels, and what he needs. Since he received his Ipad he has had no meltdowns and is just so much happier in general.

They help children on the Autism spectrum by giving them things like toys, cause what kid doesn't like toys? They also provide items such as weighted blankets ,which can help some kids calm down at night and help them sleep, and IPads which can be an extremely useful tool to help with communication and every day routines as well as just a safe outlet for the kids to play games on. Overall this charity is one of the best around. It's all about the kids with them. UPDATE: My daughter received an iPad min around Christmas time and I can't wait for school to start up again so I can talk to her O.T. about her using it in school to help with note taking and such. Again these guys are one of the best out there.

We thought he might have it for about 2 years now because we were getting random people telling us that he acts like their autistic child. He was born with Hydrocephalus so at the time we listened to the doctors who were saying that the way he acts is because of his Hydrocephalus. Well, this year he turned 4 years old and he started hitting himself on the head and throwing extremely bad tantrums where he would hit everyone around him (including his sister) and he would hit himself with walls, floor or anything else he could get his hands on. We were pretty worried when all of this started especially since we were on a trip out of town for over a week. Before this started he was always screaming about loud noises like the vacuum and other things but again the doctors tried to tell us it wasn't Autism. His school had actually told us that we should see a Behavioral Therapist instead of continuously asking his Neurologist. When we were finally able to get an appointment the Dr. didn't even need more than the hour that we were there to say yes Jacob has Autism but he also said it seems to be mild since Jacob loves to touch people and seems extremely friendly. Anyways, I think it's great that this group is out here for everyone with the autism and thank you for being here. :)

She was born 1 pound 10ounces. With a blled in her brain, a murmur, amd bronchial pulmonary displatia doctors did not think she would make it past the first week of birth. When she was born she was.completley webbed, they had to make her a belly button and so I called her.my little spider baby. She is such a miracle. Being non-verbal the use of an ioad in school assist her alot ro communicate. I wishwe had.one at home aswell. Kulturecity is a wonder non profit organization to fund and provide I pads to children on the.soectrum isagnificent. It gives these children a voice and.makes them so happy. The reach the show and the commitment to gaining donation for children is a blessing. I am so happy with their efforts.and think more organization should be like kulturecity. I commend them.

He can sit now longer when we are working with him with flashcards and he needs less redirecting. This organization is such a great help for families with children on the spectrum. They have no idea how their acts of kindness greatly affects our lives for the better. 
KultureCity	223250		/users/profile/286991	Caren E.	General Member of the Public	5	10/15/2014	I am a mom to two boys with autism and other disabilities.  We have been selected to receive a much needed iPad for my oldest nonverbal son in September.  I can't express how this is so needed and came at the most perfect time.  We go this month for a augmentative eval.  I can't work outside the home in order to meet their needs and my husband is in the construction industry and work is weather related.  We struggle to provide the correct therapy items...we struggle at times to keep just "us" together as a family.  Being blessed gives such hope from strangers...hope to keep on keeping on.  This organization is humble and feels our pains, our struggles.  I thank God for social media so we were able to connect!

KultureCity	232601	6	/users/profile/296149	wrinkles08,	General Member of the Public	5	11/02/2014	Kulture City is a non-profit organization that truly cares for the children They understand the issues that the children are going through. They listen to the parents about the needs of their child.  They then  help the parents to obtain the needed items that will help that child to get through their day, the school day or their night.

KultureCity	222813		/users/profile/286555	Sherry44	General Member of the Public	5	10/14/2014	My son was just diagnosed a few months ago with being on the Autism Spectim.  It is true when they say knowing is half the battle. I have learned so much in such a short period if time.  I just found KultureCity a few days ago. I filled out an application from one of there partners for my son to get a toy just yesterday. Today I received an email that a toy was on its way.  This is truly amazing! This gesture brings so much light to my day. I know it will brighten my sons day whe. It comes in the mail.  I am still looking at all of the things that Kulturecity does and am super excited about all,of the new recourse I have already found through them. I would recommend them to anyone.
KultureCity	222799		/users/profile/286540	kimmy426	General Member of the Public	5	10/14/2014	I just learned about this group today and thought I would share a story about my 8 year old grandson that has ASD.  When he was 3 we knew he was different and so did the school he was going to, they called the board down to review him for 2 weeks and put him on an IEP, then we decided to move to a school district that could deal with special needs children.  In this district he was shuffled from school to school, never having a school to call his own, so we decided to send him to a school for ADHD children, they just let him do what ever he wanted, so at this point we decided to change doctors , it was at this point the suggested we have him tested for ASD, the school he was attending also tested him.  Both the Doctors and the school both came back with the same opinion, he is autistic.  That explained a lot of issues we were having with him.  He is now in a school only for ASD children, although he is still only doing 1st grade work they feel by next year he should be where he needs to be.  Before this we jumped through hoops taking him to therapy every week, speech therapy, ot, you name it we probably did it for him.  It has been a difficult struggle for my daughter and son-in-law since they have 3 other children now a 2 year old son and a set of 1 year old twin boys.  We all live together which takes a little bit of the load off her.  But she is now dealing with early childhood specialists for speech for the 2 year old and one of the twins.  These two have their hands full every day, the private school Drake the 8 year old with ASD has to be taken to and from school every day, this puts a strain on their finances.  But with everything that is going on in the family they wouldn't change a thing about any of their children.  They always say God wouldn't of given us more than we can handle.  So if you think your alone out their your not, and these are the most special children in the world.

They are a true blessing to the families they have touched. My son received an Ipad through the wizard talk fundraiser.  I installed a few apps and he has already experienced an explosion of language.  Kulturecity has made a huge, positive impact on my life. They have given me the gift of hope. Thank you Kulturecity.  I can't say it enough.

We were denied assistance from our insurance provider even though an IPad with communication applications is considered a durable medical device.  This is an organization that does not have a lot of fluff...they do what they say they are going to do.  KultureCity gives back to families....real help in so many areas.  Great organization to contribute to.  You can be assured that your donation is being put back into the community.

I have been on Toys AUcross America, a group for  children with Autism and Diagnosis on the Spectrum to donate their toys to another child with a like diagnosis once they have outgrown them.  KultureCity was started to add to this, to provide families additional opportunities to receive new items for our children like iPads, weighted blankets, noise canceling earphones, books, Legos, vitas, and so much more.Families are treated with respect, kindness, and warmth.Our  kids sometimes don't have a friend, getting a package addressed to them in the mail, and NOT on their BIRTHDAY, it is such a special moment for  so many. Please help Kulturecity keep making these magical moments happen for these extraordinary kids and families.

KultureCity	214828		/users/profile/278140	Jrooney45	Client Served	5	09/12/2014	Kulturecity is a wonderful organization that brought so much joy to our family! We requested a weighted blanket for our autistic son who will be 3 years old this weekend. He has used a weighted vest in the past with some success, but had recently outgrown it. He was never a big fan of covers and blankets, so I was always afraid to invest a ton of money in to a weighted blanket of he wouldn't like it. He just recently started tolerating blankets. He is such an active little guy and sleeping has always been our biggest hurdle besides frequent meltdowns. It only took about a week to receive his beautiful blanket from Kulturecity. It was so carefully made and had the cutest dog pattern. It was a huge surprise when the doorbell rang and I opened the box to find this incredibly generous gift! Ever since receiving his blanket, my son has been napping, voluntarily grabbing his blanket at bedtime, sleeping through the night, and hasn't had a meltdown in about a week!!! We could not be more thankful to Kulturecity for their kindness, generosity, and prompt fulfillment of out request! The world is a better place because of organizations like Kulturecity who understand the difficulty emotionally and financially of raising an ASD child. Seeing my son well rested, calmer, and happier overall has been a true blessing! Thank you so much Kulturecity for making a difference in my family's life as well as the lives of so many more individuals all over the world!

We were invited to a baseball game with the Birmingham Barons, we met 13 families that day and Julian with Kulturecity. EVERY family was presented with an iPad! We also got to have a great time at the game, which going out to events such as that isn't always something that autie families do. It was really a fantastic day, not just for us, but for everyone. My son doesn't go out without his iPad now. He's shown it to his doctors, his friends, all of the family...he is using it to keep track of his weekly appointments and daily tasks. There are so many apps out there that are helpful to him and if it weren't for this organization, this wouldn't have happened for him. They are truly making a difference in the lives of kids with autism and the people who love them.

I entered in to a giveaway recently,  on facebook not thinking much of it. We won!  Its funny, how much a little toy for my son can mean to a family like us. Its really more of the meaning, the people and cause behind it that means so much. People, going out of their way to help and bring joy to other families like ours instead of throwing more challenges in our path. Its a breath of fresh air.

KultureCity	209952		/users/profile/272691	Sandra69	General Member of the Public	5	08/10/2014	This non-profit organization had touched our lives in a big way,  although they started small with only a dream of helping.... their small ripple had created some big waves in the lives of children all over the United States through Toys AUcross America.  My son Lee was able to receive a prize through one of the giveaways, but the best thing that we received was the smile that gift created. I wish I could recreate that moment everyday,  because it was a miracle. That powerful emotion of happiness and joy is what is being spread and it's contagious!  Thank you Kulturecity, and Autism Santa for all you do!

KultureCity	209016		/users/profile/271774	pknowak99	Client Served	5	08/06/2014	I started following when Toys AUcross America was on its own.  I was amazed with what Michael and his son could accomplish on their own.  Michael is dedicated to encouraging and supporting kids who are autistic.  I cannot even imagine how much of his own time and money he has donated so that kids on the spectrum can get some mail of their own.   Together KultureCity and Toys AUcross America have done amazing things just by facilitating people to come together.  This group of people works tirelessly to raise money and other donations in order to support those with autism and to educate the general public.  They do things to support caregivers.  They have given us a support system.   About a year ago, our son received a small Lego set from TAA, he was over the moon thrilled!  He hardly ever receives mail and to receive something from strangers just blew his mind.  It was then that I realized how much small things can make a difference.  So, we donated some toys to be given away.  It was a box full of random stuff, nothing big or major.  I was thankful to have someone to send them to who could then distribute them to other children.   KultureCity is a fantastic organization that focuses on raising awareness about Autism and supporting  and encouraging autism families.

I have been following them for quite a while to see what they are about, how they work and what kind of things they do. I have had issues with others that seek to take advantage of special needs parents so I have been a bit leary. In watching and interacting with Kulturecity and Toys AUcross America I believe they are legit and most of all, in it for the children, not for themselves :) I have seen photos of super happy kids. I have not seen a bunch of negativity. They really do seem to be helping out the Special needs & Autism communities , heaven knows we need more  awareness, caring, kindness and compassion.

KultureCity	208996		/users/profile/271755	Candice6	General Member of the Public	5	08/06/2014	I started this journey as a Mom with a 4yr old on the Autism spectrum. I came across a page on Facebook called Toys AUcross America that caught my eye. This page was a father and son sending toys to kids on the spectrum.  You see a lot of pages on Facebook based on childhood cancer, rare disorders and conditions, but not many I have found for Autism. As a parent I was so appreciative to finally find something just for Autism.  After several months I was referred to the page Kulturecity! I was blown away with the amt of things they have also done for kids on the spectrum. My ultimate favorite was setting up package for children to dine out with families. This is a major issue for us! A great idea and a job well done!  I am so thankful to have come across these two amazing organizations

KultureCity	208992		/users/profile/234418	Healing K.	Donor	5	08/06/2014	I want to say I started out with Michael and his small father/son venture of sending toys to Autistic children and changing the world one toy at a time. I loved it, and then he added the element of a monthly drawing that went beyond just a toy but something impactful to a family raising a child with autism and that was raising money to cover shipping costs and it gravitated and he challenged us to give an extra amount ot help cover an Ipad which helps our nonverbals to communicate. Michael then started contacting different companies for donations such as weighted blankets, gift cards, donations and that is when he discovered Kulture City and not only they did they take under their wing this Dad/Son dream but expanded it to the degree that every couple weeks there is some ipad giveaway that everyone has the opportunity for their child to win. This has made a huge difference to so many families because it has given some homes a voice that they never thought could be heard let alone read for others the gift of learning and working with the schools and apps they use there and the ability to implement the structure at home that their child works in at school which is a big help because when everyone is on the same page the child benefits greatly. I am raising an Autie and although I do not participate in the ipad giveaways, not because I own one but because the needs are so much greater than my son's it doesn't feel right taking away from a potential child that would benefit.  The hearts that KultureCity and Michael with Autism Aucross America make a daily impact to some child on the spectrum each and every day in America and never ask for anything return other than to see a child smile and excited in a very misunderstood and lonely world at times. Michael I am so proud of you and all you have accomplished because your passion was born out of raising a Spectrum child as well and I say forget Virginia and is there a Santa Claus..you dear Michael have made dreams come true, children shed tears of pure joy, you help our movement everyday with not just Awareness for Autism but Acceptance because you humanize our babies and how the world there truly is no difference between their child and ours, they just express their emotions differently.

I have had the pleasure of dealing with this organization when it was two different ones and as one.  They bring smiles, hope and understanding to the Autism Community. They treat the parents and children as if they are their family.  They send toys to children on the spectrum just to make them smile. They also help give a voice to the voiceless.  My family loves them and we can't say enough about them. Every time I get the chance, I tell everyone about them, whether they have kids on the spectrum or not. God Bless you for all you do for our kids.

As the parent of an autistic child, I have watched this organization blossom and bloom into such a great thing.  I have seen the smiles on the faces of children they have helped and Have donated bits here and there when I have been able.  My hope is that they will continue to keep up the great work so that every child with autism can know that they matter and know that good things can happen for them.

Thy are an absolute blessing to the autism community. Toys AUcross America sent my son an awesome monster truck that both my children loved so much that he sent another one to my daughter so that she could have one of her own. This was such an amazing thing for my children at a time when they really needed a smile. A couple months before that we ended up losing our home and being homeless for a short period of time. We ended up having to move about 70 miles away from my child's school and pull them away from the only home they ever knew. They were devastated and significantly affected by all the changes in a short period of time. New town, new home, new school, and having to share a tiny little room together. Those toys gave them a sense of security and a feeling of "home" because they were able to get mail in the new place. They provided my children with a smile, yes, but also so much more.

KultureCity	208961		/users/profile/271719	Sheila38	General Member of the Public	5	08/06/2014	I LOVE to see the smiles on all the kids faces that have gotten a toy donated from Kulturecity and Toys AUcross America. As a parent of a newly diagnosed 3 yr old with ASD the daily struggles are just that and if a single toy will bring a smile to a childs face then I'm all for it. Also the IPAD Mini's that are donated are such a big help to the nonverbal kids for the many apps for autism that can be used so I see these 2 pages as the best I have come across on facebook for anyone with a friend or family member on the spectrum.

Michael Autism Santa encouraged my son throughout his fundraiser and let him help in the distribution of the resulting gift.  We have also received a gift for our youngest son, who is four and in love with Legos.  He is dx with ASD and smiles are hard won, but there is no greater joy than opening a package.  We were also the lucky recipient of a Lego giveaway from Kulturecity.  I have nothing my good things to say about these organizations who have nothing but goodness to share with the world.

KultureCity	208785		/users/profile/271518	Lorrie C.	Client Served	5	08/05/2014	I am a mother of 3 children ages 17,13 and 10. The oldest and and youngest are both special needs. I found Toys Aucross America when a friend posted about her son with autism receiving  a toy from them. I followed this guy and his son who sent toys too autistic children all over the country for months. I looked at the faces of the children when they received a package in the mail addressed to them and I fell in love with the idea of putting smiles on the faces of these awesome children who sometimes find it hard to have a reason to smile. Receiving something that they love, a train, a remote control car, or what they sent my son which was 100 Yu Gi Oh trading cards. When my son received that simple gift from Toys Aucross America he was so excited and that smile on his face was what it was all about. Then Autism Santa introduced me to KultureCity. KultureCity is an organization that truly cares about helping families who deal with autism, and the isolation it sometimes causes in their lives daily, have a place to feel accepted. They do everything they can to not only spread awareness of the rising numbers of children with autism, they help the children fight back against the difficulties they face by giving them hope. The difference 1 IPad can make for an autistic non verbal child could mean a mother finally hearing her son say "I love you" for the first time. My own 17 year old daughter with autism and cognitive delays won a kindle fire from Kulture City around Christmas time last year and she still talks about that! It made her feel so special. I'm telling you, Kulture City and Toys Aucross America together are a great non profit organization and my vote will always be with them because I believe in everything they do just because of who they do it for, families like mine.

Having a tablet was a dream I had to help them when their anxiety was overwhelming, however I also knew that that was more than likely out of our reach since therapies and gas getting back and forth to the aforementioned therapies eat up most of our monthly budget. I saw a share a post contest on Kulturecity/toysaucrossamerica for a kindle. I honestly didn't expect to win I shared to help spread the word of who they are and what they do. Heck I didn't even check the winners name. I received an email from Michael (autism Santa) telling me I had won. You could have knocked me over with a feather. I am so grateful that I shared that post as it has helped my boys in to many ways to count. Thank you kulturecity and Michael you made a difference in our lives in more ways than one. You have given my boys a way to deal with their anxiety and made their lives much easier.

They have provided our son with a tangible gift and have been a great resource!  They go Above and beyond for families who are facing autism daily. My son has received Legos and couldn't have been more excited to see something in the mail with his name on it. They make facing autism a little less challenging and let kids be free to be kids! 
KultureCity	208690		/users/profile/271438	Morgan11	General Member of the Public	5	08/05/2014	I heard about KultureCity through The Autism Parents Support and Discussion group. A family on there that was desperate for help recently told us she finally found help thanks to this group. We were scrambling trying to come up with solutions for her and I'm so glad she found you guys. Thank you for being someone's angel!

KultureCity	208684		/users/profile/271432	Kisha G.	General Member of the Public	5	08/05/2014	This is one of the best organizations around. Thier tablet program is amazing  and has changed the lives of so many families.  Everything that this organization does puts smiles on faces around the country. 
KultureCity	208663		/users/profile/271405	Michael259	Volunteer	5	08/05/2014	I have been volunteering with Kulturecity since April of 2014 and continue to do so. I have seen first hand the impact this organization has had on the Autism community and beyond. Their Tablet initiative is without a doubt one of the greatest programs I have witnessed for providing communication devices for children living with Autism. An iPad is a vital tool for children who struggle being non-verbal and one of Kulturecity's goals is to help these children "find their voice". Every child deserves a voice and every parent deserves to hear it. 
KultureCity	208662		/users/profile/271404	Rohanjanico	Client Served	5	08/05/2014	For a relatively new organization, the quality of care, understanding and professionalism belie that fact.These wonderful people should be a litmus test for what a foundation of this type  should be like.They have shown nothing but kindness and respect towards my family.  Remember, they live in the trenches too. They have a non verbal Autistic little boy, in addition to another small child and rather demanding personal careers. It is truly remarkable, how they willingly and tirelessly give of their time to others in need. There is no alterior motive in Kulturecity.  These people care. They are the real deal. I wish them all the success in the world. 
KultureCity	208644		/users/profile/271379	sharkdagger	General Member of the Public	5	08/05/2014	This is truly an amazing organization. They give and they give and have never asked for any donations in return.  They are the only organization in the USA that currently provides tangible help to all autism families.  I am truly proud to know of this organization and will continue to help them any way I can.
Hand in Paw	323162		/users/profile/417392	MFlinn	Client Served	5	02/14/2017	I work for the nonprofit, The National Humane Education Society, and we partnered with Hand in Paw for a week-long outreach visit to Alabama to teach nearly 2,000 Birmingham elementary students about kindness to animals and the human-animal bond. Without question, Hand in Paw arranged for 5 therapy animals to visit across 5 days of programming. It was amazing! Students who were previously terrified of dogs were laughing, smiling, and petting the dogs.  Most had never learned the safe way to approach a dog and many had never learned about the emotional lives of animals. Best of all, Hand in Paw partnered with us solely out of their desire to help their community. They wanted nothing in return. The NHES humane education team is so appreciative of their graciousness and talents! 
Hand in Paw	309719		/users/profile/401068	Northstar2	Volunteer	5	10/11/2016	I got involved with Hand in Paw through my daughter who was a volunteer at the time.

Hand in Paw	308612		/users/profile/283984	SusanneW	Volunteer	5	10/07/2016	I joined HIP 41/2 years ago with my dog, Dinah. Currently we visit 3 facilities:  Children's Hospital of AL, UAB Hospital, and a day program for memory impaired adults. I often feel I get more out of visiting than the clients!  It's volunteer work that offers immediate rewards to the participants - I love doing this!
Hand in Paw	220334		/users/profile/283984	SusanneW	Volunteer	5	10/06/2014	Being a part of HIP as a volunteer is a privilege for me and for Dinah, my schnauzer mix.  The preparation, confidence, and continuing support HIP gives to handlers and dogs both during and after training has enabled us to feel like we are "making a difference" as we visit clients.  Dinah and I currently visit a retirement community, an alzheimers daytime care facility, and UAB Highlands Hospital.  In the past there have been many other types of facilities/events.  At each and every one, our reward is seeing faces light up and people become engaged when they meet Dinah.  She knows when we are leaving for a visit and her tail goes into overdrive-wag!  Thank you, HIP for this opportunity, and for being the professional-yet-personal, efficient organization that you are.  
Hand in Paw	308558		/users/profile/399930	cashhip	Volunteer	5	10/07/2016	My "pound puppy," and I trained, tested, and were a therapy team with Hand in Paw for 6 years.  While we retired as a team, I continue to volunteer as an assistant with other pet therapy teams.  I have seen firsthand the impact it can have on ones who need encouragement, motivation, and diversion.  Hand in Paw has provided the training, facilitated our visits, and maintained records of our visits.

Hand in Paw	308440		/users/profile/399821	toweathen	Client Served	5	10/06/2016	My son Hunter Towe had to stay at Children's of Alabama Hospital for 5 straight months.He had an LVAD implanted and during this his kidneys quit functioning as they should so he had to go on dialysis 24 hrs. a day.He couldn't leave the room for several months because of the dialysis.The only bright spot in his day was getting to see Chivas from Hand In Paw.Chivas was used as a reward to get Hunter to do his therapy and it worked. The Currie's that brought Chivas to the hospital are loving and wonderful people that really care and enjoy what they do. God called Hunter home May 3, 2016 at the age of 15.I will always be thankful to Hand in Paw for the joy that Chivas brought to my son and to all of us.You will never know how much it meant to me to see the joy in my son's face after all the things he was going through. Hunter was missing his dog from home so much and Chivas helped ease that a little.Hunter did get to go home for a few months before he passed and  he loved spending time with his dog-Striker. Kids and adults need the love an animal can give and Hand in Paw is a great example of that. I LOVE this organization !!!! Thank You-Sherry Towe. The first picture is Hunter with Chivas and the next picture is Hunter with his dog Striker.

I visit weekly to United Cerebral Palsy of Birmingham and Vestavia Hills Elementary.  These visits are the most rewarding parts of my week.  The staff at Hand In Paw does everything possible to make sure that the volunteers have all the assistance we may need (both in personnel and supplies) to share the human animal bond with those we visit.

Children have learned to read, become responsible, and to not bully with the help of Hand In Paw. People all of ages have smiled, laughed, and been comforted by the touch of an animal.

I have primarily assisted at the Oncology/Hematology clinic and to see the stress be removed from all of their faces and bodies when they see the dog is truly a wonderful feeling.

Hand in Paw	308173		/users/profile/282855	jhwHIP	Board Member	5	10/06/2016	This year marks my third year on the Board of Directors of Hand in Paw. While I'm excited about the work that the Board is doing, it is the therapy teams and the volunteers who are at the heart of this amazing organization. One "shadow visit" to watch what the therapy teams and the volunteers actually do on a day-to-day basis and the effect these folks and their animals have on people's lives is all it takes to become an avid and life-long supporter of Hand in Paw. To say that Hand in Paw deserves to be a "top-rated" nonprofit seems almost an understatement, but it would be an earned and well-deserved accolade for this great charity. Thanks for your consideration!!!
Hand in Paw	219227		/users/profile/282855	jhwHIP	Board Member	5	10/02/2014	I've worked with the Hand in Paw Board and its volunteers for the last year and have never experienced a more dedicated group of folks in the non-profit arena. What our the therapy teams are able to accomplish and the impact that they have on the lives of both adults and children are, quite simply, amazing. Hand in Paw is so deserving of any and all recognition for the work it does.

Hand in Paw	260685		/users/profile/223502	willc	Volunteer	5	10/01/2015	What other organization encourages volunteers to work alongside their pet in order to make a difference in people's lives?! Hand in Paw is an incredible organization where you can volunteer with your whole family AND your pet! Volunteers can truly participate in this organization's mission: "To improve human health and well-being through Animal-Assisted Therapy".  Hand in Paw is unique in that it is a nonprofit organization that serves so many other nonprofit's mission throughout the area-I believe that is what sets it apart from other organizations--the impact of their services is so profound that other nonprofit organizations seek their services to help the population they serve. Hand in Paw truly makes a difference.

Hand in Paw	260677		/users/profile/349259	pmccmb	Board Member	5	10/01/2015	This organization encompasses so many avenues of service to the community with their diverse vision and utilization of pets who are trained, along with their owners, to provide animal assisted therapy.  The standard of excellence in which they conduct their business has gained them national & international attention with other similar entities reaching out to them for guidance in their own programs.  Hand in Paw currently provides pet assisted therapy to Cancer units in hospitals, Children's Hospital & various units within that hospital, workplace stress environment therapy along with college campuses & study groups, therapy assistance with troubled youths, reading & literacy programs, autistic and developmentally disabled, therapy visits to the elderly at Assisted Living & Skilled Nursing facilities as well as the abused, battered, mental health and substance abuse.   Their scope of services continues to expand and be in demand creating a broad waiting list of clients to experience their compassionate services delivered through their trained pets and the pet owners.  It's pretty cool to see them in action.

Hand in Paw	257561		/users/profile/284297	Jeannie B.	Board Member	5	09/15/2015	If you like volunteering with your kids and family-- this is a wonderful organization for it!!  My kids and I visit a variety of places with our therapy Golden Retriever, Lucky.  It is more beneficial to my kids than it is to those we help.  It is just so very rewarding.  Everyone should become a therapy team.
Hand in Paw	220628		/users/profile/284297	Jeannie B.	Board Member	5	10/07/2014	I am a volunteer and Board Member with Hand In Paw.  My kids (son Banks (14) and daughter Lauren (13)) and I volunteer 1-2x a week with our therapy dog Lucky.  We often get more out of these visits than those we visit.  My kids get to see other kids their age with "real" life problems and are forced from the bubble they reside in every day.  They learn to appreciate their lives, health and family.  Those they visit benefit from seeing my kids take time from their very busy schedules to spend time with them (we often participate in 12-week Pawsitive Living Programs or monthly visits with the elderly at assisted living homes).  Plus, they adore Lucky who is the perfect dog for pet therapy.  We have seen abused kids "come out of their shells" with Lucky and end a visit by hugging and laying on him.  The smiles Lucky brings to everyone's faces is worth all the money in the world!!! Hand In Paw is especially unique and fabulous because it reaches and benefits a huge spectrum of other charities.  From Children's Hospital and the Ronald McDonald House to homeless shelters and retirement homes-- Hand In Paw helps all sorts of people every day.  I love it!

I just hope that the lives of the people we visit are as enriched as my own, through my HIP activities.  The organization is dedicated to the programs and facilities we visit, as well to support of its own volunteers.  It's growth over just the last 3 years I have been been visiting has been remarkable, thanks to the dedication of the staff and ever-increasing support by the community.
Hand in Paw	223877		/users/profile/287630	Beth124	Advisor	5	10/17/2014	Since founding Hand in Paw in 1996, my life continues to be enriched bystories of lives being touched (and bettered)  by the unconditional love of a therapy animal. I have visited wtih 7 different thearpy dogs over the years and continue to visit with my Shih  tzu Promise at Children's Hospital of Alabama. I am never ceased to be amazed at the significance of the interactions between a therapy team and a parent or child whose spirits are lifted (and in the process, there are important physical and emotinal benefits).  HIP is filled with caring, dedicated volunteers and staff members and wiht animals glad to 'work their magic'.   I am in AWE of them all!

My husband, Frank Bainbridge, and I work as partners with our little dog Pippa. Through Hand in Paw we are able to go to Children's of Alabama and UAB to visit sick people. Without this organization we would not have access to these wonderful facilities. Hand in Paw trains us...we have to train the dog!...and then puts us through a series of tests to make certain that we are qualified to perform our visits properly.We have been fortunate to be associated with many volunteer organizations, and can honestly say that Hand in Paw is one of the best! Thank you for giving us the opportunity to tell many people about Hand in Paw.  Philippa Bainbridge
Hand in Paw	220500		/users/profile/222464	Charlotte W.	Volunteer	4	10/07/2014	Ruby and I continue to serve the community through HIP, and feel blessed after each and every visit we make.  We love our work with children and enjoy watching them read.  The many patients we have visited in hospitals have touched our hearts.  And the nursing home residents bring us joy.  I often wonder who gets more out of the visits, us, or those we serve.  I look forward to our future visits and the many friends we will make along the way.  
Hand in Paw	167599		/users/profile/222464	Charlotte W.	Volunteer	5	09/05/2013	I am so honored that my little dog, Ruby and I are a pet therapy team working with Hand In Paw.  We visit retirement/ nursing homes on Sunday afternoons.  There are some people so excited we are coming that they are waiting at the door for our arrival.  Ruby and Ilove our weekly visits with shelter children.  They read to her as part of our Sit Stay Read program.  Some of the children even show her the pictures in the books they read.  It is so cute and helps promote reading.  We love visiting the hospitals and bringing smiles to the patients and their families.  We know it helps to take some of the pain away, at least for a little while.  And this past summer we participated in a Pawsitive Living program with a group of therapy teams.  This experience alone, changed my life for the better.  We witnessed through this program a tranformation in the lives of some beautiful teenage girls who had been used and abused.  I will never forget the girls, and therapy teams, and the difference it made in our lives.  And all of this was possible becaus of Hand In Paw.
Hand in Paw	220385	1	/users/profile/284030	sstorm1234	Board Member	5	10/06/2014	Hand in Paw is a joyful and caring organization providing love and tenderness to many children, families and the staffs of groups all over our city.  I first remember Hand in Paw many years ago when two of the members brought their dogs to visit children locked in the Family Court youth detention facility.   Hand in Paw has grown since then and now visits hundreds of people every year who are in need of loving attention and kindness.  We help children read and help them in recovery from serious illness.  We brighten the day of everyone we meet with our Therapy Teams. I am proud to work with Hand in Paw and to be a part of the positive impact we have daily in the lives of others. 
Hand in Paw	220367	1	/users/profile/284011	Brewster	Volunteer	5	10/06/2014	Having been involved with our Flat Coat Retriever, Brewster for almost 10 years, it has been a privilege and and honor to have listened while children read to us and not be judged by Brewster. It has been amazing to watch boys with anger management problems learn to be gentle and kind. It has been incredible to see cancer patients smile for 5 minutes and forget their serious illness and to talk about their dogs at home waiting for them. It has seemed like a miracle to be with a patient at UAB and watch their heart rate settle down as they pet Brewster.  He has no idea the impact he has but he loves every visit. Even the doctors and nurses LOVE some canine therapy!
Hand in Paw	220312	1	/users/profile/283963	jsclifford	Volunteer	5	10/06/2014	Dusty and Buddy, 2 Shih Tzus, would tell you that as they hear and see the reactions of children, families, and staff, they know they are making a difference in the lives of countless people.  They would tell you that their lives are better as well.  They bring smiles wherever they go!  But listen as they tell it: Whenever we hear our human pet partners say, 'You want to go to work' we get excited and can't wait to visit.  Every Thursday we begin our day at the UAB cancer center and visit children who are having radiation.  They and the staff are so glad to see us and they let us accompany the children into the room with the child.  After the child wakes up after treatment they often ask for one of us!!  We next go across the street to the UAB palliative care unit and often get in bed with patients who are nearing the end of their lives.  We are humbled often as an unresponsive patient tries to pet and love on us!  As we ride in our own pet strollers, you should see the surprised and excited looks we get from so many folks!  We also visit in the memory and skilled nursing units at Kirkwood by the River.  We are so pleased as patients tell us we remind them of their pets and thank us for the visit.  Another place we go is the oncology unit at Children's hospital and offer what is called 'Sit, Stay, and Read'.  The boys and girls love to read to us and we enjoy hearing them as well.  We also visit the ACE (Acute Care for the Elderly) at UAB Highlands.  Again, we cannot believe how happy old and young of heart are to see us and want us to get in bed so they can pet us!  Of course, we love the attention and compliments.So we want to thank Hand in Paw for the wonderful opportunity they give us to offer support, care, and love to so many people.

Hand in Paw	220261		/users/profile/283909	christina.e.long	Volunteer	5	10/06/2014	Hand in Paw has truly changed my life. My dog and I have volunteered with HIP in numerous capacities over the course of six years, from nursing home visits to adolescent youth homes. There is no better feeling than being a part of this organization. The animals and handlers go through a very lengthy evaluation process before becoming certified, and as a result the team of folks (2 and 4 legged!) in this nonprofit are the best there could be. They spread so much happiness to those who need it most, and I'm honored to be a part of Hand in Paw. 
Hand in Paw	220255	1	/users/profile/283904	bjturner34	Volunteer	4	10/06/2014	I first heard of Hand in Paw (HIP) at The Mutt Strutt and found my dogs and I could become volunteers. I became a TVA first while traning my dogs. I visit with a team at Childrens Hospital twice a month and also help with the No More Bullies program. I have seen the dogs do amazing things, they seem to know how to cheer up the patients and family. HIP is a great organization to be associated with.
Hand in Paw	220251	1	/users/profile/283900	jpssvanpelt	Board Member	5	10/06/2014	I have had the honor of working with Hand In Paw as a board member for many years. I am in administration at Children's Of Alabama and can see the wonderful results of interaction between the animals, volunteers, pet partneers and the parents and staff. But most importantly the sheer joy of the moment that a child interacts with a animal is truly a miracle and the child, at least  for a few moments, is taken into a different world not of medicine but of love, compasison, and understading that an animal can give to a child. Certainly dogs are the promary therapy animals but I am always impressed when a cat, rabbit, or a goat can bond with a  child to provide a moment of respite.
Hand in Paw	220247	1	/users/profile/283896	PamelaMayes	Volunteer	5	10/06/2014	This is my first year with Hand in Paw as a volunteer and therapy team member with my dog, Maylee!  I can honestly say that while this has been a long term goal of mine,  my experience has far exceeded any expectations I had (and they were high)!    The guidance we are given through every step of the program  is exceptional and the compassion and caring is evident in all aspects of this organization.   With every visit we make, I come away feeling we made a positive difference not only in someone's life, but in our community.
Hand in Paw	220239	1	/users/profile/283886	shughes317	Volunteer	5	10/06/2014	My therapy dog Molly, a Black Lab/Great Pyrenees mix, and I visit the cancer floor at Children's Hospital twice a month as part of the Sit, Stay, Read program.  This program allows children who are in the hospital for an extended time to practice and hone their reading skills by reading books to a Hand in Paw dog.  Usually the children come out to the common area and we sit on the floor to read books to Molly.  When the children are too small to read then we read books to them while Molly lies next to them.  If a child is confined to their bed then we visit the individual room and the child reads as Molly lies on the floor next to the bed.  Once in a while a child is too sick and doesnt feel like reading so they just pet and hug Molly and forget their troubles for a few minutes.  We are so happy to bring some joy to these children who are going through so much and at the same time help them keep up with their reading skills so they will not be behind when they go home and back to school.

Hand in Paw	220234		/users/profile/283882	Echeatwood	Volunteer	5	10/06/2014	I have been involved with Hand in Paw for about a year and a half. During that time I have seen so many wonderful things happen through Hand in Paw. Things ranging from children with special needs walking on their own for the first time to "walk" a dog, to a person in a nursing home smiling for the first time in weeks due to a visit from a Hand in Paw Therapy Team. There are countless stories that could be told about the difference that this organizations makes in the lives of so many people. Hand in Paw is so very special!
Hand in Paw	220095		/users/profile/283719	COlsson	Volunteer	5	10/05/2014	This is my tenth year as a pet partner with Hand In Paw. My golden retriever, Susie and I are currently working with "at risk" youth boys in a structured 12 week program called Pawsitive Living. Each week a topic is led by a facilitator to help teach the boys important concepts such as handling anger, empathy, accepting others with differences, etc. Each boy is paired with one dog and their handler. The dogs really are the "teachers" as they are used in different scenarios to teach the topic of the week. The boys really bond with the dogs, learn important concepts and get to experience the love and companionship of a dog. It is very rewarding for the boys as well as the pet partners and their dogs.This is only one of the many ways Hand In Paw serves the community and is a positive experience for those involved.
Hand in Paw	219888		/users/profile/283513	shellyshook	Volunteer	5	10/04/2014	I've been a volunteer for several years, now with my second dog.  We have had so very many positive experiences. Just this week, a patient we were visiting for the second time in the hospital for cancer treatments, told us she knew coming back into the hospital she had something to look forward to -- seeing my sweet dog! These visits truly make a difference to our patients, the staff, and family.  Such a blessing for me to get to participate in this organization. 
Hand in Paw	219706		/users/profile/283330	Carmel_Diva	Board Member	5	10/03/2014	I have been involved with Hand in Paw since about the year 2000 when I joined the board.  I was sold when I heard how they help people with animals.  However, the more I know the more impressed I am.  In 2006 I joined the staff and have learned all of the inner workings of this great organization.  You would think that maybe being that close would lessen my enthusiasm, not so; I AM EVEN MORE IMPRESSED.  Just to know the inner workings and how many thousands of details help this organization to run like a well oiled machine is constantly impressive.  I do LOVE my job.  It is a joy to come to work with professionals who are highly intelligent and have so many creative ideas.  It is never stale.  And the volunteers are AMAZING how they tirelessly give of themselves over and over again.  I am very blessed to be a part of this wonder organization.

My dog, Boo, and I were involved in pet assisted therapy for 7 years in Atlanta before moving to Birmingham this past December.  I have been so impressed with this organization, both the administrative side and the actual pet assisted therapy provided.  We look forward to many years serving the Birmingham area by bringing the healing touch of the human-animal bond through pet assisted therapy with Hand In Paw.

Animal therapy has been proven to help critically ill patients ,but it takes the devotion and dedication of the volunteers who take their pets into cancer center treatment facilities, hospitals and nursing homes to visit with the patients. If you want to help support the fabulous work of these volunteers and their pets as they reach out to help critically ill patients in our community, then make a donation to Hand in Paw. 
Hand in Paw	168906		/users/profile/223878	sandy jo	Board Member	5	09/10/2013	Hand in Paw is animal assisted therapy for children who are ill or require special care : those  in need of reading skills and those who may be in trouble.   It is also for adults who are ill or elderly and in need of care. The organization is almost entiredly made up of volunteers who train and are certified as Pet Partners with their animals.  The interaction between someone needing care and affection and the animal is amazing.   We have more requests for visits than we can currently fill.
Hand in Paw	168649		/users/profile/223586	bhamlisat	Board Member	5	09/09/2013	As a former Pet Patner, I had many grand experiences in Animal Assisted therapy. I saw what a difference it can make in the lives of the children we served. Milestones were achived and there was much joy from parents and therapists alike seeing their young ones start walking, talking, or exibit other normal behaviors and responses.  The training Hand in Paw provided my dog and I was incredible and we were well prepared to make a difference when we got into the facilities. My love for this organization grew from this experience and I got involved as a Board Member. Being a part of this organization, with it high standards and incredible relationships which yield incredible results, is a life changing experience. It is a pleasuere and a joy to see this great work being done.
Hand in Paw	168607		/users/profile/223543	jvsmith_2003	Volunteer	5	09/09/2013	I first heard of Hand in Paw randomly in a local business journal.  Because of my love of animals and knowing what my pups did for my overall well being, I wanted to become involved in fundraising.  Since that time, I'm truly honored and consider it a privilege to be involved in such a unique organization.  To see what pet partner teams (both dog and owner) do for children, adults, and elderly to help them heal is truly remarkable.  
Hand in Paw	168591		/users/profile/34498	lora-leigh	Volunteer	5	09/09/2013	Hand-in-Paw comes to the Birmingham VA hospital to visit veterans in the Palliative Care unit.  They are such a joy to the staff & to the veterans.  They have also visited the site for one of our Combined Federal Campaign Local Organization Fairs for the employees to learn more about their organization.  Animals are always clean & friendly (as are the pet handlers, lol).  I highly suggest supporting this orgination with your time and money!  They have a positive impact in the community and any interactions I've had have been in a very professional manner that would well represent their purpose.
Hand in Paw	168559		/users/profile/223488	Zeninbham	Donor	5	09/09/2013	Hand-In-Paw works incredibly hard to bring high quality dog-assisted therapy services to a wide variety of community partners.

Hand in Paw	168535		/users/profile/223463	haskelly	Volunteer	5	09/09/2013	I have been volunteering with Hand In Paw since early 2013, and I have enjoyed every minute of it. Not only has it helped me establish a deeper bond with my dog, but also it has given me a great opportunity to give back to the community and make a difference in someone's day, someone who is struggling and needed a chance to get their mind off of life's struggles. Another great thing about this organization is there are so many ways to be involved and give back. One does not have to have a therapy animal to participate! Some people assist therapy teams on visits with patients, students, etc., some people assist in planning community and fundraising events, and some people help by simply spreading the word about Hand In Paw! I have never been so passionate about something in my entire life, but Hand In Paw has definitely been one of my best decisions so far, and I cannot wait to see what this experience has in store for me and my dog in the future!

The therapy teams incent and encourage those recovering from injury or illness, provide much-needed to relief to those enduring grief or trauma, and serve as a comforting and soothing presence for reluctant readers and others facing sociological challenges.    There are few limits to the effect of the animal-human bond and Hand in Paw makes wonderful things happen through its programs' practical application of it.  
Hand in Paw	167696		/users/profile/222562	Sharon83	Client Served	5	09/05/2013	I want to tell you about my experience with Hand-In-Paw! My then 95 1/2 year-old Dad, a WWII veteran, spent his last weeks in the Safe Harbor unit at the Birmingham VA hospital in March of this year. He was a precious man, with a good heart and a great love for dogs. He always had a dog for as long as I remember until the past nine years when he went to live in an assisted living facility. A few days before he passed, I came met another Veteran and his yellow lab, Ryder, a Therapy Team with Hand-In-Paw, that was visiting the unit in hopes of cheering up the patients, if only for a little while. I asked him to visit my Dad as he had been in very low spirits and pain. He shortly brought Ryder to visit and my-oh-my how Dad IMMEDIATELY perked up! Dad was able to pet and love on Ryder and even give him treats and I will always remember Dad's smile. Of course, it was a "Kodak moment" and I look at that photo often. I want to thank Hand-In-Paw and Ryder from the bottom of my heart!!!!!!
Hand in Paw	167574		/users/profile/222438	lcicloud	Volunteer	5	09/05/2013	My dog and I are a Therapy Team with Hand in Paw.  This summer we worked with 9 other Hand in Paw teams by visiting teenage girls who have suffered from abuse and neglect.  We call this our 'Pawsitive Living' program.  Every visit during the 12 week program, I saw the power of my dog's kind spirit.  Two of the girls we visited were afraid of dogs and started out hesitant to join our group.  On the last night they were snuggling and smiling with Jed in their lap while listening to our facilitator tell the all of girls how special they are.  I can't adequately express to you how it feels to be a part of the emotional growth of those sweet girls.  What we do at Hand in Paw is powerful and it works!

Make Way Partners	225951	1	/users/profile/289700	charlenetosi	Board Member	5	10/23/2014	Talk about courage, passion, love, commitment and dedication--Make Way Partners is a place where all of these things blend together to make a difference in the world of children in Sudan and around the world.  It is an honor and a privilege to be a part of an organization that holds powerful healing, transformation energy.
Make Way Partners	223909	2	/users/profile/287660	mamielvan	Donor	5	10/17/2014	MWP is a powerful organization as evidenced by its history and results. It speaks loudly of what God can do where there is real faith and commitment. It is truly an unbelievable story except for the fact it really happened. With a small team of volunteers, the Smith's threw their whole lives into following God's will. And God's will is for all people in the world to know His love. One way that MWP is doing that is by loving children in North and South Sudan  who have lived their whole life in fear and terror through no fault of their own. Over 1000 children are now housed in three orphanages, loved, fed, educated. The Smiths saw the wisdom of finding believers who live in Sudan to partner with them to do the work of MWP. I feel so blessed to be able to be a part of this ministry and know that I am participating in God's work in Sudan, a dark place where God's light is brightly burning!
Make Way Partners	223637	1	/users/profile/287386	PlainsHobbit	Donor	5	10/16/2014	Having been a supporter of Make Way Partners since 2005 has allowed me the privilege to watch as the work done through Make Way Partners to combat human trafficking continues to grow.  I remember hearing the remarkable stories coming out of Sudan in the early days of what would eventually give birth to MWP's first orphanage in that country.  I have seen Make Way Partners used to accomplish amazing things.  While the world around them gives in to despair and corruption and hate, those working for Make Way Partners and it's ministries hold out a message of Hope and Love and Forgiveness.  It is a beacon of Hope in a desperate place.  Lives saved.  Lives changed.  
Make Way Partners	221337	2	/users/profile/285039	Dana44	Donor	5	10/09/2014	We are so touched by Kimberly and the Make Way Partners Organization.  Our family supports them as much as we can.

Make Way Partners	219313		/users/profile/282940	santabear00	Donor	5	10/02/2014	I first heard of MWP through Focus on the Family Radio Show. I was touched by their works in Sudan. They risked their very own lives to rescue the fatherless. Because of that, my husband and I have been supporting this ministry. We love to receive letters from our children in Sudan! Many times their letters brought tears of joy as I could tell of their strengths, their dreams and their hopes in life. I am thankful these children have a safe shelter and are loved!
Make Way Partners	218219	1	/users/profile/281775	mom2ten	Donor	5	09/29/2014	I first learned of MWP when I read the book "Passport Through Darkness".  It opened my eyes to whole different world in which the level of suffering was far beyond what I could even fathom.  How could I turn a blind eye without at least doing something.  When I realized that the people who ran the organization put their own "boots on the ground" and participated in the risk and suffering that the people they were ministering to were enveloped in on a daily basis,  I knew it was a passionate burden for them; being faithful with money is not an issue when you are willing to give of so many other areas of your life for a burden such as this.   I feel totally comfortable donating to them, and realize that every dime we give for the care of the our adopted orphans, go to minister to that child.  I consider it a privilege to be able to give to this organization.
Make Way Partners	218208	1	/users/profile/281761	Hope4Jesus	Donor	5	09/29/2014	My experience with MWP began when a church member did a presentation on what he saw when visiting MWP's New Life orphanage/school in South Sudan.  I was so moved that I went home and picked out a child for my husband and I to sponsor.  When MWP started this school, there were hundreds of orphans in the area sleeping in trees to avoid being attacked by hyenas and wild dogs.   Through the efforts of MWP, there is an orphanage there now that is home to 750 children.  They provide complete and total care for these children.  Our church now sponsors two more children through MWP.  They have opened my eyes to how blessed we are in the USA, and how, as Christians, we are called to care for orphans and widows -- those less fortunate that ourselves.  MWP leadership follows this calling so well.  I am so proud and happy to be able to partner with this ministry. 
Make Way Partners	218170	1	/users/profile/281721	brendansoma	Donor	5	09/29/2014	My heart goes out to orphans, all over the world. When I read Kimberly Smith's book, Passport Through Darkness, I knew this was the organization I wanted to sponsor a child through. My husband and I have sponsored one child, for two years now, and love the fact, that all money goes directly into the welfare of this child.   
Make Way Partners	218006	1	/users/profile/281558	MichaelandJen K.	Donor	5	09/28/2014	I became familiar with Make Way Partners after reading Kimberly Smith's book, Passport Through Darkness. Our family currently sponsors three children in Sudan through the organization, and I can't say enough good things about the experience. 100% of sponsorship funds go directly to the care of the children, and we are constantly updated as to the conditions and circumstances in the areas the children are living. Make Way Partners is committed to going where no one else dares to, and it is an honor to support them!

Make Way Partners	217925	1	/users/profile/281476	kjacksonp	Donor	5	09/27/2014	Through another charity I learned of a book entitled "Passport Through Darkness", a story of one woman's discovery, along with her family,  about the horrors of child sexual trafficking and child abandonment in Africa and Europe.  This small, efficient organization has grown from this family's commitment to the "starfish principal"--you cannot save every child, but you can save one at at time.  From that philosophy has come the development of orphanages in one of the worst political environments on earth--Darfur and the Sudan, along with efforts to abolish international sexual trafficking, especially in children.I support many charities; in no other is there such a commitment to caring for children no matter the personal risks to the staff.  They literally put their lives on the line on a daily basis in that war torn land.  Please consider them in your plans to help the most helpless--that is what they do very well.
Make Way Partners	217919		/users/profile/281469	Cathy80	Volunteer	5	09/27/2014	Make Way Partners is focused on helping vulnerable children in Sudan and South Sudan, where other agencies are hesitant to go because of the significant danger.  They partner with indigenous people who have already demonstrated a heart for those most at risk of human trafficking, starvation, genocide and more.  What they have accomplished in a short period of time is truly miraculous.  They are not only providing a safe environment for the children to live, they are providing education, nurturing and health care.  They recently opened their first high school, recently opened a new orphanage in the Nuba Mountains, and expanded another one.  They developed a farm and orchard to grow their own food, and they are striving to develop a hospital in a country where people who need hospital care have to be flown to Kenya.  They are continually moving forward, trusting in the Lord's direction.  It is a very effective, efficient ministry.
Make Way Partners	217882		/users/profile/281429	Rachel124	Donor	5	09/27/2014	My husband and I have sponsored children through MWP for over three years now. What I most appreciate about MWP is their commitment to going to hard places and vulnerable people with the love of Christ. Passport Through Darkness by Kimberly Smith is one of the most heart-wrenching books I have ever read....reading it made me weep, but it also made me so grateful for MWP and their focus on the HOPE, LOVE, and LIGHT of Christ that is flooding the darkness. I so appreciate Kimberly Smith's raw honesty about evil alongside of her strong conviction and steadfast trust that Christ is stronger than any evil and that He lovingly rescues and redeems His children!  
Make Way Partners	217795		/users/profile/281337	RandomAndrea	Donor	5	09/26/2014	After reading Passport Through Darkness, I invited Kimberly to speak at my church. She is the real deal, following Jesus' calling no matter what the cost. Her story is living proof that even in the darkest corners of our world God's light is able to shine. My family sponsors one of her orphans and the letter we received from him was so personal. At one time we had sponsored through Save the Children, but ended up canceling because we were constantly bombarded by mailings asking us to give more. It made us question how much of our money was being spent on our child versus all of the marketing materials we received. With MWP, I have no question that every dime of my money is going toward the care of my sponsored child. This organization is different, in that it is indigenously led, by people who have incredible faith in the face of some of the worst evil that exists on this earth. MWP's mission is not for a bunch of Westerners to come in and provide aid, then leave. Their goal is to give as many orphans as possible a chance to grow up feeling hope and knowing God's love, to get an education and as adults use their positive influence to change Sudan from within.

Kimberly and Milton's hearts and pro-active compassion for the especially needy children in both Africa and Peru are extremely challenging and encouraging. Her transparency throughout her books and ministry is real life, yet perservering. She and teammates work side by side supporting deeply caring indigenous leaders/workers who provide the daily provisions, shelter, teaching, and hands-on care for the orphans. We are blessed to share in even a small part of this quality ministry.
Make Way Partners	217576	1	/users/profile/281110	Rhowze	Donor	5	09/26/2014	After reading Passport through Darkness, my life changed.  I was educated and humbled.  I have thanked God for allowing me to be part of Make Way Partners.  My husband and I are blessed to support 3 beautiful children that I pray for and love like my own.  My heart hurts to know that there are leaders that care so little for the people they are suppose to protect and educate.  Instead they enslave, kill and rape or allow others to do so.  Kimberly Smith and the volunteers put themselves in harms way consistently to help the children that are seen as no value to their country.  I am thankful that Kimberly listened to the call from the Lord, took action and gives these children an opportunity to survive, thrive and help their country become a God-fearing, caring place.

Make Way Partners	217551		/users/profile/281083	shelbadawn	Donor	5	09/26/2014	Make Way Partners is a unique ministry reaching forgotten children on the other side of the world.  They receive not only material things to meet their physical needs, but care, protection, love, and faith.  Because love is fleshed out for them by their leaders and mentors, they learn that there are good things waiting for them in life.  Jesus is more than a name to them; He is alive in those who rescue them and hold them close to their hearts. I am amazed at the miracles that keep this wonderful ministry going.  It is so obviously dependent on a God who cares enough to call those who will risk all for His purposes.  And His purpose is to let each one of these children know that they are unique and precious--to Him and to many others around the world.  Any small amount of support will become much in the hands of Kimberly and her support staff.  Their prayers and their faithfulness guarantee that Make Way Partners and the children they rescue will keep on keeping on, guided and upheld by Father God. Shelba Forrest

Make Way Partners	217481	1	/users/profile/281005	SuBu3008	Donor	5	09/25/2014	I first heard about MWP several years ago when Kimberly was a guest on Focus on the Family. I had heard about human trafficking but was shocked at the statistics. I went to the MWP website to find out more about the work they were doing & was compelled to give financially. I read Passport through Darkness & was amazed & so grateful for Kimberly's courage & determination to save the children despite the danger to herself. I have been a supporter of a child for about 3 years & it is so touching to receive his letters & see his pictures as he grows into a young man. God bless all of the dedicated, faithful servants of God who work with MWP. They are truly serving & protecting the helpless & innocent.

Their communication is great, and the work that they're doing is really amazing -- hard, lifesaving labor in places that nobody else wants to go.
Make Way Partners	217468		/users/profile/280991	SharonNY	Donor	5	09/25/2014	I read Kimberly Smith's book and just knew I had to help in some way.  It took me a year to get financially able to do so, but I'm so happy that we are able to help an orphan financially, through personal prayer and encouraging letters to her.  I love that 100% of what I give goes to the child we sponsor!  How many other organizations can proudly say that!  Keep up the good fight Kimberly!  If not in this life, I look forward to meeting you in the next one!

Make Way Partners	217414		/users/profile/280939	pajuneau	Donor	5	09/25/2014	Since we first heard of Kimberly Smith of Make Way Partners on Janet Parshall's Christian radio talk show on WMBI in Chicago, we were greatly impressed with the work they were doing with orphans that were victims of the calamity in South Sudan. We strongly endorse this ministry as it deserves the support of all Christian believers. Peter and Joan JensenSchaumburg, Illinois
Make Way Partners	217411		/users/profile/280936	sssh	Volunteer	5	09/25/2014	After hearing Kimberly Smith speak about her huge transition from corporate life to a meager life of serving like we are asked to do by our heavenly father, I can became convinced like her that there is more to life than just living it.  Kimberly and all help her employees are giving more than just time. They are giving their lives daily living it out as Jesus has asked us to do. They are trying to impoverish the poor, they are saving lives daily, And helping to raise sponsorship around the world for these orphans. I have been volunteering since I retired two years ago and have since become a sponsor.  Their charity work should be on the A+ list.
Make Way Partners	217410		/users/profile/280935	redcpedestrian	Donor	5	09/25/2014	Responsible,  ethical and caring. I have donated to help women and children and that's exactly what they do. 
Make Way Partners	217409		/users/profile/280934	Sally56	Donor	5	09/25/2014	I am so thankful for Kimberly and Milton who saw the need of suffering children in Sudan left homeless because of disease, famine or war.  I sponsor a child and think if I can help one child, what a difference that child might make in the future of Sudan.  I realize we are limited in what we can do because of the war there.  Our prayers were answered when the supplies for the year made it through the war zone to the children.  It is awesome to see how God is working through Make Way Partners to make a difference in the lives of these orphans.   
Make Way Partners	217405		/users/profile/280931	teequulittlerock	Donor	5	09/25/2014	Who would dare attempt to stand between the murderous intentions of evil and the beautiful dignity of human beings?  Who would willingly incur loss and suffering on behalf others?  MWP does this each day, rescuing women and children in the most dangerous places on earth, and providing food, shelter, medicine, education and resources, all through empowering indigenous leadership.  I love knowing that my small donations contribute to justice, protection, and care for the most vulnerable and least protected.  I love hearing the stories of lives saved and growing stronger.   I trust the wise stewardship of Milton and Kimberly Smith.
Make Way Partners	217399		/users/profile/280925	Cathy79	Donor	5	09/25/2014	Make Way Partners is reaching orphans that would otherwise be left to die or be abused. We sponsor one boy in South Sudan and are grateful for that opportunity.

Make Way Partners	217377		/users/profile/280901	krfunk	General Member of the Public	5	09/25/2014	We easily forget about that which we do not see. We forget the plight and pain of those with nothing--no family, no hope, nobody and nothing. MWP does not forget them and they help us see the needs while providing a way to help and partner in bringing hope and life to unadoptable orphans. MWP saves lives plain and simple. So thankful for MWP
Make Way Partners	217376		/users/profile/280900	nurse1958	General Member of the Public	5	09/25/2014	I have known of Make Way Partners for several years.  I pray for them daily and send a financial gift when I can.  I am so blessed when I get Kimberly's emails and read how the Lord is using this organization to provide for the orphans in Sudan.  I am also thankful for the indigenous leaders the Lord has provided who give of themselves unselfishly to care for these traumatized children.  My daughter fully supports a child and my 12 year old granddaughter partially supports another.

Make Way Partners	217367		/users/profile/280889	JP52	General Member of the Public	5	09/25/2014	While I cannot physically go and help the work of Make way partners,by praying and donating to the work,I feel I can play some small part in doing what the Bible commands us to do.To stand up for those who are oppressed,and those who are the most vulnerable.Make way not only care for the physical needs ,but more importantly the spiritual needs of each precious child. I can wholeheartedly recommend giving to this organisation.

Make Way Partners	217355	1	/users/profile/280876	vvg53	Donor	5	09/25/2014	Make Way Partners goes to the most foresaken places on the planet, places of darkness and evil. With hearts full of love, they reach out to donors and would-be volunteers, offering retreats, materials, speakers. MWP is low profile, but it penetrates the consciences of governments. I organzied a benefit concert with a student group, and MWP gave us everything we needed to raise money and awareness. We had a full house, and one Saturday afternoon, musicians, students, teachers, friends & family came together to support the work of MWP. What were some of the comments:  "I had no idea there was still salvery in Africa."  And, "They really protect those women and children?" "How come I don't hear more about this?" If you want to put money and time and resources in an organization that supports indigenouse people fighting the evils of slavery in their homeland, MWP is the ONLY way to go.
Make Way Partners	217344		/users/profile/280867	rlgraves	Donor	5	09/25/2014	MWP is doing what no one else does -- going into lawless lands and rescuing the oppressed and the "least of these"  as Jesus commanded.  I thank God for the work they are doing to save lives.  It is a blessing to be a part of this ministry.  Our Make Way Partner child is beautiful and we are privileged to be a part of her life if even in a small way. 
Make Way Partners	217343	1	/users/profile/280866	gwendolyndd	Donor	4	09/25/2014	We have been a child sponsor since 2008.  Make Way Partners has always made us feel personally connected to our child.

Make Way Partners	216896	2	/users/profile/280417	starryknight	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/24/2014	I have been a supporter and donor of MWP for 7 years and can attest to their mission to fight against human trafficking and other forms of oppression and marginalization of people everywhere - I love how they keep you constantly up to date with the conflicts in the areas that they work in and the fact that they work in some of the most desperate places where other organizations either can't or don't want to work because of the extreme risks and costs involved - God bless and continue the work MWP!
Make Way Partners	216859	1	/users/profile/280380	altm	Donor	5	09/24/2014	I love this ministry!  I love their mission, vision, and trust their leadership! They are financially responsible --- both having the seal approval from ECFA and also making available their 990s and a third party financial review each year on their website.   They care about the heart --- both the hearts of those they serve in Sudan and South Sudan --- but also us as donors, sending thoughtful, thought-provoking, invitations to seek out God's heart in our midst and our purpose in the world.  They do this through their blogs, newsletters, and also when you interact with their staff.  It feels like being a part of a family when you follow this ministry. They do what they can't do --- serving in warzones and lawless lands where everything seems to be really hard and where its impossible to get things done.  Yet, God makes a way for those they serve.  It's inspiring to see how often God intercedes for the most vulnerable. It's essential --- they purposefully serve where no one else will go - because its too dangerous or too corrupt and stand behind indigenous leadership.  The ministry they provide literally saves lives and literally stands in the gap for others. I am a child sponsor and deeply value the growth I've seen in my child --- both physically (he is so healthy now) and also spiritually and emotionally.  He dreams big and that is a gift to all orphans in warzones.   Pictures would be enough evidence just to see the progressive transformation in his life.  
Make Way Partners	211132	1	/users/profile/273997	HolliW	Donor	5	08/19/2014	I have supported Make Way Partners for almost 2 years now through full child sponsorship.

Make Way Partners	185980	6	/users/profile/242953	WhitMilton	Donor	5	10/30/2013	I have been a child sponsor and supporter of Make Way Partners for over 5 years. Make Way Partners is so unique because they are caring for the MOST vulnerable children in war torn---that no one else is caring for! Also, my husband and I respect Make Way Partners' approach of ministry: They work through indigenous leaders! They are ECFA accredited and guarantee that 100% of my child sponsor donation is going towards caring for my child! We feel safe placing our donation in MWP's hands because we know it is reaching the  people.

Make Way Partners	184144	3	/users/profile/241085	awal79	Donor	5	10/29/2013	I have been a child sponsor since 2006 and now sponsor children in honor of my nephews so that they can experience the joy of knowing a child in Sudan and seeing them as family.  Make Way Partners is an amazing organization through which God is at work and on the move on behalf of His children --- the unadoptable orphans and widows at risk to slavery.  As I've partnered with MWP I have grown to trust their leadership and am impressed with their mission to the least of these.   As I've watched the children that I support grow I am honored to see how much, in so few years, has developed in their lives and am eager to see what change-makers they will be in their own country, community and future families.
Make Way Partners	183772	2	/users/profile/240685	kraftylady	Volunteer	5	10/28/2013	Make Way Partners is an organization that truly cares about the starving and abused children of the world, and are willing to put themselves in danger in order to go to Sudan and other places to minister to these sweet ones, I am proud that I have had the opportunity to volunteer at times for them.
Make Way Partners	183768	3	/users/profile/240670	Rocky4	Donor	5	10/28/2013	The child sponsorship program is a great way for my family to connect with the fight against human trafficking. MWP provides not just supplemental help but total care to these vulnerable orphans. While we wish we could physically adopt our child in Sudan, we know that without an org like MWP going to these extreme locations we would never have the chance of helping to care for a child in need like ours. We still consider him a part of our family and love to write him letters and see him grow!
Make Way Partners	183379	2	/users/profile/240290	miltodt	Donor	5	10/28/2013	For 5 years, my wife and I have sponsored a young woman at one of the orphanages in South Sudan through the child sponsorship program.  It has been a delight to see her grow from a little girl into a young woman.  We believe strongly in the work God is doing through Make Way Partners to protect orphans and widows in this war torn country.  We encourage anyone to sponsor a child so they may have the Christian discipleship, education, food, and medical care these children receive through donations to Make Way Partners.
Make Way Partners	183286	2	/users/profile/240198	bbrnp	Donor	5	10/28/2013	I've supported Make Way Partners by sponsoring a child for several years.

Make Way Partners	177502	2	/users/profile/234062	Aaron N.	Donor	4	10/14/2013	This charity; is a new organization to me, that I just recently learned about in the past 6 months. It's primary focus is on human trafficking, mainly children of Sudan. Unlike other child sponsorships, all monies given goes to the children's housing, clothing, food and schooling. You become there parents or family. But not only can you sponsor a child after they are taken out of hostile conditions, you can choose to sponsor the missionaries that work with this organization.I give support to the workers, and hope to start assisting a child in need soon. It's worth the money and investments. I hope you will consider sponsoring either the workers and or child.God bless

Episcopal Communities Foundation, Inc. dba Episcopal Place	206532	3	/users/profile/268972	EPSupporterTEC	Donor	5	07/18/2014	I like to think of Episcopal Place as an option as I age.  That's why I give.  I want it to be there, when I need a wonderful place like Episcopal Place to finish out my years of living independently but in an upscale caring environment - a community...and I'm not even Episcopalian.  I visit and see the activities for the residents.  I witness the care and compassion shown by the staff.  The staff goes above and beyond a simple rental office.  The public areas are fashionable and well maintained.  The location is so convenient...the park, the theater, St. Vincent's Hospital and shopping.  Some of the apartments even have balconies with a view!  There's a chapel, hair salon, library, porch and gardens.  Yep, purely selfish.  Hope there's an opening if and when I need it...keep up the good work!
Episcopal Communities Foundation, Inc. dba Episcopal Place	206409	1	/users/profile/57433	Tim B.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/17/2014	I am ending my 6th year at EP and could not be more proud of where we are.  Our Chaplain said it best when she said, "Life at EP is a never-ending story of needs, friendship, strength and grace."  [We care for those] "who are struggling to survive in a demanding world."  Life can be hard for all of us at times but when you combine an aging population with limited financial resources you are left with what one could easily call despair.  That is where EP makes a difference!  HUD funding ensures that the buildings are kept to an acceptable standard, that the utility bills are paid and minimal staff is retained.  With the help of Episcopal parishes, the Diocese and many donors we are able to provide the "extras" such as medical transportation,  subsidized noon meals, subsidized housekeeping for those that are not physically able to maintain their home, a part time Episcopal Chaplain and an activities program.  It is this kind of care that Bishop Stough, back in the middle 1970's, had dreams of.....and I am happy to be a part of continuing the mission and vision that he saw.  
Episcopal Communities Foundation, Inc. dba Episcopal Place	184528	2	/users/profile/57433	Tim B.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/29/2013	I just completed my 5th year of employment at EP!  I can't say enough good things about it.  The staff not only cares FOR the residents but they care ABOUT the residents and the residents care about the staff.  One of the things most impressive is the way we all pull together when needed.  Everybody jumps in and offers to help for things like serving big resident meals or carrying out fund raisers like Gumbo Gala.  I think Mother Teresa says it best, "Let us touch the dying, the poor, the lonely and the unwanted according to the graces we have received and let us not be ashamed or slow to do the humble work."
Episcopal Communities Foundation, Inc. dba Episcopal Place	129876	1	/users/profile/57433	Tim B.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/26/2012	I recently attended the LeadingAge conference in Denver, CO and was joined by over 8000 other non-profit providers that do what we do here at EP.....  that is to serve and advocate for the elderly and disabled.  Hearing the stories of so many others from across the country, I was reminded that what we do matters.  Collectively, we care for thousands and thousands of people every day that would otherwise not have a caring, safe and comfortable environment to live in.  I was also reminded that EP ranks well when compared to other communities and the services that are offered to the residents.  As a once was told by one of our Clergy, "You are tending the field you have been given and are a good steward of your calling.  We can only do what we can do, and, thank the Lord, that is enough."
Episcopal Communities Foundation, Inc. dba Episcopal Place	55346	2	/users/profile/57433	Tim B.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/25/2010	Episcopal Place serves the needs of its disabled population in a myriad of ways.  One of the most important ways is advocacy.  Even though differences are made and lives are improved upon on an individual basis almost every day, advocacy brings about systemic change that can effect many people.  We do not advocate FOR our residents, we advocate WITH our residents.  We give them the opportunity to go and be seen and heard and to represent themselves.  For example, over the past year, groups have been taken to Montgomery to demonstrate for more funding for transportation, to the City of Birmingham to rally and to the City of Vestavia to speak before the City Council regarding public bus service.  These advocacy opportunities brought about change that directly impacted a resident that lives at Episcopal Place.  A bus route that provided transportation for a disabled resident so he could work a part-time job was in jeopardy of being discontinued.  The residents and staff of Episcopal Place went to work and the decision to discontinue the route was overturned.  After speaking with the Executive Director of the Birmingham Jefferson County Transit Authority, he told me that our advocacy was the key factor that changed the minds of the key players and therefore resulted in the bus routes not being discontinued.

We are able to offer such a wide variety of services through the grants and fundraisers and are able to serve such a diverse population that I am overwhelmed daily by what we do. Having the ability to meet with people daily, touch their lives, meet with their family members and help them in crisis or tramatic times has really made my life long dream a reality. I am in awe of how many residents are able to remain in their apartments because of what we offer and how many have lived here over 10 years.

I have enjoyed the teamwork and the love that the residents share with the staff and each other. Over the past 7 years, I have most enjoyed getting to know each and every resident and listening to their wonderful stories and being able to fulfill their needs with the services we offer. Episcopal Place is so warm and welcoming and the activities provide a great arena for socializing and also during the holidays we have been able to fill in for those who have no family. Sometimes we can offer a smile or a hug that changes someone's day for the better. I believe that is who we are- the people who make a change for the better.

This organization, the staff, and the residents have greatly impacted my life. Currently I am in the process of assisting a female resident with a desire to be one of the first fashion models with a disability. She needed a portfolio and we were able to locate a local photographer willing to create it for her. She is now well on her way to reaching her dream. Through a new relationship with an exercise facility specializing in assisting persons with disabilities as well as senior citizens, I have successfully applied for and received 15 full or partial scholarships for our residents to utlize the facility. We also have arranged transportation to the complex twice a week. Through these activities, the residents are able to age in place.

Episcopal Communities Foundation, Inc. dba Episcopal Place	205582		/users/profile/267790	jane417	Client Served	5	07/10/2014	My mother has been a resident at The Episcopal Place since March 2013.  Over the past 16 months my expectations of care/services rendered has far exceeded any ideas I had prior to mother moving in.  There are activities scheduled everyday for the residence to participate in if they chose.  My concerns with my mother getting to the doctor have been taken care of as there is a van to provide transportation to/from appointments.  Weekly trips to two different grocery stores are provided.  There are "field trips" offered.  Most importantly, mother has made wonderful friends with other residents and staff.  I feel 100% positive there is no better atmosphere for the elderly or disabled citizens anywhere. My husband has asked me many times, "we can move in"! I almost forgot.....We LOVE the annual gumbo gala.  We wouldn't miss it and have invited our friends to come along with us.  There are activites for all age groups.  Our six year old granddaughter loves to go along as well.

I cannot say enough good things about the staff, board of directors, and residents. Episcopal Place is committed to providing services (medical van transportation , meals and housekeeping programs, and activities) that helps   our residents live independently in affordable housing for a longer time. Everyday more than one person tells how thankful the are to be living at Episcopal Place and how thankful they are for our caring staff.

Episcopal Communities Foundation, Inc. dba Episcopal Place	185235	1	/users/profile/240380	ojulesp	Client Served	4	10/30/2013	As a resident of Episcopal Place, I have found the service and concern of the staff to be a primary life saving event. Often when one changes a lifestyle at an older age, depression can set in with the usual gerontology issues and illnesses. The attention given by staff and residents often dispell issues that prevent major depression. It is not easy at all for a formerly active , healthy out going individual to change their lifestyle because of the inability to be as active as they once were. Episcopal Place provides assistance , activities, and direction that affords the residents to remain as active as possible.

I really enjoy the programs and activities and the fact that I can also be at home and spend time with my companion cat that is allowed at EP. The socialization is great and the health screenings brought here allow us so much more access to good health care than some folks have. I really like the medical transportation and the opportunity for noon meals that are delivered. I am really happy here and hope to live the rest of my life here.

We are blessed to have Elmo Tanner , our medical van driver.

Activities, experiences and services are provided that allow those residents, who wish to participate to have an enriched, full life.I feel that my donations have been used efficiently and wisely.  The diversity of the residents indicates that Episcopal Place is not just for Episcopalians and the elderly.  My positive interaction with residents and staff members proves to me that the mission statement of "Enriching Lives with Grace & Comfort" is being well carried out.  I plan to continue my involvement with time and money.  I think it would be a great place to live, when the time comes, too.
Episcopal Communities Foundation, Inc. dba Episcopal Place	130683		/users/profile/176176	T. Edward	General Member of the Public	5	10/29/2012	For years I had driven by Episcopal Place and knew that it was housing, I thought for senior citizens.  And to be honest, I thought they all had to be of the Episcopalian denomination.  Then the church that I attend, Southside Baptist, began to encourage volunters to visit and help in ways identified by the staff.  I also learned that some of my church family actually live at Episcopal Place.  So, it's not just for Episcopalians and it's not just for seniors, but those with disabilities, too.  Not long ago I visited for a performance given by Four for Time for the residents in the lovely assembly room.  It was well attended and was like being in a New York cabaret!   I met and talked with some of the residents.  They have a walled garden and an aviary in one of the sitting rooms, designed for the residents' amusement.  One of the residents identified the different birds and informed me of their habits.  I observed the staff mingling with the residents and it was like a family.  I kept thinking this is where I would want my parents to live.  Then the thought occured to me, I am fast approaching that generation and this is where I want to live.  A room with a balcony, in one of the buildings adjacent to the Virginia Samford Theater, the park and just off Highland Avenue, not far from St. Vincent's Hospital, plus a great, caring staff.  Just hope there's room, when I'm ready...

It's supported by a caring and loving staff,  who makes certain each resident remains independent and valued.  The residents are former artists, actors, painters, writers,  nurses, nuns, veterans, truck drivers, and governments workers all living their lives in this lovely environment off Highland Avenue. As the Activities Director, I get to see them during some fun times, but also see the challenges that come with aging while maintaining a sense of dignity. The Episcopal Place is a true jewel of a place.

For instance, Martha, one of my favorite residents, has learning disabilitles and was unable to live in an unsupervised environment. She comes to all the creative activities offered ( in fact, she's the first one to sign up) and I've noticed her speech and self confidence have improved remarkably. She feels safe, nutured, and loved, and it's a joy to watch her day by day. The Episcopal Place is a haven and home, a safe place to be.

The staff members here really care about the residents and go out of their way to make our lives easier, safer and more fulfilling.  For instance, a wireless emergency call system was recently installed at no cost to the residents.  We each have a personal button to wear on our wrist or around our necks which we can press to call for help in case of a health emergency.  The system works no matter where we are on the property here.  This is only one of the many extra services that Episcopal Housing Foundation provides residents.  Episcopal Place is not just low income housing for seniors and people with disabilities.  It is a place to keep your mind and body active and healthy; and a place to grow old with dignity, respect, friendship and family.

Episcopal Communities Foundation, Inc. dba Episcopal Place	56887	2	/users/profile/59633	O Happy Day	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/13/2010	I was a staff member at Episcopal Place for 25 years, until my retirement in 2008.  In this 1980 federally subsidized independent living facility for limited income  elderly and  young physically challenged adults, our overarching goal as board and staff was to create a caring Christian community in which residents of all faiths and backgrounds could live interdependently and age in place with dignity.  With funds from the board of directors, volunteer coordination was added in 1984 and pastoral care services in 1988.  Two years later board funds permitted the hiring of Alabama's first Supportive Services Coordinator (read "social worker") in this type of federally assisted housing.  By 1992 a new federal law enabled HUD funding of this position from half- to full-time.  The Service Coordinator's role was and is to import community services at reduced or no cost to the residents to sustain independent living and prevent premature nursing home transfers.  The "triumvirate" of volunteer, pastoral care, and supportive services coordination enabled Episcopal Place to transition from an independent living FACILITY to a supportive housing COMMUNITY.  Community-building was and is an ongoing process, however, requiring a sustained commitment by board, volunteers, and staff, who worked and work as a team to bring the founding board's vision to fruition. Given its population's age and cultural mix, Episcopal Place is a microcosm of the larger community of Birmingham and, for that matter, the nation.  Would that the "caring community" model created there could be replicated not only in like facilities, as suggested by current board president Terry Rogers, but also in cities across the country.

They can be private if they prefer or they can take part in a multitude of activities provided by churches and community groups.  During several "Jewelry Workshops" for residents, I provided beads and stringing material and watched each participant enjoy creating a necklace for herself.  And we had fun together!  The first-rate staff is available to meet needs of residents on an ongoing basis.  Episcopal Place provides housing which allows residents to age comfortably in a pleasant, safe environment.

Episcopal Communities Foundation, Inc. dba Episcopal Place	56333	1	/users/profile/58762	Darlene	Board Member	5	11/03/2010	Before I became a member of the Board I had many interactions with residents of Episcopal Place since several were members where I attended church. But the most memorable and inspiring resident was an essentiallly non-verbal paralyzed man who traveled in his electric wheelchair around the neighborhood selling candy. Although he couldn't speak he had no trouble communicating and was very friendly. Whenever I ran into him I would buy candy I didn't need, but I never thought about where he lived and how he survived. One day I saw him getting off the bus at Episcopal Place. I learned not only was EP a retirement community but it could accomodate the disabled.  As the years have gone by this man doesn't sell candy any more. But he, and others like him, have a safe and comfortable place to live at Episcopal Place. And he still enjoys life...especially during football season!
Episcopal Communities Foundation, Inc. dba Episcopal Place	55875	1	/users/profile/58121	Hube D.	Board Member	5	10/29/2010	I first became affiliated with Episcopal Housing as a participant in their annual fundraiser, the Gumbo Gala of Birmingham. It was during that cooking competition that I was struck by the passion and energy of all the workers and volunteers associated with this great institution. Having dealt with elder and special needs care in my own family, I immediately recognized the special impact that truly dedicated individuals can have on the lives of those in their care, and the effects on the residents who enjoyed the festivities that day was evident. Making a difference, a true difference, in the lives of seniors and special needs folks takes a dedication you cannot buy or hire out. That sort of motivation has to come from within, and Episcopal Place has done as good a job as I've ever seen in attracting the type of people who express true love and devotion through their service. They are not employees, they are extended family members to the residents, and as a result the residents enjoy the highest quality of life possible. This is truly one of the special places, and deserves recognition as such.

Episcopal Communities Foundation, Inc. dba Episcopal Place	55765		/users/profile/57994	Kenneth B.	Client Served	5	10/28/2010	I have lived at Episcopal Place for 12 years. I was anxious about living independently. At the time, I looked into several different apartment complexes and Episcopal Place had the accessible unit I needed as well as being subsidized so my rent was lower. I have gained more and more independence and self worth living at Episcopal Place. I have been able to advocate for my needs and wants as well as reaching out to help others. The 12 years I have lived here have not always been perfect, however I have worked my way through the problems with staff support. I have maintained a job for 2 1/2 years that I love and am very confident in my duties. All of this is a blessing from God and without him I would not have the courage to live life to its fullest.

Episcopal Communities Foundation, Inc. dba Episcopal Place	55512		/users/profile/57681	Kris M.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/27/2010	      Now that my own parents are living in an assisted living facility, I can even better understand why Episcopal Place is so needed in our community.     Fortunately, my own parents can afford to pay the $5,000 per month that it costs for them to live in assisted living.  They are fortunate to be among the elderly and disabled adults who have retirement income, retirement savings and a long-term health care insurance policy to cover the costs of long-term care.     But for the 146 seniors and disabled adults who live at Episcopal Place, that is not the case.  Our residents lived on fixed incomes and some of them do not have enough income to cover the bare necessities they need each month.  Our independent living facility provides them affordable housing through HUD (U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development) and our foundation raises funds in the community to provide them with supportive services like transportation, subsidized noon meals and housekeeping, resident activities, pastoral care and counseling.     Many of our residents, based on physical disabilities and limitations, could qualify for assisted living, but they cannot afford the cost, so living at Episcopal Place with supportive services helps them avoid having to move prematurely to a nursing home on Medicaid.     One of our most remarkable residents is a 42-year-old man with cerebral palsy.  Despite his physical limitations, he works part-time at Publix and tries to be a positive influence in the lives of everyone he encounters.  His whole life is about helping others and doing good works.  He is a customer service representative for Publix, helping shoppers find  items they need in the store.  Many people who shop at that store on a regular basis know this resident by name.  Each time we take our display board out in the public to promote Episcopal Place, we have someone comment on the picture of that resident and say they know him from Publix.  They always comment on his positive attitude and his desire to help.    This resident says that living at Episcopal Place for the past 7 years has helped him become that person that he is today.  Because Episcopal Place has been here to help him with his needs, he wants to share his good fortune with others.       We hear that same sentiment from many of our residents who feel blessed to live at Episcopal Place.  It is a wonderful facility that is making a real difference in the lives of those who live here.

I soon realized how important it was for me to listen to her whether it was a new story or one she had already shared with me.

They are truly here to help and assist those in need.  We are still very close and thankful to The Dannnon Project, Kerri, Jeh Jeh and the staff.
Dannon Project	80807		/users/profile/88212	Jeh Jeh	Board Member	5	03/01/2011	I want everyone to know why the Dannon Project is so special to me. It was named after my brother, who had the best smile in the world. His life was taken at 18 years old by my good friend, who at the time was living a life of crime. My beautiful wife Kerri wanted to honor my brother who she never met, but loved him as much as I did. We wanted to help those who at one time lived in the crime world, but want to change their lives, and become respectful citizens. We, The Dannon Project, have helped so many people in the city of Birmingham. We want to help everyone who is getting out of prison with job training, housing, clothing, and emotional counseling. In some way, if we look back at all the things we've done, some of us could be in the same position. That is why The Dannon Project, to me, is the best organization for previously incarcerated prisoners who have turned a complete 180. Thank you for honoring this agency and helping other agencies who are helping people.
Dannon Project	80720		/users/profile/88094	Hedy	General Member of the Public	5	03/01/2011	As a retired school principal and lifetime childrens' advocate, I truly can appreciate the mission and work of The Dannon Project.  The organization seeks to rehabilitate and assist those who, for one reason or another, have lost their way.  This segment of our society is a growing one and has very specific needs.  The Project starts its work during incarceration and continues as individuals attempt to re-enter society.  This is a crucial time when assistance and positive reinforcement  are needed if the cycle is to be broken.  Thank you for an agency that is truly needed and appreciated.               
Dannon Project	79963		/users/profile/87315	Kimlpatton	Donor	5	02/28/2011	I am a long term contributor to The Dannon Project (TDP). It is an outstanding nationally recognized agency (see You Tube Feeding Dreams on TDP story) reflecing how they are consistently providing quality services to at risk populations including underemployed, unemployed, non violent previously incarcerated persons and youth who are pregnant, parenting, child of an incarcerated person or teen who had troubles with the law.  The Dannon Project provides exceptionally high quality customer service to participants and their families while working closely with other community based and governmental agencies to prevent duplication of services. The Dannon Project uses resources wisely making it a great investment for every dollar contributed leading to outcomes that far exceed national, state and regional outcomes. The participants receive the services and support they need to change their lives and give them a second chance to achieve their hopes and dreams. They receive assessment, case management, housing, counseling, health care, pharmacy assistance, job training and plaement, state work certifications, savings accounts and financial literacy training, life skills training, pathways out of poverty training, character counts training, HIV AIDS prevention training, and a host of other supportive services and mentor matching to change their ways of thinking and support to  learn new behaviors that will help them achieve their goals and dreams and show how they can do all things through unconditional love which is in abundance at TDP.  Participants are treated with dignity and respect with high expectations for goal achievement being the anticipated return on investment. They hire participants and you cannot tell whether the staff is a former participant or a professional because the staff takes great pride in providing high quality professional service to each person who comes in contact with the agency making them feel important and part of the family, that whatever happened in the past will not influence how the agency is there to support you in achieving your future goals and aspirations. It is refreshing to know that there are people who truly care for others to restore and re-engage them in our community to create success for all involved. Now if they had more money and resources for prevention maybe they could actually prevent folks from making choices of crime and help build skills in how to plan and implement the plan as to how to have a successful life without having to get in trouble with the law and then come in contact with TDP. I enjoy attending events where participants are awarded certicates and receive incentives for goal achievements for training completion, job placements, certifications like CNA, Phlebotomy, EKG and Pharmacy Tech.

Since then, I have completed all of the programs offered here. Through my diligence and hard work, I was afforded the opportunity to participate in the STP program here. It gives me a chance to not only assist others who face the same trials that I have, but also gives me a chance to give back to the same people who gave me a chance. I am now the lab assistant in training through the STP program, with the opportunity to become a full time employee with the Dannon Project.

I was released from Julia Tutwiler Prison on June 30, 2010.  After I got out of prison I felt so alone, even though I had family to back me up.  They just didnt understand what prison takes out of you.  The minute I walked in the door at Dannon I felt like I was finally home.  I went to all of the computer classes, got my Ready To Work Certificate, was put on the Skills Training Program and the next thing I know I now have  full time job with Dannon!!!  I have never been this happy in my entire 50 years of my life.  The road to this happy place wasnt easy but with people in my corner it took the edge off and I felt like I could conquer the world with people keeping me uplifted.

We truly need someone in our corner that has not only been there, but understands what it is like to be judged by society. They understand the trials and tribulations that ex-felons face on a day to day basis. The Dannon Project has been there for me through trying times in this trying time in my life. Without their support, many of us would just quit trying to succeed in life and go back to our comfort zone which would just end us right back in the same situation we began with. We need more positive influences in our lives like the Dannon Project. They truly strive to make life worth living in a normal social environment.

TDP offered me courses on lifeskills, financial literacy, finding out about all the various college options open to me. They also support me in various other ways. They give us participants moral support, they give us someone to talk to to help us figure out our next steps coming out of prison and transitioning back into society.       They make all the difference to us who have noone when we come home.  They prepare us for job interviews, as well as help us find gainful employment, so that we not only feel, but we become contributing members of society.     TDP is a wonderful organization, and the people who run the program, the people who work at the program, really care, they really want to make a difference.  And they do.     What started out as a tragedy for one family, became a blessing to hundreds of convicted persons all over Alabama.  And, I, as a participant of this organization am truly grateful for all that they stand for and do.

ALL (emphasize ALL) the staff I've dealt with there are friendly, knowledgeable, professional and eager to assist. The clients I've met through the year or so I've been involved with the Dannon Project are, without exception, trying to better themselves in order to return to the community as a productive citizen, and most of them, in order to return to a family they hope will be proud of them. Many of them have children or elderly parents they want to support. The clients are apparently carefully screened, because I haven't met one yet that I thought was "taking advantage" of the services Dannon offers.  In short, the staff, clients, volunteers of the Dannon Project are the most sincere and honest group of people I've ever met in this type of project. Huge CUDOs, Dannon Project!!

I lost my mother,father,grandmother, and grandfather all during my incarcerationband had no where to go so I came to a transitional house here in Birmingham. But that wasn't cutting it, they didnlt help you with nothing. I heard about "The Dannon Project" and decided to see what they were about. Right away when I entered into the office I was welcomed and they really seemed to care about my needs and desires. I didn't have anything-clothes,hygiene,shoes, or an ID. This team of loving and caring professionals went above and beyond their duty to make sure that my needs were met. I was not the only one I have seen these people do the same thing for many others. I feel like others should get on board with "The Dannon Project" and help those who are having a hard time helping themselves.

I'm not even sure how they found out about me, or if i contacted them its during the time frame of "everything is moving too fast".  Every time I emailed them, called them about anything, i always got a fast response, and being that my schedule was not on a set routine, someone would just meet me there with just a phone call saying im on the way there now.  They offered me just about everything you could imagine wigs, hats, scarves, you name it they offered it.  The wigs were a big thing for me cause i didnt want to where the do rags too much, especially to church, and if i got tired of one they just let me trade it for a new one.  Everything they do is awsome. cant say enough good things about them, friendly staff, clean enviroment,

Steel Magnolias Breast Cancer Support Group Inc	91299		/users/profile/46803	lenora-j	Board Member	5	06/18/2011	My name is Lenora Johnson, I have been a breast cancer survivor since 1999.  In 2001, I founded Steel Magnolias.  Our group has grown into an army of men (Men of Steel) and women who work shoulder to shoulder to offer comfort and hope to cancer patients, especially breast cancer.  We work in Alabama, primarily in calhoun and surropunding counties, however through our website, our newsletter, through legislation we pushed through the 2009 Alabama general session and care packages we mail, our influence is felt in many places.  Our desire is to offer patients caught like deer in the headlights, not knowing where to turn and facing unsure futures, courage and comfort for the challenges in their lives.  Our supporters make our work possible.  Thank you!  Lenora
Steel Magnolias Breast Cancer Support Group Inc	45929	4	/users/profile/46803	lenora-j	Board Member	5	06/26/2010	In 1999, I was diagnosed with Triple Negative Breast Cancer.  Thanks to God, I was diagnosed before my cancer spread.  However, because of the seriousness of my cancer cell and because I didn't get a clear margin, I had bilateral mastectomy and TRAM reconstruction.  I have never regretted my decision.  It took me two years to reclaim my life and in that time I felt certain that there should be something or some group, locally to help women going through what I had just come out of.  After several personal encounters with people who encouraged me to become an advocate, and finally having Chaplain Jim Wilson's phone number laid in my hand, I called the RMC Chaplain and said, "I think I should become minvolved in a breast cancer support group."  I was told, "It will be more than becoming involved, you'll have to establish one, there is not one here in Anniston."  The first meeting was in August, 2001.  Since then we have grown into a recognized 501 c 3 nonprofit organization with a website , and are now a service, support and educational organization.  We are a group of survivors, volunteers, no one, including me, receives a salary.  All contributions go either to our many ministries inside Anniston's Regional Medical Center or to minister to patients wherever they live, with care packages and the monthly steel Magnolias Newsletter.  In 2009, we were successful in pushing legislation through the Alabama general session, by unanimous vote in both the House and Senate that closed the loophole in Alabama's breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act.  Our needs are increasedfunding so that we can continue to expand services and new computer and office equipment so that we can do more draft work in our RMC office.  Before we adopt any new program, we test it by the Prayer of Jabez- First Chronicles 4:10 "Oh, that You would bless me indeed, and enlarge my territory, that Your hand would be with me, and that You would keep me from evil, that I may not cause pain."

My husband met a lady that was a member of Steel Magnolias.  When she learned of my diagnosis, she asked my husband if Lenora knew about it.  my husband asked Lenora who?  In two days I received a packet from Lenora Johnson, Founder and Director of Stel Magnolias.  Inside that packet were items that I needed following my mastectomy.  I also received cards, phone clls and I knew they were praying for me, someone they did's know.  Isn't that amazing?  After my recovery and retirement from the Postal Service, I became a member of Steel Magnolias and have been with them ever since.  It has been a privilege and joy to be a part of a group of women that have walked the same path as myself and care about reaching out to other women that are on this same journey.

Not only has this group tackled the "hands-on" care of the patient and their road to treatment and recovery, they have included their families as well.

It's a great blessing to realize this group has raised funds to provide care baskets for other breast and cervical cancer patients. They provide two meal vouchers for the patient's family. They provide baskets of crackers and drinks in the radiology/chemotherapy doctors offices, for patients getting treatment. They discovered a loophole in the Medicaid law denying treatment for those who had worked, had insurance, but diagnosed with cancer and lost their job and insurance and then were denied coverage. By gathering thousands of signatures on petitions and with the help of Rep. Lea Fite, and Sen. Kim Benefield. They saw this loophole closed. They purchased a breast kit and volunteers go to the schools to teach young girls how to recognize signs of cancer. They hold bake and jewelry sales, and silent auctions to raise money. They their first Lea Fite Memorial Golf Tournament in memory of our state Rep. who helped get the law passed for Medicaid coverage (for breast and cervical cancer).

The volunteers are inspirational, kind, generous, and caring. It is one of the most amazing organizations I have ever had the privilege of being witnessing.

My Mother had bladder cancer and it very much affected the whole family. Without proper information, that bad time in our lives would've been so much worse. We need this group and more like it to keep us informed.  Keep up the Good Work Steel Magnolias!!

Steel Magnolias deserves the recognition it so deserves. They are doing a wonderful job with educating women of all ages. People from around the world are becoming educated from various sources: websites, emails, blogs, etc.. I've known many wonderful women in my life, who've experienced breast cancer, this group would have been very helpful to them.

Free2Be provides much needed services to an under-served population in an area of the United States where LGBTQ people are often overlooked if not facing outright discrimination. The agency is also venturing into new and unexplored territory for themselves and for the LGBTQ South with their new programs. They are braving the rough waters of grantwriting and working under the auspices of grant administrators in order to supply the LGBTQ community with anti-violence programs such as outreach, advocacy, therapeutic and supportive groups, counseling for individuals, couples, and families, as well as community events related to domestic violence, sexual assault, bullying, and suicide prevention and awareness.

Free2Be (Free2Be LGBTQ Resource Center & Free2Be Safe Anti-Violence Project)	223819		/users/profile/155016	Susan97	Volunteer	5	10/17/2014	I've been involved with Free2Be for several years, and have watched the organization grow rapidly, expanding services at a phenomenal rate, especially considering they operate strictly on donations with no government or grant funding. For a time, I volunteered at weekly meetings for LGBTQ young people, and witnessed first hand the affect that acceptance has on those who have been made to feel they are different and somehow less worthy than their classmates. It is no exaggeration to say that lives have been turned around, and literally saved due to the efforts of James Robinson and the staff of volunteers and counselors. No one should face life in the isolation of the closet, feeling they have no hope for the future and no chance of acceptance. Free2Be strives to see that no one, young person or adult, no matter where they may fall along the spectrum of gender identity and/or sexual orientation, faces life alone. This is vital in the South, where those who do not fit the 'norm' are quite often in fear for their lives, and with good reason. Violence is all too common as a means of problem-solving in the region, and must be countered with positive measures on all fronts. The integrity of the executive director permeates the agency, and the staff and volunteers are held to the highest possible standards in providing those positive measures so necessary to the physical and mental health of the LGBTQ South. It is impossible to overstate the impact Free2Be has had on the community in Huntsville and the surrounding areas, or to understate the need for it to continue to expand the services offered.
Free2Be (Free2Be LGBTQ Resource Center & Free2Be Safe Anti-Violence Project)	113921		/users/profile/155016	Susan97	General Member of the Public	5	06/06/2012	I met James Robinson of GLBT Advocacy and Youth Services at a showing of the movie "For the Bible Tells Me So".  I knew immediately I had met an extraordinary man.  Here was an articulate, compassionate, honest man, imbued with integrity, unafraid to take a stand for both GLBT rights and faith  a far cry from the images we see so often in the news.  As I began to learn more about GLBTAYS, I became even more impressed.  Advocacy for GLBT youth is urgently needed when the authority figures in a young person's life may be the very ones who are heaping vitriol upon them.  It's a serious problem; from May 1 to May 13 (Mother's Day) ten young people committed suicide after being bullied.  Nearly one every day.  One of those was 7 years old.  These kids need to know beyond a doubt that someone is there for them, that someone will stand between them and those who have targeted them for hatred.  James is that someone in our area.  I've watched GLBTAYS work tirelessly to support a student bullied by a teacher at a local high school, persevering and determined that things would be made right despite apparent indifference from the school board.  I've watched GLBTYAS reach out to the community on behalf of a troubled teen from our area who was in a dangerous home situation.  When my own work for the GLBTQ community becomes burdensome, when hope is so fragile a single breath could destroy it, when anger at injustice reddens everything I see, James is there, calm, courageous, constant  always working, always giving, always caring.  His is the soul of GLBTAYS, the force that gives it life, and is reflected in its every activity.  We need the services that GLBTAYS provides and we need them badly; James ensures we have them.  He and the organization have my deepest admiration.

The Free2Be LGBTQ resource center in North Alabama is a one-of-a-kind resource center that the Huntsville community is incredibly fortunate to have. It's certainly a feather in the cap of a progressive city to have an organization devoted to equality. Kudos to founder James Robinson for his activism and vision.

I was totally blown away by the work they are doing there.  After seeing all of the people they offer their services to and hearing their stories, I knew that this was an organization I wanted to be affiliated with and support.

There are so many LGBTQ youth that have been turned away by their families, churches, friends and schools for simply being who they are.  This organization provides resources to these valued members of society.  They have made a huge difference in many lives and manage to do the best they can with meager finding.  It my hope that this vital program get as much funding as possible so that even more lives can be saved.

James Robinson is an awesome person who has a never ending love for humankind and believes strongly in civil and human rights for all.  I am proud to be affiliated with GLBT Advocacy & Youth Services, Inc.  I am even more proud to be a friend of James Robinson.  We have worked together for many years in the public school system.  We have seen it all when it comes to the abuse, bullying and indifference to children.  This organization is the salvation for kids in the south who find themselves in impossible situations.  They provide support, love, resources for these children/youth who otherwise may feel there is no option for them other than suicide.  The real life stories that come to the attention of this advocacy group are nothing short of completely heartbreaking.  Until I got involved with this group, I had no idea how fast and large this problem has gotten.  There are far too many children as well as adults who are "shunned" or abused by their families, friends, community simply for being who they are.  To me, this is totally unacceptable in this day and age.  People are people period.  I wish labels could be completely eliminated and replaced by being individuals.  I think a lot of the problems come from misinformation, misunderstanding, and just plain ignorance.  This group is out there, making people aware of the problem and offering ways for others to help.  I totally support GLBT Advocacy & Youth Services, Inc. and encourage others to check out the work they do and help in anyway possible.  We are all children of God...the details really don't matter.

The work they have accomplished in a relatively short period of time is astounding. My husband and I were lucky enough to get to attend a holiday event last year and meet the team and learn about all they do, and what they have planned for the future. It's exciting and inspiring. James and his team together have done great things and will continue for a long long time. I can't wait to see how they grow and hope we get to be lucky enough to be a part of it!

I feel that as a young adult looking back being able to see that there were people like me who cared about my safety & well being was a wonderful thing to get me through the point I was at in that time. James Robinson was the one who really touched my life and showed me that it was okay to be gay, to be proud, and embrace all that I am as an LGBT individual. He also was able to help awnser questions I had about being gay & a Christian. I am honored to have had this group apart of my life!

I personally feel it is a credit to society and making young lives better, one person at a time. Any support given to them is a gift, one that is treasured whether is financially, with giving time, and support in general. The director James Robinson is a good man, who is after Gods own heart.

From as far away as 3 to 4 hours people come to know what exist in Huntsville Al.  From counseling, to support and everything in between, the people that make up its staff or God sent angels in my eyes.  The sacrifices they make to give someone a voice, a friend, a colleague, an opportunity an ear to listen.  It is what non profits do that make the blessing be personal and life sustaining.

The GLBT Center reaches out to help those who have no where to go, and need the support of those who may have similar experiences. How fortunate and grateful we are to have such a progressive and truly inclusive place in our community !It is a place we know we are always loved and welcome.

They started with so little and have grown to a bigger location due to their growth in helping others in the GLBTQ community. Jame Robinson and his volunteers have participated in many community activities in order to expand their outreach to any GLBTQ youth and adults that may  not have any supports systems at home, school, or work. They hold support group meetings for GLBTQ youth and adults so they can have a safe place to meet others in the GLBTQ community. They have been recognized in the media for the work and in helping students fight discrimination in their own school. I havent got to volunteer as much as I had planned due to living and working in Tennessee, but I would definitely devote my time to helping James and his other colleagues in making GLBT Advocacy & Youth Services a safe place for all people.

James Robinson works very hard in trying to secure funding to keep this organization alive for the benefit of our glbtq youth and adults. The organization offers a variety of services from peer support groups to a host home program. I, myself, have attended and assisted several safe schools workshops in Alabama and South Florida as well as volunteered for several glbtq youth events in South Florida. So I can recognize a great and valuable organization from my own experience as well as from the viewpoint of an educator that accepts all youth from all backgrounds. So please support GLBT Advocacy & Youth Services if you can so our youth will have a safe place to go and be themselves.

Free2Be (Free2Be LGBTQ Resource Center & Free2Be Safe Anti-Violence Project)	186728		/users/profile/243673	ECrankshaw	Board Member	5	10/31/2013	I am a volunteer as well as the Chair of the Board of Directors for GLBT Advocacy & Youth Services, Inc. I currently moderate the transgender support group that was the North Alabama Gender Center and is now a part of GLBT Advocacy & Youth Services, Inc. I first learned of the organization as it was forming and knew that I had to help. I immediately became a volunteer for the youth support group in addition to the transgender support group and share my knowledge and experience where needed. Youth today face enough troubles without being shown intolerance or bullied because they are or perceived as being GLBT. Being in the South where religion sometimes shows its extremism, kids are often thrown out of their homes if they come out as GLBT and often have no where to go. That's where we step in as an advocate. In the few years we have been around, we have expanded our services immensely. We have been grateful to the Spirit of the Cross church here in Huntsville for donating their hall for our groups and now that we have our own space, Our Space Community Center, we continue to grow. Besides the youth and transgender support groups, we have a Host Home Program, AA support group, breast cancer support group and caregivers support group, craft circle, just to name a few. Please consider donating your time and money to help this organization continue to grow by supporting and advocating for our community.

LGBT youth are some of the most underserved population. This age group is extremely vulnerable, with very few resources or support. GLBTAYS is working to fill that need.                                                   Youth often have no voice and can easily become victims with no place to turn.

Since then Ive been motivated and inspired by James Robinsons tireless efforts at raising awareness and creating resources for the members of the GLBTQ community in Alabama. I grew up in North Alabama and I can understand how isolating it can be for anyone who even appears to be different.  James is providing an invaluable resource for the local community and at the same time promoting awareness by speaking at colleges, mediating with schools and attending various events to help promote equality. I have never seen one person work so hard to make a difference. Over the past year, the national media finally started paying attention to the problems faced by the gay community and its youth in particular. Gay teens face more adversity than almost any other group. They are at a higher risk for suicide, homelessness and bullying.  It is wonderful to see an organization in our state that is so dedicated to doing something about it.

GLBT Advocacy & Youth Services was founded around the same time the UAH GSA was over 2 years ago and so James Robinson and I began working together. I've lived in Huntsville, AL all my life and didn't encounter the GLBTQ community or learn about GLBTQ issues until I began to co-found a gay-straight alliance. Huntsvillians simply don't talk about GLBTQ issues. As a whole, our community is more progressive than the vast majority of the state, but these issues were seldom focused on until GLBTQ organizations began surfacing a little more. GLBTAYS is still the only organization in the area specifically dedicated to youth dealing with non-heterosexual orientation and gender identities. This work is essential in a largely conservative state and community that is largely uneducated (sometimes by choice) about the struggles of GLBTQ individuals. GLBTQ youth need a place to go and James Robinson offers one of the few outlets in the state of Alabama.

General Member of the Public	5	06/06/2012	Im a mom, wife, PTA president and community volunteer raising two daughters.  My husband and I deal with the typical growing pains of teen girls.  Best friends, boyfriends, dating, crushes, etc.  But, even with all the stress of growing up its easy to be straight in Huntsville, Al.  I can only imagine how difficult teen life could be as a LGBT youth, going through these same issues.  We wouldve been great parents to a gay kid, but we werent.   And unfortunately, in this ultra conservative community being gay and accepted is hard to find.  Thats why I am so glad James Robinson launched LGBT Advocacy and Youth Services.  Not only does LGBTAYS offer a safe connection for youth, but adult allies from both the gay and heterosexual community now have a place to offer their support.  Huntsville is one of the fastest growing and expanding cities in Alabama.  Helping the youth of our community to have a strong self worth and ethical role models is vital to the success of any community.  I predict that because of James Robinson and LGBT Advocacy and Youth Services, Huntsville is on a better path to a more successful future for all of its citizens.  Im thrilled and delighted to be a friend of James Robinson and LGBT Advocacy and Youth Services.

Free2Be provides much needed services to an under-served population in an area of the United States where LGBTQ people are often overlooked if not facing outright discrimination. The agency is also venturing into new and unexplored territory for themselves and for the LGBTQ South with their new programs. They are braving the rough waters of grantwriting and working under the auspices of grant administrators in order to supply the LGBTQ community with anti-violence programs such as outreach, advocacy, therapeutic and supportive groups, counseling for individuals, couples, and families, as well as community events related to domestic violence, sexual assault, bullying, and suicide prevention and awareness. Free2Be is an agency that challenges itself to do better and provide higher quality services to a community that often faces unique challenges.
Free2Be (Free2Be LGBTQ Resource Center & Free2Be Safe Anti-Violence Project)	114066		/users/profile/155215	Terri9	Volunteer	5	06/06/2012	I have been very blessed to see first hand the difference that the GLBT Advocacy Youth Services, and James Robninson,  has made in the lives of people in our community.  From their inspiring Anti-Bullying campaign to their much needed home placement program for homeless GLBT youth they are truly creating the change that is needed in this world. They are not an agency of just words, speaking only of the difficulties that our community faces, but they are an agency of ACTION, always offering solutions.   Whether gay, straight, young or old, EVERYONE who cares about all people being treated with compassion and equality should contact this organization and find out more about the programs that they have in place and how you can donate financially and/or of your time.  Thank you James Robinson for your tireless efforts!!
Free2Be (Free2Be LGBTQ Resource Center & Free2Be Safe Anti-Violence Project)	113989		/users/profile/155109	Hilton D.	Volunteer	5	06/06/2012	My name is Hilton and Im Brazilian. I live in a medium size conservative town here in Brazil. Most of my family is Catholic and some members are Protestants. You can imagine how difficult it will be to me to come out of the closet to them. If I came out today, they would screw me and kick me out of my house. Something I hope never happens to anyone. There were a couple of times when I saw James Robinsons facebook page and some of the posts he put on his profile about his organization. I decided to send him a message through facebook asking him for some help because I was really in a dark moment. I was about to do something very bad. I was having some suicidal feelings. One day we finally chatted and he comforted me and was really kind and supportive of me. I will always be very grateful for his support. Today, I dont have those suicidal feelings anymore. I will come out to my parents and I will be myself entirely even if they screw me because James helped me to build my confidence and courage to go ahead with my life, no matter what. So, even not knowing him personally I loved all the words this man said to me through facebook. We became friends and I hope someday we can meet personally. So, Im sure hes been leading his organization so well and I wish I could help financially (something Im sure I will do someday). So, if youre sensitive to this cause and want to express the thankfulness for being a successful man or woman in Alabama or in any other state in US, please give a donation to this organization GLBT Youth Services & Advocacy. This organization is great, giving others the courage to go ahead with their lives being who they really are and helping them with accommodations when their parents kick them out of their houses. 
Free2Be (Free2Be LGBTQ Resource Center & Free2Be Safe Anti-Violence Project)	113928		/users/profile/155023	Rebecca37	General Member of the Public	5	06/06/2012	I am new to the Huntsville area and am so impressed that an active organization like this exists in what can be a very hostile part of the country for LGBT individuals.  Whether through individual interventions or community events, GLBT Advocacy & Youth Services is a strong part of the Huntsville community.  I remember what it was like to grow up in a small Alabama town and to be so very afraid that I was the only gay person in the whole world. That sense of isolation is terrifying.  I am grateful that this organization exists so that GLBT youth and adults have a support system and opportunities to form a community.  That community is small, but GLBTAYS is working hard to ensure that GLBT individuals feel safe in coming out and joining that community. Visibility and the freedom to proud of who you are is essential to anyone's health and happiness.  I'm proud to support GLBTAYS and the very necessary work they are doing to form and enrich a positive GLBT community in Huntsville.

Volunteer	5	06/05/2012	I have had the privilege and great honor of watching GLBTAYS form from an idea into the innovation that it is today. To say that it has been a rewarding experience is an understatement. I have known the joys of seeing various young people from all walks of life and orientation glean a positive experience from their involvement with this organization. It has been so much fun and fulfilling, really, to meet so many people who just want to help these youth. My reflections on my teenage years and my own experiences have helped  me appreciate what we are doing here...i can only wish that every community in every city, state, or country had a James Robinson to selflessly cultivate and nurture a body of volunteers and mentors and friends into the culmination of the wonderful thing that GLBTAYS is... I can only hope that the group continues to grow and garner the resources needed to offer unlimited help and hope to these young people. I have been humbled to be a part of this, to see beyond myself and further within. To me, GLBTAYS encompasses helping and healing for everyone involved.

I wish everyone I know to support this tremendous organization for the support they give to youth in troubled situations!
Free2Be (Free2Be LGBTQ Resource Center & Free2Be Safe Anti-Violence Project)	113861		/users/profile/154937	Anna17	Volunteer	5	06/05/2012	I could be very professional and watch my words closely as I type, but I don't feel like this organization deserves that. No, it definitely deserves much better. GLBT Advocacy & Youth Services is a fantastic organization that is worthy of an uncensored review.  This agency is professional in helping people, but it takes much more than that to truly make  a difference in our community. When a child is going through hell because they don't understand who they are, when they realize who they are and they don't feel accepted, when they simply aren't accepted, this is an organization that welcomes them with open and loving arms. Sometimes it takes more than professional words to make a difference and this organization offers that. Most everyone that volunteers with the agency has gone through their own separate hell and wants nothing more than to stop someone from going through what they did. They relate to the people that they help and they are able to put their heart fully into their work. Since I have joined, I've seen so much pain through this organization. I've heard of teenagers running away from home due to abuse, I've heard of people being beaten and bullied, and I've heard of people who are tormented daily all because of who they love. However, I've also seen a lot of happiness as well. People come together in the groups, they learn that they're never alone in their pain, and the people who need help get help. This group is set on making a change in the world. This group 'will' make a change in the world.

I am continually amazed at the outpouring of love and inspiration that they exhibit. 
Free2Be (Free2Be LGBTQ Resource Center & Free2Be Safe Anti-Violence Project)	67127		/users/profile/73365	Daywalkerpoet23	Volunteer	5	02/11/2011	GLBT Advocacy & Youth Services is a one-of-a-kind organization in the Tennessee Valley area. I have personally been witness to the organization's growth from an idea into an effective community service agency that not only serves the gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender population that it mentions in its mission statement but also serves the needs of the entire community. From donating food to the homeless, hosting school supply drives for disadvantaged youth, hosting peer support groups, or partnering with universities to reach glbt individuals on their campuses, GLBT AYS is proving to be a staple in the community. And with the help of its Executive Director, James Robinson, it will become one of the few agencies that stays around for the long haul. 
Carlisa, Inc.	287732		/users/profile/377866	Writer,	General Member of the Public	5	04/30/2016	Carlisa, Inc. fights hunger in more ways than just providing hot meals to those less fortunate.  They provide hope and joy to souls who suffer the emotional hunger pangs of those who may feel they have been overlooked by the rest of the world.  Through random acts of kindness, a helping hand, words of encouragement, and ever-ready smile, they inspire others around them to reach out and lift each other up in a world that is often quick to put others down.  
Carlisa, Inc.	287463		/users/profile/377562	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	04/27/2016	Great place  to eat at a reasonable price.   Also Mrs. Lisa has been serving the community by providing meals to the needy not only during holidays but often.
Carlisa, Inc.	286247		/users/profile/376336	Emily135	Client Served	5	04/20/2016	Miss Lisa gives to the community more than one could imagine. Between her food pantry, feeding college students, and everything in between, she goes above and beyond the call of duty to help those who need it, and she does it deliciously. As a broke full-time college student with a full-time job, I can honestly say there are days when I would have just had to go without food between classes and before work, that is, had it not been for Miss Lisa. She is a blessing to the community, and every single thing she does is for a good cause. It amazes me every day the drive that she has, and I just cannot say enough good things about her and her cause. 
Carlisa, Inc.	286129	1	/users/profile/376198	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	04/18/2016	Lisa McMillian, aka Carlisa, Inc.,is one of the most selfless people that I know or know of.  She is all about helping others, whether it be feeding college students for free (our local community college doesn't have a cafeteria, so she makes sure that every student who wants a meal gets one on Monday thru Wednesday), to providing meals for the elderly or needy (and often delivering it to them), to providing transportation to doctor visits, etc, and often provides money to those in need.  It doesn't stop here--she provides "holiday" meals to anyone in the community who would like them:  Christmas, Thanksgiving, Easter, and even honors the veterans on Veteran's Day.  She is such a service to our community, a real blessing, and all from the kindness of her heart.  Thanks, Carlisa!!!
Carlisa, Inc.	286067		/users/profile/376125	Keri7	General Member of the Public	5	04/17/2016	In 2014 my mother passed away. I was able to be with her but I had missed a bit of work but was able to take my vacation as an emergency. A few months later my father became gravely ill and I wanted to spend some time with him. My father lived in Kentucky and that was a great distance from me I also had to take some more time off he passed away and we had his funeral then I came back to brewton and went back to work. Ms. Lisa called me over to see her at her table at my job at the huddle house and asked me how I was doing. I told her I'm holding up and I'll be ok and that my daddy was my favorite person and I miss him. She handed me a check to help me out I was so stunned I told her I couldn't take it and didn't need it that someone else could use it and she said please Keri take it this is what I do and what I work for so I took it and hugged her. I went in the back room at work and cried. This isn't the first time she's done things like this during Christmas time she would come in and call each of us over and give us gift cards or checks as presents but she knew each person there had a story and had either not much help from anyone or had big families like mine. She has been a blessing to each person she has helped. She does not stop there she has a little kitchen she help feeds college students and also helps feed people who don't have families around the holidays and she cooks quite a bit and invites people from all over the areas to come eat for Christmas and thanksgiving. Lisa at Carlisa inc has helped many many people me included over the years and I've also read her book and she says it's her calling and her passion to help those who need the help or just give someone something to look forward too also she knows some people just have nothing at all and she wants to make sure some people who have nothing has a little something! Lisa is a blessing and and someone who I've come to know love appreciate and confide in over the years! She is compassionate about helping boost people's lives it's what makes her happy! So if you could donate or if you truly can't donate pass this along and help Carlisa inc raise money to help feed the hungry and help support her work she does this from the kindness of her heart and started out helping people with nothing and she does not use these funds to support her self she works and works hard! Please help and donate today. I have donated to Carlisa inc and have felt good about it and I will donate again even if it's a dollar or fifty cents we can all help feed the hungry.
Carlisa, Inc.	285954	1	/users/profile/375997	Carolyn111	General Member of the Public	5	04/15/2016	Carlisa, Inc. is a non profit organization with many missions. In fact, "We feed the Need" is their mission statement. They are involved in many different projects  in our community. Their ability to act quickly was put to the test  recently when the towns of Flomaton, AL and Century , FL were hit by a devastating tornado. I knew Carlisa, Inc. had the experience to help and was so glad they could provide hot meals to the victims of this horrible storm. This nonprofit is a very productive part of our community and has been for several years.

Once she heard about students not having food to eat, she stepped in and began serving free lunch to all college students.  For some, this was the only meal they ate that day.  Also she had snacks available for them to take back to the dorm for an evening snack.  What an asset to her community.  We need note people like Mrs Lisa.  Everything is free to those in need.  Thanks Carlisa Inc
Carlisa, Inc.	285372	1	/users/profile/375358	Writer	Donor	5	04/09/2016	Carlisa is one of those charities that notices what a community needs and simply steps in to fill that need.  She does not see challenges; she sees possibilities.  She finds a way to feed those who are hungry because her whole heart is in her work.  And for those people in crisis she also researches other ways she can be of assistance.  She is also a great speaker.  She spoke to a group of elementary school in a summer program and she was inspirational.  More than that though, she spoke on their level and she made them understand that we are all expected to help others.  We are so lucky to have this organization as a part of our community
Carlisa, Inc.	285315	1	/users/profile/375297	Anita McCreary J.	Advisor	5	04/08/2016	Carlisa Food Bank Inc., is truly an awesome nonprofit organization. I am an employee of our local community college and I know first hand that Carlisa provides FREE meals to our students every Monday - Wednesday each week that classes are in session. She wants to ensure that not one student goes hungry on our campus. Although some of our students, especially athletes, live in the dorms we do not have a lunch/cafeteria program. It is Carlisa that provides free meals to our students. No only does Carlisa provide our students with free meals, she also provide the elderly in our community with free meals. Carlisa has a passion for ensuring that no one goes hungry in our community (and around the world for that matter!). I am thankful for having an organization such as Carlisa Food Bank in our community to help those in need!

Carlisa, Inc.	285298	1	/users/profile/375278	Samantha78	Client Served	5	04/08/2016	I can't say enough about Mrs. Lisa at Carlisa Inc., she has an amazing heart and spirit for the work that she does.  She not only helps those in need but she is overjoyed to be able to do it.  I started working with Lisa over 17 years ago and have never had a call for help not answered.  No matter what the need she filled it in with every means she had.    I am a licensed insurance agent and I work mostly with the elderly a great many of my clients are low income and are in need of basic necessities such as food.  Never a moment has went by that I couldn't call Carlisa Inc. so that I could feed those elderly who were choosing between food and medicine and it is definitely a real struggle for some.  What a joy I have to know Mrs. Lisa and know that Carlisa Inc.  will be there.  The donations provided to her really do make it out into the community and you know the saying "it takes a village to raise a child" It takes that same village to help those truly in need of the services of Carlisa, Inc.  Give with joy, happiness and certainty that anyone who donates and continues to donate can rest assured it's being used for the purpose it's meant for.

Afar, because once I first heard of Carlisa Inc.  I was interested in learning more about this non profit.  So, what did I do; I volunteered and that experience has given me nothing but joy.  The people that they assist are so appreciative of Carlisa Inc.  Just to be one of the volunteers to help serve meals has now inspired me to do more for my community.  My experience as a volunteer with Carlisa Inc. has inspired me to prepare meals on weekends for 10 individuals in my community which consist of a disabled veteran, senior citizens, and two disabled individuals.  I get so much pleasure when I prepare and deliver their meals to them.  My son has gotten a kick out of taking their meals as well.  Carlisa Inc. has helped me to show my son how to share with others.  We are cheerful givers and are blessed to know the fine people at Carlisa Inc.  This non profit is a great asset to our community and surrounding area.  Thanks Carlisa Inc. for allow us to volunteer with your non profit organization because it has been a life changing experience.  We appreciate you all so much and will always be ready to help you serve others.

The Carisa, Inc. is an incredible blessing in my life and truly helps my parents out. Mrs. Lisa and Ms. Gloria have been a tremendous blessing to me and many,  many people before me. I have never met two of the nicest ladies that are so giving to others. Attending Jefferson Davis, giving this incorporation thirty dollars for a semester, being able to have lunch everyday is not the only good thing these ladies do. Through them serving others and putting together food for the students at JDCC and the people of Brewton, many people see how giving these ladies are. Personally they have taught me so many things about having a giving heart and putting others first. I am so thankful I know these ladies and how much they mean to me. Donating to this incorporation is definitely worth it. You will learn many things, and if you put aside the food for a second and see how hard these ladies work, it makes you want to provide for others. Giving is the big picture here and anybody that know, Mrs. Lisa and Ms. Gloria are immediately impacted for the better.

I know of a young man who was from Brewton, but who had moved to Illinois.  He was struggling to make it there and was not able to buy groceries at the time.  He reached out to his family back home, but they could not help him.  Lisa heard about his situation and sent him a gift card to buy groceries.  He sent his family a picture of his full refrigerator and was very grateful for the help.

Carlisa, Inc.	287732		/users/profile/377866	Writer,	General Member of the Public	5	04/30/2016	Carlisa, Inc. fights hunger in more ways than just providing hot meals to those less fortunate.  They provide hope and joy to souls who suffer the emotional hunger pangs of those who may feel they have been overlooked by the rest of the world.  Through random acts of kindness, a helping hand, words of encouragement, and ever-ready smile, they inspire others around them to reach out and lift each other up in a world that is often quick to put others down.  
Carlisa, Inc.	284452		/users/profile/374499	Writer	Donor	5	04/02/2016	The book Living Fulfilled has changed my life.....it has opened my eyes to love and hope. The author takes you on an inspirational journey that shows just how one ordinary individual can help change the world. It also teaches you how to pay it forward. It's a perfect gift too!

Just the same I was a little reluctant to go to "Still Serving Veterans" mostly because I did not understand what they really assist a veteran with.  Well I finally needed some assistance trying to figure out what I was doing wrong....My first appointment was 26 Jan 2016.  And we went from there.  The have a GREAT team, they assisted me with my resume, and ideas and different approaches for how to job hunt head on, and I finally got and interview..  It might not sound like much but that's a huge stone for me.  I've been looking for work since July 2015.  My goal was to check and search the internet daily and fill out at least 1 job application a day.   Absolutely NO HITS...until I went to "Still Serving Veterans"  From Jan 26,  to 4 March 2016.....  I finally got an interview.  Thank you so much to Still Serving Veterans for you assistance with all that you do for FREE to veterans actively trying to find employment.  Keep up the GREAT work with that GREAT team.   Daphne

My situation is not an "easy fix" in this economy and yet they took on my case with compassion and focus. I remain actively in the hunt  but I don't think I could find more capable hands or hearts on which to rely for sound advice and reliable direction in a scenario I did not anticipate and have not been through in some time.  Bravo to SSV from a grateful veteran!

Not only do group members function as a tremendous support network for people affected by gyn cancer, they serve as advocates, fundraisers, and above all as friends.  It is a tremendous organization and I am very proud to be affiliated with such a wonderful group of people.
Cansurvive Gyn Cancer Support Group	160696		/users/profile/213063	Patti19	Client Served	5	06/15/2013	The CanSurvive group has been my lifeline for support, information, and a sense of connection to fellow survivors.  I am an 8 year ovarian cancer survivor and I live a six hour drive from my doctor and the CanSurvive meetings.  However, they have done a remarkable job of keeping me connected via email.  Because of CanSurvive encouragement, I attended the national conference in Washington D.C where I met survivors from all over the country.  This was empowering for me and I realized the importance of keeping our law makers informed of the needs for funding for cancer research.Because I live in a remote area, I felt quite alone after my diagnosis. There was no one close to me who had experienced gyn cancer and treatment.  I started my own local support group with women who were breast cancer survivors.  I also provided symptom cards to the shops in my area.  For the past 8 years, I have been able to connect through CanSurvive with others in my geographical area  who have ovarian cancer and I have stayed in touch to offer support.  Being part of this unique group of women has been a true blessing to me and I am grateful for the leadership.

I found out about this group at my doctor's office where I took my chemo treatments. It has been great to gather with other ladies who have been down this same path. We have all been dealt the blow of receiving the diagnosis of cancer, we have all endured cancer treatment from surgery or radiation or chemo. There is something to be said about being with people who truly understand these difficulties, yet are able to offer encouraging words and endeavor to lift your spirits! I have enjoyed making friends in this group. Cheryl is great about keeping everyone informed. There are many activities and opportunities to interact, volunteer and get involved in awareness campaigns and fundraisers.
Cansurvive Gyn Cancer Support Group	159358		/users/profile/211512	Survivor2	Board Member	5	06/03/2013	As a twelve year survivor of ovarian cancer I have found CanSurvive to be a wonderful support group where ladies with gyn cancers and their care givers can meet once a month to share their experiences, ask questions of others and gain support from peers. We also gain knowledge from our speakers who present a variety of issues all of which are pertinent to our circumstances. Most of all I enjoy the fellowship and sharing of all those who attend.CanSurvive is very active in getting the word out and trying to educate others to be aware of those very vague symptoms of ovarian cancer. I certainly didnt know any signs and symptoms of ovarian cancer so I am quite happy to volunteer with our group to let others know what the warnings are. We also have literature available for all the gyn cancers.

I had never taken part in a support group before and didn't know quite what to expect.  I was worried that the meetings might make me feel depressed at a time when I was trying so hard to be positive and happy.  Instead, I found the meetings to be extremely uplifting, very informative, and just what I needed.  I wish I had attended them sooner---while I was going through chemotherapy---as I have received so much support from the wonderful members I have come to know and love.  Many like me attend alone but are certainly not lonely---there are new friends and dear friends to see each time I attend.  The officers and members are always friendly and reach out to others to make each person feel a part of the group.  The meetings are interesting and just what I need to learn something new and ways to help others. My thanks and praises go to the officers who work so hard to meet the needs of its members. CanSurvive is a joyful group!

Even though I have missed more meetings than I have attended, I enjoy reading each e-mail the group sends because they help me stay up to date about what is happening locally and afar, and about all topics close to my heart.  The topics close to me heart would be those concerning gyn related cancers.  This is because in Feb. 2010,  I was diagnosed with stage 3-C Ovarian Cancer.  I was 46 at the time.  I had a reoccurance in July 2012, and am currently in a 2nd remission since that first diagnosis in 2010.  This group helps women and caregivers by sharing medical knowlegde, chemo related issues, food and exercise, and the list goes on!  Humor has helped me get through some tearful moments, and with that being the case,  I'll add that this is "one cancer club" you would want to be a part of, because of all the good things it does for anyone touched by gyn cancers! 
Cansurvive Gyn Cancer Support Group	158867		/users/profile/210880	cathymoore	Volunteer	5	05/28/2013	We all have a story of how our lives unfold.  Chapters and milestones to achieve and to embrace but we are never ever prepared for the news that you have the "C" word.  It changes everything and you lose control of your own life and your path takes a turn that you can never be truly prepared for.  My journey started with my yearly womanly checkup.  I had not been having any issues and I was about to turn 50 in a few months.  I had no symptoms that were impacting my daily life; so, just imagine the shock and disbelief when your doctor advises you that you have Stage III c Ovarian Cancer!  Your first inclination is to run to the computer and goggle ovarian cancer!  That can be the most devastating piece of this process and prognosis.  The survival rates are not encouraging to say the least. It felt like I was handed a death sentence for a crime I did not commit. Why was I being punished in this way?  What had I done to cause this disease to invade my body and spirit?  The medical professionals did their best to ease my anxiety and take the best possible care of me from a medical perspective, but, it is the human spirit that will falter faster than the body if you have nowhere to turn.  I found my salvation the day I attended my first CanSurvive meeting.  I was welcomed with such openness and grace. My spirits were immediately lifted; to be able to talk to women, who were living with ovarian cancer, hear about their personal trials and tribulations; Issues they had encountered and how they were able to overcome and survive.  I left that meeting with a renewed sense of it will be OK.  I have new friends to support me and help me learn to live with my illness.  I am happy to say that I am on the road to recovery and have been living my life with a new sense of gratitude and wanting to give back to my community of woman fighting the same battle.  CanSurvive was a blessing when I needed it the most and that to me is PRICELESS.

My mom lived in Montgomery and wasn't able to attend group meetings but the members of CanSurvive made her feel included by sending her encouraging messages and providing her with a "Lydia Project" bag while she was undergoing treatment. When my mom was admitted to the hospital and eventually to the palliative care unit in January 2013, CanSurvive sent her balloons, cards, and some group members even took time to visit with her. I appreciate all the amazing gifts CanSurvive gave my mother in such a difficult time but I am even more touched by their generosity of taking the time to comfort me and the rest of our family. 
Cansurvive Gyn Cancer Support Group	158657		/users/profile/210518	LynnEps	Client Served	5	05/23/2013	I was diagnosed with advanced stage Ovarian cancer in August of 2011. I went through surgery & chemo not really feeling a need for an outside support group. I was very focused on my battle and was fortunate to have a tremendous amount of support from family, friends and my medical team. I was a warrior with goals and milestones to meet....then in February 2012 I achieved that final goal, the last of 6 cycles of aggressive chemo..... cause for celebration, all tests looked good, it appeared everything worked as hoped... now life could get back to normal, as if the previous 6 months had never happened.! Only the funny thing was, that "normal" never came back.... I found that I was becoming anxious before every Dr visit, everytime I had an unusual ache or pain I would immediately worry that the cancer was coming back, I was wondering why I did so well, when so many others weren't as lucky... I wanted the old "me" back, not this fearful, baldheaded stranger looking back from the mirror.   Then I found the Cansurvive support group and discovered that all of my feelings were normal (imagine that, it's just a new normal).  I just showed up at the April 2012 Sunday meeting, didn't know anyone but I immediately felt at home.  Everyone welcomed me with open arms, and I never felt like an outsider.... (I even won the door prize... but I still think that was rigged!) The thing is, we may not know each other when we walk in the door, but we are all in the same sisterhood and are there to offer support to each other, answer questions (almost anything that you ask, someone has a personal experience to share), laugh together, offer hope to each other and yes, sometimes cry together as well.   I live approximately 60miles outside Birmingham, so the Friday meeting is not really an option for me.  I am so thankful that Cansurvive has the Sunday meetings and I try my best not to miss one.  I would tell anyone who is either dealing with GYN cancer, or has a loved one affected to come to one of our meetings... I promise you won't regret it!
Cansurvive Gyn Cancer Support Group	158639	2	/users/profile/210497	Joan Goode	Volunteer	5	05/23/2013	Thank you for the opportunity to share what CanSurvive has meant to me and my family. My daughter, Dana Layne was diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2011.  It was very difficult to get adjusted to the word "cancer".  Even when we realized that cancer was our new reality, it was still very difficult to accept.  As Dana experienced surgery, radiation and chemo therapy, we were at a loss as to what questions to ask, or even where to get answers to the questions we did have. We needed the truth, but we needed compassion and understanding also. When Dana heard of the CanSurvive support  group she was eager to attend, in the hope that it would be of help to us. We were not disappointed.  The ladies at CanSurvive were the answer to our many prayers.  It turned out that they were exactly what Dana and I needed.  From the beginning the group took Dana into their arms and never let go. Dana felt free to call any of them day or night, even on holidays.  They used e-mail, text messages, and even regular mail to share information, in order to help Dana understand what her body was going through.  They did it all with love, compassion, and understanding. The caregiver support group provided by CanSurvive enabled me to understand how to help myself, along with Dana as she fought her battle with cancer.  Dana lost her  battle in October 2012, and the loss I felt--and still feel -  is indescribable, CanSurvive is still there for me.  They have been with me  with open arms to help me deal with my loss.  They have enabled me to stand when I could not. They have held me close when I needed support.  Words cannot express the gratitude in my heart for CanSurvive.  The best way to describe them is in one word.... "blessing". Joan Goode 
Cansurvive Gyn Cancer Support Group	158568		/users/profile/210375	GinnyB	Client Served	5	05/22/2013	I was diagnosed with Ovarian Cancer in 2011 and attended my first Support Group meeting one month later.  I found a welcoming group of smiling faces, happy to get to know me and hear my story, quick to offer a listening ear and a kind word or hug.  Its a safe haven where I don't have to explain the medical language, the side effects, the range of emotions; I can just 'be'.  We discuss a wide range of topics and I seem to learn something each meeting and walk away feeling stronger.   I am encouraged by the women and each of their respective journeys and leave with a rejuvenated sense of motivation to fight this battle.
Cansurvive Gyn Cancer Support Group	102746		/users/profile/135452	Sonyawells1	Client Served	5	12/30/2011	Hi, my name is Sonya Wells. I was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in July 2008. For the next few months I would learn new words, oncology, chemotherapy, and the scariest thing to me would be ports and infusion therapy. When all was finished, I felt sure I would run from the building and never say CANCER again. I begin to receive e-mails form a group called CANSURVIVE. I went to a meeting, and there were people giving of their time and support in more ways than I could ever imagine. I felt as though I left with hope, courage, a since of humor and realized I was able to say I had cancer, and I was now called a SURVIVOR. CANSURVIVE group is a great and wonderful way to stay aware of the new drugs, help others who have just been diagnosed. Also ask questions get answers, and I feel I have a new extended family who understands me and there is no judgment to the Chemo Brain we all share.Cancer will always be a part of my life but I am no longer afraid to say cancer, and when you put a group of women together one thing is for sure you will find power beyond measure.    
Cansurvive Gyn Cancer Support Group	93340		/users/profile/107293	rdalvarez	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/03/2011	There was a large void in support services for patients with gyn cancers in our community.  CanSurvive provided a resource for people to talk to others dealing with the burden of cancer and cancer treatments and the indelible mark it puts on a person's psyche.  They meet regularly and provide updates on medical issues, provide programs on survivorship, and plan activities to assist patients currently ongoing treatments.  One of their latest activities was to provide laptop computers for patients undergoing chemotherapy so that they may access Caring Bridge on the internet during treatment.  It's really hard to put down in so few words what all this organization means to our patients and to my practice. 
Cansurvive Gyn Cancer Support Group	92974		/users/profile/106734	Connie	Client Served	5	06/29/2011	There aren't many redeeming qualities about having cancer. No one can take away the frightening words of the diagnosis, the pain of surgery, the side effects of chemotherapy and radiation, the fear, the waiting, the worry. But there is a way to reduce the feelings of aloneness. I was first diagnosed with Stage 3C ovarian cancer in 2004 and joined CanSurvive in 2006. I walked into a world of caring friends, women who shared my experiences, sorrows, joys, and hope. We laughed and cried together.  One consequence of my illness and treatment is that my contact with others changed. For weeks at a time, I could no longer do the things that made up my 'normal' life. Just as people in CanSurvive cared for me, I found that reaching out to other women in our group brought back a feeling of being valued, of supporting people during their hardest times.  CanSurvive provides many things: patient support (in lots of  ways), information to patients, public awareness, a shoulder to lean on, a joyful heart to share the happy times with, a circle of women who become strong because they can hold on to each other. My life has been positively affected through my involvement with CanSurvive. 
Cansurvive Gyn Cancer Support Group	92618		/users/profile/106285	JSmiley	Board Member	5	06/28/2011	We first found the CanSurvive group when my mother, MaryAnne King, was diagnosed with Fallopian Tube cancer in 2006. The support that was provided to my mother and our family was invaluable. It truly made a difference for my mom to be able to talk to other women who knew exactly what she was going through and could offer her advice. They shared their ideas for nutrition, exercise, pain management, and much more. It also helped her through her journey to be able to help others and share her own experience. That is what this group is all about, helping each other. After my mother passed away in 2009, I chose to continute to be involved with the CanSurvive group simply because I was shown through being with these women and their families, the possibilites of making a difference for someone who is going through cancer treatments or dealing with the recovery after the treatment and for support being offered to those who care for them. This group provides something for patients that is desperately needed and that is caring, understanding and support.
Cansurvive Gyn Cancer Support Group	91075		/users/profile/104061	brenda lamb	Volunteer	5	06/16/2011	I have been involved with the CanSurvive GYN Cancer Support Group since its inception.  There has never been a more caring group of ladies who help support one another through their journeys and then reach out to educate women on the signs and symptoms of gyn cancers.  They are dedicated.  they meet once a month at the American Cancer Center where they share their treatment and the side effects.  They also have professional educators as guest speakers at these meetings to keep them informed on the latest treatments and studies that are going on.  This is an amazing non-profit group.  They support patients and their families from the first diagnosis until the end.  Many of the families are in need of support and encouragement as much as their loved one with cancer.
Cansurvive Gyn Cancer Support Group	90852		/users/profile/103764	DianneB	Volunteer	5	06/14/2011	  I wear many hats with the CanSurvive GYN Cancer support group. I wear hat number one as an ovarian cancer survivor.  I value the actual support from my "sisters", from the medical staff who become involved, from others who are touched by GYN cancer and are so generous and caring to  be a part of the group.  Another hat I wear is as a part of a speakers' bureau.  We are trained to speak to medical students and other groups to promote awareness of the signs and symptoms of ovarian cancer.  I wear a similar hat when I volunteer at events such as the Southern Women's Show to distribute information about GYN cancers and to talk to people about signs and symptoms.  Others in this group wear the important hats of reaching out to patients, of sharing personal experiences about coping with treatments, and of directly "being there".
Cansurvive Gyn Cancer Support Group	90847		/users/profile/103758	debthomps	General Member of the Public	5	06/14/2011	My sister is a ten year survivor of ovarian cancer.  CanSurvive was there for her from the very beginning.  I cannot begin to tell you what a positive influence this group has been for her and for me as her sister.  Brenda and Margaret who work with the doctors who care for ovarian cancer patients absolutely dedicate themselves to these women in this group.  And each survivor plays a valuable part in either helping those recently diagnosed and those whose cancer has come back  or raising awareness of the sometimes elusive symptoms of ovarian cancer.  My sister, as part of her role in the group, speaks yearly to medical students at UAB about her own story and the need to take symptoms that could indicate ovarian cancer seriously.  Too many women have been misdiagnosed and did not survive as a result of that.  It has to be particularly challenging emotionally to be a part of this group.  So many of the members do not survive.  And yet, the ones who do and the women who work in the field provide so much love and support through the pain they must suffer as a result of the many losses.  It bring me to tears sometimes as I witness the dedication.  The group includes not only the victims of this deadly cancer but also the families.  I know how much they have meant to me.  CanSurvive is truly a GREAT nonprofit.  They are family.
Cansurvive Gyn Cancer Support Group	90736		/users/profile/103598	Cheryl54	Board Member	5	06/14/2011	The CanSurvive GYN Cancer Support Group is open to women who have/had gyn cancer, their families, friends, loved ones, and the professionals who treat them.  We currently have 2 support group meetings a month.  It is so important to be with other people who have "been there" and know  you are not alone. We maintain a website (www.cansurvivesupportgroup.org) and an e-list to keep patients informed on what is going on.  We post meeting and speaker notes so those patients who are unable to attend can get the benefit of the meetings. We also reach out to patients with gift cards provided through the social worker; netbook computers for patients to use while getting chemo; e-mails, calls, & cards; literature for patients and their families; meeting small, practical needs; and, annual patient support kits We reached over 2,000 people last year through awareness tables.  Since there is no early detection test for ovarian cancer, we make sure to give them information about the signs and symptoms of that cancer.  We also distribute literature on the other gyn cancers and stress the importance of Pap smears and HPV vaccines for cervical cancer.

Kerusso Foundation Inc	139403		/users/profile/185519	jbellcell	Board Member	5	11/14/2012	Kerusso is a cutting edge ministry doing work that very few other ministries are doing.  The emerging world does not have the resources to train and develop Christian leaders.  This is very unfortunate, because the way these countries will truly change for the better is through God bringing His kingdom - which often comes through Christians leading in the church, ministries, and the workplace.  This is where Kerusso enters the scene, bringing customizable training and leadership development programs to help grow the Christian leadership base.  God is using Kerusso to bless the ends of the earth!
Kerusso Foundation Inc	139400		/users/profile/185515	akcbjc	Board Member	5	11/14/2012	I am awed and inspired at how God continues to use Kerusso to encourage and empower leaders in emerging  countries !

Better Basics, Inc.	144467		/users/profile/191003	Bran	Volunteer	5	11/29/2012	Although I am a working parent, with a very busy schedule, I felt compelled to participate in the Better Basic Reading Program. After seeing a presentation by one of the staff members of Better Basic, I signed up to volunteer one day a week at a local elementary school.  Better Basics provided books of various genres (comic, classic, scientific etc.) just to name a few, for students to read at their leisure. To encourage the students to participate they incorporated a great reward system as well. Kids were rewarded with books for their private collection, tee shirts and all sorts of trinkets that kids love. I am so glad I had the opportunity to participate in this program. I saw the excitement and passion that some of the kids had for reading. I saw kids encouraging and challenging each other to read as well.  The only way to know the effect of this program is to become involved in it. I encourage anyone to make the time to participate, even if it is only for a short period of time.

Better Basics, Inc.	144303		/users/profile/190824	Angela47	Volunteer	4	11/29/2012	I started volunteering at Better Basics as a requirement for a college course.  I had intended to put in my minimum of 20 hours and be done.  But I enjoyed my time there so much that I've decided to finish out the school year.  Every Thursday I volunteer at the HOPE after school program, and I've seen first hand the benefits Better Basics provides.  The children adore Ms. Rachael and Ms. Ebony.  They receive encouragement and praise from both the teachers and the volunteers.  I've been extremely surprised by how bright these children truly are, and when they are given the proper attention and guidance, those lights truly shine!  I have also had the opportunity to spend some time in the office with Ms. Kathleen and other members of the staff.  They are all extremely devoted to the agency and what it stands for.  One thing that stood out the most was how grateful they all are for their volunteers.  I have always loved to read, and its a huge disappointment to me when I see how most children hate to read.  Having said that, when I came across Better Basics I knew I had found something I could truly stand behind!

Better Basics has done a wonderful job of creating valuable volunteer opportunities while providing a real service to the children of the Greater Birmingham community.  Getting involved as a volunteer was one of the best decisions I've ever made.  
EPISCOPAL HOUSING FOUNDATION INC dba Episcopal Place	189698		/users/profile/176176	T. Edward	Donor	5	12/02/2013	I have donated both money and time to Episcopal Housing Foundation.  The board and staff are committed to providing the residents there the best in living experiences possible.   I enjoy participating in the many activities and services provided for the residents, which also helps those with families, too as it relieves any concerns family members may have about their loved one's housing and well-being.  Tim Blanton and his staff do a wonderful job of abiding by the rules that come with the limited HUD funding and work to provide the additional benefits and features that result in measurable outcomes.  To the board and staff I say "well done". To anyone contemplating becoming involved in some way, possibly as a donor, with Episcopal Housing Foundation, I say, " join me".

I cannot say enough good things about the staff, board of directors, and residents. Episcopal Place is committed to providing services (medical van transportation , meals and housekeeping programs, and activities) that helps our residents live independently in affordable housing for a longer time. Everyday more than one person tells how thankful the are to be living at Episcopal Place and how thankful they are for our caring staff. I tell them I am the thankful one to be here to help care for them. Episcopal Place has become my second family.

I can't say enough good things about it. The staff not only cares FOR the residents but they care ABOUT the residents and the residents care about the staff. One of the things most impressive is the way we all pull together when needed. Everybody jumps in and offers to help for things like serving big resident meals or carrying out fund raisers like Gumbo Gala. I think Mother Teresa says it best, "Let us touch the dying, the poor, the lonely and the unwanted according to the graces we have received and let us not be ashamed or slow to do the humble work."

Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/26/2012	I recently attended the LeadingAge conference in Denver, CO and was joined by over 8000 other non-profit providers that do what we do here at EP..... that is to serve and advocate for the elderly and disabled. Hearing the stories of so many others from across the country, I was reminded that what we do matters. Collectively, we care for thousands and thousands of people every day that would otherwise not have a caring, safe and comfortable environment to live in. I was also reminded that EP ranks well when compared to other communities and the services that are offered to the residents. As a once was told by one of our Clergy, "You are tending the field you have been given and are a good steward of your calling. We can only do what we can do, and, thank the Lord, that is enough."

We are able to offer such a wide variety of services through the grants and fundraisers and are able to serve such a diverse population that I am overwhelmed daily by what we do. Having the ability to meet with people daily, touch their lives, meet with their family members and help them in crisis or tramatic times has really made my life long dream a reality. I am in awe of how many residents are able to remain in their apartments because of what we offer and how many have lived here over 10 years.

EPISCOPAL HOUSING FOUNDATION INC dba Episcopal Place	183489		/users/profile/240380	ojulesp	Client Served	4	10/28/2013	As a resident of Episcopal Place, I have found the service and concern of the staff to be a primary life saving event. Often when one changes a lifestyle at an older age, depression can set in with the usual gerontology issues and illnesses. The attention given by staff and residents often dispell issues that prevent major depression. It is not easy at all for a formerly active , healthy out going individual to change their lifestyle because of the inability to be as active as they once were. Episcopal Place provides assistance , activities, and direction that affords the residents to remain as active as possible.

The dedicated Board of Directors and employees of Episcopal Place go beyond what most do to make Episcopal Place the special place that it is.  There are numerous housing communities for low income seniors, but none that provide the added service and attention to the residents as they do at EP.  It is a beautiful community with happy satisfied residents.  A community that anyone would want their parents or grandparents to live.

Having worked in the nonprofit sector for many years, I understand the administrative and support issues EP faces.

EPISCOPAL HOUSING FOUNDATION INC dba Episcopal Place	129982		/users/profile/57681	Kris M.	Donor	5	10/26/2012	It's a joy to see how, through using supportive services, seniors are able to stay in their homes longer and compensate for the things they can no longer do.  Many of the seniors at Episcopal Place no longer drive, so the Episcopal Place van takes them to the grocery store, to WalMart, to the bank and to other places where they need to take care of business or purchase needed items.  When they are no longer strong enough to lift and maneuver the vacuum cleaner, they can get monthly housekeeping service at a very affordable price.  If they get sick and need to drink Ensure to help with weight gain, Episcopal Place helps provide them Ensure if their monthly income is so stretched that they cannot afford it.  I can't image being in those situations as a senior and not having the help that Episcopal Place residents have.  I know that my contributions are making a real difference in the lives of older people.

Mrs. Betsy's  love for animals  is evident the second you step foot onto their beautiful property. It is a great place to be a cat or dog at Aide for Animals! The beautiful cat sanctuary in the backyard is a haven full of lush and colorful greenery, a few fountains, shady patios and kitty cat houses and hammocks everywhere.  If I get to be a cat in my next life, I want to live in that sanctuary, Catnip Village. I imagine that the amount of work and dedication required to run a nonprofit  animal rescue is at times bewildering and overwhelming, but Mrs. Betsy's love and determination to help abandoned and sometimes unadoptable  animals shines through everyday, day in and day out, all 365 days of the year! I support her and appreciate her in every way that I can because she and the animals deserve it! We adopted our little Nicki from her and we love him so much!

Her reverence and respect for life has given me so much respect for her. There just aren't many people like her. The same goes for her husband and family. I have not been in the local area for seven yrs, so don't know the other current volunteers, but I  do know the work this group does  is of a level of emotional and physical difficulty that most ppl would find it hard to imagine. They are absolutely tireless. They draw their strength from the tremendous need of the innocent creatures they rescue &  care for. I know they truly believe what they do is so worth it every time they look into the eyes of one of the angels living at AFA. Thank you Betsy for what you do for them, day in and day out....for what you've done for me over the years and what you've taught me by your example. You (and AFA) are making such a difference.

She and husband Tom have saved hundred of cats and dogs and for that matter - rabbits and baby animals as well.  Her cat colony is simpatico.  They feed together side by side and there is nothing but harmony.  She is their Pied Piper for sure!  They rely totally on donations and money is always tight.  She needs volunteers as much as donations so anyone local who can spend some time with her and her cats and dogs is sorely needed.  Imagine doing all that yourself?  There are so many chores I can't imagine how they do it.  So if you are able bodied, have a checkbook or need to adopt, this  is best place on earth!!!

Aide for Animals	265399		/users/profile/354141	BradE	Donor	5	10/19/2015	Betsy Haas, with Aide for Animals, helped us when no other rescue or sanctuary would. A while back, we found some stray kittens behind our office, and Betsy took them in when we could no longer care for them. And again, just last week, she helped us when we caught a male feral cat at our office. She helped set up the TNR (Trap, Neuter, Release) at her vet. The cat, now named Copper, has been successfully neutered, ear tipped and released back into his free roam environment, and gets fed at our shop! Betsy Haas and the volunteers at Aide for Animals truly do care about the well being of the animals, and do this work for the love of animals!

I am so blessed to have met Betsy when she took in some kittens that I found, and I've been volunteering weekly ever since. I've never met a more kind, caring, compassionate and dedicated person in my life! I'm proud to say that I'm a volunteer and donor at AFA, and plan to be for the rest of my life. With that being said, AFA can always use additional volunteers in many capacities and always needs donations to help with the continued (sometimes forever) care of the cats and dogs. There are also many beautiful, sweet, loving cats, that would love to be adopted, but if that doesn't happen, they have a forever home at AFA. Betsy treats every single animal like a family member! Please show your support for AFA!!

Any animal who is not adopted will live out the remainder of their lives with TLC at AFA Sanctuary.  Many are disabled, geriatric  or considered "not attractive and unadoptable."  I am grateful for the opportunity to serve and dedicate my energy to this fantastic organization.

They take in animals that are disabled or have special needs and work diligently to find them forever homes. My daughters and I have volunteered with Aide for Animals and have seen the loving care given there.  And when my father passed away, there was a stray mother cat and kitten at his house that we needed to find a home for.   Aide for Animals took them in when no one else would.
Aide for Animals	153180	2	/users/profile/96004	Lee C.	Board Member	5	04/07/2013	There are so many great things about Aide for Animals that I could take pages to tell you about them.  I will hit on the main functions of this rescue organization in this review.   We are the only animal rescue group in this area that not only takes stray cats and dogs and gets them ready for adoption , but also is a retirement home for unadoptable pets, such as the old, disabled, or chronically ill. I have been on the board of Aide for Animals for several years, and in that capacity, I get to see the struggle that we go through every day, trying to bring in enough donations to keep these animals vetted, fed, and comfortable.  We have had several fund raisers since I have been involved, and although they help immensely, we still work tirelessly to put out newsletters, brochures and use word of mouth to get our name further into the community than it already is. I share the added honor of being an Adoption Coordinator and Critical Care Unit with one of our other volunteers, Rachel Nowlin Jones.   As Adoption Coordinators, we make sure that the pets that are up for adoption on our website or on Petfinder go to homes that suit them as individuals and not just another cat or dog.  We go into the homes and interview the prospective owners, and in most cases, there is a perfect match between animal and proud owner. Our critical care units are just that:  A place in our individual homes where we take gravely ill pets that need a lot of special attention, such as daily medication, fluids, constant monitoring, etc.  When they are well and eating good, we take them back to Aide for Animals and put them up for adoption. I can't say enough about Aide for Animals.   Even if I weren't so closely bonded with the people, animals, and overall good that we do for the community, such as teaching that pets are members of our families and that spaying or neutering is one of the most important things an owner can do for their pet, I would still be a volunteer and do what I could to make sure that this wonderful organization continues to help all of the animals that come into their care.
Aide for Animals	85916		/users/profile/96004	Lee C.	Volunteer	5	04/15/2011	I have been fortunate enough to know the founders of Aide for Animals for a lot of years.  In the past few years, I became first volunteer then board member.   Aide for Animals is a place for homeless, helpless animals.  Betsy and her family work tirelessly to ensure that all the animals are vetted and disease free before they are put in "general population" and they provide individual "kitty condos" for the cats and all are well loved. Of course, there are more new animals than there are adoptions, but when someone does adopt a fur baby, they are matched with the sweet animal that will make their life complete.
Aide for Animals	109953		/users/profile/149762	catladyleeann	Board Member	5	04/16/2012	I have been on the board of Aide for Animals for over a year now, and have been the Adoption Coordinator for that long, also.  Before this, however, I volunteered for Betsy and Aide for Animals.  The wonders of the animals that I get to see when I am on the grounds of this wonderful organization are priceless.  Every little paw that reaches out to me, every sweet face that I get to kiss, reminds me of how much good Aide for Animals does for our community.  What were once stray, abused or neglected and starving animals are now well fed, well cared for, and most important of all, well loved.  I am so very grateful to be a part of this wonderful nonprofit organization.    We are a part of the bigger picture of how the world should be.

For years I tried to give even a small amount to as many as I could, with compassion and empathy, but as I studied the actual work accomplished by several I supported,  I was dismayed by the high administrative salaries and lack of real results.  I am now a firm supporter of the Southern Poverty Law Center.  I know they are genuinely committed to equal rights and equal justice for all.  I see it in the thousands of cases they represent as attorneys, and am grateful for the difference they make to the lives of so many.  They help us keep the dream of democracy alive with the work they do daily.

The program points to the future, helping teachers prepare a new generation to live in a diverse world.  Adult bigots and their offspring have bullied children for years.  My child, very Christian and loving, has been bullied and we seek education for all to end ignorance and hatred.  We are saddened by the pervasive oppression, ingnorance and injustice we see in our world, thus we give when we can, as led by Christ's love to do so.
Southern Poverty Law Center, Inc.	122594	5	/users/profile/166981	RangerG	Professional with expertise in this field	1	09/19/2012	Before donating you should review the 990s that are publicly filed; as of 2011 this outfit--with only a handful of employees--is sitting on about 250 million dollars in assets....  That is a disproportionate cash position and given that their income covers expenses, you wonder just what that quarter billion dollars is doing?  Substantively, they use the "hate group" label indiscriminately--groups that simply affirm marriage as one man/one woman--the definition that has been virtually uniform in western civilization--are condemned as hate groups.  This is pure propaganda, worse because many of their charges have been directly rebutted yet they never retract their false statements.
Southern Poverty Law Center, Inc.	120018	8	/users/profile/163172	Canof Sand	General Member of the Public	1	08/04/2012	Per their published reports, the Southern Poverty Law Center considers all of the following to be "extreme" individuals or hate groups: the Family Research Council, Rand Paul and other libertarians, anyone who wants existing immigration law enforced, anyone who is against redefining of term for political reasons (that is, Orwellian newspeak) when said redefining is something leftists are pushing for, the Tea Party, etc. etc. And who DOESN'T make the cut? Why, any group it would be "politically incorrect" to attack (such as Muslim groups that hold the same position against "gay marriage" that others were labeled as "hate groups" for holding). And, of course, all leftist groups get a free pass. They even admit as much. (See links.) So... it's a great group to donate to if you're an intellectually bankrupt leftist hack, I suppose. // http://www.theblaze.com/stories/progressive-org-gives-muslim-groups-a-pass-on-gay-issues-condemns-social-conservatives/ // http://www.renewamerica.com/columns/mbarber/100325 // http://www.therightperspective.org/2011/07/14/splc-brands-rand-paul-an-extremist/
Southern Poverty Law Center, Inc.	106495	6	/users/profile/143911	Lori Smith	Donor	5	02/15/2012	In response to Mr. Bandler, I believe the induction to the Direct Mktg Hall of Fame slur is misleading.  Because Mr. Dees was inducted to this group means he excelled at has marketing skills, along with his contributions to society.  There is a huge difference between efforts a non-profit makes in seeking donations to fund their cause and those who pay exorbitant fees to a FOR-profit fund raising group. Too many kind folks donate via a for-profit fund raiser, unknowingly giving most if not all of their money to them instead of the non-profit.  The SPLC does excellent work on behalf of so many who need it most.  I am grateful for Mr. Dees' consistent dedication along with everyone else there.
Southern Poverty Law Center, Inc.	102731	8	/users/profile/135405	Brian Ternoey	Donor	5	12/30/2011	I've contributed since 1975 and think this organization is one of the most effective civil rights organizations around.  It goes directly after hate organizations as well as teaching tolerance
Southern Poverty Law Center, Inc.	101789	6	/users/profile/131349	Andrew Nowak	Donor	5	12/06/2011	There's no other organization in the US that has fought hatred and racism and exposes the hate mongers as effectively as SPLC.  I would give them 6 stars if possible.  
Southern Poverty Law Center, Inc.	101707	4	/users/profile/131054	Steve Bandler	Donor	1	12/05/2011	The fact that the founder, Morris Dees, is a member of the Direct Marketing Hall of Fame (www.the-dma.org/awards/hof/hofinductees.shtml#1998) should tell you that this organization is much more about raising money than doing good.
Southern Poverty Law Center, Inc.	100973	7	/users/profile/125571	dcluke	Donor	5	11/23/2011	I am so proud to be a donor to the SPLC.  The SPLC has a solid record of real activism against hate in America. Unlike other civil liberties organizations that simply publicize hate and injustice, the SPLC is not afraid to take action. It has worked within the law to shut down white supremacist organizations and is currently in the courts battling a Minnesota school district that has turned a blind eye to anti-gay bullying despite an alarming number of suicides among its students.  The SPLC's decision to brand several prominent Religious Right organizations as "hate groups" for their false and demonizing propaganda against gays/lesbians has put those organizations on the defensive. The SPLC takes a stand against all hate, whether it is directed against minority groups or majority groups. It has also remained independent and refuses to be co-opted by a major political party.
Southern Poverty Law Center, Inc.	93497	7	/users/profile/107615	Linda C.	Donor	5	07/06/2011	I have donated to Southern Poverty Law Center since 1974, and have been both inspired and humbled by their unfailing devotion to social justice and their incredible bravery in the face of overt and frightening attacks, including at one time the firebombing and destruction of their offices. SPLC has saved many lives, defended many unjustly accused, used legal means to disassemble many neo-Nazi, racist, and other extremist groups, and served as a source of information when even the government had no knowledge of extremists. They also have the wonderful campaign of "Teach Tolerance" in the schools. After Oklahoma City the feds got much of the information that led to arrests from SPLC. Founder Morris Dees and others have put their lives on the line many times, and serve as inspirations to new generations of volunteers and staff, who are brave and steadfast in their devotion to justice for all. 
Southern Poverty Law Center, Inc.	88738	6	/users/profile/100133	bonnietoo	Donor	5	05/15/2011	I first supported Morris Dees and his organization many years ago. He and the Center have uncovered, prosecuted and brought down many many extremely violent racist individuals and groups. They go up against the toughest groups in the country and don't back down. They send out free materials including curriculums, books, videos and magazines with high quality anti-discrimination strategies and lessons to any teacher or school group that asks. They have been bombed, set on fire, threatened and attacked for what they do. I feel that they are one of the main organizations standing between us and anarchy. I am grateful for what they do and and happily support them as much as I can.

I give back though  organizations such as this because I can identify with the people being served.  I lost a brother many years ago.  He left children age 2 and 9. They could have used the services of an organization like the Healing Place.  My husband also died suddenly of a pulmonary embolism.  My daughter was only 15 at the time.  Counseling was important to helping us cope with the sudden loss.  The school program is especially beneficial to the children in our area.  Many of them would be unable to visit the facility so having the services provided at the school include students that would not ordinarily receive such service.  This is a great organization! 
Healing Place-A Center For Grieving Children & Families	187738		/users/profile/244809	michharr	General Member of the Public	5	11/04/2013	My husband passed away in April of 2007 leaving me with 7 and 2 year old girls. About a month later my mom saw in the paper about a day camp for children who had lost loved ones so I called and signed them up. That was my first encounter with The Healing Place. We then began going to the group nights (my 2 year old started later when she turned 3). We attended regularly for over 4 years then went every few months for about another year. My girls loved going and I can say I strongly believe it is a major reason they do so well now. I will always be grateful for what they did for my girls and for me. While the kids are in group the adults get to also meet. I believe we gained strenth and comfort from the others that were going thru a death. Most of the time the situations were very different but we could still relate in so many ways. Mrs. Kaye is an awesome counselor and always had great materials and topics for discussion. Almost 7 years have now passed, I have now remarried and me and my girls are so blessed and doing wonderful with my new husband and step-daughter. I know I owe part of this sucess to The Healing Place. My girls and very considerate of others, especially friends and family that lose someone in there lives. I can see them one day working somewhere like The Healing Place. They can say to others you are not alone and things are going to be different but it can and will be ok.

I started volunteering with The Healing Place a year ago and the changes and impact it has made on me is describable. Many people no do realize the need for an organization like The Healing Place and the services that they provide, but the differences that are made by these talented and truly passionate women is extraordinary. I have never met a kinder or more humbler soul than the direct, Ms. Kay Parker. She is the type of person that you only meet once in a lifetime and we are so lucky to have her at The Healing Place. The Healing Place embodies everything that a non-profit organization should and they continue to inspire not only the teens and children that come through the doors for their services, but the volunteers, donors, and people of the Shoals community.

They put on a camp recently that I volunteered for.  There so many kids!  There were all ages.  It was wonderful to see such a caring organization helping children with their grief. Too many times the children are left out, when it is the children that are often times the most impacted with a loss.  My heart goes out to The Healing Place for all the work they do year round, not just the one day camp!!!

The staff ensures that they receive the counseling they need to cope with an event that they do not understand and ensure that there will be better days ahead.  The children receive the counseling as long as necessary.   As a Board member I am very pleased with the caring service provided by our staff.  The number of children receiving this loving care is in the hundreds since we have been providing it.  All the schools in northwest  Alabama are aware of the service we provide and they call us first.  That in itself speaks volumes about our staff. Jim Traglia

For over a decade, The Healing Place has helped give countless children and their families hope during the most tumultuous times of their lives.  Having been actively involved in charitable organizations and other nonprofits for several years, I have rarely come across another organization that I feel exemplifies all of the qualities of charity as much as The Healing Place does.  I have never worked with a more caring staff or a more fiscally responsible board.  The Healing Place is a steward of public good.
Healing Place-A Center For Grieving Children & Families	176782		/users/profile/233236	Joe_39	Board Member	5	10/11/2013	The Healing Place has helped many children overcome the emotional distress of losing a loved one. As a former elementary school principal, I have seen first hand the problems young people sometimes have in the educational environment when they experience the loss of someone close. The Healing Place uses both group and individual counseling sessions to help these children come to grips with that loss and see that 1) its was not their fault, 2) they are not alone, many others experience loss as well. It is a honor to work with the staff of the Healing Place to provide this help to children.

I know because not only am I honored to be a part of the team providing care, I am also a family member whose loved ones have received care.  My father was a patient for several months prior to his passing from kidney cancer.  He eventually came into the inpatient facility and passed after several days of around the clock care.  As a nurse it was a great relief for me personally to be able to spend my dad's last days with him as his loving daughter instead of as his nurse.  My sister-in-law had a very different experience.  She came from the hospital to the inpatient facility as she ended her fight with a brain tumor.  My family was so grateful that there was a place she go go in her last days that provided comfort, peace and respect for someone who had fought so valiantly up until her final days.

My time working with Hospice of West Alabama has changed me as a nurse, as a person, and as a caregiver. It has forever changed me and I wouldn't give anything for that.

There full time staff of Paul, Mimi and Christy are an outstanding fit for the Foundation and extremely well qualified with each one demonstrating an unusual understanding of their particular part of the program.   Their Vista program adds another level of  professionalism with Tyler and Sarah taking up the slack and helping in many different areas.   Their volunteer program takes advantage of a wealth of knowledge and experience.  I would sincerely hope that everyone would check into this awesome program and find what role you can play in making the WACF even better and more effective than it is now.

She was rescued from a puppy mill. She has been a much loved family member and a big support of mine for over 12 years. BHRA does its very best to find the best people for these bassett hounds.
Basset Hound Rescue of Alabama	245240	3	/users/profile/332366	Tammy100	General Member of the Public	1	06/14/2015	After a long search for our baby girl whom we had named Dixie Belle.. But the Bhra renamed her Lilly.. We contacted them and gave them everything they asked for vet records .. Pics.. Even identified her spot for spot and dot for dot... But yet these people still refused to give us our baby girl back... Instead they told us they was speeding her adoption along.. My daughterJamie is so heartbroken... We had looked everywhere for her since around thanksgiving..  It's not our fault belle aka LILLY was taken from us and didn't surface again til we got word in first of june someone saw her pic and informed Jamie so we started searching again.. And we found her except we was denied our baby!!! So my review is that these people are NOT out for what's best for these babies... But money talks!!! I will continue searching for people that will listen and do something with this non profit organization because They kept on telling us oh give us this give us that.. Then all of a sudden nope you can't have her back Because you didn't search enough for her!!! And they lied on several websites of how they obtained "Lilly" and even to us.. And YES I have ALL emails and pics of all conversation with the president of Bhra and the websites.. They also removed Lilly's pics immediately upon us contacting them... But what hurt the most is we found our belle and they lead US to believe we give them proof of ownership and we could have her back.. Of course we would have reimbursed for all her care while with Bhra .. And then 'll of a sudden no.. Vet records aren't burden of proof and we are speeding up her adoption process.. And I think They were so wrong.. And to me that breaks all of what they are suppose to stand for.. They should be that Dixie belle aka Lilly should go to her HOME with her mommy who had her since she was 6 weeks old... We miss our baby girl.. So if you have our precious baby.. Plz call her belle belle ;) that is her name... She will love you forever.. And if y'all want burden of proof that is her name contact Dr sherry Brown at Brent animal hospital in Brent Alabama .. Jamie Jones was the one she was taken from! Thank you for your time.. Tammy Richardson (trich48@hotmail.com) Grandma of the belle belle.. Will be glad to show everyone "burden of proof" against these heartless people.

They foster these beautiful basset babies, providing for all of their needs, including their medical needs. BHRA screens their potential forever homes before placing the basset babies and follows up after placement to make sure the adjustment is going well. Their primary concern is for these sweet fur babies. Such a beautiful spirit in this organization.

The volunteers for BHRA take their responsibility VERY seriously.  Their intake process makes sure all of their bassets will be healthy when adopted.  They do a thorough home visit making sure their hounds will be in a secure and loving environment.  This is a top notch organization for which I am VERY grateful.  My 2 rescues have meant the world to me.  So thankful that they allow "Tennessee Volunteers" to rescue and love their Alabama bassets.

It would be like if I had a daughter and letting her go out on her first date.  The adoptee's would never be good enough for the bassets and I would have maybe 10-15 on my hands then. lolWe have adopted/ rescued 6 so far and counting.  I usually have at least 2 at a time, if not 3.  I am currently looking for a 3-5 year old male to replace our 15 year old we had to lay to rest not long ago and the 2 girls we have need a big brother to watch over them while they sleep (which is pretty much all day and night) and protect them from the local squirrel/ rabbit population.  Terrifying (lol)  BHRA has always been there for us.  Thanks a million for all you do.

Lilly is great company and loves to play in the yard and keeps me moving when I'd rather be sitting around.

Basset Hound Rescue of Alabama	240740	2	/users/profile/327021	Valerie55	Volunteer	5	04/07/2015	Basset hounds have been part of my family for the past 34 years.  Now, as a basset foster parent and part of a dedicated volunteer team, working with BHRA has allowed me to fulfill my passion for rescuing, fostering, and helping find forever homes for these loving bassets. Since we do not have a physical address or facility, we rely solely on the help of volunteer foster parents to temporarily house and care for our hounds until they are adopted....whether the bassets are owner surrenders, strays, abused and abandoned pets, or rescue pets from public animal shelters. BHRA and their volunteers do not get enough credit for the painstaking, gut-wrenching, heartfelt labor of love that goes into every effort to save a hound.   An amazing group of volunteers doing an amazing job they all should be proud of!

From the initial consultation, home visit, placement and post adoption follow up, they were professional, responsive and well organized. It is evident that their top priority is the welfare of the innocent animals that come into their care. After our dear boy Wally passed away last fall, BHRA worked with us to find a good match for our home.  Lulu came from a wonderful foster care family who were very helpful in providing us with the information we needed with regard to her personality and needs.  It seems that everyone we interacted with truly loves these animals.

K-9s 4 Kids	218608	4	/users/profile/282187	Lilith P.	General Member of the Public	5	09/30/2014	This program helps EVERYONE involved, from the dogs who get rescued from shelters, the trainers in the prison who never reoffend, society at large because the inmates who train come back into society more healthy and law-abiding, and most of all, the homes where the dogs are placed.  These dogs bring safety, peace, and joy to children and veterans otherwise experiencing difficulty, and the effects are nothing short of miraculous.  Want to know what makes this an even better program?  People in need aren't turned away because they don't have thousands of dollars to pay for the dog; this program GIVES the dogs to qualified families who can be responsible for the upkeep of the service animal.  My family attended the service dog graduation this year, and I was just in tears when I saw how much the program helps people.  We are currently awaiting our son's service dog through this program, and we have high hopes for a positive transformation in his life as I've seen happen in the lives of other children.

This child was a totally different child because of his service dog.  Prior to having "Emma", this child was very withdrawn and would have frequent meltdowns, which alienated him from his classmates. It was a complete turnaround when Emma joined the picture. She gave him the courage and confidence to participate in class and socialize with classmates. This student even became an active member of the 5th grade student council, an honor that only 22 out of 190 students had the privilege of doing. As far as having a dog in the classroom,  she was just like another student. You couldn't even tell she was there. The best thing that ever happened to this child. They now have an inseparable bond.

Her seizures are uncontrolled and we never know when she will have one. It made us afraid to even leave her in her room for a long period of time without checking on her.  That is until we were blessed with Buckmaster from K-9s 4 Kids.  He has truly changed our lives.  Buck is trained to come get us if Madison is having a seizure.   There have been countless times that he has woken us up at night to let us know she is seizing in her bed.  He is a truly remarkable dog and Madison's constant companion.  This organization is filled with compassionate, professional and knowledgable people whom I am so glad I have the pleasure of knowing.  
K-9s 4 Kids	213455	5	/users/profile/276640	Pamela76	General Member of the Public	5	09/04/2014	I have attended two graduation ceremonies since my nephew received a service dog (EMMA) through this wonderful organization and the many volunteers who dedicate many hours to make a dream come true for many children.  Through this program with Easter Seals and K-9 4 Kids, these dogs are trained and placed with children per individual needs (medical, social disorders, handicaps, etc).  Only through this program was it possible for my nephew, Gaige, to be afforded the much needed opportunity to receive such a special dog and true friend.  Emma has played an enormous role in not only her service to Gaige with Asbergers Syndrome, but also a much needed friend.  These dogs provide a child with assistance along with their desire to love.  It is so true that a Dog is the Best Friend you could ever own.  They never complain, they always strive to please, and they never will abandon you; unlike most humans in this world today.  These volunteers not only train these dogs but make sure each dog is personally fit to each child in need.  I was personally touched at graduation both times attended as Ms. Frances McGowen, Emma's trainer, and all the many volunteers who also planned a grand finale with class sessions and a ceremony of recognition that was just awesome.  I would like to invite anyone to learn more about this program and see how you might be a part whether by donating or by being a volunteer.  Thanks to all of you and God Bless.

Prior to receiving this life saving service dog, we lived in constant fear and heartache as we watched him revert into himself more each day until we were afraid we had lost him altogether. He had a very difficult time at school, bullied and "in his words" said, "I am invisible". After speaking to Director Frances McGowin several times, instinctively she knew what Gaige needed and arranged a meeting between the two. Our grandson instantly reacted to Emma & we felt a huge weight was lifted off his shoulders as well as ours. He finally after 10 years had a friend. Emma saved him. How can you thank this program, these people...there is no adequate way. They gave us back our grandson who was hurting, sinking into that black hole we could not go...OMGoodness, we owe everything to Frances, Ashley Taylor (Emma's trainer), Easter Seals. Our hearts, our lives are forever grateful. We learned to never give up. They did not allow us to give up.

Their belief in not just helping the hero but the whole family to keep them together, to keep them from falling apart. I am the founder of Heros Closet and after I found out my life would soon be ending due to a terminal illness I went to FOV to ask if they could take over the cases I was helping with veterans. They immeaditly took action and not only took over the cases but because I couldn't finish my work to complete Heros Closetthe founder of FOV Brannan Vines took immeadiate action and within 2 days had boxes of items going out to families in need. Heros Closet will now be included in FOVs David's House community. Families in need will now be able to shop for the things they need for free. FOV is truly an amazing organization.

They helped me locate resources for my husband and myself, and are a HUGE support system. It's so nice to know there are people I can talk too and get advice from who live the same kind of lifestyle I do. Not feeling alone and feeling like there is always someone to turn too is an absolutely amazing feeling. I LOVE Family of a Vet!!!
Family Of A Vet Inc	190097		/users/profile/248184	Trina C.	Volunteer	5	12/07/2013	Family of a Vet is a lifesaver; this nonprofit has gone above and beyond to provide (not only to me and my family but to others as well) information, support services, guidance and more. Connecting with FOV has provided me with a stable support system that helps me in so many ways. I've been given information regarding VA claims and appointments, support in providing daily care for my veteran and emotional support on rough days. Family of a Vet offers a stellar radio show, informational articles, a blog, and most importantly, a personal connection with other families that are in my shoes that would otherwise not have been possible.
Family Of A Vet Inc	190093		/users/profile/248176	BluButrfly	Volunteer	5	12/07/2013	When my husband began having vivid, physical flashbacks, I knew deep down I was right in my suspicions of combat PTSD.  I reached out to the FamilyofaVet.com facebook page with my cry for help. I received a warm, friendly, caring response and was given an opportunity to be involved in a community of people who understood. As my husband went through inpatient treatment, and even struggles with his active duty military career due to his PTSD and suspected TBI, I found information - both for me and others, including family and even my son's teacher! I received much-needed support and help researching the right treatments and care for my husband. When he was discharged, FOV helped us locate the best place for us to move and took the stress out of planning our itinerary to get there. I learned what paperwork was most important at the VA and what order to do everything in, and had a shoulder to cry on when I thought it would never end. Without FOV, my family might not have survived everything. Instead, I can happily say we are thriving and I attribute most of our current successes to the work of amazing people in FOV.

They provided us with so much information and answered all the questions we had. The organization is run my Veterans and their family members, and they have an awesome support system. I am honored to give back and help others like us, who still struggle with the live after combat! 
Family Of A Vet Inc	188800		/users/profile/246412	Pam_57	Volunteer	5	11/18/2013	Family Of a Vet is the only reason our family has survived the new life we have since my husband was diagnosed with PTSD & TBI. FOV helped me to learn how to cope with the changes in our life.
Family Of A Vet Inc	188789		/users/profile/246396	gatrepanier	Client Served	5	11/18/2013	My husband crashed in 2011 after fighting PTSD since his return from Africa in 2007.  He was going to the VA hospital for treatment, and I had no idea how I was going to move forward.  We have 4 kids, 2 with serious learning disabilities.  It was Dec 4, and we had no income and no idea how I was going to provide for our kids.  FOV came through with help for Christmas (all 4 kids were covered) and connected us with amazing people within the VA and other groups that we could not have accessed any other way.  My gratitude to this dedicated group cannot be measured. The fact that they are all 100% volunteers, many of whom experienced similar things, and so heartfelt and genuine in their support is still astounding to me.  Their massive library of information is awesome, and they have continued to help provide direction as questions arise.  Without their help, we would not have been able to get back on our feet.  Today, we are financially stable, and moving forward in spite of significant obstacles.  Thank you so much, FOV.  I don't know what I would have done without you.  
The Kentuck Museum Association, Inc.	241541	4	/users/profile/328129	rfmcd	General Member of the Public	1	04/22/2015	I am so very sorry to see the state this organization is in. A couple of years ago the board of directors did what too many other nonprofits have done, they hired one of their own directors as executive director. In speaking with patrons, artists and supporters I have learned that the current leadership is failing and flailing. The entire staff has quit and there is no programming other than the annaul festival. The current leadership is completely changing the rules of the festival this year and has done away with the grandfathered artists that so many folks come to see. There were advertisements for the executive director position in 2013 for a nonprofit professional with 6 years experience in nonprofit management and experience writing grants and the salary was raised appropriately to a range of $60-$70K. They in turn hired one of their own members who did not meet those requirements. This is a very beloved festival in the state of Alabama and it is very sad to see that it is on a careless downhill slope. 
The Kentuck Museum Association, Inc.	233655	4	/users/profile/297540	AliceL	Professional with expertise in this field	1	11/13/2014	This used to be a wonderful organization. It is such a shame that they keep hiring directors who do not have the background, knowledge or understanding to keep things going. 
The Kentuck Museum Association, Inc.	129883		/users/profile/175315	bournetobook	Donor	5	10/26/2012	The Kentuck Arts Festival has open arms. On the third weekend of October every year, this outdoor gathering provides a magnificent environment where the tall and the small celebrate art. This year I watched again as pilgrims pranced, polished off, picked up on, and perused wondrous cross-genre offerings plucked from imagination and eased into our midst. For the first time since its inception, the young and the young-at-heart got messy and built memories at Kentuck for Kids without the enthusiastic encouragement of Carolyn Fritz, longtime volunteer and advocate who passed away earlier this year. Her spirit and generosity linger. Faith, persistence, and inclusion have secured this arts festival for 41 years. With its big heart, Kentuck grows community. 
The Kentuck Museum Association, Inc.	129684		/users/profile/175076	Amy_48	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/26/2012	 There are so many wonderful things to say about Kentuck - and all well-deserved. From a non-profit perspective, what amazes me about Kentuck is that such a small organization can successfully execute an iconic, nationally recognized event. Kentuck has put hosted a Nationally acclaimed art show for 41 years. From theirsmall building, the Kentuck staff has consistently attracted some of the best outsider and folk artists in the nation, and some of the best collectors of art. Additionally , the Kentuck has actively sought out unrecognized talent.. Some of which had skyrocketed to the top, with the recognition of Kentuck. In addition to identifying and promoting great art, they have educated the community: both local and those who travel from afar as patrons. It is an inclusive event which is attended by patrons who buy major works, as well as families simply coming to view art and participate in children's events. I believe that Kentuck's commitment has truly played a part in not only recognizing, but also developing Southern Folk Art and, at the same time, educating and developing an educated art buyer. I have been an invited artist for many years and attribute much of my children's keen eye to the years they have spent at Kentuck.
The Kentuck Museum Association, Inc.	129620	1	/users/profile/174997	Kara8	General Member of the Public	4	10/26/2012	I had never been to the Kentuck Art Festival, but this weekend I had an opportunity to go and had such a great time. There was so much more to do and see than I had anticipated. The quality of the musical performances and storytellers was just wonderful, and the artists all showcased such lovely work. It was  a real treat to spend the weekend perusing the vendors and enjoying the community atmosphere. I will definitely go again!
The Kentuck Museum Association, Inc.	129486		/users/profile/174848	Jeanne F.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/26/2012	I have had the honor of being an invited artist at Kentuck Festival of the Arts for many years.   I have been doing shows as a working artist for 20 plus years. It is without a doubt my favorite show that I do throughout the year.  Upon arrival I am greeted each year by the staff and volunteers as a member of the Kentuck family.  These kind of special touches are a welcome change.  I look forward all year to this show, as it is where I feel I am truly with my tribe.  Kentuck has a great mix a folk/outsider art, contemporary art & outstanding craft.  The music and demonstrating artists make this a well-rounded event.  Even the activities for children have an unusual twist; my favorite is the musical instruments tent, where kids get a chance to try out an array of instruments.  In the past, when the park has encountered rain & flooding the staff was there coming up with solutions and working with the venue on long term solutions. The public is supportive of the event and the local newspapers to a great job with articles and spotlights on musicians and artists. They have a Patron Program that works wonderfully. The show hours are perfect, 9-5 Sat/Sun with load-in on Friday.  What more can I say?  I look forward to next year!
The Kentuck Museum Association, Inc.	129396		/users/profile/174766	Gillian K.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/25/2012	I have been participating in juried art festivals throughout the midwest and southwest for more than twenty years. Kentuck is indeed unique from my prospective.It is a wonderful mix of true folk art, pseudo folk art, semi folk, wanna be folk, contemporary work and just plain good art made by sincere craftsmen. It is a safe environment to brings kids and let them wander and wonder. It is the only art show about the art, craft and creativity, not about presentation . My first year the man across from us hung his work from a tree and leaned against a chicken wire fence. I was entranced  as i watched throughout the day as he almost sold out. Its the only show I've gone to where a staff member stood in the path in front of my booth and said, "you need help? I'll get someone right over!"  And did!    Most of the artists I know come back year after year despite the mud, dust, pollen, floods, sunshine and cheer. It feels like an art show for artists though the public is a vital force- after all, we do need an audience! 
The Kentuck Museum Association, Inc.	129367		/users/profile/174736	Jay_7	General Member of the Public	5	10/25/2012	Kentuck is a collage of talent, creativity and fun. Walking through the paths and finding the perfect piece of art is a delight. The music, the people, the entire experience is not to be missed. 
The Kentuck Museum Association, Inc.	129252		/users/profile/174619	St St	Board Member	5	10/25/2012	Kentuck is the best non-profit with which I have ever been involved.  It provides year-round activities on its campus while its "signature", nationally-acclaimed festival occurs annually and attracts visitors across the country.  Kentuck attracts all ages and provides a wide scope of art-related activities.  All these activities are done with the end goal of perpetuating the arts, engaging the community, and empowering the artist.  The organization operates in a professional manner, has an active board, a deep volunteer base, and a dynamic staff.  
The Kentuck Museum Association, Inc.	129169		/users/profile/174528	Suzan B.	General Member of the Public	5	10/25/2012	Kentuck is a fantastic, magical place--a place where children can be taught about art, and what the imagination can actually do when let loose. The art at Kentuck spans from very fine art to the essence of Southern folk art. The staff, board and volunteers are there, and they far exceed what is normally given. They treat the artist like royalty, and the visitors to this event even better. It is a wonderful place..and the morning after the show, I start looking forward to next year.
The Kentuck Museum Association, Inc.	129100		/users/profile/174441	Edward G.	Board Member	5	10/25/2012	Kentuck is a rare and unique art festival with an eclectic selection of art.  I look forward to Kentuck Art Festival every year and each year I am impressed with the artists from around the country.   The staff, volunteers, and board members do a great job implementing this event and it is obvious they take careful consideration when choosing the artists for the festival.  I am also equally impressed with the ease of traffic associated with this event particularly when there is a home football game which also draws a large crowd.  It is apparent that everyone involved takes every detail into consideration when planning and implementing this fantastic event.  I am already looking forward to next year.

Ashland Housing Development Corporation	237697	4	/users/profile/322535	Allisong	Volunteer	5	02/06/2015	AHDC is a great non-profit that is committed to their community. Rural Alabama communities struggle to provide opportunities and activities for the residents. AHDC not only provides housing opportunities for low-income households, but also donates generously each year to many local programs like; Ashland Library Summer Reading Program, Clay County Arts League Summer Arts Camp for Youth, Ashland Youth Sports League, and many others. Without their support, many of these programs would not exist. Their contributions allow community residents, especially the young, to learn and experience many things that build character and expand knowledge. I highly recommend supporting AHDC!

Eastern Shore Choral Society Inc	31999	6	/users/profile/32815	choral	Board Member	5	03/01/2010	This is a great organization of talented individuals who volunteer their time and talents and work hard striving for absolute perfection in their concerts from the simplest to the most difficult music. They performed at Carnegie Hall in 2007 and 2009 with their director, Terry Maddox. In addition to performing two concerts per year, and a free Messiah concert, members volunteer and perform mini-concerts, at no charge, throughout the year at such functions as the Fairhope Christmas Tree Lighting ceremony, book signings and at various events in and around Baldwin County. All donations received at the Messiah concert go to support of the Edna Traccarella Scholarship Fund which began in 1996 and continues today.  The organizations Edna Traccarella Scholarship Fund supports a competition for high school students with awards of $300, $400 and $500 to assist students in furthering their vocal studies. ESCS also makes monetary contributions of $250-$500 each to several local high schools music programs each year.

Terry Maddox is an exceptionally talented director and conductor who demands perfection of effort while creating an environmnet of fun and enjoyment.  If you desire to develop or improve your singing voice and you enjoy choral music, then here is where you want to be.  As for me, I try never to miss their concerts.

The ESCS has permitted qualified teens to participate in their amazing program, at no cost.

I hope everyone will support this very worthwhile organization, who has blessed our community with much joy!

Eastern Shore Choral Society Inc	28594	11	/users/profile/29634	song-bird	Volunteer	5	02/17/2010	Over the 68 years of my life I have been involved in singing with various choral groups.As a child I sang in church choirs and glee clubs. Being a pianist and singer, I looked for groups in my adult life that would challenge me through the difficulty of the music as well as the expertise of the conductor. I found such a group in the Eastern Shore Choral Society.  Terry Maddox seems to have perfect pitch, which is, at times, scary because he catches all mistakes; and, demanding because he expects the correct notes to take the place of the incorrect ones.  The caliber of the singers is at a high level and most are teaching, accompanying, or conducting in their own right.  All members pay $45.00 per semester for the privilege of singing in this chorale but this amount does not cover all the items in our budget.  I have heard nothing but compliments after our concerts.

To think that the group can not only work with the director to achieve a very acceptable presentation, but that we can succeed at providing, through donations and attendance at our two yearly recitals, scholarship funds for young people, is a wonderful end result at this time of life.I am so pleased to be a part of this worthwhile endeavor.

As a 5 year breast cancer survivor I have learned to give back to others as they walk through, offering every level of support, financial, spiritual, mental and even just making sure their homes are clean.  What is most rewarding is the joy one receives when the recipient show unwavering appreciation for support given.  Hats off to Cancer Awareness Network for all you do to make people smile.

They are very active in supporting families through prayer and visits and service to individuals with cancer, as well as those who lose a love one to cancer. I say people keep up the awesome work you all are doing because the Lord is truly using you all to make a difference. Continue your Samaritan work in love and be blessed for your service you all do for God's people Joyce
Cancer Awareness Network for Children Inc	217300	6	/users/profile/280825	brinson	Donor	5	09/25/2014	I think the Cancer Awareness Network for Children, Inc. does a marvelous job in providing accurate information from a professional level including a doctor of oncology, which is  what people need today. They offer numerous of workshops giving coping techniques as well as sound advice for diets and exercise routines to live a healthier life. In other words a set of changes or ideas that all of us could benefit from a pro-active level to live whole lives. Whole lives means whole communities. I think they are doing a much needed service for their community and the world. This non-profit organization is a group that volunteers their personal time while yet working toward the necessary objective of their everyday lives as well.Joyce

True To The Red White And Blue	111081		/users/profile/151174	Whistle Blower	General Member of the Public	1	04/29/2012	Be careful - this organization is being investigated by the I.R.S. for taking cash donations and using them for personal expenses.  If you donate real items, they will send the troops the items to maintain a valid appearance.  However, they cannot account for all of the cash they received under the false pretence of helping our troops.  This "non profit" organization is fake.  Debbie Aznar has been arrested for theft in the past.  Her husband has been arrested for several counts of DUI.  These people cannot be trusted.

Debby is a wonderful person who has sacrificed both her health and family for this country, yet she continues to give back to others (primarily active duty troops) but also reserve and separated members and their families.  Debby not only provides troops the ability to meet performers at concerts but she also sends them care packages while they are deployed overseas and helps their families out with utility bills should they fall behind or become unable to pay them.  Debby and her organization truly exemplify the American spirit.  Debby's attitude towards others inspired me to join her organization and assist in "Thanking" our troops for all that they do.

Whenever I had spare time, I volunteered with them, and they have me excellent training so that I could digitize paper files into Medflex, query Medflex for health insurance (for children that had it), and help with paperwork for dental appointments. They also carefully protect their young patient's privacy by requiring HIPPAA training for all volunteers. This is a wonderful group of people!

However, the way in which HEALs touches the lives of kids and their families is profound.  Well Doctor visits, full dental care, and a new pair of shoes when a kid has a check up.  You can see the effects this type of generosity has on these children.  It's amazing.
Heals Inc	44187	1	/users/profile/45108	mosley0605	Volunteer	5	06/16/2010	Heals, Inc. is a wonderful organization that  provides healthcare and other services to children who would not otherwise receive it.  From speaking with Heals staff, I understand that some of these children are not even properly fed and clothed at home, and Heals steps in at every opportunity it possibly can.  There is no way we can expect children to learn, grow, and rise above their circumstances if they are unhealthy, hungry, and feel less worthy than their peers.  Heal's contribution to its community is immeasurable.
Heals Inc	43333	1	/users/profile/44161	jp3	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/08/2010	I managed a program that provided non-health care support in the school.  But we were always coming across students who were in need of health care or dental care.  HEALS worked with us to see that these children received the help they needed.  Like most nonprofits, they had limited funds for their programs, but that didn't keep them from putting the children first.
Heals Inc	42908	1	/users/profile/43650	krbyrne	Volunteer	5	06/03/2010	I am very active in the community but I volunteer with HEALS whenever I get the chance. You can tell the people that work there truly care about what they do. These children not only go without decent healthcare but they also go without adequate shoes. Two things we all take for granted most of the time.
Heals Inc	42863	1	/users/profile/43600	tim11	General Member of the Public	5	06/03/2010	HEALS is a wonderful organization that provides a much needed service to our community.  HEALS provides medical, dental and social care to students who would otherwise do without. They have become a national model for school based services and have literally impacted thousands of students and their families with better health care. Their staff is impeccable which is reflected in the number and quality of their volunteers!  A great organization doing great work!
Heals Inc	42805	1	/users/profile/43536	tracey2	Former staff	5	06/03/2010	HEALS has been a part of my heart since 2001 when I first heard about the agency and started working there. At the time there was a medical clinic at Lincoln and a dental clinic in a portable classroom out the back door of our offices. I witnessed not only the struggle of a young non-profit to keep its doors open but also witnessed the miracles that the agency accomplished.I have seen firsthand the joy that lights up a child's face when they get a brand new pair of shoes. I have heard the relief in a parent's voice when they are able to get help for their very sick child. I have seen the humbleness in the eyes of the volunteer doctors and dentists who know that if they didn't give of their time and talents that these children probably would never get the health care they need. I have been there; I've seen what this agency can do when given the chance, when given the resources.From a personal standpoint I can attest to the frustration of knowing there is SO much need out there, so many children who suffer needlessly, yet not being able to do more for them. You cannot imagine the agony of having to turn children and parents away because we just didn't have the resources to provide services to all who needed them. HEALS can do so much more, reach so many more children if given the resources to do so.
Heals Inc	42758	1	/users/profile/43482	derek11	Board Member	5	06/03/2010	HEALS is an outstanding organization that provides high-quality medical and dental care to children in Title 1 schools in Huntsville and Madison County, Alabama.  With a very capable Executive Director and staff; truly professional and caring doctors, dentists and nurses; and a fully-engaged board and many volunteers, HEALS makes a difference in the lives of many children who would otherwise not receive the medical and dental care vital to their physical and emotional development.  As someone who was blessed with parents who could afford the best medical and dental care money could buy during my youth, I stand in awe of what this organization does to promote health for children with extremely limited financial resources.  The fact of the matter is that without HEALS, these children would go without the care they need to remain healthy, happy and productive on the path to successful adulthood.  HEALS operates very efficiently and makes the most of the money it raises and receives through various sources.  The healthcare professionals who work for HEALS interact with these children on a regular basis and deliver the care they need and the self-esteem that is so vital to their present and future success.  HEALS' vision is to grow the local presence of HEALS to serve children in the sixteen Title I schools in Huntsville City and Madison County, Alabama.  Establish the school-based health center model in Alabama and be a national model of excellence for providing fully-funded, outstanding, comprehensive medical, dental and mental health care.    Identify and maximize all available resources necessary to achieve a reputation as the number one deliverer of high-quality care to the children we are privileged to treat.  Improve healthcare access, student success, cost savings and overall health by ensuring the best service and by showing sincere concern for the health and well-being of the children we serve. HEALS focuses all its energy and resources toward accomplishing thisvision and has already made a measurable difference in the lives of the hundreds of children the organization has served during the past ten year.  HEALS is an excellent non-profit organization that delivers results, acts as a responsible steward of resources, and deserves ever dollar it receives.  Although there is room for process improvement in the steps necessary to open new clinics in the coming years, HEALS is proceeding cautiously to main quality care and demonstrate sincere concern for the young patients it is privileged to serve.
Heals Inc	42733	1	/users/profile/43457	gconner	General Member of the Public	5	06/02/2010	We hear so much these days about healthcare, especially for children.  Heals is a program which unites the generosity of this community with the medical and dental needs of children in our lower income school situations.  This program touches the lives of children in such a tangible way, bringing health and care in places where it would not happen otherwise.  However, the joy of this is that it is not just asking for funds to help children, but it seeks to build goodwill, good stewardship, and good fun throughout the community, both in its mission and fundraising.  Children deserve health care, particularly those whose parents are unable to provide it.  Heals, Inc, provides that care.  I was selected to participate as a "Star" in the "Dancing wwith with Stars" fundraiser.  I was hooked when I realized that I could help provide the health care by making myself available in this fun way.  I was amazed at how many people, from all walks of life, helped to sponsor my turn on the dancefloor.  I was truly amazed at the community doubling thier fundraisiing efforts from the last year.  I encourage your help in any way to Heals, Inc., as it is doing what we all want to do...help those in need and, build up our communities, and enjoy the bringing of these things together.

But, imagine being one of the many children or adults that don't have enough food.   Having a place to go, where people help and care is important.  At Prodisee Pantry, volunteers reach out and help families, providing more than food.  Each week, families visiting Prodisee Pantry also find representatives from Social Security, legal aid assistance, educational assistance -- even companies looking to hire workers -- all on site and available to help.  These resources provide invaluable assistance to families because Prodisee Pantry cares.

I became involved with this organization after my wife had become a regular volunteer. There are so many good things to say about Prodisee, the number of families served (over 15,000 in 2015), the number of community partner agencies we work with (over 35), the additional support programs we offer (free GED and job fairs on sight), the fresh produce we are able to share with our clients, etc. But what makes our mission successful is the core volunteers who take time from their busy schedules to help those in need in our community. http://prodiseepantry.org/
Prodisee Pantry Inc	140621		/users/profile/186822	Ml M.	Advisor	5	11/16/2012	i was on hand for the very first day of the Prodisee Pantry.  We were started by a local United Methodist Church in 2003 and have become a multi-church, multi-community non-profit organization  (2005) providing emergency food boxes to families in Baldwin County, Alabama. It has been a real blessing to see what caring community individuals can do when all faiths and all walks of life come together to serve their communities.  Last year we served about 12,000 families with staple food boxes including fresh produce and bakery items either donated by individuals, corporate entities or purchased from our Area Food Bank.  About 20,000 volunteer hours were logged by community members to achieve this amazing feat.  The pantry has one full time and one part time employee.  Last year we were able to purchase, renovate and move into a larger facility which has enabled us to carry on our ministry of providing HOPE to our less fortunate brothers and sisters in our county.  I have been so blessed to be a tiny part of this ministry and humbled to realize that hunger is so real and so near to all of us if we will just open our eyes.
Prodisee Pantry Inc	125139		/users/profile/170280	foodlady	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/11/2012	Providing HOPE by feeding physical, emotional and spiritual hunger!  Prodisee Pantry's compassionate volunteers provide 1,000 + families each month with a variety of fresh fruits and vegetables, meat, eggs, bread, boxes of staple groceries and warm smiles!  It is about hunger!  This volunteer run program can take a $20 donation and provide $120 worth of food to a needy family in Baldwin County.  BUT, what makes this program special is that it understands that when someone comes in for the most basic of needs: food and a hug, there are other things going on.  They coordinate and have on site other programs which address other needs such as jobs, counseling, utility and housing assistance and more.   This community ministry will serve some 12,000 family visits this year.  In the past eight year, the blessings of a caring word, referrals and groceries touched individuals 130,000 times!
Prodisee Pantry Inc	91978		/users/profile/105370	PastorLonnie	Volunteer	5	06/24/2011	I have volunteered at the Prodisee Pantry since approximately May 2007.  My family and I have also been the recipient of their help. First, my personal story.  In July 2007 I was diagnosed as having Stage IV oropharyngeal cancer (a cancer of the head and neck).  While I was undergoing treatment for the same I became unable to work -- I was basically bedridden for months.  Each and every week Deann Servos, the Executive Director of the Prodisee Pantry, took the time to bring my family food.  I can't begin to tell you the debt of gratitude that I owe her for being so kind and generous.  Without the donations given to the Prodisee Pantry and without servants such as Deann my wife and our two children (then 8 and 4) may not have been able to eat as well as they did. As a pastor who actively serves the community, I'm confronted nearly every day with those who are in dire straits.  When disaster strikes or the economy takes a downward turn people hurt.  Being there for those who are hurting is where the Prodisee Pantry excels.  Since 2007 the Prodisee Pantry has played a pivotal role in bringing together several organizations, under one roof, so that those who live in Baldwin county know where to go to get help.  From the Salvation Army to Project Rebound and the Council on Aging to BARC - local Humane Society -- the Prodisee Pantry, under the leadership of Deann Servos, is providing our clients with many different types of help. The primary goal of the Prodisee Pantry is providing food for single parents, unemployed and under-employed households, families in transition, homeless, retirees and grandparents raising grandchildren.  Last year we helped around 35,000 people eat healthy, nutritious meals. Although I live in Mobile (a county adjacent to Baldwin), I'm more than happy to drive the nearly 40 miles (round trip) each week to serve those in need. The Prodisee Pantry is a great way to meet people where they are, to serve them in a way that doesn't embarrass them and to give back to the community. Rev. Lonnie Honeycutt
Alabama Blues Project	30666	1	/users/profile/31624	raybeez	Client Served	5	02/24/2010	My name is Rachel B. Edwards and Ive been involved with the Alabama Blues Project for five years. I started as a vocal student of Caroline Shines in the Advanced Band. There was absolutely no way for me to tell when I was 15 that the ABP would have intertwined with my life as much as it has. Now that Im 20 and an aspiring blues singer, it makes perfectly good sense. It would be an understatement if I said that the Alabama Blues Project wasnt the highlight of my week back then, and now that I actually get to work behind the scenes for the ABP, its the highlight of my day.
Alabama Blues Project	27879	4	/users/profile/28959	bdundon	Client Served	5	02/11/2010	My grandson attended the sunner blues camp in 2009. He has Downs Syndrome. At first I was skeptical about this camp but he loves music & he loves Debbie Bonds & her husband Rick. After speaking with them directly several times I enrolled him in the program. The 1st day I left him he was ok at 1st but after an hour he withdrew. They called me & after that I attended daily with him. I was amazed by the caring caring staff & that several of them had experience with special needs children in their daily work lifes. This program brings all children together no matter who or where they come from. The patients that they all had with the children was just amazing!!! They truly enjoy the children & teach all age levels & skill levels. I was also amazed at how much they put into 1 short week!! I have been involved with other short summer programs but notheing compares to this one!!! They truly tried to teach him to play guitar & drums, in the end he was presented with a "special" tamborine from Debbie to play in his band at open house. My being there with him every day was no problem, he jsut needed to see me close by to be comfortable. I helped with the children in his group but to tell the truth I gained as much from this as he did!! I cannot express enough what a wonderful program this is for all children. We need more community based programs for all children, it lets them see all that the world has to offer. Alot of these children would never be exposed to this kind of music & art, for that matter to any music & art. My grandson does attend regular school at Lloyd Wood Middle School in Northport, Alabama. He is in a special life skills program there for special ed children they feel would benefit from this program. All he needs is an aide to guide him & I feel that with the staff they had his needs would of been more than met. He jsut was a little unsure of the himself with all of the  strangers. My being there was no problem & I was able to observe first hand how they were with the children. Once again I have to say WOW!!! What a GREAT program!!!

Alabama Blues Project	27280	6	/users/profile/28323	blak16	Client Served	5	02/07/2010	As adoptive parents of a child with special needs and other issues we were always looking for something to provide positive feedback and encouragement for our pre-teen son. Through an article in our local newspaper, The Alabama Blues Project sounded like an answer to prayer. In the summer of 2006 Jonathan attended his first "Blues Camp", a week of music instruction, blues history and art all rolled into one. He was hooked!! With the excellent leadership, instructors, and loving volunteers associated with The Alabama Blues Project, we have watched him grow into a member of the Advanced Band performing on a regular basis at local events. He now sings, as well as plays harmonica, and the band just recently got a chance to perform at the International Blues Challenge in Memphis. The Alabama Blues Project has definitely been what this young man needed and continues to provide support and encouragement to him. We also are raising our grandson who has behavior issues and he is a two year member of the "Blues Camp" program. Joshua's musical talent is yet to be discovered but it is a great learning experience for him. To be a part of a musical group who won't grade you on talent just enthusiasm has been a plus for him.  The added bonus is participating in weekly life skills discussions and working on making good choices in every day situations.  If I could make any changes it would probably involve the changing instructors. I realize it must be very difficult to bring in the quality of instructors that they continue to have on a regular basis but with my two sons, losing a favorite instructor can sometimes be very traumatic. We've never been disappointed with the quality of instruction but explaining the reasons why instructors come and go could perhaps be a part of life skills. As in all organizations sometimes communication can be a problem. The Alabama Blues Project staff has been working really hard to improve in this area by adding volunteers and staff to assist in getting information out to the parents. With the economic situation during the past year or so they have really been doing an almost impossible job. The needs are great with a program of this type though. We see the opportunities provided to young people from disadvantaged areas and with issues such as our two boys through The Alabama Blues Project.  It would be a wonderful blessing to see their program highlighted so many others can know about the great work they do for the children and young people all over the West Central Alabama area.
Alabama Blues Project	27242	3	/users/profile/28291	perri	Client Served	5	02/06/2010	In 2007 I registered my 2 sons for the first time with the Alabama Blues Camp. My husband was away in Iraq and I was looking for something fun and constructive to fill a little time for them. We were immediately hooked on this awesome organization. Debbie Bond and Rick Asherson have a vision for each child that is so special.  Everyone is welcome, kids are all known by name, the instructors are amazing (seriously talented) and happy to be there! It has truly had such a positive impact on all of us. My boys are not only learning how to play the blues, but they have also developed new knowledge and respect for the music that we have listened to all of our lives. For me it has been an eye opener as far as getting to know about the artists themselves and the history behind the music that is so much a part of where we live. The Blues Project is saving what would be a dying art form. They are connecting young people from various backgrounds and experiences not only with each other but with a wonderful past. They are also offering something that can be used for the rest of their lives.  They teach life skills in part of their time together and help them make new friends and form partnerships with kids that they might not know otherwise.  This group also makes sure that no child is turned away because of financial hardship.  After my husband returned from Iraq he was out of work for almost a year. During this time they were understanding and made it possible for my sons to continue to come to camp.We look forward to the beginning of each camp and I love to hear my boys play all the time.  It has given them a freedom and confidence in their creativity that is irreplaceble!   The Alabama Blues Project had been one of the most positive things I have ever been involved with!  I only wish we had known about them earlier so my older sons could have been there!!Mrs. Perri Mullinsmother of Peter(16) and Thomas(11) Tuscaloosa, AL

He has learned so much about music, the blues and how to work with others. He has participated in the Advanced band and learned to work as a team with other band members.  He has been able to improve his musical skill through the expert instruction.  I have seen how the camp benefits all the children involved. I would highly recommend it to others.

It was one of the most enlightening experiences for her.  She was placed into the guitar group and experienced lessons of music, yet this was only the beginning of her rich experience.   Each morning, a featured presenter would introduce their contributions to the world - an artist, an Olympian, a sculptor, a musician, a community leader.  Our children were introduced to the teachings of life, friendship, community giving, art, and music.  It was a truly valuable program for our daughter and entire family.  She will forever hold these beautiful memories and lessons during her journey in life.  We will be back next summer. Thanks Alabama Blues Project!

My husband and I were so impressed with the organization that we took our sons, 12 and 17, to Selma during Spring Break this year.  We wanted our boys to witness first hand  the good the Missions does for those who are the most in need, those who are easily forgotten.  It was an experience that our family will never forget.   Their leader is Chad McEachern and he is a true visionary.  The folks who work and volunteer at the Missions are truly committed to serving the poor.  They live it and breathe it.  If you ask the people who are helped by the Missions, they will tell you how thankful they are for this bright spot in the midst darkness.    I am hard pressed to think of another organization worthy of more support than the Missions.

Nothing could be further from the truth. Just like the Red Cross did in New Orleans, they are filling their bank accounts and just pulling African-Americans out to pose in pictures. It has been stated that the Archbishop of Mobile, is "boys" with Father Paul Mcquillian of The City of St. Jude, an Edmundite priest.  He treat African-Americans at his parish and in the archdiocese as if it was 1950 instead of 2015. They should be ashamed , they raise money on the back of African-Americans and treat them like dirt.  The Attorney General of the State should do a forensic audit and investigate them thoroughly.
Ruth and Naomi Senior Outreach	33911	11	/users/profile/34726	f-souther	Volunteer	5	03/25/2010	"I was introduced to the Ruth and Naomi Senior Outreach Harp Ministry when Mama was first placed in the hospice program.  Knowing Mamas love of music, I asked for these ladies to visit her and to play for her.  The day Mama died, Lynn Bledsoe, one of the harp ladies walked into her room, not knowing that she had died.  She ended up visiting with my brother Will and me and then played her harp for us.  What an uplifting and comforting visit we had!  After the times we have had in nursing facilities the past years, we can see such a need for the Ruth and Naomi Ministry, and know that Mama would have loved to have been a part of this ministry if she could have been.  Thank you."The above was enclosed in thank you notes that I sent for memorial gifts to RNSO in memory of my mother after she died.I personally witnessed the love & compassion that RNSOhas for its clients during my mother's passing, and it was a life changing event for me.  Because of that visit five years ago, I visit nursing homes and hospitals in Georgia ministering to the sick and elderly. There are no words to describe the rewards of this work- the sparkle in eyes that have little to sparkle about as I walk into the room, the voice that asks me to please come back three or four times before the visit is over, the tears that are shed in appreciation as we pray, singing along as I play music when there is little verbal response. Because of these experiences, I know what a worthwhile and meaningful organization Ruth and Naomi is. They have made such a difference in so many lives especially the elder orphans who have no one left to help them. The joy that has been brought to this forgotten population is priceless.
Ruth and Naomi Senior Outreach	33684	1	/users/profile/34498	lora-leigh	Volunteer	5	03/22/2010	This is a very special outreach that touches the sick and actively dying patients and families.  They are visited at home or in the hospital and music is performed with their permission or permission of the family (if present).  There is noticable comfort and healing in the majority of patients served by this experience.
Ruth and Naomi Senior Outreach	33648	5	/users/profile/34462	amanda-c	Volunteer	5	03/21/2010	For several years, recently and in the past, I have been involved with mostly elder care of family members:father, mother, out-of-state mother-in-law.  How I wish RNSO had been available for them!  However, a few years ago, I was fortunate to hear Mary Porter and Lynn Bledsoe give a program on their work, and from that program and my experience with care-giving, I asked if they could play for a 104 year-old lady who was in a nursing home and who until 102 had been fairly active.  She had little family who could care for her, so I became the one to look after her.  When RNSO came to play, I was amazed to hear this bedridden, almost blind 104 year old begin to sing.  Her roommate began singing also, and soon other residents came, some in their wheelchairs.  Staff came, and there were tears.  I saw for certain that afternoon what music and caring time can do for those who are ill, dying, or separated from the life they had previously lived.  On the day this lady died, RNSO was planning to come again to play for her.  Not only did this experience minister to those residents in the nursing home, it also ministered to those who cared for the residents as well as to me, a "family" member.  I am now studying the harp, have enjoyed participating a few times in other nursing home settings and elder care, and am hoping to be trained before too long so as to volunteer with RNSO.

Their timing in visiting could not have been better in lifting spirits and sharing support during very challenging days.  The role they play not only for clients facing end-of-life and chronic medical needs but for their loved ones cannot be overstated.  Caring, concern, and true impact - we have seen personally how their work improved the mental, spiritual and physical health of our loved ones.

They took our group of 6 high school students and 2 teachers under their wings, showed us "the ropes," inspired us, helped us dream, and brought so many avoided realities front and center.  Each particpant in this informal internship grew as a result of the input of the two RNSO facilitators and the opportunities for service which they planned specifically for our group. I would highly recommend RNSO as both trainers and ministers of elder care.

How fortunate that we met by chance at an Alzheimers event in the local area. Serendipity. Dad has been in hospice for almost a year. He has lost almost all cognition, and connection with the outside world. Although unable to communicate, surprisingly he can still sing. Through your music, ministry and presence, you reach him. From singing Amazing Grace to You Are My Sunshine to My Old Kentucky Home, you help ease his journey, and ours.I can't tell you how much it means to see Dad's spirits lifted through your presence --especially during this time when it seems almost impossible to connect with him. Music is one of the most sustaining forces in his life, along with such caring people like you.Thank you for bringing your harp and heart to Dad, and to our family. I hope many people discover Ruth and Naomi, and benefit from all the blessings you bring.
Ruth and Naomi Senior Outreach	33601	5	/users/profile/34411	linda-lathem	Volunteer	5	03/20/2010	This organization came to the nursing home where my mother was a resident.  They taught me to play the harp, along with staff, residents, outsiders.  They brought music, love, crafts, projects, spiritual nourishment in many forms.  They formed relationships.  They came to the bedside of many dying patients, including my mother, bringing music for the soul and ministering in times of great need not only to the patient, but to the family.  I've seen elderly people open up to music, singing hymns, mouthing each word to the hymn, and they can't even speak a sentence. I've seen these ladies lay down their harp and stand and dance with a person in a wheelchair, making them feel so special and alive.  A wonderful ministry.

Thank you all for teaching me how to play the harp and for your part in giving me this experience.
Ruth and Naomi Senior Outreach	33583	2	/users/profile/34388	leonam42	Volunteer	5	03/19/2010	When I play the harp in nursing homes, I usually offer my harp to some of the residents so they can play it.  When those with arthritic hands are able to pluck or slide their fingers across the strings and make sounds, the smiles on their faces are priceless. After I packed up my harp and started to leave one day, a patient, asked me where I was going. (She rarely speaks more than a word or two at a time.) I told her I would stay a while longer and asked if she would rather I just sat with her or play the harp. She wanted me to play!

Humane Society Of Shelby County	96028		/users/profile/111744	cv32w	Volunteer	5	08/18/2011	I have adopted 3 cats from Shelby Humane Society over the last 7 years and they are fantastic.  I began volunteering with the shelter in 2007.  Since then, I have participated in several programs that Shelby Humane Society offers.  This would include working at offsite adoption events, low cost vaccination/microchip clinics and the Shelter Partners program.   The offsite adoption events help find loving homes for many dogs or cats.  The low cost vaccination/microchip clinics and Quick Fix Spay/Neuter program have been a huge success in our communities. These two programs provide low cost options to residents who may not be able to afford the regular cost of the services provided.  Not only will these services keep our community pets healthy but will also help with the pet overpopulation that we have.  The Shelter Partners program transport dogs from our crowded shelter to shelters in New England where they have spay/neuter and pet license laws.  Due to these laws being strictly enforced, they do not have the overpopulation that we have.  Since this program began in 2006, over 4400 dogs have found a loving home in the north.  I've had the opportunity to do one of the transports in which we carried 31 dogs to New Hampshire.  When we got there, the receiving shelter only had 3-4 dogs up for adoption.  They had adopters who were already approved and were waiting on our dogs to get there and be placed up for adoption.  Within a week and a half, all of them found their new homes.  If it were not for this program and the generous donors and volunteers, many dogs would not find a home of their own.  I am proud to be associated with Shelby Humane Society and look forward to many more years with them.  The communities in which they serve depend on them.

I do not know how they provide such quality services and programs with the resources available to them. The staff at SHS is wonderful and they do a great job of recognizing the volunteers and people who adopt from the shelter. The volunteer appreciation dinner really makes the volunteers feel like we are making an impact and provides an opportunity for us to come together and get to know one another. SHS also encourages adoptive parents of shelter pets to give updates on their new family member through the Happy Tails forum.   SHS is doing so many good things that I could go on and on, but I will wrap it up by saying that I am proud to be associated with Shelby Humane Society and I look forward to volunteering with them for years to come.

Humane Society Of Shelby County	88975	1	/users/profile/100701	auburngirl	General Member of the Public	1	05/20/2011	This organization was involved in transporting dogs out of the state of alabama after the tornadoes of April 2011.  Shelby Humane has repeatedly stated that they were pre-storm dogs, yet in some media reports they were called "Tornado Dogs."  We have asked repeatedly for pictures and intake data on the dogs to make sure that no family pets were transported, and they refuse to comply.  Per their 990 they received govt. funding and per the Sunshine laws of Ala. they should respond to a FOIA request and they will not.  Most of all, there are people who are traumatized by the tornadoes, and by refusing to provide something so simple as pictures, they further traumatize individuals who can't find their dogs.   This has made the citizens question their actions even more.  Our family has requested that no donations be given to this organization based on their behavior.

Autism Spectrum Counseling Center	199528	1	/users/profile/260479	gerri.a.taylor	Board Member	5	05/02/2014	My name is Gerri Taylor. This organization started with the help of three professionals (and personal friends) that are as dedicated as I am to serving individuals with needs in our communities.  My son was diagnosed with Autistic Disorder at age 27 months in 2002.  In 2010, I was diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome. In April 2011, I resigned my position as the Children's Mental Health Counselor - Bullock Co. at East Central Mental Health to begin the process of creating an organization for the ASD community, in the river-region of central Alabama. The Autism Spectrum Counseling Center, Incorporated was founded on August 31, 2011. On May 17, 2012, our organization was approved by the IRS as a 501 (c) (3) tax-exempt public charity.

Downtown Jimmie Hale Mission	82661	1	/users/profile/91293	Mark	Client Served	5	03/20/2011	Alcoholism had taken my job in Graphic design and nearly every relationship in my life. While my father and sisters never gave up on me, their hope was greatly diminished after ten years of abuse and refusal to seek any help. After being revived in the back of an ambulance in 1999, I was convinced that I needed help and was accepted in the program at the Jimmie Hale Mission. The instructors were able to restore my relationship with God by helping me reevaluate who I am and what my life could become. They helped to breath hope back into my life. This new understanding moved me to reassemble my priorities and become a teacher. I am so very grateful  to the individuals who introduced me to Jimmie Hale Mission and I am forever grateful to the master craftsman, my Savior, Jesus Christ. Thank you Jimmie Hale Mission for the opportunity to live again. Mark Silvers

If it wasn't for them, I would likely have been on the street and vulnerable to all the elements, including the criminal element. As it turned out, though, JD threw me a life line, so to speak, and didn't let go until we were reeled into safety.I can never forget that - or you, the donors and contributors, because you folks are the ones who make rescue possible.Today, I help these guys do similar things for other veterans who need help.But all I can do is "manage" - manage that which our loyal donors and contributors actually make possible. Thanks to everyone from the bottom of my heart. Even if I couldn't do a single thing for Three Hots and A Cot, I'm a loyal fan to the end. Thanks again everybody!

I've gotten my women's group at church and my co workers to collect items for the houses they are re building for homeless veterans - we all know how expensive keeping up households so think about 10 homes! They also assist with counseling, job training, addiction help, and so much more.

Forgotten Felines Inc	120131	1	/users/profile/163357	Christine37	Client Served	5	08/07/2012	This rescue is wonderful. I adopted my kitty form Leslie all her kitties and kittens at her rescue were well taken care of and happy. I found it hard to choose since all were very adoptable. I did adopt a male kitten now named "Sebastian". He has become a very important part of our household. I would recommend this organization to anyone willing to adopt a rescue. It is rewarding and Leslie will help you find the perfect kitty. Sincerely, Christine
Forgotten Felines Inc	87677	7	/users/profile/98415	Sonya G.	General Member of the Public	1	04/27/2011	I just want to throw my two cents in about Leslie and Forgotten Felines I called her on Sunday to express my interest in adopting 2 kittens, preferably siblings. She put me through the inquisition others have described  where do you live, do you smoke, are you employed, how old are you (apparently early 20s didnt suffice, so she pushed on like, 23, or what?), will they be outside, etc. Some questions I felt were important, but others just seemed nosy and irrelevant. Her tone through the entire time was condescending, like she was only doing me a favor by considering my adoptive status, and that favor isnt a two-way street. I was rather rubbed the wrong way by her, however, she described two kittens which I had seen on the website, who were adorable and completely fit my profile. She said they were getting fixed that day, and if the surgeries went well, shed call me back to schedule a meet and greet. Fast forward to today, Wednesday. I hadnt heard back from her, so I decided to initiate the call. When she returned my call, it was to the tone of Ohhh, so-and-so never called you? Weve already adopted one of them out sorry, and she started to hang up on me. When I pushed that I was disappointed (to say the LEAST!) and could she put me on a waiting list, I was met with another no, were too busy line and promptly hung up on. I get that this program is entirely volunteer run, but the least they could do is keep a proper queuing system for when people have expressed interest in certain cats. I felt I should have had previous claim (especially due to my interest in adopting TWO, not one) to these little darlings, but due to her lack of organization, I am left disappointed and without feline companion in my life.
Forgotten Felines Inc	87113	6	/users/profile/97700	Alecia B.	General Member of the Public	1	04/25/2011	I called this organization because we wanted to add a kitten to our family.  We currently have a wonderful, happy, healthy 3 1/2 cat that we have had since he was 8 weeks old.  We got him in Hawaii and brought him with us when we moved to Seattle, because we never leave animals behind.  When we moved to Seattle we erected a 288 Cu. Ft. covered cat run in the backyard since our kitty had previously been secured in our yard in Hawaii.  When I told Leslie about our wonderful cat run she was appalled and kept repeating "I have never heard of a cat run that was not attached to the house." I explained that our kitty was an outdoor cat in Hawaii and really loved his outdoor time here when we are at work.  She simply could not wrap her head around it.  So I decided to plainly ask if she would adopt a kitten to us since our inadequate cat run seemed to bother her.  She began to rant about how cats should be a part of the family, and that we clearly were not fit, and so on.  Before I would get a word in edgewise she raised her voice to that sickly sweet tone and said "no I don't think I will be adopting to you, good-bye" and promptly hung up the phone. I am disgusted by this behavior and am greatly concerned about the unprofessional  behavior of this companies matriarch.  I would urge you to seek out other kitten and cat rescues!
Forgotten Felines Inc	86063	3	/users/profile/96207	egrace	General Member of the Public	1	04/17/2011	Very concerned about this organization.  It doesn't seem to be a legitimate business or non-profit with proper licenses with the state of Washington.  I would have never checked had it not been for a terribly rude experience with the woman who runs the organization.  Any time someone is that rude one has to wonder just what else is going on! I'm happy when someone takes the time to "do some good", but there are laws and regulations in the state that govern organizations.  When anyone fails to follow them, we all suffer.
Forgotten Felines Inc	58720	2	/users/profile/62754	Barnacles	Client Served	4	12/12/2010	My wife and I adopted two kittens from Leslie in September 2009.  Yes, Leslie does ask a lot of questions, but all of them were related to the well being and care of the kittens once they were ours.  The issue here is feline responsibility and in my opinion, that's Leslie's only concern.  She is responsible for the disposition of her kitten herd and I believe she is effectively executing that obligation. Maybe she is too direct with her inquiries and concerns, but she isn't rude, despotic or distempered.  Her candor is refreshing and honest, and far more appreciated than this new age manmy-pamby Seattle political correctness that is unfortunately expected from everyone in every conversation - jeez, give me a break.  
Forgotten Felines Inc	34767	4	/users/profile/35627	vicki2	General Member of the Public	1	04/06/2010	Leslie is very and abrupt.   She has a very narrow set of rules and if you don't fall within them, no cat for you.  She would prefer the cat remain locked in a cage in her home, than give it to someone who has ever in their lifetime loved a cat in a way that does not meet with her approval. She first asked how many hours a day the cat would be allowed out. I honestly had not planned to let the cat out but based on her question, I assumed this particular cat needed some outside time. I told her that it could only go out if we are home and able to accompany it. That was the first wrong answer; but after that, I don't think it would matter what I said, or that my last cat lived with me 18 years and was very loved and protected, she was not giving me one of her cats.  The cats are kept at her home, and pictures on the internet show some of them in cages. My definition of cruelty includes housing timid cats with a lot of other cats, and keeping them in cages. Or having so many cats you can not possibly give any one of them the attention they need.  Her tone and comments were very upsetting, though I felt a little better when I Googled Forgotten Felines and found a number of people had reported similar experiences.   There are lots of other pet adoption organizations that are much better to deal with, and I encourage you to seek them out.  It makes me sad that the cats at Forgotten Felines are missing out on some wonderful homes, and instead will continue to be housed in an overcrowded environment or in a cage, because perfectly good homes are being rejected.

She did not even hear my situation and just assumed that we would give the cat away after a year.  I have worked for numerous humane societies and have volunteered so I knew how amazing it is to adopt an animal.

Forgotten Felines Inc	10033	3	/users/profile/11891	nancyd	Client Served	5	09/08/2009	This group does incredible work with homeless cats.  They work tirelessly to feed and/or capture, foster, spay/neuter and place them in loving homes. Injured or disabled animals receive the care required for them to lead happy, healthy lives.  I didn't realize there was such a vast number of these discarded innocent creatures in our community until a young homeless cat gave birth to her kittens in my yard a year ago. Forgotten Felines safely captured them and provided low cost vet services to allow them to become treasured members of our family rather than leaving them to endure a miserable life spent merely attempting to survive. Since then I have been amazed at how this dedicated group of volunteers rescue so many of society's most innocent victims.

This company is deceitful, dishonest and do not spend the money on the client.  I feel sorry for the consumers in their care, it is clear to see that the upper management does not care about their wellbeing - instead of providing cars to transport consumers, they provide cars for themselves - just check out the parking lot any day of the week and then do a drive at the homes where the clients live.  It is easy enough to clearly see the misapproraition of funds.

Their residential care CANNOT BE BEAT.  My sister had a stroke while living in an Ability Plus apartment.  Thanks to alert staff, they caught her problem early & got her to the hospital in time.  They were a huge source of security for our family during her long hospital stay & rehabilitation.  Ability Plus staff at all levels visited her several times a week and were responsive to our needs.  They were advocates in helping us find & good care, educating the rehab center on my sister's special needs, etc.  The Ability Plus nursing staff even found & corrected issues with her medical care that the hospital staff had overlooked.  In at least one case, and possibly more, my sister may have DIED without their careful attention to her needs.   Not only were they helping OUR family out.  At one point, they had five clients in the same hospital, and they showed the same care & concern for all of them.   I would STRONGLY ADVISE  families who are considering placement of a loved one in residential housing to consider this important question:  Can you truly count on the staff of the facility to BE THERE and to CARE for your loved one, in the event they get sick or are injured?  With Ability Plus, I KNOW I can rest easy.   They care for my sister as well as I would.  Their Day Hab Program is first-class all the way.  It's more like a place of learning than most other day programs I have seen, including the ARC's Opportunity Center.   They truly do develop learning programs for the INDIVIDUAL client,  rather than just "baby sitting" them in one big room.  My sister loves it there.  Having good care for HER makes MY life sooo much easier!    A++++! Can't recommend highly enough.

Dream Acres Equine Sanctuary	302095	1	/users/profile/393213	horsingaround	Volunteer	5	08/31/2016	Within the past year, financial difficulties resulted in my family having to sell our horses before we could no longer afford them. After falling on even harder financial times, I knew I needed an outlet, a place to be around horses once more. After searching for nearby horse rescues, I found Dream Acres Equine Sanctuary, called Ariana, and went out to volunteer the first Saturday I could.While I knew I would fall in love with the horses and I knew that it was a horse haven, what I didn't expect was to find my second family, and my own haven. By my second time out there, I already felt like family and, whenever I drive out every foot I get closer during my 20 minute commute, takes away my stress until I am drained of my issues and completely happy and ready to help. Because I grew up around horses, culminating in about 11 years of being around them, I knew they would relieve my stress, but I didn't know that the people would do that as well. Not only can I not thank Ariana and all the volunteers, and the horses out there enough for helping me (whether they realize it or not), but to try to explain how much everyone out there truly loves and adores and cares for all the animals would take up more than just the space of a review. Ariana gives the rescue and the horses her all. Because I volunteer at the rescue, I can attest to the amount of work, dedication, and, most of all, LOVE that she, and everyone out there, pours into the horses and into assuring that they and the property are maintained well and are healthy. ALL of the proceeds go the horses, which in this day and age is not as common as it should be. It's truly amazing and inspiring how Dream Acres Equine Sanctuary is able to turn starved creatures into majestic, kind, and loving horses and companions. The horses that come in, find more than a home, they find their dream acres, their tales are those of the phoenix, being reborn again. And if that sound too poetic to be true, it's because you haven't felt their magic yet!I love Dream Acres Equine Sanctuary, all the people, all the horses, and all the animals. They are truly wonderful and I really do feel that I am changing the world by being out there, the rescue is certainly changing MY world.I can't recommend them enough!If you can donate, volunteer, sponsor, adopt, or share their message, DO IT! They're awesome!
Dream Acres Equine Sanctuary	288726	1	/users/profile/378922	southernbells	Client Served	5	05/05/2016	I had a wonderful experience with Dream Acres Equine Sanctuary. We met Ariana and several adoptable horses at a event a few weeks ago. Ariana took the time to answer  all the questions my husband and I had about Dream Acres as well as the horses that were available for adoption. Personally, I liked the picture album of all of the horses that she has rescued. Over 50 in 6 months! After much consideration, I decided on the horse I liked and Ariana set me up with what she calls a "Meet and Greet". I got to spend as much time as I liked with the horse I was interested in. She really does look to make matches with equines and humans. She even came out to my property to see where my new horse would be living. After several days of waiting to get our adoption form approved, we were thrilled to find out that we would be the new owners of a amazing horse. I am so happy to have this new addition to my family.Dream Acres  delivered our shiny beautiful horse with complimentary  halter, lead and 2 bags of grain. This organization is the best!!
Dream Acres Equine Sanctuary	277264	3	/users/profile/367057	Writer	Volunteer	5	01/20/2016	Hello,I just have to tell everyone how amazing Dream Acres Equine Sanctuary is. I currently live in Mobile Alabama and had no idea there was a horse rescue here. The rescue was on the news one night and I was overjoyed to help them. I went to the website and contacted Arianna to see if they needed a foster home for any of their horses. I was in luck. She had me fill out a foster agreement, called my references, checked the potential property and by the next week I had 2 wonderful horses roaming around the pasture.Dream Acres has a very good foster network-system and they always make sure that I have everything I need. Arianna checks in weekly and comes by every couple weeks to take pictures of the horses, talk to me about their progress and even help out with various tasks.I have been halter breaking these sweet horses and I am going to be sad when they are adopted. That being said, I will be requesting new horses to train and it is very fulfilling to be a part of helping these wonderful creatures.Mystery Foster

Arianna truly loves what she does and is fully committed to making sure every horse in her care is treated with kindness and love. Dream Acres rescues many different breeds from kill lots on the East Coast. If you love horses and are ever looking to adopt, I suggest you look at the website. Dreamacres.org   
Dream Acres Equine Sanctuary	272439	2	/users/profile/361488	horselover2015	Volunteer	5	11/19/2015	I first volunteered with Dream Acres Equine Sanctuary in 2014 when I lived in the Mobile, AL area. I saw first-hand the quality way the horses were cared for. There are few options for unwanted or abused horses in that area, and Dream Acres helps so many. I now live in Alaska, but continue to support the farm financially because I believe in the work Arianna and the volunteers are doing. it's a worthwhile organization doing a great deal to help horses in difficult situations. We need Dream Acres Equine  Sanctuary.

I gave money, donated goods to the thrift shop, helped transport food, shopped at the thrift shop before going to any others, recommended this charity to my friends. Recently, unfortunately, the attitudes have changed. My friends feel unacknowledged when donating... the women who live there act as though they own the downtown streets, the thrift store staff is as bad as Wal-Mart on a really bad day... arrogance and entitlement have replaced the humble and grateful attitudes we had so admired in the staff and clients/residents. If the attitudes I and others have seen recently are Christian attitudes, then I am sorry to say that the saduccees would be proud. I am praying that this no-longer-Christian agency can find its way back.

It is a wonderful place for people to come to for help with an alcohol or drug problem. I have seen thousands of people helped and change for the better with God's help! Besides also feeding the homeless daily and ccoking over 18,000 meals a year, they train the people they help to give back to the community by going to schools and drug infested neighborhoods to reach the children and youth and give their testimonies. In other words, drug prevention is better than the cure, but Wings is involved with both. I am so glad that God let me be involved at Wings of Life!

I came to the Wings in November 2006, broken, hurt, hopeless, and lifeless.  When I came here I had no idea that I was going to be introduced to a relationship with Jesus Christ my Lord and Savior.  I grew up in church as a child but never really knew of a relationship with Jesus I was bound by religious activities.  I was able to go through the 90 day program, Bible School, and the Ministry Program here at the Wings of Life.  Since being here at the Wings of Life I have also been able to travel around the world to Guatemala, Costa Rica, and Africa on mission trips to serve other people and show them the love of Jesus Christ.  After traveling to these few countries I have been able to be part of the outreach ministry here at the Wings of Life who goes into the streets of Mobile preaching and teaching others about the power of God to change a life.

Lunches for Learning	133069		/users/profile/178767	Laura90	Donor	5	11/03/2012	My church began supporting a school through this program several years ago.  The money we send buys local food, which is prepared for the students by mothers in the community.  For some children, the meal we provide is the only meal they get all day.  By feeding the children at school, we help them to complete a 6th grade education.  In this part of the world, that much education will qualify them for apprenticeship programs and a route out of poverty.  Without that education, they are only qualified for manual labor in the fields.  Lunches for Learning is not only feeding children, but it is helping to break the cycle of poverty.
Lunches for Learning	130680		/users/profile/176172	Peter A. Land	Board Member	5	10/29/2012	In my travels to 50 different countries, I have never seen any program as efficient, effective, and impactful as Lunches for Learning on the lives of young children living in poverty.  Lunches for Learning not only enables young children to complete their education, but encourages them to do so.  Completing their education will positively affect them and future generations to come.  
Lunches for Learning	130662		/users/profile/176144	Ronald6	Volunteer	5	10/29/2012	The mission of L4L is to provide a nutritious lunch to elementary studenta at their school; thereby, giving the child an opportynity is stay in school.  If the child stays in school, he/she will enter the work force as a literate individual.The L4L Program works.  In 2005, there were 16 students in first grade and 4 students in 6th grade.  Six years later we graduated 15 of the original 16 1st graders.
Lunches for Learning	130348		/users/profile/175819	Kristi3	Board Member	5	10/28/2012	As a founding member of Lunches for Learning, I have been blessed many times over since I began working with the organization.  We started several years ago with our first lunches at the Andrea Gonzalez Elementary School feeding just over 80 kids and today, we feed in excess of 1,400 kids. Support for L4L comes from individual donors and school sponsors to companies and corporations in addition to community and faith-based organizations.  After we fed our first lunches, I never really imagined or expected to expand beyond our first school, but with faithful financial supporters combined with the disciplined, committed leadership and oversight by the L4L Board and (and let's not forget some faith) L4L is prepared to feed many more hungry children in rural Honduras to help break the cycle of poverty.  After looking into the eyes of child after child during my travels in Honduras, I am forever changed.  Simply put, this is my opportunity to give back a portion of which I have been so wonderfully blessed.  I know this organization from the inside out and I can think of no better place to lend my time, talents and financial resources.
Lunches for Learning	130287		/users/profile/175758	Randy J.	Board Member	5	10/27/2012	You won't find a more efficient organization that feeds children.  96% of all donations go directly toward feeding the children of Valle Province in Honduras.  This program is transforming communities and will in the end transform the Valle Province.  I have been to see the program and the parents and children are so thankful for L4L's support.  L4L is making a huge difference in one of the poorest places in the world.  
Lunches for Learning	84114		/users/profile/93257	jimwirshing	Donor	5	03/30/2011	Started in my church, and serving only 82 studens in one Honduran village, Lunches for Learning (L4L) has grown to a regionally-supported charity that serves over a thousand students in a dozen villages.  This organization maximizes the return on our investment in several ways: (1) administrative/overhead expenses below 10% of income insure that our donations work at the heart of the need, not subsidizing an advertising budget, (2) requiring village families to participate in daily meal preparation for the students helps to develop that community's involvement and internal solidarity, (3) keeping Honduran children in school through the sixth grade is proven to significantly increase their lifelong employability and personal success. I have seen regular updates of the progress and impact that this program has, and it is powerful.  Villages throughout the Valle District are pleading for the opportunity to be served by it.  The only current limitaton is L4L's ability to assure sustainable funding levels (they don't want to get a village started, then drop them due to inadequate funds).

I am always amazed at the demeanor of the men; even though they may be at a troubled place in their lives, they are always so friendly and appreciative of the meals we provide, they are very willing to help out. Each person that comes through the food line thanks us for our support and that just makes it all worthwhile for me.  The Shelter is very well run by staff and rules are strictly enforced which I think helps the men understand respect is always important, no matter the circumstances.  Besides two hot meals a day and a warm place to sleep and shower, the Shelter also offers meetings of AA which helps provide a support network for those battling this disease.

I never hear them talk about themselves but rather how they can provide more and improve the lives of the people they serve in Fight 4 Life. This ministry truly is about helping not just the youth but the families as well. Having a non-profit and having served on two different non-profit boards, I could not endorse them more. This ministry needs our support, and I am confident that every contribution is used to create success stories in lives of children, youth, and adults who have not had the opportunities that most of enjoy on a daily basis.

Renaissance Theatre Inc	28795	7	/users/profile/29855	zombie-of-the-stage	Volunteer	5	02/17/2010	There are a number of theatre organizations in the greater Huntsville/north Alabama area, and each has its own strengths. However, no other organization offers the opportunities or rewards that Renaissance Theatre provides. Simply put, few other companies would tackle the edgy, sometimes controversial plays often seen at RT, while at the same time providing "family friendly" and children's performances. It truly is a place with something for everyone, the most daring and exciting place for live theatre in town!
Renaissance Theatre Inc	28684	3	/users/profile/29730	domino61	Volunteer	5	02/17/2010	I have only recently gotten involved in community theatre and it was because of RT. I have been delighted, and often thrilled, by their productions. RT is brave enough to produce contemporary plays and musicals, and savvy enough to mix in just the right type and number of classic plays and musicals to please and entice a broad section of the Huntsvilles population. If you've ever been involved with theatre, you know that everyone is welcome to get involved; RT has something for the youngest to the most experienced. I cannot say enough good things about the positive impact of RT on this community. They set a high standard not often found in community theatre, to continue to operate such an award-winning community theatre, with top-notch productions, talent, sets, direction, music  on very little money. My wish is that every person has the joy of experiencing and loving RT as I have. Every time I walk into the lovely foyer, and into the depths of that stately building, so full of history, I transcend to another place. After seeing each show, I walk out those doors a better person.

From both standpoints. He has made lifelong friends through Renaissance that he will always respect for the experience and opportunities they gave him. I loved the professional yet family closeness of Renaissance. They encouraged everyone to become involved and made us all feel like we are Renaissance.  As a patron, I also enjoyed sitting back and being highly entertained for every performance that I have watched.
Renaissance Theatre Inc	28664	8	/users/profile/29705	mephisto-azul	General Member of the Public	4	02/17/2010	I am a patron of the theatre who has quickly become a friend to most of the major players.  This is a very well-run and energetic bunch of people!  They are serious about their craft and their work without taking themselves too seriously.  I am impressed and amazed that they have taken the facilities at hand, and turned it into a first-class community theatre!
Renaissance Theatre Inc	27089	4	/users/profile/28127	oldriddle	Board Member	5	02/04/2010	The theatre was founded in October of 1998 and I have been involved in keeping the non profit operating since that time acting as Artistic Director.  WE have produced approximately ten productions a year on average since opening.  We also produce "new" works by regional writers along with Broadway hits and musicals.  We are located in a historical old mill building once used as store fronts and a basketball court upstairs, now turned into a theater with dressing rooms and storage.  We lease this space and the rent has not changed since we moved opened.
Oasis Counseling For Women And Children	132821		/users/profile/178494	janejohnson	Volunteer	5	11/02/2012	There is no objective or ethical way to claim that one non-profit "deserves" more funding than another; however, I would like to nominate Oasis for "great non-profits" in an effort to help raise visibility, awareness and funding for the organization.  This is a well-run, well-maintained organziation that meets a very real need in the community - quality mental health services at an affordable price.  Because local meantal health centers have become full/overrun, they have had to limit there services to "seriously mentally ill" patients, leaving many sick people without any affordable options.  Oasis has answered this need in a respectful, professional, and therapetutic way.  Please consider awarding this worthwhile group - so that members of the community can have their mental health needs met, which will allow them, in turn, to become more produtive members of the community!

Oasis provides mental health services for families that fall between the 'gaps' in many, current health insurance program and, as a result, women and children who otherwise could not afford services can get important and often life-sustaining help.   Additionally, the organization is well managed with consistent financial reporting to the board and stakeholders.

It has a tiny budget and a small staff, but The Exchange Center is making a large impact in the area of abuse counseling and prevention in our community. It is positioned to grow beyond Dothan into surrounding counties, and it is exciting to be part of an organization that is driven towards healthy expansion and growth.

Alabama Wildlife Center	123936	2	/users/profile/168700	Christy M.	Donor	4	09/30/2012	For years I have been visiting the Alabama Wildlife Center with my children.  More recently I became involved with helping with auction support for an annual fund raiser that helps complete the mission of the center. Just last week I had the privilege of meeting with Carol Argo, Director.  She gave me a tour of the center and overview of each patient at the center. I was able to spend some time making friends with "Legacy" a beautiful American Kestrel with broken talons.  She went on to explain with broken talons, the bird would have no way to hunt and capture food to sustain his life. The mission of the center is to Rescue, Rehabilitate and Release wildlife back into their natural habitat.  Just the day before my visit,  they released two Great Horned Owls and had another release of ducks scheduled for that evening.  It is a privilege to be a small part of this program.  I understand that it is almost fully supported by volunteers.  They give an unconditional amount of time, love and service.

Alabama Wildlife Center	100503	2	/users/profile/122819	kerjsmit	Volunteer	5	11/10/2011	I've been volunteering at the Alabama Wildlife Center for about two months now. The staff and volunteers are wonderful, generous, dedicated people who care deeply about the work they do. Rescuing, rehabilitating, and releasing 1,600 injured and orphaned wild birds per year is endless--and considering the clientele, thankless--work, but the results are extraordinary. This is a small nonprofit making a huge difference in the lives of wild birds and, by direct extension, in human lives as well. I'm proud to volunteer with this extraordinarily humane, beneficial, and selfless organization.

I am privileged to meet many women who are looking for someone to listen to and care about them. Life changing decisions are made, sometimes a women  will decide to carry her baby who had other thoughts prior to coming in. Some women decide to make a change in their lives and will accept Christ at the center. What could be better than saving babies and bringing women to Christ.

Sav-A-Life Shelby Inc	204036		/users/profile/266062	throughhismercy	Volunteer	5	06/26/2014	Sav-A-Life Shelby is a wonderful opportunity for ministry, meeting the needs of young women who come in and requesting pregnancy tests and sonograms of their precious babies and perhaps needing referrals to other organizations. During a mother's pregnancy, Sav-A-Life Shelby offers opportunities for parenting classes and  camaraderie with other young mothers through their Earn-While-You learn program.  A meal is provided as well as free baby sitting the evenings they attend the program. As mothers attend the classes, they earn "Mommy Bucks" they can spend in the Boutique for items they will need for their babies when they are born, as well as items for small children under 2.  There is clothing, diapers, baby food, layette items as well as items like car seats. My husband and I retired back to Birmingham after 35 years, and I have been a volunteer at Sav-A-Life Shelby for over three years and was a volunteer for a Pregnancy Center in Brandon Florida for many years.  It is such a blessing to be a part of this ministry.  We go to minister to these young women, and we get ministered to. Being a non-profit organization, Sav-A-Life Shelby depends on contributions from individuals, organizations and churches in the Birmingham Area.  If The Lord is leading you to be a partner -- either as a contributor or a volunteer, I encourage you to consider Sav-A-Life Shelby. If you are looking for a place to serve others, Sav-A-Life Shelby is a compassionate and caring ministry.The staff and volunteers are a blessing to clients as well as to one another.
Safehouse Of Shelby County Inc	297793		/users/profile/388605	Writer	Client Served	1	07/23/2016	Worst experience of my life!! Not at all what they claim to do or be. I have experienced and witnessed discrimination, violence, many clients returning to abusive situations or homelessness because of being judged, lack of confidentiality,  treated as if they are a criminal or drug addict, or being forced to go to homeless shelter, or unsafe living conditions, even out on the streets. they don't care. I've witnessed so many things and experienced a bit as well. Someone needs to do something about what's happening there. I myself witnessed and spoke to so many people that lost their children to DHR, without an investigation, because of false allegations or assumptions made by staff.  Empowering my ass!  The staff that actually care are fired or leave because of what's happening. It's a roof over your head  if it's your only option but don't expect much more. Especially not childcare or therapy. Their counselor, case managers and director is a JOKE AND VERY JUDGEMENTAL  and please don't expect CONFIDENTIALITy!! Find an outside source for therapy and healing!! Same with childcare. On the rare occasions u may actually recieve childcare for maybe an hour,to meet with staff,  they won't change your baby and will just let an infant cry and never even pick them up. Most of the time u have to just keep them with you while u handle business and do therapy. Do not expect child care or transportation for you to find a job or get to  work... it won't happen!!!They do not offer services they claim to.

Safehouse Of Shelby County Inc	245388		/users/profile/332474	ersgrady	Donor	5	06/16/2015	It is important that our community has a safe place for survivors of domestic violence and abuse.  I support Safehouse of Shelby County so that women and their children can find a way out of the cycle of abuse and gain the support they need to become self determined.  The staff is highly professional and the agency is governed by a board that shares a passion for the work as well as a strong business sense.   This is not easy work and the challenges are long term.  There are no band aid solutions.  What is expected by nonprofits helping people in difficult situations  are miracles when  in fact it takes wisdom, faith and compassion.  You can find these values at Safehouse.  
Safehouse Of Shelby County Inc	237229	3	/users/profile/321662	Stakeholder	General Member of the Public	1	01/24/2015	This organization is a joke. They tout a variety of services that support victims of domestic and sexual assault for public appeal, but all it really is is a homeless shelter that profits when occupancy rates stay high. Staff turnover rate is sky-high and plagued with unprofessionalism to the point that clients are forced to suffer more than before they came because of staff and organization-induced barriers. If you're a prospective employee, you will either learn to cope with cut-throat teammates who'll throw you under the bus at a moments notice, or develop an illness working here. If you're a victim, it's a roof over your head, but don't expect much else unless you're willing to play games and kiss staff members butts.

It is so comforting to have her included in the typically developing class and her time here has helped her more than I ever imagined it would. We love it here!

I was very favorably impressed. The kids not only showed talent in their performances, but they were also very friendly in meeting and greeting the audience. They also helped run concessions in the lobby before the shows and at intermission, which I imagine helps them realize how much work and dedication it takes to keep the arts afloat.   Because organizations like CDF support and train artists of the next generation, there's a bright future for the local arts in Birmingham.

She has been battling an Autoimmune Disorder called Juveile Idiopathic Arthritis and Uveitis (when it affected her eyes).  This dance is the Firstreal activity she has been involved in and she absolutely Loves it!    For the Past 3 & 1/2 years, she has been taking some pretty strong medicines & IV Treatments, just to slow the progression of the disease and allow her to move, walk, dance & SEE,  just like other children.  Bailey seems to have a smile on her face no matter what she goes through, but nothing can compare to the Smile that she has when she is at Dance Class! The first day of class, I had to hold back my tears as I saw Bailey running & dancing just like the other children!  She had this  Huge smile on her face that just Lit her entire Face up!  What happiness in spite of all the sadness she endures. Her instructor is wonderful!  It amazes me how she teaches the children to move & express themselves through dance!  It is unlike anything I've seen before! We are so Thankful to  the Sponsors!  Without help, we would not be able to afford Bailey this opportunity.  Her medical bills are very high, so this activity would not be possible without the  sponsors.  To give a child like Bailey who suffers daily  the opportunity  to Move & stretch her joints in a fun creative way & not just her Physical therapy stretching, is  wonderful.   We walk,donate,volunteer & speakout whenever we can for organizations that support & are looking for a cure for this horrible disease, so I know that raising funds can be difficult.

Every local United Methodist church has an Advocate who works in conjunction with the staff to assist in fundraising and other activities. I maintain frequent communication with the administrative staff.  I arrange visits to the local group homes in the area for members of my church. I plan the details of the annual White Christmas offering so that my church can be an active participant in this event. I have met children who are served by the Children's Home in a group home setting and coordinated activities to help the children in that home. The staff always supports and encourages my role as Advocate, while maintaining continuous, positive communication with me.The staff awarded my rural, small church with a certificate for being one of the top ten local church contributors to the Children's Home during the annual White Christmas offering. I was so inspired by the mission of the Children's Home that I continued in my father's legacy of being the local church Advocate for my church.
Diamond Federated Club Inc	274142	2	/users/profile/363506	ContinuedSuccess	Professional with expertise in this field	5	12/10/2015	Diamond Federated was a great experience for my daughter. I worked such as the previous parent mentioned to ensure this be a wonderful opportunity for my daughter. Every time I called to ask a question, my telephone calls were answered. I sat through the meetings and rehearsals. Sometimes our daughters do not communicate things in an effective manner and we choose to think that the organization is unorganized. If I had not asked the proper questions or been attentive to my daughter's needs, I would have thought such; however, this is a learning process for our daughters. I worked tirelessly to assist my daughter with raising funds. Diamond Federated Club Inc., is the ONLY nonprofit organization that I am aware of that offers "EACH" young lady a scholarship based on the required criteria. As a struggling single parent, I think  Diamond Federated Club, Inc., provides a wonderful experience in giving back to the young ladies with assisting them with dresses. Most dresses run between $199 and $1200 and for someone to DONATE a dress to use is wonderful. Each young lady is paired with a mentor. I know personally other parents who have participated with other nonprofit organizations, which I "choose" not to name, indicated that they were unorganized as well. Thank you.
Diamond Federated Club Inc	259051	4	/users/profile/347578	choosetobehappy	Client Served	4	09/23/2015	I also had a daughter who participated in this program. The previous comments were probably from parents who didn't respond to a phone call, email or text message and were not involved to actually see what goes on. As an involved parent, I attended ALL meetings and worked to assist my daughter in every aspect of the program. I attended the workshops to see what was going on. You should not leave it up to any organization for your daughters development. During the program there were at least 3 or 4 parents who never attended anything. There were 3 debutantes who didn't meet the necessary requirements to receive a scholarship but I personally witnessed members of the club sell ads to ensure that EVERY girl received a scholarship even if it was a book scholarship. Every girl had a dress even if members personally purchased dresses or borrowed dresses from former debutantes. A few questions for the writers of the previous comments... If your daughter didn't receive a scholarship did she submit an acceptance letter to a college or university with your daughters student number included? Did you attend the parent meeting(s) where you were told up front what the requirements were? I was not in a program with a members daughter but should their daughters be deprived of participation, scholarship or the same opportunity presented to your daughter? IF they work hard, participate and sell ads should they not be allowed to win? Did you do your part to make your daughter's experience a positive one? If you weren't satisfied with the program or the organization, why did you allow your daughter to complete the program? Did you contact a member of the organization to voice your complaints or did you post your nasty comments on the web?  We as parents need to assume some responsibility. Take a look at yourself mother! That's all I'm saying.

I think some of the ladies are nice but the group overall is a total wreck! My daughter was in the group as well with a member's daugther and yep, the member's daugther won. I think it's a conflict of interest but who do you report it to. I agree with the last review, if you are looking for your daugther to be apart of a Debutante group DO NOT choose this one. If I could rate them a zero, I would.
Diamond Federated Club Inc	206527	1	/users/profile/268967	ElegantGrace	Client Served	1	07/18/2014	If you have received an invite or thinking about allowing your daughter to be a part of this group for a Debutante PLEASE reconsider. This group is VERY unorganized and unfair. It practically a joke. The only thing positive is that your daughter may receive a scholarship depending on how much she sells in ads. Yes, I said MAY because we haven't received anything as of yet. They don't communicate well and they say they want to teach these young ladies about poise and integrity, HA! The ladies that enter the competition with graceful talents were overlooked and the ones that dropped it like it hot won. They allow the members of the club to enter their daughter(which is a conflict of interest) and just so happens they ALWAYS win. If you are looking for a nice, respectable, well put together club for your daughter to participate and be treated fairly please seek The Imperial Club or the AKA's, or Delta's. Please keep it moving passed this mess of an unprofitable organization.
SNAP Spay/Neuter Action Project	303734		/users/profile/394905	bashton	Volunteer	5	09/12/2016	I worked for a group that did rescue only; I found it very rewarding and important.  But after 5 years, I realized that doing only rescue did not seem to reduce the number of homeless animals that kept coming in.  I left and joined SNAP after doing research on how effective a large scale S/N program is in reducing the number of homeless animals.  SNAP puts the animals first, and strives to help as many people who want to spay or neuter their own animal or a stray.  I see the reduction in intake numbers at local shelters due to the S/Ns.

I am a 100 percent disabled veteran and was asking for help that I extremely needed and was completely denied by the Lt Col and embarrassed.    He had the nerve to email me and say "I cant see how you cant make ends meet, as a 100 percent disabled vet you should be making 3000 a month.  Needless to say he did not help out my family.  With that 3000 a month I have to take care of my family, pay my mortgage, along with any other bills, and pay for all of my families and my own medical bills.  Thank you Lt Col  Doane.  If you cant help a completely disabled OIF OEF veteran Purple Heart Recipient and his family when they are in need, I'm curious what your Foundation actually spends its money on.  
Wounded Warrior Family Foundation	188175	4	/users/profile/245451	Jobelle C.	Client Served	1	11/08/2013	I met Lt. Col. Doane at the Maxwell BX and he told me about his program.  I told him that I was a disabled veteran and that I served prior to 9/11 and he approved my application to make my kitchen handicap accessible.  He sent an out of work math teacher and the teachers girlfriend to my home to work on the kitchen sink.  The math teacher removed the kitchen sink plumbing, pipes, electric wiring (left hot and exposed) from the sink disposal and pulled apart my cabinets.  This was in June, 2012.  Something went very wrong and the couple left, with $100 cash of my money for supplies, which were returned to the math teacher, I have pictures of what I returned.  It is now November 8, 2013 and I still don't have a working kitchen sink, cabinets or electrics.  I attempted many times to get this problem resolved but to date is has not been.  My last communication from Lt. Col. Doane was that I was never really supposed to have been helped by his program.  To say I am a client served is an understatement.  I now not only have to take showers in the backyard with a hose, because my wheelchair no longer fits in my bathroom, but I also have to wash dishes on the patio, too.  I have a microwave oven and an extension cord for the fridge.  Being a disabled veteran really has hit an all time low.

Ludwig Von Mises Institute For Austrian Economics Inc	112388		/users/profile/152954	Centinel	Professional with expertise in this field	1	05/18/2012	Beware:  The Institute is a hotbed of anarchist dogma.  Specifically, the majority of the faculty and administrators are anarchists whose 'end game' is the destruction and dismantling of American civil and political society.    Moreover, they have demonstrated intellectual dishonesty by not openly declaring their rejection of our Constitutional Federal Republic, preferring instead to undermine American institutions and traditions in a nuanced and indirect manner.  For example, some anarchists at Mises.org paradoxically and disengeniously act as advocates for the Constitution when in fact they reject all government as coercive and dangerous. All patriotic and loyal Americans who believe in the vision offered by our founding fathers (all who categorically rejected anarchism) should not support this organization under its present leadership.

As patients come to Birmingham to get treated, their families have real needs for emotional and financial support. I have seen many families that aTeam has been able to help, by giving them a place to stay in the apartment, by providing meals for families in the hospital, and by praying continuously for patients. aTeam also has been able to provide financial assistance to families with great needs, offer them opportunities to attend football games and participate in fun activities take a break from their cancer worries, and has been very active in childhood cancer awareness.

The quality of vetting and medical paperwork for each dog far surpasses any other rescue we have worked with in the US.  The volunteers put their whole hearts into the well being of each animal.

Angels Arms Animal Rescue And Transportation Services	147826		/users/profile/195594	Good Cause	Volunteer	5	01/08/2013	My families experience volunteering with Angels' Arms to distribute donated food to local shelters in Mobile, AL and the surrounding areas has been very rewarding. We have volunteered with Angels' Arms over a dozen times in the last year including supporting efforts to save animals from abandoned shelters with animals living in  very poor conditions, to loading and unloading tens of thousands of pounds of donated food in support of local shelters, to helping place animals in need of a good home. Being able to see the difference the organization has made through its efforts first hand is what keeps us coming back. Because of the altruistic nature of the cause and the Angels' Arms organization I never hesitate to solicit additional help from co workers and friends.  Because of Angels' Arms hard work and unfailing commitment to the cause, hundreds of dogs and cats in shelters in Mobile, AL and surrounding areas have benefited and continue to benefit daily. Not to mention the burden that their efforts lessen on the shelters who are also working very hard to provide for these animals until they can find them a new home and someone to love them. Angels' Arms efforts to save, feed, provide spay and neuter services and place homeless animals are among the most noble and the organization deserve all the help it can muster. 
Angels Arms Animal Rescue And Transportation Services	147750		/users/profile/195486	s.shepard	Board Member	5	01/07/2013	My name is Sandy Shepard and I have been with this AWESOME all volunteer animal welfare group for the last two and a half years.  I started as a volunteer and six months later became a board member. Our group started out rescuing animals from our local high kill shelters.  We also transported animals on their way to their forever homes, through OTRA (On The Road Again).  Our President is an OTRA verified transporter. During 2011 our group took a look at the resources we had and resources we did not have (a facility to board animals) and tried to figure how we could help a larger number of animals in need with the finances we had.   Rescuing was hard to give up, but we have found that we have helped so many more animals and groups by doing our programs below then what we were able to do when we were faced with large expenses for boarding that absorbed the majority of our financial resources. We also tried to figure out what ways we could educate the public on the local euthanasia statistics and we tried to figure out how we could help other local rescue groups and animal shelters with large needs that they face. The first project we accomplished was our community awareness project.  You can view video of this project on You Tube under Angels' Arms Mobile, Al Community Awareness Project.   You can also find a link on our website www.angelsarms4paws.org.  For this project we made wooden crosses out of discarded pallets from local businesses.  We made and displayed one wooden cross representing each animals that was euthanized in three of our four local animal shelters.  (We were unable to get the statistics on the forth shelter.)  In total we made 8,450 crosses, one cross for each animal euthanized in 2010 in Mobile County, AL.  The crosses stood in a field on the side of a major highway in Mobile County, AL from October 2011 through December 2011.  Signs were posted stating what these crosses represented and to please spay/neuter, please adopt not buy and please volunteer with local shelters and rescue groups.   The second project that we started was in November 2011 we started our very first pet food distribution program called - FOOD TO THE RESCUES - that is done in cooperation with Rescue Bank (find them at www.rescuebank.org) and with major pet food manufacturers.  In our first year we were blessed to be able to distribute over 117,000 lbs of pet food and treats to locally approved animal shelters and rescue groups at a dramatically discounted price. This program resulted in so many great things for local animals in need and the families that care for them.  FOOD TO THE RESCUES went well beyond just being a pet food feeding program.  Groups that participate with us achieved so much more for the animals in their care and local community members in need.  One group said they spayed/neutered over 50 more animals free of charge for local families that would have not been able to pay for the surgeries themselves.  This program helped with needed high cost surgeries that included a leg amputation, ear amputation, eye surgery and so much more.  For one group they were able to pay for the supplies and labor to be able to put 20 roofs on outdoor kennels.  One of our local shelters implemented a vaccination program for each animal that enters their shelter.  So far over 7,000 animals have been able to receive vaccinations and they said that without the pet food distribution program they would have not been able to have this program available for the animals that come under their care.  The same shelter was called in on a equine (horse) incident and the horse was able to receive treatment from a local veterinarian that was needed for the horse.  The shelter stated that without the savings from the food program they would not have had the money to treat the horse.  A family in need that own two pit bulls were able through the help of one of our groups to have an enclosure put up and shelter access given for the two dogs.  Plus the group was able to spay and neuter the two dogs.  The group said that the money for the fencing and the spay and neuter were provided with the savings the group had saved from being part of the Food To The Rescues program. We were also able to respond with much needed food to two large scale animal neglect incidents.  We were able to give the lead responding agencies combined over 5,000 lbs. of pet food for the animals involved, free of charge.  The results go on and on.  Each month we are serving (helping feed) over 1,000 animals and we truly feel so blessed to be able to help the animals in need, our local rescue groups and animals shelters.  We started a spay/neuter program - STOP LITTERING - that concentrated on the Bayou LaBatre community of Mobile County, AL.  We fully funded the spaying and neutering of 56 animals in this small community for families that were in need of having their pets spayed and neutered. We also started a transport funding program.  The program - ROAD HOME - is done in cooperation with Save A Stray animal rescue group who pulls the animals from our local high kill shelters, gets them fully vetted, spayed, neutered, microchipped and then Angels' Arms makes the arrangements and pays for them for the dogs to be transported to an adoption guaranteed facility in Dewitt, NY called Helping Hounds.  At Helping Hounds they are cared for and potential adoptive families are looked into to ensure that the placement is loving and long lasting for each dog.  In the Mobile area animal rescue groups have a hard time finding adopters, because of the volume of animals in need in the area.  The transport program has funded the transport of 86 dogs in 2012.  We are proud to be able to help these dogs to find their way to their ROAD HOME. Overall, I LOVE Angels' Arms.  Many years ago I decided that I wanted my life to mean something and did not want to waist my life saying I wish I would have helped more.  I have volunteered and worked for other non profits.  They don't even compare to Angels' Arms.  We are making huge strides in the lives of animals in need in our community.  What we have been able to do for our local rescue groups and shelters and the families in need that they and we serve has been AMAZING in this last year! The money that is donated to Angels' Arms truly goes to the programs we run and in turn really does go to the animals/groups we serve.  We really have very low overhead and we are an ALL VOLUNTEER animal welfare group, so there are NO SALARIES that donations go to, not one. Speaking of our volunteer angels, WOW how awesome are our volunteers!!!!  Anytime we have a last minute need they are there.  We have our own volunteers and we have our shared volunteers.  That means volunteers that are either employees or volunteers from other local animal shelters and rescue groups that believe in what we do and love helping us accomplish the programs at hand.  We LOVE ALL OUR VOLUNTEERS! So, if you are looking to donate please donate to ANGELS' ARMS ANIMAL WELFARE CONNECTION and see how far your donation can go and how many animals we can help with your donation.  Your donation to Angels' Arms helps not only our group, but it will help us make our goal of helping our local animals in need, the other locally approved animal rescue groups, animal shelters, and local communities with the  spaying/neutering of their companion animals come true!
Individual & Family Support Of South Alabama	286933		/users/profile/377005	Jennifer_O2	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	My name is Jenny Oveson, Im 28 years old, and I was born with Spina Bifida.  I wanted to write you to tell you about an organization that has grown to mean so much to me.  As a young child, I watched my father make it his mission in life to better the lives of people with disabilities and our families.  He is achieving this as Director of Family Support.  Family Support, the home of the Individual & Family Support program in south Alabama provides financial assistance for medical, dental, prescriptions, supplies, utilities, food, clothing, housing, holiday gifts, ramps, home modifications/repairs, transportation costs including auto repairs, conference expenses, summer camps, education, respite, recreation, etc.  Also information, moral support and referrals may be provided to help families access other programs of assistance.  Family Support works to enhance the lives of Alabamians with disabilities and their families.  Their success is measured in the number of people they can help with the quality of programs and services they provide.  These programs are fueled by our dedicated staff, caring volunteers, and generous donors.

Unlike most summer programs, there is emphasis on academics.  The program provided reading, math, writing , and computer instruction. My children did not mind the academics because they were equally complimented with diverse enrichment activities such as: bowling, skating, swimming, dance, karate, and a varied array of field trips.

I have seen many summer programs and this one surpassess all of them by providing each child with an exciting and exemplary experience.

North Alabama Wildlife Rehabilitators	259941	2	/users/profile/348474	alabamamisfit	Volunteer	5	09/27/2015	I have been working with this group for 10 years.  During the last two years every penny that is spent is documented.  In the past we, the members, had no control over the Board or the Officers.  As members we were not allowed to elect the officers.  The board, which were the officers decided  on the election of the officers.  When we had a REAL election, it was declared void by the existing president because his mother lost the election. We were never given so much as a spread-sheet explaining where the dues were being spent.  I can however tell you it is a HUGE relief to be rid of some deadwood.  The group is now functioning without dues!  We raised and released 145 wildlife animals last year with only five members.  We are grateful for the support of the community.  The five members work constantly to save and support wildlife.

I refuse to air the dirty laundry on this site.  The only thing I will say is the bills that were not paid by the prior president and board I thank God my husband and I were able to cover for NAWR.  I guess the wildlife does not matter to prior members, I have been a member for 10 years.

Childcare Resources	131967		/users/profile/177567	Bhm volunteer	Volunteer	5	10/31/2012	I have been a volunteer for Childcare Resources for 8 years, always impressed by the passion, commitment and dedication of the staff and the quality of the work they do.  But by far the most powerful moments have been in opportunities to hear clients of the agency tell their stories and the impact of Childcare Resources on their lives.  How modest financial support for daycare tuition  allowed a young single mother to stay in the workforce through the tough early years of her career.  How a caring and knowledgeable staff member worked tirelessly to help another family find appropriate daycare for their disabled child.  How the low-cost training program has created opportunities for harried and underpaid daycare providers to truly up their game.  These stories truly touch my heart and keep me - and numerous other volunteers- involved and engaged.

Childcare Resources	130696		/users/profile/176189	bhammom	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/29/2012	Childcare Resources is a phenomenal non-profit organization in Birmingham, Alabama that provides assistance to families, children and local child care providers.  Childcare Resources has enabled families to continue to stay employed, child care providers have received training and parents have received guidance in finding a quality child care program that meets their family's needs.  I have participated in the resource and referral department for finding a child care program and the child care center where I direct has been a part of the Parents as Teachers program as well as receiving the Resource library van at our program.  The teachers have used the resource books in the classroom, read to the children from the children's books and the children have enjoyed the books on tape.  Childcare Resources is an agency that will change the lives of every person it touches which in turn leads to others lives being changed because of the domino effect.  Change one life and it always changes another.  A truly amazing Agency that will change the lives of many over many generations.

Humane Society Of Elmore County Inc	322465		/users/profile/416298	Kirk6	Client Served	2	01/31/2017	It was disgusting and filthy. the animals were sick in two of the cages and they sold us a puppy knowing he had been exposed to Parvo virus!!!  and the next day after we got him home he had to be rushed to the animal hospital and admitted  , He had kennel cough ,a horrible upper respiratory infection and Parvo virus.   They kept saying when we first picked him up  if he gets sick you can bring him back and exchange him. like he was a item from Walmart or something.  I am convinced they knew he was sick and they also told us make sure you take him to the Vet within the week.  I am outraged at the inhumane way they bring puppies in and do not vaccinate them when they are  around other dogs with potential illnesses and dangerous diseases such as Parvo virus.!!!  and kennel cough.   This place  needs to be shut down and everyone working there fired.  it stinks to high heaven from feces and it is just plain nasty.   Incidently the other dogs in his cage have this disease too and some unsuspecting grieving dog parent will buy him unaware of the terrible condition they are in..

Babywearing International Inc	241204		/users/profile/279989	kellyratliff08	General Member of the Public	1	04/15/2015	If you're looking to make friends with people who wear babies and are into attachment parenting this may be a good place to be.  I was only interested in trying out a few different carriers from the local lending library. I joined a CIncinnati Facebook group and learned that there was a waiting list for carriers and "paying members" get first dibs on borrowing carriers.  After being knocked down the list for over a month waiting for my turn on a Tula I decided to just pay the "dues" and get first dibs.  It's $10 to borrow one without the membership (for this particular chapter.  Each chapter makes their own rules) and I wasn't spending hundreds of dollars on one and risk disliking it so the $30 annual membership "dues", as they called them, was a no-brainer.  At first I was notified when it was my turn for a carrier and met with the same woman several times without issue.  Then the group split into different sub-chapters and I began dealing with another woman.  She was twenty minutes late the first time we met, I had to drive an hour and a half round-trip to drop off the carrier the second time, and then she stood me up the third time.  No joke, I drove 20 minutes, waited for 20 minutes, she messaged me saying I could wait another half hour for her to load her kids (I declined and thanked her), and drove 20 minutes home.  Apparently the rules were always that you had to meet once a month at meetings to pick up and drop off carriers unless the admins were feeling generous, but they were only just recently implemented (their policies are only on their Facebook page and I cannot see them to confirm this).  I don't have time to hang out with my actual friends, let alone time to devote on Saturday mornings to chit chat and trade carriers with people I have nothing in common with otherwise.  I asked for a refund for my membership after I was stood up.  The woman went on a rant about the rules and repeatedly mentioned that she volunteers, doesn't get paid for this, and it's not her entire life.  Listen, I do a lot of volunteer work.  If I didn't have time to commit I wouldn't. I also don't throw my sacrifice up in the air as an excuse to be  a flake.  After my Facebook messenger went off repeatedly for ten minutes while I was driving home from her standing me up I blocked her.  I thought this was a reasonable thing to do after she blew my phone up like that.  Apparently not.  I was then banned from the group, as you can't block an admin and stay on the group.  When I contacted BWI directly I was told that I could borrow from meetings.  How do I know when meetings are held if I can't see the Facebook group?  I was told to unblock the admin if I want the ban lifted.  I won't open the door for someone to behave like a lunatic to use carriers.  So I'm out $30 that they consider a "donation" and nonrefundable.  If they're that hard up for the $30 they can keep it.  It's sketchy and unethical, at best, but I don't really have time to devote to fighting it.  Instead I'll shout from the rooftops NOT to give this group any money because they can (and will) take it and leave you with nothing to show for it.  I simply didn't want to waste my time and gas and then have someone complain when I had a problem with the waste.   If you want to try their carriers or meet do it without giving them money.                                        
Babywearing International Inc	81891		/users/profile/89801	mandywelch	Professional with expertise in this field	4	03/11/2011	I first learned the importance of wearing my babies when I became a mother for the first time. I had a high-needs baby that needed to be held upright, I had a job outside the home and I had a house and husband to take care of. I purchased my first  carrier very early on and wore it often even though it wasn't very easy or comfortable. When the second baby came, I knew there must be something better, but nothing I found worked for us. I was determined to make something work when I had my 3rd child. By then (2004) slings were easy to find on the internet. I read review after review and I was lucky enough to meet someone in person who could help me with a sling! I finally found something that was comfortable, practical, easy and stylish! After I had my 4th child, a local babywearing group was started. I began attending the meetings and learning all I could. I loved babywearing so much that I decided to help teach other caregivers the joys and benefits of wearing your children close.  I've even used my 5th child as a model for the various carriers! This group has grown and spread the love of babywearing all over the world via the internet and all over our locale with meetings and special events.

The job search environment has changed dramatically over the past few years.  Searching the want ads in a local newspaper is no longer an acceptable method to find a job.  Now social media is the best route, and BrokeButNotForLong provides excellent information through its website, blogs, and e-newspaper to help the unemployed traverse the new environment. Its website is loaded with information to help the unemployed maximize their career search, especially veterans and ex-offenders.

Sandra Rogers, of Broke But Not For Long, has been with me through this tough time counseling me and providing chances for temporary employment and information about finding long-term options. Unfortunately, I am still struggling to locate satisfactory employment. I must say, though, it is not due Sandra's lack of effort. She cannot convince employers to hire, nor can she make the grueling process that employers require any shorter. What she can do and what she has done is point me in the direction of the best opportunities that she knows of. For that and her sympathetic ear, I am sincerely grateful.

Alabama Pug Rescue And Adoption Inc	156474		/users/profile/207460	Kym O.	Client Served	5	04/27/2013	Pugs are such adorable, sweet and fabulously snorty little companions!  You'd think nobody would be capable of harming or neglecting them.  Sadly, that's not the case.   Abused and lost pugs are brought in on a daily basis - most of them requiring a daunting amount of medical care, time, and nurturing.  Many folks wouldn't consider a dog worth such an investment.  But if you're an animal lover, you see something different.  You see a wounded angel covered in fur and wrinkles.  An innocent and infinitely forgiving forever friend.  A loyal love worth saving. Enter Alabama Pug Rescue & Adoption (aka "APRA"), where a team of loving foster families are led by one incredibly dedicated woman, Pam Mays.  I first met Pam about two years ago, when a friend on Facebook shared an astonishing "before & after" picture of a pug named, "Ten".  In his before picture, Ten's had an oversized head with bulging, heartbroken eyes.  His body was unnaturally tiny, withered from starvation, devoid of any fur, and covered in blackened mange and open sores.  But his eyes still held the question, "Will you love me?"   Pam answered that question by taking Ten into her own home, and devoting hours every day to saving his life.  They weren't sure if he would even survive, but she was at least going to make sure he had every fighting chance, and that he would be surrounded by a sea of love.  She nursed his body back to health and his spirit back to joy, singing Sinatra to him and cradling him her arms in between her "real" job that pays the bills.   Within just a few months, Ten looked like he'd been a pampered pooch his entire life!  He was entered into a pet rescue contest sponsored by Purina - the prize being something like a year's worth of pet food (a huge blessing to any rescue group).  An APRA volunteer made a video of Ten's before & after pictures and folks from all over the world were inspired to vote for him!  You can still see it on Youtube:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkPI-0V6fLo Today my family and I are the very grateful guardians of this sweet boy.  We couldn't imagine life without our beloved Tenny!  I've been through serious medical issues including carcinoid lung cancer and lobectomy surgery, and Ten has an uncanny ability to know when and where I'm hurting.  He seeks me out and very gently places himself right where I'm hurting.  I have no doubt he knows exactly what he's doing.  He brings healing, peace, companionship and pure joy to our entire family with his daily antics and sweet spirit.  And as wonderful as he is, we hear the same from every other adoptive family who has fallen in love with pugs.  Pugs are truly special!   Supporting APRA means your entire donation is put to very careful use.  This is an entirely volunteer-based, non-profit group.  Donations go to basics like food, medicine, and medical treatment which has been carefully and frugally negotiated with a caring veterinarian.  APRA is often forced to turn away pugs just like Ten...simply because the resources and funds aren't there.  Pugs are taken in every single week, foster homes are overflowing with rescues, and donations are desperately needed for APRA to continue doing this very important work of rescue, adoption, and advocacy.   Heartfelt thanks to Pam and the entire APRA team for this wonderful life work and truly making a difference in this world!  I hope others will be inspired to give generously to this very worthy cause!  xoxo

Birmingham Museum of Art	282272		/users/profile/372367	Writer	Volunteer	5	03/14/2016	Went to the BMA on the evening of 3 March 2016 to attend their regular FIRST THURSDAY event. Great evening: cool jazz music in the cafe, a nice buffet, good crowds but not uncomfortably "packed" and an amazing, expert-driven panel discussion on the "ins-and-outs" of collecting art. Fun time and remarkable learning experience!

This group offers numerous educational opportunities, visits to private collections and artist studios, travel - regional, national and international, and relationship building amongst art lovers. There's always something great going on at the museum, whether through the Collector's Circle or through their public events, and the variety offers something for everyone. 
Warrior Baseball Association Inc	203425		/users/profile/265346	Amk2	General Member of the Public	1	06/21/2014	My family has been majorly mistreated by the president obtains organization. I was verbally assaulted by the president for asking a simple question  about their "rules". I am not sure how leadership like this is even allowed in an organization in which serves children. Very disappointed in the way many situations have been handled by the president without the board members knowledge. Very childish behavior almost like a bunch of high school guys trying to be secretive about who knows what. Very fishy that the by laws are not easily accessible. My husband was "kicked" off of the board for a misinterpretation of rules though other coaches and board members never ever even corrected the interpretation nor have any other coaches ever been punished for a misinterpretation. Also my husband was the so called treasurer and never ever saw one financial anything! What the heck is going on in warrior baseball with this leadership?! As working in youth sports forever it is very sad to see an organization getting such a bad name because if 1 person!! Also why are coaches/umpires/board members not background checked?!! Why is there not a bathroom near the tee ball field?! The kids are going to the bathroom behind a wall in the light of day?!!

There has not been a meeting for members for almost a year. The Board 'tries' to meet once a month, Sadly, this is a closed meeting. No minutes are available, no detailed financial reports  available for over 2 years. Simply a 'report' that states "TOOK IN"  "SPENT".... no detailing on expenditures. I am a 'member' and have been denied each of the above requests. So have many others who are members.

EQUAL JUSTICE INITIATIVE	121750	2	/users/profile/165574	Snowbirds2	Donor	5	08/31/2012	This is an exemplary organization because it is devoted to helping juveniles who are serving very long sentences behind bars~sometimes Life Without Parole, which means that if a young person is convicted of a serious crime, he or she could remain incarcerated for the rest of their natural lives. Bryan Stevenson appeared before the U.S. Supreme Court in March of 2012 hoping to convince the court to overturn mandatory life sentences for juveniles involved in a crime where someone was killed. The court ruled 5-4 that Life Without Parole for this type of crime was unconstitutional. Mr. Stevenson is the executive director of Equal Justice Initiative and the organization reaches out to the poor and to those on death row as well,helping people obtain justice when they cannot do so alone. I have just begun to contribute financially to this organization as I believe our young people need an advocate like Bryan Stevenson.

The day we met them they were in the community handing out hot plates of food and goodie bags to individuals who were homeless or just having a hard time. We watched from a far as they gave this food away. The way they enjoyed their community was awesome they were not rushed or trying to obtain attention. You could tell that they are genuinely loving giving away what they had. After they finished my husband and I  approached them to learn more about them. By the time we finished talking we sign up to volunteer!!  This company goes out every week giving away food and other things like.clothes and hygene products we went with them every chance we got to go and when we could not go we donate clothes and anything else  we can. This group is incredible and we are honored to help.

Exchange Club Center for the Prevention of Child Abuse-Jefferson County AL, Inc.	56729		/users/profile/59404	BrendaJ	Board Member	4	11/11/2010	I have been an Exchange Club member since 1989, but I didn't really know what the Exchange Club Family Skills Center did until I joined the board.  The Family Skills Center is the "Instruction Book" you don't get when you get your bundle of joy at the hospital.  The center can answer all those questions about how to nurture your child and give them the best parenting there is.The classes help protect our most valuable asset, our children.
Exchange Club Center for the Prevention of Child Abuse-Jefferson County AL, Inc.	56523		/users/profile/59056	Karen	Board Member	5	11/08/2010	About 18 years ago, I heard a horrifying story on the local radio station in Birmingham, Alabama about how twin girls who were 5 yrs old, were found in an apartment, living in a dog crate and in their own feces. Because they were so under nourished and living in a dog crate, they were only the size of about 2 year olds.  This story broke my heart!  I could not live on this earth without at least trying to make a difference when it came to child abuse. I immediately called the United Way to ask where I could volunteer to help with child abuse prevention.  I was led to The Exchange Club Family Skills Center in Birmingham, Alabama.I have seen the hours and hours of tireless dedication of the social workers, the Executive Director, the staff members and the Board of Directors at this organization. They are all truly connected to the community (Jefferson and Shelby Counties) and they will do whatever it takes to educate, communicate and save families.  They have numerous programs and all of the parenting classes are FREE of charge!!!!  They have the Nurturing Program, the Positive Parenting Groups, the Parent Aide Program, the Speaker's Bureau and Parents as Teachers (PAT).   They have seminars on Shaken Baby Syndrome and Child Safety Resource Fairs.The Exchange Club Center for the Prevention of Child Abuse was formed through the dedication, support and commitment of Alabama members of The Exchange Club, a National Service Organization whose primary focus is child abuse prevention.  In 1987, clients were able to receive services from the Parent Aide program in an office at Eastside Mental Health Center. Also, in 1988, The Exchange Club merged with the local Parents Anonymous Chapter, which brought the establishment of a new program, Positive Parenting groups.  In 1998, the center started doing business as The Exchange Club Family Skills Center.If you know of a child at risk, please recommend the parents or the custodians seek the services of this organization immediately.  If you know of a parent who's struggling to get it all done in this fast paced world, this is the place to turn.  If you know of a single parent who is having a hard time juggling homework, baths, extra-curricular activities for their family, Exchange Club will help them.  If you know someone who is truly trying to break the cycle of abuse, there is not better place for them to turn than The Exchange Club. When families struggle financially, sometimes their frustrations may be turned towards the ones they love the most. Tell them to seek the professoinals at Exchange Club.

American Institute Of Holistic Theology	276518		/users/profile/366303	alarsen	Client Served	1	01/13/2016	I paid for an MS degree and a PhD degree in holistic theology from AIHT. I made the down payment for the programs in December 2009 and finished paying for them in 2011.In 2014, I notified AIHT that I would not be completing my MS degree or starting the PhD degree. I was very disappointed in the quality of the MS program. There were numerous typos in the curriculum (tests, instructions, etc.) and the content was very thin. The school didnt even bother to run spell check on their materials! I found the program to be a unacademic and a waste of my time.AIHT refused to issue a refund for the PhD program. I then requested the PhD books and coursework materials. They refused to send those as well.The AIHT ontract states I have 30 days to withdraw from an AIHT program and receive a full refund. The school told me I am not eligible to receive the PhD materials until I complete the MS program, which I won't be doing, so I am not technically enrolled in the PhD program, and the 30 days have never started on the PhD program since the school refuses to send me the materials.The total cost of my MS and PhD program was $6,990, with the PhD program accounting for 52% of that cost or $3,634.80.

Authorities told Ms Simmons they'd be back to remove more horses the next day, when they went back the horses were gone.

The Way 2 Serve Inc	153016		/users/profile/203874	neophytewrtr	Volunteer	4	04/06/2013	I stopped by my cousin's house for a short visit today. My cousin's dad had surgery recently and I wanted to know how he was doing. He's been through a lot physically. And his living conditions provided little comforts after surgery. You see, his illness left him unable to get around. He had always been a very active man. To make the proper repairs in the home was now a challenge. As a result, he was constantly suffering with a cold, or the flu, or something. Weatherization was a major concern for him. He have gotten up in age now. Home repairs he once made he's not able to do anymore.  His home have run-down and it was far too cold during the winter months.  The family would tack-up plastic to the windows and doors. They believed by doing this the house would provide some warmth and comfort. However, the energy bill continue to rise.Meanwhile, the pipes continued to freeze over.  No matter what was done, the home had a damp draft to it constantly.   New windows, new doors, and a a new roof is what was he needs. Unfortunately, he could not afford (out-of-pocket) home repair(s). It simply wasn't in the budget. His family was at odds about what to do to resolve this problem. To get things fixed around the home began to concern everyone. Then today I dropped by and saw "The Way 2 Serve" organization out. My heart filled with glee. I could not believe what I saw. So I drove in closer to see my cousin's yard filled with volunteers.  They were working on top of the roof.  Finally, the much needed repairs were being made. You can't imagine the how happy everyone was to see him being made whole. The Way 2 Serve organization was there to help. They brought materials, tools, and other supplies.  The volunteers are working to make his house a warm and comfortable home again. To see this, it nearly brought tears to my eyes. Today was a joyous occasion.  Thank you The Way We Serve, may God bless you! Sincerely,  Lindsey

Hope Inspired Ministries Inc.	233472	1	/users/profile/297293	jmcarmy	Volunteer	5	11/12/2014	I truly admire the mission, staff, clients and success of H.I.M.   Changing the behavior of adults is a true challenge.  Many of these students come from backgrounds of abuse, neglect, abandonment, drug use and prison time.  Many do not have a high school diploma, further limiting employment options.  They have no skill sets to "help themselves" (as some admonish).  They don't know how to interview for a job, balance a check book, pay bills in a timely manner or even communicate effectively.  Simple things -- such as the value and importance of eye-contact --  are not part of the culture in which they were raised.  They want to escape the lives of "quiet desperation" in which they find themselves; they simply don't know how.  The 13 week H.I.M. program establishes standards and provides skills that empower these students to be independent and self-sufficient.  It works.  I've seen it grow over the last 2 years, and am constantly amazed at the "tough-love yet compassionate" manner in which the H.I.M. staff embrace these lost souls, and help them convert themselves into solid citizens.  Specifically, I help with meals (because the lunch meal is often the only real food these students get each day) and I help with mock job interviews held about half-way through the structured program.  These interviews prepare the students for real-world interviews, and they are often difficult, requiring candid assessments of appropriate attire, demeanor, confidence, articulation, eye-contact and resume gaps.  It's a great investment of time, because the students DO learn that they have some control over how they present themselves, and that landing a job is dependent on more than the good will of the employer.  They have to sell themselves, and, for many of them, this is a brand new concept.  I've worked as a volunteer with many agencies and organizations over the last 30 years and find the work of H.I.M. to be the most life-changing.  It's an honor to work with individuals who are dedicated to long-term life healing, and not just short-term, temporary fixes to symptomatic or cyclical problems.

They are a small rescue organization, but do the work of a large rescue. Their commitment to transparency, updates on all the animals they have rescued, level of care exceeded my expectations. Updating is critical, direct links to veterinary clinics for donations, their site is professional and not cluttered with anything other than the work they do and the support of their donor base. SFR is one of the few I support and I support them because of their honesty, commitment to best care, the "family" environment they have created because they are committed to keeping supporters informed--they don't post and plead for donations, but they do post current rescues and the needs associated with them, and continue to share stories from rescues dating years back of dogs still in their forever homes. They are thorough and have an admirable code of ethics, which includes community involvement, educating and working with local residents, rescues and humane societies to help reduce overpopulation. I am forever grateful for SFR and repeatedly amazed that their organization is run by husband and wife team and their two sons. They uphold what a rescue should be and represent this 100% .

Birmingham Landmarks Inc	200663	2	/users/profile/261970	Christopher42	Volunteer	1	05/21/2014	It has been 3 weeks since I requested a list of the Board of Directors of Birmingham Landmarks, a nonprofit here in Birmingham, Alabama. It owns and operates The Alabsma Theatre and the Lyric Theatre. I have repeatedly requested it over the phone and via emails to Brant Beene and his secretary Cindy Mullins. They have ignored my many requests. I have also asked when/how I might view the tax filings from the previous years. Again, no response. My interest in this information, which, as a nonprofit, I believe they are obligated to share, stems from witnessing a pattern of behavior on the part of Brant Beene and his boss, Danny Evans, over the last several years--beginning with the departure and death of Cecil Whitmire. (Cecil and the Organ Society were responsible for saving The Alabama Theatre.) After Cecil was gone, Danny Evans hired his friend Brant Beene to manage The Alabama Theatre. That's when I got to know Brant, as I was a regular patron at The Alabama Theatre. I suggested many ideas and conceived of a film series with Weld, and talked Weld into doing it. This film series brought in $12,000 for The Alabama Theatre/Birmingham Landmarks. Prior to this, again, as an unpaid volunteer, I helped create and promote Opening Night: An event meant to recreate the opening night at The Alabama Theatre in 1927. By create, I meant that I selected the movie and cartoon to be shown; I promoted it by writing several pieces explaining the event--what to expect; what to wear. I even suggested songs to the band that were appropriate for that year...The event, until I stepped in, was ill-conceived, poorly planned, and barely promoted. I also filled the need that there be some kind of quality control over this event. I say this to establish my connection with The Alabama, and those responsible for its operation, as an insider. Most of the allegations I'm making, I witnessed first hand; others have multiple witnesses (people who were under the employ of Birmingham Landmarks). Also, there exists a lengthy exchange of emails between Brant Beene, Cindy Mullins and myself to confirm the truth of what happened as it happened. To begin with, Brant Beene and Danny Evans invited the public down to the Lyric Theatre to help clean it up. This was before it had been properly inspected and any assessment of a health risk to the public had been made. Essentially, over a weekend citizens came down to sweep up asbestos and chisel lead paint from the walls and ceiling. The sweeping, of course, made these toxins airborne--and easily inhaled. Danny Evans, also an attorney, was there. He had everyone sign waivers. So he must have known of the dangers involved--or else why have everyone sign waivers? And yet, he wasn't concerned about the serious health risk this posed to the citizens who came out to help that day. At a public meeting, weeks or months later, they announced that they had just found out that the lead paint was only on the ceilings. I vividly remember a conversation I had the last day of the clean-up with Glenny Brock (one of the people in charge of the clean-up) where she was standing on a ladder chipping paint off the ceiling. In another episode, Birmingham Landmarks closed Lyric Hot Dogs--a business that had been open longer continuously than the Lyric Theatre itself. Brant Beene lied to the owner, Andrew Collins, assuring him his business would remain opened. Late last year, he was abruptly informed it would not. The Alabama Theatre, expecting backlash, immediately posted an anonymously written message which was misleading, contained lies, and even attempted to speak for Mr. Collins--when he had not been contacted to comment. Collins responded with a Facebook post of his own, pointing out these distortions. Weld, a local paper, also did a story which contained eyewitness quotes confirming that Brant Beene had lied to Collins, repeatedly. Birmingham Landmarks manufactured many reasons for the closing of Lyric Hot Dogs: We need the space for an office. We need the space for a stairwell. We need the space for plumbing. We need the space for an elevator. Brant told me on several occasions that the Lyric Theatres' blueprints would be duplicated from the Wells Theatre--which had the same architect and it was an exact duplicate. (The Wells Theatre has been fully restored.) Since this was the case, they would have known years in advance the layout for the Lyric's restoration. The small space Lyric Hot Dogs filled, could have easily been accommodated. Instead, Birmingham Landmarks destroys a landmark--one that was open longer than the Lyric Theatre. Lyric Hot Dogs was a historic operating business that Birmingham Landmarks destroyed because they didn't want competition for concession or parking. I thought nonprofits were supposed to act in the interest of the public and to be transparent.  The last surviving cherub head from the Lyric Theatre was left out on a folding table for months (for the public to handle) until finally someone dropped and broke it. As I started voicing these and other complaints publicly, employees of the theatre started contacting me privately. These are people I saw working at The Alabama Theatre. A safe was stolen from the Alabama Theatre office, and a police report was never filed. I have heard this story from a few inside sources. And that the safe had been moved to a new location before it was stolen. And only two, maybe three people, had keys and alarm codes that would have given them access to the office with the safe. Brant Beene is reported to have flown into a rage when one of the employee's commented publicly about the safe being stolen. Although he has acknowledged the theft. There have also been reports of a pattern of firings. "People who know too much." I have many other incidences to report, but I think this is enough to get an investigation under way concerning the status of Birmingham Landmarks as a nonprofit. Brant likes to tell the story of how a part of the ceiling fell after the first public concert was held in the still dangerous Lyric Theatre: September 28, 2012. It fell after the concert, right where the mayor had been standing. Brant has always smiled and laughed when I've heard him tell this story. Exposing the citizens and even the mayor to life-threatening situations; closing a historic and beloved landmark (and lying as they do it); allowing the only surviving cherub to be carelessly broken; possible theft; and repeated refusal to share the names of Birmingham Landmarks Board of Directors; keeping their tax filings from the public: This is not how a non-profit should operate. Please contact Birmingham Landmarks and request a list of their current board of directors and information on how you can view their tax filings from the last several years. (Thus far, they have ignored my requests.) Under law, they have to make that information public to maintain nonprofit status. If you get it, please post that information here.

Athens-Limestone Kidney Association Inc	215115	1	/users/profile/278470	alkainc12	Volunteer	5	09/15/2014	This organization was instrumental in getting a dialysis center in Athens, Al.  Those original members lobbied in Montgomery for the unit and worked tirelessly to raise money to buy a van for transportation of dialysis patients.   With hard work and many donations, they successfully got the first van and the totally volunteering drivers to facilitate the dream of helping the dialysis patients of Limestone Co.  Due to liability issues, the bus was later donated to the county so they could continue the transportation of patients. ALKA now helps with patient's needs that are not covered by bigger organizations. They have helped with medicines, electric/gas bills, food, gasoline, heaters, and many more necessary items.  They recently donated $4600.00 to the county for the lift on the new bus and repairs as needed. They support the yearly celebration of the patients with a picnic/meal and Christmas gift bags for all patients and staff.

Feed My Sheep Ministries	285343		/users/profile/375331	snakewatts	General Member of the Public	5	04/08/2016	Feed My Sheep Ministries saved my life- when I first attended their church services the pastor prayed for me- the Bishop prophesy to me and others all joined in to lift me before the Lord and Savior. It was at that moment that my life begin to change- the desire to drink alcohol, smoke weed, or try other drugs soon diminished. It is 19 years later now, and that Pastor Terryle and Bishop Daniel Parker are still praising the Lord and helping people get delivered...
Arc, Inc. of Jefferson County	111781		/users/profile/152185	Karen70	Client Served	2	05/11/2012	In my daughter's words: "With the big deal being made about bullying and gay and lesbian rights, you don't hear much about people with disabilities and their rights. A man with an intellectual disability was told today that he has 90 days to pack up his stuff and find somewhere else to live. Why? Because he complains. Why does he complain? Because the group home he lives in buys their groceries in bulk. This wouldn't be a problem except they ask him for his grocery list before they go to the store and many times return with nothing from his list, and only a few things he will actually eat. Realizing that he has only enough food to last him for 2 days, he calls his sister who makes the necessary phone calls to administration. After years of dealing with this, the organization decides "he obviously isn't happy here" without asking him if is indeed unhappy, and tells him he has to move out of the only home he has known for years. His response when asked by his sister if he wants to move - "No". But he doesn't have an option. The organization is already going through the steps to have him removed. This man is my uncle and his sister is my mom. So while celebrities are standing up against bullying and our president is suddenly changing his mind about gays and lesbians being able to marry, there are people with disabilities being kicked out of their homes (which happen to be funded by our lovely government) because they ask for food. That's like kicking a child out of school because they ask for a pencil to write with. When is someone going to stand up for these individuals also!? Something is very wrong with our country."

Their productions incompass many adults in the volunteer positions of set building, costuming and other technical fields, while directors take over getting the blocking and script to performance level for the cast.  Usually their productions have an overall "tour show" quality with much attention to detailing.  Literally thousands of children have benifited from their relationship with Fantasy with more confidence and abilities to work as a team.

The Social Services Department is the arm of Health Services Inc which network with charities and other health care providers to find financial support to follow up on the primary care decisions made by the primary care physicians/providers for the uninsured patient's care. Without the tremendous efforts and networkingon behalf of the uninsured many of the uninsured would go without imaging needs, specialist physician care, and prescription medicines. Despite all of these efforts, there is still a great need for financial support to get patients to follow up care especially for transportation to medical care, surgery assistance, and expensive imaging such as MRIs.

The Child Protect staff works very hard to minimize the amount of distress inflicted during the justice and restoration procedure by offering a non-threatening environment and counseling for each child.  They truly touch the heart of so many children every year.

Easter Seals has created one big family with one goal in mind and that is to help our community with any of their needs we can possibly help with. Even if we can't help you with something we WILL find someone that can. I began my career at Easter Seals disabled with Epilepsy. They were kind, understanding and there for me when I needed them. I had several seizures at work during my first 6 months of employment and every time I woke up from one, I would see a face looking at me with tears in their eyes and compassion in their heart. My husband is mentally ill and we have three children to care for and support, but no matter what hard times we have had they have always been understanding. I now have the pleasure of serving the disabled community through giving durable medical equipment and medical supplies to anyone who is not insured or under-insured. This is the greatest working family I have ever had in my life and I will never leave it. If you ever have the opportunity to serve, work or seek assistance through Easter Seals Central Alabama, you will never want to leave. Many families served by our Great Family still visit and attend parties because of the love they grew to know when being here. It is the number one organization in my eyes.
Pickens County Partners In Education Foundation	86769		/users/profile/97240	Lisa	Client Served	5	04/22/2011	I am a special education teacher at Carrollton Elementary School and I teach students with multiple disabilities.  The Pickens County Partners in Education Foundation has provided funding for three projects at CES that has greatly impacted the teaching and learning process for students with disabilities. The first grant awarded funding to purchase a phonics program.  This program was very successful and provided the needed classroom materials necessary to deliver effective reading instruction.The second grant awarded funding for the T.A.L.K. (Take Along Language Kits) project.  Several students are nonverbal and are unable to express themselves and require augmentative communication.  My school did not have a curriculum or available activities to facilitate instruction that would engage them in instruction to promote communication.   TALK kits were assembled with all of the necessary communication boards and switches along with interactive games for the student to use at school and at home.   These activities are excellent because they increase  effective communication and positive feedback.  The TALK kits are also excellent homework assignments for students who are unable to complete paper and pencil homework.   The third grant award funded a wheelchair swing.  Our school is the host school for students with multiple handicaps.  Before the PIE foundation awarded the funding for the swing, our school had no adaptive play equipment for students with physical impairments.   Now, our students who use wheelchairs are engaged in the fun that every child should experience during recess/p.e.  I can't tell you how satisfying it is to see the smiles and enthusiasm that these children have on their faces when they know that they are going outside to swing.  Everytime that the students use the swing, my thoughts include much gratitude to the board members of the PIE foundation.

There were times where practices were to be held at the school and no one showed but the kids. No coaches.  At there last game for the season this past Sat. March 4, 2016.  My child's coach Carl Cobbs was a no show. There was no Substitute or any other coach to come and take his position.  The Birmingham Bears #2 had to play their final game with no guidance.  I was deeply disappointed and embarrassed for my boys.  The head Coach M. Perkins was not there either for support.
Aarons Hope Ministries Inc	103891	3	/users/profile/139107	At Least I Am A Christian	General Member of the Public	1	01/19/2012	This place is a joke for anyboby trying to find a rehab facility that actually cares. They require an intake fee of $500.00, and each individual man is expected to pay $150.00 per week. Each man is required to furnish all linens, blankets, detergent, fabric softener, etc. There were 13 men at this facility last week end. Two local restaurants supply meals twice a week, and all other food is donated. Do the math on 13 men......that come to a grand total of $993,500.00 per year. Non-profit my behind !!! After on of the gentlemen fell out during a "Celebrate Recovery" session all belongings were searched and the sherill's office was called in. Not know what was found, 4 men were dismissed from the facility. According to the director, her exact words were "this is private property, and I can kick out anybody I want to". And by the way......the only person arrested that night was her son. If this were a true christian rehab facility seems like their focus would be to try to do what they say they will do "rehabilitation". Looks like the only thing they care about is what their bottomline looks like. Most of the money is done is cash.......wonder where it goes?

I feel they screen applicants well and are very good at choosing deserving families.  But, more than anything, I LOVE this ministry because it allows people to receive assistance with dignity.  The food bank is set up like a small store, and at Christmas they also set up a small "toy store" with donated toys.  They have a holiday party for the children, while grandparents get to secretly "shop" for a gift for their grandchild.  Highly recommend

Arc Of Shelby County Inc	196784		/users/profile/257215	disabilityadvocate	Professional with expertise in this field	5	03/31/2014	Due to our family seeking out the assistance from The Arc of Shelby years ago, we were equipped by our son's advocate, Susan Ellis to learn how to advocate and to NOT live by all the shall not, can not, will not, etc. The services that she provided us while employed at The Arc of Shelby proved to be life changing. WE as a family learned the importance of focusing on the ABILITIES and not the disabilities. WE learned to be vocal, expect a change and be a part of the solution. The Arc of Shelby County was such a door opening for what was to come. We know for sure had it not been for the greatest advocate, Susan Ellis, we would not be where we are today. The Arc of Shelby has opened the door for some great world changers and we are thankful to have met one of them and to still have them in our lives. This non-profit organization continues to be the heartbeat in many ways and on many levels. Not any one non-profit is ever perfect, but they have some great individuals working hard and focusing on the needs of individuals with intellectual disABILITIES.
WILLOW FARMS ALL BREED CANINE EQUINE RESCUE INC	242909		/users/profile/329489	Thistlethorne	Volunteer	5	05/12/2015	I started volunteering at Willow Farms recently-and I am amazed at the care and love the horses receive. The people here genuinely love the animals, and it is reflected in each horse (and donkey's) ease and gentleness. Some of these animals went through hell before being brought to the safe haven that is Willow Farms, and to see them healthy and happy and making a recovery, is amazing. It is a small rescue, but the heart behind it is evident in everything they do.

Greater Birmingham Ministries Inc	43556	6	/users/profile/44430	amon	Client Served	1	06/10/2010	Theme; Africa I live in                                                 Title; Hope in AfricaThe Africa I live is a continent of many faces. It is full of hypocrisy among its leaders, people who are tribalist, full of hatred, a continent of injustice and usually faced by natural calamities such as drought, hunger and epidemics such as cholera and other diseases. On the other hand its a continent of generous people, full of optimism and whenever faced with catastrophies they always join hands and come up with solutions. Africans are talented in sports and its a continent with the best runners in the world, best footballers and full of giants who have prospered in the field of academics. I was born 28 years ago in a small village in Uasin- Gishu district in Kenya and for the few years I have lived in the continent I have had my share of the ups and downs that the continent offers.My birth village was a cosmopolitan village which was a mixture of more than ten tribes. Since my childhood I benefited a lot from other tribes because I was able to learn most of their languages, shared their traditions and ate their delicacies. I was taught by my friend from the Kalenjin community how to prepare mursik (sour Milk) using charcoal as early as in standard four. I also learned to eat birds from a teso friend.I enjoyed the kalenjin traditional dances on pre-circumcisions ceremonies. Since I was born up to class five, even though I was still young to know about the political situations in the country, things were ok. It was until November 1992 when our relationship with our neighbours was never the same a gain. I had lived knowing that I was in our home and I did not know that we were different from our neighbours. Maybe my conscious before had been telling me that God created people and allowed them to live together like we had lived. I came from school one evening and found my mother packing our cloths and other utensils on sacks. What is wrong mother? I asked. We have to move from this place my son she replied. Why mother? I asked. We have to go to your fathers place of work because we have been told to move out of this place by the locals, she answered.I was shocked when I learned that we had been living in a foreign land and I was ten years old.It was the first time in my life that I come to know that tribe was not just the language as I thought before. Since I was young it was just fun to me when I assisted my mother in packing and I couldnt know the seriousness of the matter. The vehicle that my mother expected to take us to fathers place failed to come and we had to unpack so that cooking was to continue as usual. That                                                                         1                                       Amon mwangi                 night we were visited by our neighbours from our tribe and that is when I learned the reason that we had to leave out of that place. I listened to the talk in the house and heard Kenneth Matiba who was a presidential aspirant a member of our tribe was challenging the then president who was the same tribe with the locals. It was from the chiefs baraza that day when the new area chief was being introduced to the people that in his address he said that tutatoa madoa doa (we shall remove the stains). The stains were the tribes that were not supporting the government of the day.As a young child I was depressed when I saw how my mother was stressed and not knowing the next move. I felt that of I had power I would have convinced matiba not to challenge the president because people were suffering at the grassroots. It was a night I slept hating matiba with a passion and I did not even wait the visitors to leave. At around quarter past one I had a loud scrim uuuuiii!! Uuuuuii!! Wake up! Wake up my mother shouted. It was our distant neighbors who were shouting for help after their house was set a blaze .We didnt even know where to go. My mother was holding our hands me and my brother and we ran to a near by hill. The light from a burning house filled the air and we would see even the attackers moving towards a different direct. When we reached the hill we found a person there and mother pulled us to a different direction running. When I turned I saw the person running to the opposite direction. We ran towards our primary school but before we reached we met a crowd of people with their luggages in sacks moving towards where we were coming from. A man in that crowd gathered courage and asked us where were going, but mother did not respond. After a minute of silence the man said join us we are running away just like you. My mother was able to identify the mans voice and they started talking. They agreed that we run toward a mission church. The crowd was of more than five families and they had their childrens. I identified my classmates and we were relaxed as we moved towards the mission church in the opposite direction of the attackers who were still torching houses. As we ran towards the mission church, it was a sad moment for our parents who were counting the losses and how the government had forsaken them, but to the children we were narrating the experiences and making fun out of it and we couldnt comprehend the seriousness of the matter. It was the first time to meet my classmates at such a time of the night and therefore to us it was memorable moments and fun. For the children we were not afraid possibly because we were young and innocent and didnt know the dangers that could face us. We led the group running and the others followed. There was only one man in the group and the others were women.I latter learned that the man was a coward that is why he kept on singing in Kiswahili. Watoto mbele watoto mbele! Watoto mbele watoto mbele! Wamama nyuma! wamama nyuma!                                                                        2                                              Amon mwangi  Wazee katikati wazee katikati walinde usalama.( Children to be at the forefront! children to be at the fore front!  Women to be at the back front! Women to be at the back front! Men to be in the middle! Men to be in the middle front to provide security). I latter discovered that the man had played his cards well because he was at the safe position in case the attackers were to approach from any side.We arrived at the mission church at half past three. We were received well served with tea and bread. After the tea the priest made a prayer and we were given the blankets since majority of the families had mattresses and we slept in the church. The night was very long and tiresome and we just slept less than four hours. The following day we went back to our village and it was not the same again.  All the houses of the foreigners as they said had been torched, animals stolen and every thing else had been reduced to ash. The neighbours from the attacking communities were very hostile to us and they couldnt even greet us. All they told us was to go to muranga which I did even know where it was. The hostility and hatred that engulfed the village could be cut with a knife.  We had no alternative apart from leaving the place to unknown destination. There was no time to say goodbye, every family disappeared hurriedly after seeing a pool of ash in what used to be their homes. The picture of what used to be our home left a permanent scar in my brain that was to follow me many years after. Before we left my mother made an emotional prayer that I still remember word by word up to date. The good thing with that prayer is that she prayed God to give our enemies an inner understanding to know that Matiba was not her relative and she didnt know him for her to suffer because of him.On our way to the fathers place we reached a roadblock that was mannered by youths some of whom were my schoolmates. We were afraid at first but when I identified them I toldMother that I was to talked to them and nothing bad was to happen on us. When we reached them they were so apologetic and they told my mother that it was not their wish, they were working under instructions. In the course of their conversation with my mother, our school headmaster who was from our tribe came riding his wife with a bicycle. The good school mates turned wild, catch your toes they told the old man. Initially I thought the youth would run away the way they did in school but they didnt. They had found an opportunity to cane the headmaster when he was catching his toes the way he used to do to them school. The old man was caned seriously before his wife as I helplessly watched. My mother pulled me before I had said a word and we left. I did not have an opportunity to know what happened to our poor headmaster latter.                                                                         3                                               Amon mwangiAs a young boy I felt bad and asked myself where the world had gone wrong for such a reversed role to happen in broad day light. I promised my heart that I will never be a teacher only did I know that I was to end up being a teacher as I am today.We arrived at the fathers working place so traumatized that none of my brothers had courage to revisit what we had gone through. The following day my father organized our migration to central province where he had bought a land. We had not salvaged anything and therefore the migration was easy. After the general the then president was re- elected and things went back to normal but my mother vowed never to return back to the former land. I continued with my education in the new environment where everybody in the school was from the same tribe. The secondary school was the same with same few teachers and students from other tribes.When I join the university, I was happy again to meet people from allover the country .I had a chance to meet and share joy with people from tribes I was reading on books. It is in the university that I joined Omidyar network which was an on-line network. We would share discussions with people from allover the world, and it offered me an opportunity to meet new friends from Rwanda, Zambia, and Ethiopia among other countries in the world. I learned from the friends that Africa as a continent has experienced same troubles which from their narrations resembled what I had gone through. I learned from my Rwandese friend the pains he went through during the genocide in 1994. He narrated to me how he witnessed his father and mother being hulked to death as he watched. He also told me of the tight measures that the government had put in place to prevent the recurrence of genocide. I learned that it is a crime to identify oneself as either Tutsi or Hutu and even as we met in Omidyar conference and our communications up to date he has declined to tell me if he is a Tutsi or Hutu despite my assurance to him that I will never tell anybody that he reveled to me his tribe. They have lived as a nation and they used Nyarwanda to communicate. In 2007 the Omidyar network sponsored us to attend a conference in Gulu northern Uganda, that was organized by life in Africa Kampala and charity for peace in Gulu.In the Northern Uganda things we worse than I imagined. I learned a new vocabulary that was not in my dictionary that comes to be official ion Kenya after the general elections in 2007. The IDPIn my life I had not seen what I saw in Gulu. Four out of ten people you meet in the streets are missing one of their body parts. Some had even their nose chopped off. The IDP camps were congested with uncountable thatched houses lining up. It was unbelievable to see graves surrounding the grass thatch houses because people are congested and there is no space to burry the dead. I couldnt believe sleeping in a house where a dead person has been buried in next to the perimeter of the house. I some houses the graves were next to the door.                                                                            4                                            Amon mwangiUnlike the clashes in Kenya affected few communities the Uganda case was different because the rebels cause panic to the whole village. Every body lived in fear and even the children were not sleeping in their homes they were coming to sleep in the charity for peace ground. The most encouraging thing was the hospitality of the Ugandans in Gulu. I was hosted by one family for a night and I couldnt believe that I was in a foreign land. I ate sweet potatoes, posho and greens. I was treated as one of their own I couldnt understand why Africans fight yet they are such generous and kind people. That evening I was briefed about the insecurities in the northern Uganda, the abductions and other heart breaking news from the area by my host.In the charity for peace where we were hosted where we were hosted life was interesting.  We were more than fifty people from different countries in the world aged between 20 and 35 years. We entertained the children up to midnight and gave them hope to move on, we allowed the children to share their experiences to us and it help them to cope well for a problem shared is a problem half solved. The children were freer with us after sharing their experiences and they saw us as a blessing to their life. We lived and shared our life experiences and discussed different approaches of bring peace in the region. It is in the conference that we discovered that African minus their corrupt, tribalist and power hungry leaders are wonderful people. We like the wonderful African cultures not forgetting the Ugandan women who were kneeling when greeting us. As Kenyans we were so embarrassed we were not used to seeing women older than us according us such respect. The advocacy of the conference was humanity before politics and therefore it came a time to give the Gulu people the present from the omidyar family. The present was in terms of cash that was to be used to benefit them all. There were many suggestions of opening a business, revolving fund, buying a boda boda bicycle. What carried the day was the opinion of one old lady who wanted the cash to be shared among the members. When asked why she thought so she said that age is catching up with her and she didnt think that the profit from the business was to find her a live. We had to vote and the idea of revolving fund carried the day. The group contributed some many and we gave the old lady and she really appreciated blessed us all. After the conference I visited several places in Kenya on business mission since I had completed my studies at the University. One of the interesting parts of my mission is when we went to Suswa to transport maize. We had to spend the night with the lorry driver because the place had rained during the day. Our host had two wives, one was instructed to cook the meat while the other ugali and within few minutes the supper was ready. I was surprised to see how the two wives coexisted well in that homestead.                                                                           5                                     Amon mwangi I appreciated that culture which was different from what I was used to. When I reflected the good life we lived in the University as students and the generosity I have found in Kenyans, the commitment of the people towards peace building and reconciliations and economic development. I also join hands that the leaders are the problem in the continent and that all is not lost there is still a better tomorrow. Despite the corrupt leaders in our continent, past and present injustices Africans are optimistic and hopeful that a better day is coming and they will live happily and exists for the sake of each other for existing for the sake of each other is a fundamental principle of the universe. By his wisdom God created world of being in such away that subject and object partners have to live for one another in order to bring about true love, true happiness and true peace. The ups and down falls of the continent has produced a new generation of people who are ready to die for the sake of bringing a sustainable peace in the region. The differences of culture among the Africans is a resource that when exploited positively will boost the economy of the Continent. The experience I have gone through has made me love all the mankind and appreciate their divergent views and accommodate divergent opinions. As a teacher and teaching in Uasin Gishu a region that has experience post election violence in the past I teach my students to be peace makers. For the holy scripture in Mathew 5;9 says that blessed are the peace makers for they shall be called the sons of God. That is the Africa I have lived in. The continent of challenges blessings and all sort of experiences that has entered in the books of history featured in the world news but life has to go on despite the odds.

Mcrae Learning Center Inc	82677		/users/profile/91304	McRae-Gaines L.	Volunteer	5	03/20/2011	The mission of McRae-Gaines Learning Center is to give our students the opportunity to benefit from receiving an excellent education from the least to the greatest.   The McRae-Gaines Learning Center, Inc. has been part of the community of Selma, Alabama since the 1970s.  Though the Learning Center began as a private school founded to serve as an alternative to the public school system primarily for African-American children, over the years it has evolved and serves both bi-racial children and children of other ethnicities.  McRae-Gaines Learning Center has educated several thousand of children in this community for almost 38 years assisting those children in realizing their potential by utilizing a non-traditional approach to educate them. Furthermore, the founders of the McRae-Gaines Learning Center envisioned a day-care center and pre-school that would give children of color and low-income children an advantage when they entered the public school system.  They realized that the money a person earns should not determine the quality of education that his or her children receive.  Their premise was that if we begin to teach children the alphabet, numbers and recognition of shapes and colors, and small words at an earlier age the children would begin to read and reason earlier.  Thus, they will have an equal chance to keep-up and even surpass children from more advantaged environments.  The school began with only a handful of students but is now certified to educate 165 children.  Currently enrollment is 112 children between the ages of 18 months and eight years-old. The goals of the McRae-Gaines Learning Center are very basic but always evolving:1.	To educate pre-school and elementary school age children holistically, by utilizing social skills, family, religion, the arts and academics;2.	To teach young students discipline and instill in them the desire to strive for excellence through a curriculum that builds self-esteem;3.	To continually expose young students to the arts, science and history by utilizing local artists, writers, performers, business and industry leaders, scientists and historical figures to teach them about the opportunities available to them;4.	To make sure that the first school experience for our students is one of academic excellence, but filled with fun, love and exploration;5.	To offer more innovative educational programs to our students that will keep them on the cutting-edge; and6.	To offer our teachers the opportunity to get further education through programs at local colleges and community programs. The McRae-Gaines Learning Center partners with the Wallace Community College in Selma to provide single and low-income parents with affordable child care.  It is also a certified provider of child-care and pre-school programming for the State of Alabama Department of Human Resources. Graduates from McRae-Gaines have continued their educations in local public and private school and have gone on to colleges and universities throughout the United States.  Today they serve their communities as teachers, lawyers, doctors, engineers, architects, community developers, and government officials to name a few professions.

The staff is extremely dedicated and I believe its one of the unique non-profit organization whereby as a volunteer, you will gain more than you can possibly give. The thrill and satisfaction of being a small component in a potentially life changing event is an incredible feeling as HHI provides financial assistance grants to those individuals/families who lack healthcare and have medical debt. HHI is continuously growing and expanding in the community while educating individuals about the importance of incorporating a healthy lifestyle into our daily lives.

Tie And Doll Inc	286806		/users/profile/376876	Traci_H	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	I Give Because Someone Gave to Me.www.tieanddoll.orgObstacles to me are nothing more than opportunities.  Life is filled with obstacles.  Every obstacle that came my way always taught me a lesson or two or more.  Depends on what obstacle was dealt to me that day.SeeI learned at an early age that nothing in life comes easy.  I have a moderate to severe hearing loss in both ears.  My family did not receive confirmation of my hearing loss until I was in pre-school. Yes, I was faced with road blocks but that didnt mean it was the end of the world for me.  I just had to try harder, work harder, and fight harder.  Just because I cant hear doesnt mean I am dumb, stupid or deaf.  Im just hard of hearing.  I was told numerous times by teachers, doctors and others who really didnt know me that I wouldnt live a normal life.  What is normal?  Who gave you permission to tell me what is normal or not normal.  The way I live in the world with my hearing loss is my normal.  My normal maybe different from your normal but it is my normal.  Tie and Doll's mission is 'Mentoring youth to build their self-esteem and empower them to lead courageously, give generously, and enrich themselves culturally so that they can make intelligent choices and be positive influences in their respective communities.'I wanted to find a way to inspire and encourage the youth in Montgomery, Alabama that anything is possible.  I wanted the youth to know that he or she is not alone in the obstacles they are faced with.  I just knew that I would be the one to teach the youth something but the youth ended up teaching me some important lessons.  In 2010, I had an opportunity to speak to a group of 20 young men in grades 6-8.  I was shocked to see that only 3 of them knew how to tie a neck tie.  I assumed it was something that young men learned how to do like tying their shoes.  Majority of them did not own a neck tie.  In addition to this, I found out that I had grown men that I knew that didn't know how to tie a neck tie and had to get someone to tie their neck tie for them.  I was speechless.  Now it makes sense why these young men didn't know how to tie a neck tie because of the lack of male figures or the male figures in their life didn't know how to tie a necktie.Anybody that own neck ties or purchased neck ties as a gift knows that it can be pricey.  I presented a challenge on social media such as Facebook and Twitter challenging family, friends and strangers to donate new or used neck ties to give to young.  I received overwhelming positive response to my challenge and collected over 100 neckties.Every year, Tie and Doll presents a Spring and Fall workshop to teach young men how to dress for success, and make responsible choices that will prepare them for the real world.  I take the donated neck ties collected from the community and give them to the young men that attend the workshops.  For many of them, this is the first time they learn how to tie knots such as four-in-hand knot, trinity knot or Windsor knot.  At the end of the workshop, every young men get to take home the neck tie.  For many of them, it is their first neck tie.  For every neck tie that I donate to the young men, I am proud to know that I am giving them something just like someone gave to me.  I pray that when the young men get older, they will look at this moment and be inspired to give back to young men and teach them how to tie a neck tie.  A neck tie is a small piece of clothing but it makes a big statement when someone sees a young man wear their neck tie proudly.  I am proud to give to Tie and Doll because I get a chance to let these young men know that every obstacle or challenge that come their way will make them be more determine and stronger in pursuing their dreams.  Being able to share my obstacles with them allows me to show how I turned my obstacles into opportunities that will bring joy to not only me but to those who are impacted by my drive.This is why I give unselfishly.  This is why I thank my support team for molding me into who I am today.  This is #MyGivingStory.
Christian Service Center Inc	35793	8	/users/profile/36590	bill-martin	Volunteer	5	04/14/2010	I work as a volunteer in the food pantry program for the Christian Service Center.  I am now in my 4th year of service.  I am 72 years old and can truly say I have never served an organization which provides as much help to those seeking assistance with rent, utilities, food and other emergency aid as this one.  The Center is sponsored by 21 community churches, all of which support the center with food and cash donations.  What a joy to work with such dedicated volunteers.  There are NO paid staff.....everyone who works here is a volunteer
San Inc	188552		/users/profile/246055	davinamorris13	Client Served	1	11/14/2013	I have 2 children, and was a client from 9/9/13 until 11/7/13. We were under stress and frightened because of our experiences. Since there were no staff available to help with the children, they had to hear me recount all of the domestic violence details with the staff that we had endured. We were informed that we could not shut our bedroom door, and shared a bedroom with 1 other client. They allowed mentally unstable, drug users, prostitutes, and homeless live there. The social worker directed us to a bulletin board for help with information regarding housing and employment. She was not very helpful, unless you asked specifically for information, and then sometimes she still did not help very much. Most of the staff stayed on us about small things such as 1 piece of paper in the trash can, etc... They would wake you up to ask you regarding information that could wait until the morning when everyone was fully awake.  I worked myself trying to find employment and housing. I knew housing would only be possible if I had a job first. I was new to the area, and needed a chance and some time. I was given a 11/22/13 exit date on 11/4/13 and the only reason was "because this will give you enough time to find housing".  It was really apparent that most of the staff did not care about any of the clients.  The Director, Belinda talked to me the week that I secured another place in a domestic violence shelter and said that "we do allow you to close your doors". She was trying to make herself appear in a better light. All it did was make me realize that I was glad to be out of the dangerous living environment, and free. It was almost like they treated clients like second class citizens. 
Marys Shelter	84824		/users/profile/94230	Donna	Professional with expertise in this field	4	04/05/2011	I have worked at Mary's Shelter previously.  This is the only shelter for homeless, pregnant adult women within several counties.  The shelter not only provides a home environment for these mothers but also offers a variety of classes to develop and enhance each mother's self esteem, abilities, life skills and chances of overcoming the cycle of homelessness and making a better life for herself and her children. Mothers who choose to come to the shelter and participate in the program can stay up to 6 months following the birth of their child.  They are assisted to access community resources and have the opportunity to expand their education either through GED classes and /or college courses.  There is also an opportunity to participate in a Transitional Housing Program which subsidizes rent, utilities and other housing costs while the mother finds employment and is able to provide for herself and her children.  Women completing this program have responded that their lives are significantly improved as a result of participating at Mary's Shelter. There are numerous volunteers that assist with classes, transportation, etc.  
Mission Birmingham	286638		/users/profile/376708	Jennifer_W	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	Because I Love my CityI was born and raised in the metropolitan area of Birmingham, AL. As I was growing up, a lot of people had a really negative view of this city because of its dark past and instability in the present. However, I always had an inexplicable love for Birmingham from the time I was old enough to know its name. I wanted to see Birmingham become great again. As an adult, I learned of a nonprofit called Mission Birmingham, whose goal it is to bring leaders together from all sectors of our city to create partnerships and strategies to improve our city. My husband and I started giving a little money, as we could afford it, to the organization. Eventually, I got involved in some hand-on projects with Mission Birmingham, as I fell more in love with their purpose and the way they go about it. Today, I am a part-time volunteer for Mission Birmingham, helping put together a regular newsletter and writing for its blog. We are seeing a resurgence of so many of the things that make our city great, and we're enjoying the positive publicity Birmingham is getting from around the country. It's a result of the hard work by so many different people and organizations, and I love knowing that it's because I gave to one of those organizations that I was able to become a small part of the city's rebirth. We have a long way to go, but we've also come an amazingly long way. My giving story is that by giving to a cause for a city I loved, I was able to help change that city for the better.
Independent Reading Counseling Services Inc	166786	3	/users/profile/221579	EducatorProfessional	Professional with expertise in this field	4	09/03/2013	I am a professional educator and while serving in Volunteer status with this organization I observed how they provided small group and individual reading, educational assistance to many children that were having difficulty in reading and the time they took to work to improve their reading skills over the time allotted and on weekends.Although, a small agency I observed that many at-risk children had behavior problems. There program addressed individual counseling and family counseling addressing these needs to make the family comfortable which appeared to help ease the problems they had in school while working on reading; reading readiness, and grade improvement. This organization is often overlooked in the community; and by school educators but is extremely dedicated to work with the technical skills needed to help one child at a time become academically successful so that he/she can move on in life. They have other programs that focused with many homeless children, 4-H groups, and counseling as well as working with a small amount of adults needing services.

Destiny School Of Kingdom Expansion Inc	322898		/users/profile/416989	Harley2	Client Served	5	02/09/2017	If you are looking for a ministry school, this is the perfect place to go. This school is actually more than a ministry school- its a life school! It teaches you how to be Kingdom-minded in your everyday calling/ job. They teach you about identity- who you are and whose you are. They teach you how to manage time well to be effective in life skills. Mission: "Revealing Identity! Unveiling Purpose! Living Powerfully!"Vision: "We are an Apostolic Training Center committed to communicating worth and potential to others, equipping and empowering disciples to create, cultivate and carry the Kingdom of God.SOKE is based on the truth that every person is created, by God, for great purpose! Often times, those purposes remain locked inside until someone begins communicating worth and potential in such a way, that our destinies are unlocked and we are equipped and empowered to go transform the world! Once our Christ-given identity is revealed, our purpose is unveiled and we can begin living powerfully in the earth!"Accreditation:"At the conclusion of each school year, a Certificate of Completion is issued to each student who has met the requirements for graduation from SOKE. This certificate serves as a validation to future ministry employers and partners that the student carries the Kingdom values as set forth by SOKE.SOKE is not an accredited, degree-granting educational institution with the State of Alabama, and therefore students are not eligible for financial aid, student loans, grants or tax benefits. We believe the quality of the Kingdom Expansion educational experience to be more important to accreditation and will be acceptable as transferable credits to many institutions. Upon request, we can provide copies of each course syllabus to assist you in making a request to other educational institutions for transfer credit.In order for students to receive academic credit for coursework completed, we have planned the following into our program: Approximately one hour of work outside of class is considered normal for each hour of class. Therefore 6 hours of class, Tuesdays and Thursdays, should require 4 hours of homework, along with 7 Habit Training, Family Life and City Expansion, for a total of 15 hours a week. Students attending SOKE should consider themselves part-time students."It was some of the best teaching that I could have ever gotten. God showed me who I am and whose I am. Anyone looking for a ministry school, please consider SOKE! It is based in Daphne, AL which is located on Mobile Bay. It is literally minutes from the most beautiful, sunny, white-sand beaches that exist! www.dsoke.com
