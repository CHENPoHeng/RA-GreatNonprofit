Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	80825		/users/profile/88237	Sundog	Professional with expertise in this field	5	03/01/2011	MUD is the most humble of charities.  I'll bet a dollar will go farther with MUD than just about any group you can come up with.  We have led the solar installation workshop on site, been a member, done small presentations and donated a truck.  Every town should have a group like this to set a great example to youth and allow students to live a sustainable life 24/7.  MUD competes for donors with many other eco-minded organizations and has shown itself to be a survivor.  That is a testament to MUD's true adherence to sustainability.  From worms to tools to compost and manure, MUD gets it right!
Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	80706		/users/profile/88080	archiedog	General Member of the Public	5	03/01/2011	We recycled a old house in Missoula.  We ended up getting ripped off by the company we hired who claimed to be recyclers.  The bank gave us a dead line and we had no money to finish but had joined the people at mud. We needed to sand floors, finish the landscaping, finish plumbing, puddy the windows,put up 2x4 walls,tape walls, paint,build a porch. Then our only vehicle was hit while stopped at a stop light on Broadway. We cryed. Then we took out the list MUD had and started to see what they had.  We got the power washer first and washed down the house and couldn't get the washer back because our friend truck wasnt home so we called and they had another couple who needed it and lived near by,So they arrange for them to pick up at our house. We pick up all sort of power tools to finish the walls 2x4-sheet rock-mudding and the works and they looked thing up for us on how to dothings like framing, mudding nailing, orange peel.  Some times we showed up when they where not open and they helped us anyway.We also used the truck share to haul 2x4s, cement mixer, sheetrockand trees people dug up or wanted to get rid of for our yard.  We ended up meeting the dead line the bank gave us for our first housewe have ever owned.  We thought we were going to lose the house, the houseing market crashed and I lost my job and my husband job was looking like they were going to cut hours for them and we hadused our saving to do this not wanting to rent anymore.  They had ever thing we needed and still do.   Lona

It's an important and cherished part of MIssoula's character. Missoula would not be the same without it, and more importantly, the MUD model could be applied to other towns, big and small. 
Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	80690		/users/profile/88064	robindb	Client Served	4	02/28/2011	I think MUD provides an invaluable community service.  Our family has utilized several services offered by MUD.  We have accessed the apple press from the tool library on several occassions to make cider with our apples.  My husband has attended several of the workshops offered by MUD as well.  I highly recommend this organization to everyone in my community.

The honest efforts of Missoula Urban Demonstration are a testament to the hard work of non-profits.  Through the collective efforts of dedicated staff and volunteers, MUD has grown from a simple city seed company to a vital community resource for cooperative urban living.  It is a delight to watch them evolve.  I sincerely support their efforts as a Missoulian, neighbor and friend.

Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	80624		/users/profile/87996	Lagan T.	Client Served	4	02/28/2011	Missoula Urban Demonstration Project (MUD) is a great benefit to the Missoula community.  I have attended two workshops provided by MUD:  one taught basics of saving seeds relative to gardening/farming, the other taught basic blacksmithing skills.  Both workshops were taught by very knowledgeable and qualified instructors, and were provided to me, a member, at a very affordable fee.  I would highly recommend participating in learning experiences offered by MUD, and advocate for supporting the organization with membership or donations.  MUD also provides an excellent tool library and affordable pickup truck share program.

Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	80391		/users/profile/87758	Cal Pickens	Donor	3	02/28/2011	Community, a concept, is hard to define.  However in moments of acquiessence or repose may bring warmth and familiarity. Familiarity amongst neighbors are seeds that draw each and us closer.  MUD strives to bring community and family together.  Allowing for the resources when idle, we may provide for the betterment of homes sitting side by side, building and sharing our community. MUD, a gift amongst ou to share. 
Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	80360		/users/profile/87724	John B.	General Member of the Public	5	02/28/2011	MUD is great.

My wife and I are both members and we have made extensive use of the tool library for our home garden and yard. We borrowed tools to build 5 raised beds, thus allowing us to grow most of our own vegetables, and again when we converted part of our yard to a low-water use garden, so decreasing our overall water use.

Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	80275		/users/profile/87639	Rachel	Client Served	5	02/28/2011	We regularly use MUD's tool library - what a fantastic resource.  Before purchasing tools, you should check it out as they have everything and just using 1 or 2 of the tools can pay for the membership.  An additional benefit that pays for the membership is the 10% discount at Home Resource.  Membership for us in MUD is a no brainer.  We also live on the Northside and regulary attend social events hosted by MUD.  It is a great opportunity to meet like-minded people in our neighborhood and the Missoula community at large.  The classes are beneficial as well and taught by super knowlegable people.  This is an amazing organization.   
Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	80263		/users/profile/87626	Maureen	Client Served	5	02/28/2011	We moved to Missoula with all of our household goods in storage, so no tools at hand. THank goodness we had the tool library to start remodeling our house and maintain our yard and gardens. Without their help we would have had to buy tools for a one time use (demolition for remodel required sledgehammers, etc. The expertise offered guided us through the process as well.   We have lived in several communities and have not experienced such a unique service. The friendly, helpful staff at the lending tool library and the office connected us with many community resources as well. 
Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	80230		/users/profile/87587	Michael D.	General Member of the Public	5	02/28/2011	MUD should be considered a contender for this award because it is a pioneer in the field of sustainability, with a long history of innovation and outreach, to offer especially appropriate services and education to the community which it nurtures.  The truck share and tool library programs are outstanding examples of ideas that allow us all to live more lightly on the planet, and within our means in trying times. The planned renovation and upgrade of the Phillips Street properties will be stellar models of accessible means to reduce our resource demands and provide a setting for a rich life in community.
Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	80190		/users/profile/87551	samish	General Member of the Public	5	02/28/2011	MUD provides an important service to the Missoula community.

One of our favorite activities when guests visit is to take them by the Tool Library to get or return tools. Our guests are always amazed at the concept itself (even friends involved in community work elsewhere have not encountered such a practical and useful resource), and then even more amazed when they actually see the Tool Library in action. Thank you MUD!
Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	79891		/users/profile/87240	wendytech	General Member of the Public	5	02/28/2011	My daughter, whom I adopted three years ago, had many emotional and behaviorial issues. Amazingly, what has helped her the most has been working with her hands, and gardening. Organizations such as MUD really helped her (and me, too), understand the importance of getting your hands dirty, choosing the proper tools, designing a living space for green things, and then--drumroll please--WAITING to see how it works out. There are always surprises, and MUD teachers are available for coaching. I was born and raised in a city and my garden was a windowbox--my daughter has a larger garden, but a clueless Mom. Together with organizations like MUD, we're planting a better world, and improving ourselves in the process!THANKS, MUD!

Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	79865		/users/profile/87211	Jack R.	Volunteer	5	02/28/2011	I've been involved with MUD for more than 11 years. First as a very sporadic volunteer, then a Board member for 4 years, back to a sporadic volunteer, and now as a dedicated Tool Library user. MUD has been many things during its lifespan. It will never be a traditional success nor approach perfection, yet it continues to sustain, adapt, and inspire. Thus it has achieved a paradoxical manner of success and perfection I deeply admire.

As an older gardener I really appreciate being able to pick up tools to use rather than buy them.  Last year I bought a truck share and was able to pick up llama manure for my garden.  Really liked having the truck share.  MUD is an invaluable non profit to our community.  My one problem is that I don't utilize my membership enough.

More than any other local organization, MUD has made us feel part of a strong, forward-looking community.

Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	79565		/users/profile/86895	mackenzie	Client Served	5	02/28/2011	As someone trying to make it on a lower income in Missoula, MUD has been invaluable. My partner and I started going to MUD to use the tool the library. We checked out drills, bits, saws, sanders... anything we needed while trying to make a lasting place for ourselves in our apartment and thereby in Missoula. Without MUD our walls would be bare, the furniture we found on the cheap or for free would be less functional. I know it doesn't sound like much, but having access to those tools means real things. We can make ourselves a home; a place we feel comfortable in that we belong to. Going back and forth to MUD we met other people, people with good advice about putting up a hanging mirror or where to go fix your bike. We got to feed the chickens and pull a few choice items from the garden, or just have a place to rest a while and chat with other folks before biking home.  Knowing there's an organization like MUD means there's people in this town looking out for each other, trying to make a common and collected go of it. I've felt more at home, more a part, of Missoula than most places I've lived because of that quality. You see it in MUD, the organization embodies community. It houses it, gives it a center.

MUD offers tons of information relevant to homeowners and "urban" agriculturalists, but my primary use of their services comes from the tool library.  They have everything I need for small home building projects, and they offer great advice on using the tools.  Particularly, I like being able to get tools from them that I would only use once or twice a year - or just once.  Even if I could afford these tools, my purchase of them would be wasteful.  Sharing these tools is a responsible use of resources, encourages community engagement, and reduces the storage space that every home owner seems to need for endless supplies of rarely used tools.  Go MUD!

MUD stands out as one of the most effective, grassroots, community organizations, and for 30 years has helped Missoula with practical, hands-on experience in sustainable urban living.  A terrific organization with an important mission!
Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	79124		/users/profile/86427	rtwigs	General Member of the Public	5	02/27/2011	I moved to missoula a few years ago and discovered MUD. I signed up to have access to the tool library and was amazed at selection of tools. Since then I have been consistently impressed with the course offerings as well as their commitment to providing a tangible resource in the community for sustainable living. MUD is definitely a valuable asset to the neighborhood and the community.

Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	79076		/users/profile/86378	hedgehog sonic	General Member of the Public	4	02/27/2011	i thought i knew how to grow veges as all my life i had done so....in california.  in 2005 after two summers in missoula and whopping failures, i discovered MUD.  first thing i learned was how much i needed to learn. MUD helped with everything from composting tips and soil prep, to understanding the seasons here,  to harvesting and storing my own seeds and even offered tools and a truck to do the job.  i also took a cheese making class.  i wander through the MUD site sometimes just to get inspired, taste the delicious veges, see the community working together. i feel safe that MUD has been there a long time and is growing now into more of what it is meant to be even as MUD positions itself to launch into the huge growth spurt of a complete remodel, into an even better example of urban sustainable and healthy community living.

Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	79038		/users/profile/86339	Carolyn	General Member of the Public	4	02/27/2011	I have attended two workshops:  a home improvement one on gray-water systems and a cheese-making workshop.  The home improvement was thoughtful, practical and accessible thanks to the MUD volunteers and staff.  I have also donated a large number of inherited tools, both power and hand.  To me the tool library is the most brilliant idea!  All neighborhoods should have one where people could share and not own so many things that rarely get used.  They are welcoming and take the time to show you how to use the tools, as well.  It's a wonderful model of community building, sharing, and resourcefulness.

This organization gives Missoulians the tools they need to live a more sustainable lifestyle. I have given my time to help teach girl scouts about recycling by making paper mache with them. I have also spent a lot of time in the native garden, weeding and redoing the landscape so kids can come through and learn about native plants. MUD is a genuine organization filled with amazing people who volunteer their time to make Missoula a better place.

I have been so blessed by it, I just can express how much. We have used the tools to fix problems in our home that would have cost us so much more if we had to hire someone to do it. We are a family with 6 kids and could not afford to hire a repair man when we needed a new furnace. So with the help of MUD and the tool library we were able to do it for a fraction of the price. We are truly blessed to be a part of such a wonderful organization.

I used the tool library when I was converting the lawn to garden (checked out the rototiller), and we had a great, productive first year garden.  We also used the cider press to press over a hundred pounds of apples!  MUD has been both a source of tools, and also great help.  Every time we are getting going on project and stop by MUD they have had useful suggestions.  I haven't taken any of their classes yet, but I've been impressed with the wide variety that have been held.

Project ever since I became personally involved as a volunteer presentor. The Project is a shining example of a grass roots effort to increase self-reliance and community-wide cooperation from agriculture to zoology. For two years I was a volunteer who presented a cheese making workshop, both of which were well attended by young and old, the curious and the experts. It was all about enriching our knowledge and improving our skills. Volunteers with the Project were eager and proved their capabilities in planning and seeing things through. I feel that Missoula's community continues to benefit on many levels, from the library, tools, and expert aid or advice.

Every fall, the best thing was going apple picking then renting the apple press (an incredibly specific and useful tool that there is no way we would ever have been able to afford for ourselves, nor is it a tool we would really need to own, as we only used it for a few days a year). I made so much cider and from that, apple cider vinegar, hard and soft cider, mmmmm!! Thanks mud! I also used the services to get a roto-tiller to set up our garden. It is incredibly affordable, and also incredibly sensible to have a place where tools can be shared communally. I highly approve!

We were consistently delighted with the selection of tools in the share shed and the availability and knowledge of workers that helped us organize and prepare for our home projects. We have been clients for a few years now and each year find new resources, topics of interest and learn more awesome things about Missoula Urban Demonstration Project.

MUD is a special asset for lower-income people trying to use resources efficiently to provide healthy food and environment for their families.  I can't remember a time I wasn't aware that MUD is a real treasure ino our community.

Anyone who values community investment would do well to check them out and attend some of their seminars and classes.  One of my favorite classes taught us how to construct a lettuce planter box using old glass doors, to help protect the seedlings from the unpredictable spring weather.

My wife Sue and I had our first child at MUD.  She was raised in the organic nursery we operated there. It has always been a magnet for fascinating people who are actively experimenting on ways to live better while consuming less.  In addition to the usual suspects of hands-on workshops from everything from solar water heating to tofu, MUD has is a place where societal, intellectual and spiritual ideas are freely shared.  Heres to the current crew of brilliant and visionary staff and volunteers that are continuing old traditions and breaking new ground.

Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	77238		/users/profile/84484	Suzanne Sherman Aboulfadl	Client Served	5	02/26/2011	We are incredibly fortunate to have this unique resource in Missoula. I have learned how to garden, how to prune trees, and this year I could enroll in  Backyard Chickens 101, a great addition, since Missoulians are now permitted to raise six chickens in their backyards--and it's not as easy as we city people might think. Gardening, food preservation, and chicken raising classes contribute significantly to efforts to reduce dependence on food that is hauled clear across the country.  Another particularly valuable resource is MUD's Truck Share program. I am a pedestrian/cyclist and seldom need a vehicle. When there is a need, Truck Share enables me to haul  home project-related items, take yard waste to the local composting company, EkoCompost. or to free my garage of all that glass I've been saving to the recently established glass recycling collection point. The founders of this organization were way ahead of their time, and I'm grateful to the people whose labors have kept it going all these years.

The Board, the director, the volunteers, everyone is committed and believes in what MUD does.  This contagious attitude then spreads and affects the entire town.

The solar greenhouse built with local materials and gardens have inspired me and countless others to work harder and derive more satisfaction and enjoyment from achieving greater levels of sustainability in an urban environment. Based on the many ideas I learned from MUD I was inspired to design and build a year around passive solar greenhouse for food production and also to use all that was learned from MUD and my project to enhance my classes at the University and to participate in community events aimed at encouraging others to use their creativity to achieve greater sustainability and contribute to the community.

So long that 'alternative' has become 'mainstream'.  MUD sponsors workshops from organic gardening to tying knots, from solar water heaters to garden/orchard fencing.  It has done much to encourage 'green' living through its workshops and demonstration projects.  MUD is truly an organization that makes Missoula special.

I was interested in turning a 16 x 48 foot piece of grass into a garden and witht help of a Sod remover I and a few friends from the community were able to accomplish the task in one afternoon with the help of the sod cutter. It would have been a much harder job with out the tool. ONa second occasion I was able to borrow a post hole digger to begin the process of building a greenhouse  and even with the bucket of rocks each hole produced I was extremely thankful for the right tool for the job.

Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	74159		/users/profile/81032	suberdo	General Member of the Public	5	02/23/2011	MUD is a model for local, homegrown sustainability projects everywhere.  For three decades it has served a low income neighborhood and the surrounding community by launching the city's first community garden, demonstrating urban gardening techniques and sustainable living practices, coordinating community tool sharing and composting projects, and building community.  The project has been through many generations of volunteers and continues to recreate itself as newcomers bring new vision and inspiration to the ongoing quest for sustainability.  I'm proud to have been a volunteer 20 years ago when I planted my first garden at the community garden MUD established for this neighborhood.   Today, there are now many more community gardens in our town which have now grown into their own organization -- thanks to the success of MUD's original work.  It's great to see new volunteers getting their hands in the MUD to bring more good ideas to life in our community.  MUD is making the vision reality!

Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	74125		/users/profile/80998	Steve Nelson	Volunteer	5	02/23/2011	I worked as a volunteer, and served as a board member for three years, at MUD through the 90s. MUD serves as a focal point for innovation in urban sustainable living and an incubator for demonstration projects. MUD initiated the first community garden project in Missoula, which has grown into many similar gardens throughout the city. A small scale effort to reuse lumber that had been cast into alleys (stored in a small lean-to on the southwest corner of MUD) evolved, via a MUD powerhouse, into Home ReSource, a building material reuse center in Missoula. The Tool Library is an innovation from MUD which provides tools for self-reliant homeowners and business persons. MUD reintroduces many agrarian and conservation skills, which are at risk of vanishing, through varied workshops. The site itself serves as an excellent demonstration site of on-going experiments in sustainable living. MUD's strength and niche is as an organization which has supported experimentation and innovation in self reliance, conservation and community building.

I needed a pickaxe just once, and I did not have to buy it, but borrowed it.  Then MUD has great workshops on any number of things: cold frame making, beekeeping, fruit tree pruning, engine maintanance and beer making to name a few.

Working in the garden, planting seeds, tending the plants and watching them grow, was one of the best experiences I had in school. I think every student should work at MUD or a similar organization, to get back in touch with our food, and see how much work goes into each thing we eat, and to understand the benefits of growing and eating your own food. I think it would be great if MUD was more well known on campus, so that more students could visit and participate in the amazing process of getting connected with food, instead of shopping at a grocery store, not understanding any of the ingredients, and filling their bodies with unhealthy substances.

I didn't own a lawnmower and didn't really have the money to run out and purchase one at the time. One weekend afternoon, I was speaking with my neighbor about this dilemma and they pointed across the street and said, "Go to MUD, they have a tool library, everything you need, including lawnmowers." I just stood their perplexed for a second. Did he really just tell me that my neighborhood had a tool library where you could rent otherwise expensive tools?  Turns out they did. Not only did they have lawnmowers to loan, they had every kind of saw, wood chippers, a floor sander and more garden and hand tools than you would use to build a house. They had it all. Not only that, MUD had monthly classes that actually showed you how to be self-sustainable by using all the tools to make make your own  home improvements. And they threw great parties celebrating the Earth and community. It didn't take me long to warm up to the great people and community at MUD and I soon became a board member. Over the course of the few years I spent on the board I met a great deal of community oriented folks who had the same look on their face that I must have when I first heard about MUD. A mix of amazement, excitement and gratitude. Long live MUD!

The workshops have also helped me find healthy hobbies like home gardening, basic food storage, and tiling projects around the house.  Can't wait for more workshops this summer!  
Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	73403		/users/profile/80221	Happy tool user	Client Served	5	02/23/2011	I have learned a lot of hands-on skills and lessons from MUD.  Their tool library is amazing and makes doing projects at home much more doable.  They help a wide range of members of our community help themselves.  For this, they have gained my undying respect.
Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	73356		/users/profile/80170	Joyous	General Member of the Public	5	02/22/2011	MUD is an amazing resource for the Missoula community.  The variety of classes they offer range from canning to permaculture techniques to homebrewing.  The Tool Shed is available for people to rent and borrow tools so they don't have to buy expensive new ones for a short term project.  They promote native wildflower gardens and have been a major part in many garden building projects.  I am very greatful for this nonprofit and what they aid to the community.

I believe this experience helped form her interest in sustainable agriculture.  I enjoyed becoming more familiar with MUD's work and their role in our community.  They have been around for a long time and were one of the pioneers in community gardening and information and resource sharing to help others engage in their mission.

Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	73282		/users/profile/80092	MaryMUD	Volunteer	1	02/22/2011	MUD's Bethanne Garamon is an unprofessional backstabber. I volunteers for MUD. It didn't take long to hear Bethanne talking trash against us "grubby" volunteers. She also has a habit of blaming other for her mistakes. She disregarded instructions on one of her projects and blamed. me. MUD also passed up an opportunity to publicize and spread it's message outside of Montana.very UNPROFESSIONAL.
Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	73281		/users/profile/80091	bk09	General Member of the Public	5	02/22/2011	MUD is such a wonderful resource for our community.

Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	73245		/users/profile/80055	Amy G.	General Member of the Public	5	02/22/2011	It's true what they say about being a homeowner...it can be as stressful as divorce or death in the family. I have MUD to thank for taking some of that stress away by simply offering me the resources to fix up my home; it truly  would have been unmanageable otherwise. What a great community member! 
Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	73210		/users/profile/80019	jwmt	General Member of the Public	5	02/22/2011	MUD is one of the best resources we have locally, particularly for those who aren't flush with cash. We've used the MUD pickups to take bush and tree trimmings to the local composting site, we've borrowed a variety of useful tools for working on our home, and, one occasional, one of the MUD volunteers helped me rip boards with MUD's table saw. I don't know what our modest-income neighborhood would do without them! John W.

As a Realtor and Landlord I get to do this often.  The last person I told was so excited she wanted to be sure and remember the address so wrote it on her hand!
Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	73053		/users/profile/79859	claire	Professional with expertise in this field	4	02/22/2011	I'm a high school science teacher in Helena and I think MUDs Youth Education Program (YEP!) provides great resources for teachers and students.  The opportunities they make available through educational trunks, tours and hands-on activities will help our children make important connections to the land and ecosystems around them.  These methods are inexpensive and easily replicated in Montana or around the globe and will help re-connect our kids with nature through lessons in sustainability.  Thanks for all you do, MUD!
Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	73029		/users/profile/79831	AngieJones	General Member of the Public	5	02/22/2011	MUD is an incredible resource every community should have. The classes and tools they make available are invaluable. Whether you're interested in something like bee keeping, sustainable and organic gardening, or just need to borrow a shovel, they're the best resource in town. 
Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	73028		/users/profile/79829	Matt Hisel	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/22/2011	MUD was an invaluable resource to me as a graduate student at the university of Montana.  As an intern there, and later as site manager, I learned volumes on many aspects of sustainable living, including organic gardening, composting, solar panel installation, passive solar greenhouse design, green building, waste management, recycling and so much more.  Now, ten years later, these aspects are still demonstrated on the site, and the tool library provides a much needed service to Missoula.  I checked out dozens of tools that enabled me to remodel my first home.  I can't say enough great things about this organization that has been on the forefront of sustainability for decades.
Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	72990		/users/profile/79787	barirett	Volunteer	4	02/22/2011	MUD has several programs, but its oldest is probably its most valuable to many people.  The lending tool library makes it possible for Missoulians to ignore the standard American approach wherein every family must have every tool they ever need, even if that need occurs only once or once in a great while.  It makes sense for people to share resources, and MUD's tool library is a great way to do that, especially for families of limited means.  
Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	72943		/users/profile/79739	Kathy Revello	Professional with expertise in this field	4	02/22/2011	As an MSU-Missoula County Extension Agent, MUD has been a partner and mouth piece for me to provide reliable research based information to the public regarding food preservation.  The interest in canning has more than tripled in the past 4 years and MUD has partnered with me to offer canning classes scheduled this summer.  As the interest in food preservation increases, the risk for food borne illness also increase as people rely on word of mouth or the internet for directions that may not be acurate.  This winter, I received several calls from people who wanted to give their home canned products as gifts but were concerned about food safety.  When I reviewed their home canning methods I found out that errors were made which could even be life threatening.  MUD has agreed to let me teach canning classes to their members and surrounding community.  They have the ability to reach the community that I don't have and will, thus, help me do the job of educating the public in safe food preservation techniques.  They also provide canning equipment for members to check out.  Way to go, MUD!

Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	72824		/users/profile/79606	DIY or not	General Member of the Public	4	02/22/2011	MUD's great. They offer peace-of-mind insurance, even for Missoulians who don't own a home and don't always choose the DIY option.  We know the tool library, the classes, the expertise, the camaraderie, are all available for very inexpensive membership fees. If you need to move or help plant a garden, you might need to borrow a truck, a roto-tiller, a wheelbarrow. I'm relieved to know I don't need to buy those tools; they're available for the community to borrow, which is how it should be.  It's great to know that an organization exists to teach not only the basics of home and garden repair, but also the tools to live in a more sustainable and fun way, right in town.

Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	72754		/users/profile/79527	Eliot M.	Client Served	5	02/22/2011	We owned a little house in Missoula that was near to MUD.  The tool library was amazing and allowed us to do many more home improvements than otherwise we could have.  But, it was not only the tools, but also the help offered with the tools.  My girlfriend needed a chop saw but had never used one.  The person working at the tool library at the time, walked her through the use; changing angles of cut, sizes of wood etc.  MUD is an excellent project and helps build self reliance among home owners, as well as community responsibility.

Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	72701		/users/profile/79470	Lisa M.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/22/2011	MUD is a wonderful organization.  It continues to thrive through the decades.  Our neighborhood (40+ homes) holds a get-together in the fall to harvest apples from our common area apple orchard, harvest the apples together and make apple cider. The kids get especially excited to participate in this event.  This community coming together is in large part made possible by the loan of an apple press from MUD, and their staff and volunteers have been great about teaching us how to use it and properly put up gallons and gallons of cider. In the past I also kept several bee hives at the MUD facility and shared my love of beekeeping with the public, it is great to have a place to teach and learn from each other in our community.    The MUD gardens, workshopsand social events are great for our community and no doubt inspire people to dig in the dirt and enjoy the fruits of their labor. The tools and truck loan programs are affordable and fantastic way to share community resources.   I love MUD!

Helped build a cob shed/greenhouse, attended great garden parties, purchased llama poop, borrowed a wide variety of tools for projects from house remodel to garden bed building. I've attended a couple of their workshops, including for cheese-making, and cold-frame building. A great resource for all things sustainable, and a model that we all get to participate in.

Why?  MUD's focus is entirely on local sustainability for Missoula citizens, and their focus is not on any specific user group but rather all Missoula citizens.  MUD doesn't just provide services and goods for citizens...it teaches citizens how to live a more sustainable lifestyle which benefits their community, their environment and their wallet.  You know the phrase...give a man a fish an he'll eat for a day, teach a man a fish and he'll eat forever.  MUD is teaching citizens, and little by little making our community a more conhesive and self-sufficient place to live.

We help people establish backyard gardens by providing free labor to remove sod, set up composting, and online information and resources.  MUD has been our informal partner and provided tools from the tool library, information and other collaborative support. Achieving the aims of 1000 New Gardens (Missoula) is made much easier with such an outstanding collaborator.  On top of that, it is useful to refer our clients to MUD's many practical informative workshops.  In Missoula, it is a compliment to be told, "Your name is MUD!!!"

Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	70921		/users/profile/77530	tammy	General Member of the Public	5	02/18/2011	MUD is an amazing resource, and we are so lucky to have them in Missoula. They have helped us with everything from getting high-quality llama poop for our garden, to loaning us random tools like belt-sanders, roto-tillers, rock bars, and drills that we needed for just a weekend but did not have the money to buy. The people at MUD are very knowledgeable about all things house and garden and have given us expert advice, reading materials, and contact information for more investigation. They are the first place we go when we are stuck in the middle of a project. Finally, MUD makes itself readily available to the public with sliding scale membership and opportunities to learn more and get involved in sustainable living. If you haven't been there yet....do yourself a favor and go visit them!
Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	70901		/users/profile/77510	moonshine	General Member of the Public	5	02/18/2011	They have an extensive tool library.  I have personally felt limited in the projects I undertake and my methodology for completing those projects due to my inability to purchase the necessary equipment.  MUD eliminates that issue by providing a huge range of tools that can be borrowed cheaply.  Myself, and other members in the community can share this resource and enable ourselves and each other to create!  The tool library reduces the amount of *stuff* in our lives by creating a way to effectively share with one another.

Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	70882		/users/profile/77489	ere518	General Member of the Public	5	02/18/2011	MUD provides the Missoula community with essential services. Their  method of encouraging success and propagating sustainable living focuses on providing individuals with the knowledge and tools to be self-sufficient. MUD provides support to people who want to live in a more sustainable way. By giving the community the information and materials they need to change they make a much greater impact than organizations that advocate without teaching.

It has helped in developing a more sustainable way of life in our progressive little community. Specifically, their youth education and outreach program (YEP) seems to be uniquely beneficial. It is to my understanding that members of MUD have been compiling literature to teach our youth about being more sustainable. What a great idea! In addition, they do activities with youth at the local YMCA, and provide demonstrations on how to live more sustainable, including but not limited to, building construction and gardening. What a great organization. The world needs a more sustainable way of life, and MUD is working at the grassroots level to help Missoula be a more sustainable community, and set an example for the rest of Montana, and the United States.

This is a fund raiser for MUD.  They do a great job.  The music is always delightful.  The crowd, including the children, get up and dance.
Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	69480		/users/profile/75926	second sister	General Member of the Public	4	02/16/2011	MUD is a group of mostly neighbors who learn from each other and share resources for sustainable, community building living. I've gone to workshops on gardening, pruning and energy efficient living; I've gone to the community dinners where we eat local and listen to local music. I've used the tool library so i don't have to buy a lawn mower. Members try hard to share what they know and provide options to learn new and different skills, e.g. raising chickens in a small urban yard. MUD always need resources for the staff who can keep the whole enterprise spinning along.

Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	69255		/users/profile/75681	emma	Client Served	5	02/16/2011	MUD makes it easy to tackle projects that exceed the capacity of my own garage. If I can imagine doing it, MUD has the tools -- and usually the experience -- to be sure I don't get in over my head and walk away. Whether its a specialty wrench or a weekend use of a truck or chimney sweep brushes, I know chances are MUD has it and all I have to do is call or stop by. I also love MUD because it helps me contain my personal footprint. I don't need to own a leaf blower that I'll only use once a year, I can borrow MUDs, and so can all my neighbors. What's more, if there's something I need that MUD doesn't have, they can often find it, or at least put it on the least of things to acquire. I love MUD

The great group of folks on the Board, the Vistas, and the volunteers are all committed to a vision of a more sustainable Missoula.

But moving from an apartment to a home we quickly realized we had no tools! And no extra cash to purchase any.  We sought out MUD and established a relationship that has lasted us three weeding, gardening, planting and spring cleaning seasons. Three cheers for MUD--for many seasons to come!
Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	68072		/users/profile/74388	Shoop83	General Member of the Public	4	02/14/2011	MUD is a great resource for the Missoula area.

Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	67896		/users/profile/74205	creativechimera	General Member of the Public	5	02/14/2011	Mud is a fantastic program and an amazing asset to the Missoula community. Their programs and events add a great deal of knowledge to our community about living sustainably and economically. However, their programs also serve the community in other fashions. They work with local youth for community service projects (both court-ordered and volunteer), help elderly folks out with harvesting their trees, and benefit wildlife by cleaning up areas where bears could be attracted by fruit or vegetation. They also maintain a tool bank for folks to checkout expensive items that are only used once or twice a year, thus cutting down on wasted resources.

MUD is an innovator in the urban homesteading movement.  The Tool library enables those of us with the drive to fix and build but without access to the necessary tools to create solutions to problems in our everyday life.  The MUD garden is always verdant and productive, and it reminds us how easily we can contribute to our own food security.  MUD's is replete with knowledgeable staff members and dedicated community volunteers that are always eager to share their wisdom about gardening, alternative technology, and self-reliance.

Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	67390		/users/profile/73659	Mary Ellen	General Member of the Public	4	02/12/2011	I live in the same neighborhood as the MUD site.  MUD definitely benefits the neighborhood through its truck share program, tool library and its demonstration gardens and demo straw bale building.   MUD also promotes community in this low income neighborhood via its very social fundraisers and its classes.  MUD struggles sometimes to keep enough funding to maintain its momentum, but somehow it manages to survive and give to our community in a great variety of ways.    I see a great future ahead for this nonprofit!

I am in awe of such a convenient, practical purpose that MUD serves.  I am in no position to purchase the numerous tools the tool library provides, but I have many uses for them.  It is incredible to have the opportunity to be self-sufficient with home projects because of the services at my disposal, thanks to MUD! This organization is a perfect example of working together for the benefit of all.

Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	67048		/users/profile/73277	Howard Fulweiler	General Member of the Public	4	02/11/2011	I had not heard of M.U.D., being a Missourian, until my Goddaughter became a volunteer.  Since that time I have been reading the brochures of the institution and looked over the records of their work.  As a result I would give the project my highest recommendation.  If Americans have learned anything in the past few years, it is the importance and value of local efforts.  One thinks of the availability of food locally, the building of houses for people who need them,     and meeting the needs of our population in a down to earth way.  The Missoula Urban Demonstration Project seems a brilliant example--from furnishing tools to teaching people how to prune trees.  Here is a non-profit organization that accomplishes great things without demanding large sums of money, one in which a little money goes a long way.

Multiple individuals participated in the labor making it an enjoyable community endeavor.   I also helped with the installation of a 'hill' garden at a member's home, partook of some of the yields from the garden, used the tool library for projects at a members home, and attended a cheese making class.   The staff and members of MUD were all cordial and helpful.  The tools and equipment were maintained adequately, and the garden area represented a pleasant environment in which to meet.

Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	66908		/users/profile/73129	sustainabledancer	General Member of the Public	4	02/11/2011	MUD is an integral part of the community here in Missoula; I have often used MUD's service just as a general member of the community. My two daughters--one is 3 yrs-old, the other is one--have enjoyed spending time in the MUD garden, native plants-area and with the chickens. They learn while I gather tools, information, etc... that I use to improve my own sustainable existence at home. MUD serves us in multiple ways, and serves multiple generations, just by being here; the fact that MUD volunteers and employees help and teach children and adults as well, makes them an even more valuable asset to this Montana town.

The tool library and truck share programs are brilliant. Reading reviews from those who use it makes me think that these kinds of programs need to exist on a national scale. Maybe they do and I am unaware of it but it sounds like a wonderful program that could very much benefit those who accept it into their communities. 
Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	66640		/users/profile/72837	Liquid Plumber	Donor	4	02/11/2011	I have benefited greatly from living about six blocks from MUD and the Tool Library.  As a first time home owner, the proximity of such a resource means I borrow a lawn-mower, drill, or circular saw, etc. and learn about ways to use them to spruce up the place and add sustainable features.  The organization is trying to raise money for a move to a more central location, which will be sad to lose in the neighborhood.  Still, the idea makes sense for sustainability reasons - more people will be able to travel shorter distances to get there. I will be happy if more people can share this resource that has its head in the right direction.

In all honesty, people, myself included, tend to be skeptical of sustainability projects at first, but they truly are an important initiative. I love their programs, especially those that focus on the youth. I truly feel that through programs like this, communities can begin to become sustainable living environments.
Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	66634		/users/profile/72830	wpmartin06	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/11/2011	MUD is a great, sustainable, developmental organization aimed at empowering the communities disadvantaged by the ambivalence of economic policies even before Hurricane Katrina made landfall. It is efforts like this, that not only strive to heal a community in-need, but promote a long-term sustainable solution to previously existing socio-economic disparities, that will make and impact on this region.
Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	66623		/users/profile/57037	ecopearl	Client Served	5	02/11/2011	I have attended several of MUD's workshops and found them not only informative but also exciting. Most recently I learned how to tie knots--a skill that could save my life one day, or at least keep the mattress from escaping off my car roof. Before that, I learned how to press cider, and was inspired to pick apples for the project myself. MUD is an asset to the community and I hope that they will grow into an even greater resource in the future.

Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	66309		/users/profile/72482	fscycle	Donor	5	02/10/2011	MUD has been a flash point for integrated, holistic, sustainable urban living.  The tool lending library, although it's there as a resource, also, at its heart, decreases overconsumption simply because people are sharing the items - no matter how simple (screwdrivers) or complex.  The workshops (I do wish they were held more often on a recurring basis) promote community (connecting with over like-minded folk) and sustainability.  But more than anything, the integrated approach and philosophy of MUD is key to the future of healthy communities.

Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	66033		/users/profile/72183	BGMerkle	Professional with expertise in this field	4	02/10/2011	I keep returning to MUD because it embodies what is most compelling about grassroots community-based change.  At MUD, you, as an individual, have the capacity to make a significant difference: a) in the success of the organization's programs, b) in the impact MUD has in the Missoula community, and c) in your own life.  Volunteering for MUD is always an opportunity for personal skill development and even professional development.   The environment in which work is accomplished at MUD is one of collaborative decision-making.  Members of the organization serve on key committees, informing decisions in a critical way.  MUD's relationships with community partners are deliberately cultivated to ensure the local non-profit community is maximizing its potential to serve Missoulians.   And fundamentally, the work done every day at MUD is motivated by the conviction that sharing knowledge and resources about sustainable life skills from one neighbor to the next will result in a significant positive impact on the resilience and long-term sustainability of our community.  It is possible to live a meaningful sustainability-oriented lifestyle IN AN URBAN ENVIRONMENT without lots of gadgets and expense. 
Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	65976		/users/profile/72116	njbenja06	General Member of the Public	4	02/10/2011	Sustainability is a great movement with the possibility to create enormous effects. The issues is our economy is overly focused on quick results, and bottom line economics. While what can be changed is of great importance, emphasizing these components relevant to MUD and sustainability in general so be of greater focus when dealing with the general public. Doing so will result with less skepticism about the movement and greater achievement. Regardless organizations like MUD should continue to receive publicity and greater support from our government who are able to comprehend the long term benefits.

Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	65308		/users/profile/71387	Lowell C.	General Member of the Public	4	02/09/2011	MUD has done wonderful things for the Missoula community. The projects they have accomplished have increased the interdependence within our community and substantially improved the quality of life for Missoulians.
Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	64970		/users/profile/71031	roosburn	General Member of the Public	5	02/08/2011	I believe that MUD is a very worthwhile organization, especially in our current time. Missoula, MT is a shining light in the States in regards to sustainability and community commitment/involvement.  A large part of this can be attributed to MUD and other organizations like it. It's short term goals already do and have the potential to foster long terms rewards. These rewards include but are not limited to healthier lives, stronger community ties, cultural, environmental, and psychological awareness.
Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	64803		/users/profile/70849	Joe Furshong	General Member of the Public	5	02/08/2011	Recently MUD has gone from near extinction to being a vibrant, responsive community partner, effectively supporting efforts to promote neighborhood viability on Missoula's north side.  Kudos to Lauren Caldwell and a very strong board.  MUD is an example of how a focused non-profit can truly deliver on its mission statement.
Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	64684		/users/profile/70727	jballew80	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/08/2011	MUD is a phenomenal organization, what more can I say.  The services that MUD offers to the Missoula valley are so beneficial to the whole community.  From the kids enrolled in the Youth Education Program (YEP for short) to their grandparents who attend the workshops on gardening, seed saving, or sewing, MUD offers education and support for the community.   I first became a member of MUD to use the tool library.  I was stunned when I saw the number and assortment of tools that they have available.  They even have two trucks that are available as part of the Truck Share Program.  I could not believe it.  I was all of a sudden shocked that this type of organization was not in every town.  Not only does MUD have a plethora of tools, their tool librarian's have to know how to operate, maintain, and give helpful tips on how to use their tools effectively and safely. Several months later I joined the Board of Directors.  As an Energy Auditor and Home Performance Consultant I worked with the Site committee to develop a redevelopment plan.  I was so pleased to work with so many talented and diligent people. Unfortunately, my stay on the Board of Directors was short lived.  I took a job in Pennsylvania and have missed MUD every day since.  I now live in a town that doesn't have a tool library or Truck Share and realize how useful it was.  Times were, I had access to everything from lathes, table saws, and chisels to chippers, pole pruners, and chain saws.  I love you dearly MUD.  I will always remember the good time I had with my friends at MUD!

I've gotten vegetable starts there in the spring, attended the very friendly garden party, and hope to borrow the truck this spring during yard cleanup. I haven't had the opportunity yet to take advantage, but I love the line-up of educational workshops from chicken care to tree pruning.  
Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	64086		/users/profile/70055	horsegirl	Volunteer	5	02/06/2011	I have volunteered with MUD for several months now and absolutely love being a part of it.

If you talk to any of the resourceful creative people around here at some point MUD or Home Resources will invariably be mentioned for the ability to help them get their projects done. Things are being re-used, gardens are popping up all over town ! I'm proud to live in a town that prioritizes these ideals.

Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	63766		/users/profile/69707	MissoulaLocal	General Member of the Public	4	02/05/2011	I regularly borrow tools from the tool library and attend MUD community events.  They're a great part of what makes Missoula the vibrant supportive community that it is.  MUD assists the average person to maintain and upgrade their lifestyle in a sustainable manner.  They provide this valuable assistance while costing members and participants very little.  Keep up the good work. 
Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	63725		/users/profile/69668	phoenixrising	Client Served	5	02/05/2011	I have been a MUD member for years... I have taken some of their workshops and learned everything from how to make non-toxic household cleaners to my most recent one Basic Bathroom Tiling.   I have purchased recycled tiles from our local Home Resources.  Now that I have the training to do tiling, I will be utilizing the wet tile cutter that I can borrow from the MUD tool shed.  I have never been very confident in my skills with power tools but our trainer did not just show us how to do things, he made sure we participated and were comfortable with the tile cutter and grinder, neither I had used before.  How empowering it made me feel to say to myself .... "You can do this" I look forward to starting my bathroom project... and decided not only to do the floor but am going to design a tile pattern for my shower stall as well.  MUD is such an amazing community resource for Missoula and has been around for 30 years now.   Originally they were the Down Home Project.  I recall the times I would take some of the folks I served who had disabilities and we volunteered to go over 2 times a week to work in the gardens and for those in wheelchairs, the raised garden beds. What a sense of wonder they felt when their work turned into flowers and food!   Folks may come and go over the years... but MUD remains a strong member of this community with it's roots firmly planted.  Fond memories of the yearly MUD Garden Parties... an incredible way to bring adults, children, food, music and fun together and share in our abundance with one another.

It is a real down-to-earth type of an organization that helps to disseminate lots of great information. The workshops have always been useful, the Tool Librarians are knowledgeable, and the site is beautiful especially during its full glory at harvest time.

The ways in which they help enrich our community are too numerous to name here. The work they do speaks for itself though, and evidence of their dedication has left indellible marks of beauty and sustainability throughout our beautiful valley. Thank you MUD!!

From what I have read, this sounds like a great way for the community(especially the children) to learn about different ways of gardening etc..  As time goes on, there seems to be less people raising their own produce and this looks to be a great site to help them learn how.Its always great to see the community reach out to the very young.

MUD also is in charge of the Earth Day Celebration, where there is information on all sorts of Sustainable ways of life, plus there is music from many of the local bands, it is the kick off every spring for the New Year.

Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	63296		/users/profile/69201	Denver	General Member of the Public	5	02/04/2011	MUD offers unique services to the poor and working families of Missoula.  There are probably over 100 non-profit organizations in this city, ranging from service based to advocacy, but none of them fill the same niche as MUD.  From the Tool Library to the Truck Share to the farming and home improvement demonstration classes MUD teaches real skills and provides raw materials to help families stretch their increasingly tight budgets.  But perhaps more importantly, MUD provides stabilization for families and neighborhoods.  The Northside of Missoula, where MUD is based, has traditionally been the rough side of town.  Here you will find the poorest schools in the city and the highest rate of crime.  In a town that prides itself on its boutique businesses and buy local cafes, community looks different on the Northside.  But through their projects MUD demonstrates and redefines what it means to be a community.  The other side of the coin that is not readily apparent, is that the Montana legislature is currently in the process of slashing budgets and cutting public assistance programs drastically.  The families that already depend on MUD will need their services that much more in the coming years.  Furthermore, I worry that as the recession wears on donor dollars will dry up for many service-based non-profits unless they are able to secure some sizable grants to anchor their budget.  If you are looking to provide much needed funding to an organization that does a whole lot on very little, I would implore you to invest in MUD.

They provide workshops, a loaning tool library, demo projects (conservation remodeling, grow your own food, how to fix it, etc etc). They also provide school programs and organize an annual Earth Day celebration for Missoula. MUD is a major factor in why Missoula has been able to shrink it's eco-footprint.  And they accomplish a lot with very little -- so an investment in them is well 'leveraged'.  They have lots of great volunteers who are used effectively. My students learn a lot when they volunteer with MUD.  A great choice

MUD not only creates sustainable communities, but also empowers the communities through education.  From my experience in NYC, this is what is lacking--educating the public about ways they too could have sustainable communities. Without education, the populace is not empowered, and MUD does just that.  On top of that, MUD builds and supports community through their celebrations and through their actively engaging people.  I am thoroughly impressed by MUD's efforts and wish their were a replica of MUC here is NYC.  We need it badly!

Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	62570		/users/profile/68401	erikarauthe	General Member of the Public	4	02/02/2011	MUD has always been an incredible resource and asset to Missoula.  I cannot imagine the community without MUD!  As far as non-profits go, MUD is vital to the Missoula community.
Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	62533		/users/profile/68353	Pat L.	Volunteer	5	02/02/2011	MUD is great. I have attended a number of workshops - beer making, cheese making, and so on - and they are informative and enjoyable. I really like that the workshops are not theoretical but provide practical ways we can each change how we live so as to sustain our dwindling resources.
Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	62513		/users/profile/68331	brewer1153	Client Served	5	02/02/2011	MUD has proved to be an invaluable resource for the Missoula community and more specifically for myself.  After buying our new home last year (with help from the first home buyer tax credit), MUD has consistently been there to provide the tools we needed to tackle the various home maintenance projects that have persisted in popping up.  From rebuilding one of the biggest walls in our home, to painting the interior, to building window frames and new trim, to hanging up art work (some of which we made from left over wood cuttings from using MUD table and chop saws), to resizing some of the doors in our house, MUD has always had the tools we needed to enable us to do projects that otherwise would have been much more costly and much less accessible.  Thanks so much MUD! 
Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	62494		/users/profile/68309	kelly	General Member of the Public	5	02/02/2011	MUD is an incredible asset to the Missoula community.  Even after having moved away from Montana several years ago, I often find myself wishing that I still had access to MUD's tool library -- especially the apple press! 
Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	62488		/users/profile/68300	linneams	Client Served	5	02/02/2011	I love MUD and find the classes and tool shed an important part of helping community members move towards sustainable living. I have taken workshops and rented the truck for compost hauls. Keep up the good work. 
Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	62483		/users/profile/68295	jeva1011	Volunteer	5	02/02/2011	MUD is an amazing organization that has served the Missoula community for 30 years.  Its grassroots at its finest and many other important Missoula organizations have been "born" in the houses and gardens of the MUD demonstration cite.  Garden City Harvest is a great example.  MUD itself continues to inspire people and provide resources (including information and the physical tools/materials) to live a little more lightly on this planet, while building community with others.  I love MUD and all they do. 
Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	62482		/users/profile/68294	Melissa Bangs	Client Served	4	02/02/2011	I live on the North Side of Missoula and am a home owner here.  One of the vital elements that makes us feel deeply at home in our hood is the TOOL LIBRARY.  We use the tool library for many a home renovation, big or small and have, for a number of years in a row now, utilized the cider press to makes loads of apple cider.  Many of our neighbors are our friends and it is a common experience in the hood that home renovation is more possible because we have access to tools of every kind at the TOOL LIBRARY.  Not only do they have a wide variety of tools, they are great tools, they work and the volunteer help is warm, enthusiastic and engaged.  In my experience, the TOOL LIBRARY does much more than simply make renovation projects possible that might otherwise not be... it is an epicenter of community.  The TOOL LIBRARY is a model that sparks community and sustainability.  In a national economy based, too often, on planned obsolescence, consumption and individualism... the TOOL LIBRARY is a microcosmic counterpoint and a life-giving alternative.
Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	62467		/users/profile/68277	canucking	General Member of the Public	5	02/02/2011	MUD is a unique and vibrant part of this community.  Its use is beneficial on many different levels and a fantastic resource to draw from.  In addition to the volunteers like Mike Manhardt who display dedication and a wealth of knowledge on many subjects, the staff of MUD are very enthusiastic and a pleasure to do business with.  I'm glad its an inveterate part of Missoula.
Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	62438		/users/profile/68245	carolm	General Member of the Public	5	02/02/2011	MUD is a wonderful resource in Missoula. Their friendly staff helped me find the right tools and the information I needed.

I feel as though many of the community services that this group offers, such as the tool library and the truck share programs are great ways to encourage not only sustainability but also a sense of community camaraderie.  I think these organizations should be more widespread, especially in agricultural areas.  
Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	62375		/users/profile/68172	Brian C.	Client Served	5	02/01/2011	MUD is a great, uniquely Missoula organization.  They have helped me with tools/equipment to make countless home repairs as well as apple cider, and plant my garden every year.  They are an invaluable service to the average "underfunded" Missoulian homeowner.
Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	62360		/users/profile/68157	wiles	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/01/2011	When the dust settles on this era, urban organizations in the early 21st century focused on regional self-reliance and energy and resource conservation will be looked upon as the most important.  These are the people that get it.  MUD is 30 years old now.  It was and remains ahead of its time.  A true leader in its field, setting the example.  Living the dream.  Helping each other.  Inspiring others.
Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	62348		/users/profile/68145	lbrown	General Member of the Public	5	02/01/2011	I have been aware and used the services of MUD since it's inception. This nonprofit has been an invaluable source in our community, from sponsoring and organizing activities to educating the general public on sustainable living. I have used tools from their Tool Library, gone to workshops from on raising chickens, pruning trees and building coldframes. I am the advisor for a local  high schools recycling/sustainabliity club and MUD has been there to answer questions and help students get involved. I could not have done half of what I do to live sustainablity without the support of MUD.
Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	62311		/users/profile/68109	Lewis	Client Served	5	02/01/2011	MUD is a really fantastic organisation. They have been active in the Missoula community long enough to become a local institution, and from personal experience, their tool library is a one-of-a-kind asset for low and medium income home owners. Thanks, MUD!
Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	62289		/users/profile/68086	laura	Client Served	5	02/01/2011	The tool library is an incredible resource for the neighborhood. It has saved us hundreds of dollars in tools. We have been able to increase the value of our historic house (1906!) and by default the value of our neighborhood because of MUD. Thanks!
Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	62287		/users/profile/68084	Shannon H.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/01/2011	What a magnificent resource.  The tool library is my favorite aspect and I promote membership regularly to do-it-yourself clients.

MUD's annual Garden Party was the very first event that I went to after moving to Missoula in the fall of 2009.  What an extraordinary community of DIY gardeners, carpenters, artists, and best of all, neighbors.
Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	62254		/users/profile/68047	hrbaker	Volunteer	5	02/01/2011	MUD provides wonderful services to the Missoula community through its tool library, truck share and excellent workshops. More importantly though, through these services MUD provides an alternate way of thinking about resources and how we use them, an alternate economy that helps to bring people together and build community. It is this kind of far-reaching and creative thinking that I value in a non-profit and I am excited to be part of MUD's vision for the future. 
Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	62248		/users/profile/68039	julie	General Member of the Public	4	02/01/2011	I love MUD! The tool library is my favorite and such an amazing asset to the community. MUD is one of the best non-profits around and is an amazing model for a healthy community!
Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	62173		/users/profile/67959	Burt	Volunteer	4	02/01/2011	My wife and I joined MUD a few years back and have enjoyed our association with other members/volunteers.  We are users of the tool library more than any of the other of the organization's assets and programs.  We have had the good fortune to borrow a compound mitre saw, a compressed air nail gun, ladders, and several other items to perform work on our daughter's house.  Aside from teaching sustainable lifestyle options, the tool library is in our opinion the most important function (including truck share for hauling the tools) MUD offers.  It allows people to have access to expensive tools that may only be used once a year without having to purchase and store them.
Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	62165		/users/profile/67949	cframe	Client Served	4	02/01/2011	As a new homeowner, I find the Tool library incredibly useful!
Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	62155		/users/profile/67938	Misty	Client Served	5	02/01/2011	Mud is a very helpful resource to our community. I have personally been a member of the MUD Tool Library for a few years, & without it I know our home would be falling apart. I've borrowed lawn mowers, painting tools, plastering tools, saws, and so much more to help maintain, repair, & weatherize our home.  We could never have afforded to purchase all of these tools, but our membership fees allowed us to be able to share them through MUD.  The staff is always friendly, & I wish I had more time to attend their excellent demonstrations.
Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	62153		/users/profile/67935	violet hopkins	Volunteer	5	02/01/2011	MUD is a fantastic resource for all Missoulians. I've worked there and taken advantage of their classes and their tool library, and it  helped me obtain an education award through VISTA. I can't explain how much the organization has grown and supported Missoula all of these years- It's simply a fundamental example of how  a community-centered organization should function.
Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	62151		/users/profile/67933	dubhglas	General Member of the Public	5	02/01/2011	MUD is a fantastic organization. Frugal, grass-roots, sustainable, and making a big impact in the community, there isn't much more one can expect from a social benefit organization. And unlike so many other orgs, MUD has stayed true to its mission and hasn't expanded just because it has been so successful. It has been devoted to its core principles for years, and offers huge value-added service to the community.
Missoula Urban Demonstration Project	62104		/users/profile/67887	Chris	Volunteer	5	02/01/2011	MUD is one of Missoula's treasure organizations.  Supporting urban sustainable living, MUD's Backyard Sustainability workshop series always introduces something new and makes the subject matter accessible to everyone! The Tool Library and Truck Share make it possible for any Missoulian to work on their home and/or garden regardless of whether they own the necessary equipment.  I love Missoula Urban Demonstration Project & proud to be a member.

Buffalo Field Campaign	301849	1	/users/profile/392906	kllyon01	General Member of the Public	5	08/29/2016	Buffalo Field Campaign is a dedicated group of people who put themselves on the line, in the field, and in between those who do the bison harm.  These are special animals that deserve to live in peace in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem protected as our National Mammal. It's absurd that these iconic, majestic creatures are hazed, and hunted, and sent to slaughter by the hundreds from within and around their migration routes in the part.. IF the BFC was not there to observe and document, we would not know the injustices being done in places most of us will never see.  I am so impressed by the dedication of BFC staff to this great cause. This is a non-profit that deserves support to continue their important work. 
Buffalo Field Campaign	301844		/users/profile/392901	Christopher79	Donor	5	08/29/2016	A small but energetic and effective organization with a narrow goal of saving Yellowstone bison and a wide goal of restoring the Greater Yeklowstone Ecosystem.

I have had them as my preferred charity on goodsearch/goodshop.com and smile.amazon.com for a while now. It's an effortless way to donate to this MOST worthy and noble cause  every time you shop for things you need anyway. Support them - and Let the Buffalo Roam !!!

Buffalo Field Campaign	301832	3	/users/profile/392888	ForTheOceans	Donor	5	08/29/2016	This incredible non-profit does so much with so little. Dedicated, enduring, passionate and suffering along with the buffalo, they are so impressive and so admirable and so determined. Our National Heritage buffalo/bison are the target of hunters and hunter-controlled government agencies, with even the Park Service unwilling to stand up for the defenseless buffalo who are only trying to live and survive in areas that have been their homeland since the beginning. BFC is their voice and their advocate when others are to busy to care.  This is, indeed, a non-profit that walks the walk.
Buffalo Field Campaign	301821	3	/users/profile/392873	Stephanie254	Donor	5	08/29/2016	I have been a supporter for Buffalo Field Campaign for several years. They are a hard working group that put their actual lives on the line to watch over the national animal . the buffalo have been threatened and endangered by various props who fly over them and hassle the new young ones and mothers. It's called razing. BCF put out a monthly letter on line to help us all stay on top of what is going on out in the natural habitat of this majestic and honored creature. They strive to maintain peaceful solutions and have the backing of many fine legal services. They volunteer!!! to keep our national animal safe from two legged predators. Contact them to join in this service to the future of this fragile world and this ancient creature. Tatanka!!

Extinction events are tied to loss of diversity and low planetary oxygen, that's in the geologic record and we are now reducing oxygen rapidly and losing over 200-species per day knowing that for a new species the event is rare, not yearly, not decadal, hardly by century at times.The ungulate bond to an apex-predator balance held over many thousands of years in plenty.Perhaps the reins now need to pass back to those that honored what worked and there was no hunger unless all were hungry, there was bounty shared and respect given to good thinkers, people with insight to past-present-future being tied and always ongoing together.The Western Culture can learn, we assume, yet not until it puts down the crown of arrogance of being "in charge", to not dominate and conquer, to communicate and share to go back to a worthy ethic of behavior for future people to honor, not the ransacked, stripped down and left behind planet we see today.The Buffalo is the basis of a Culture, it's not just an animal to kill for food, that's an insight into how to honor any animal, to live with them in abundance again.

Their dedication to saving the remaining wild buffalo is tireless and inspiring. They communicate with the world why this needs to be done and teaches through their videos, books, webpage, social media and road shows the importance of saving our national species for future generations.  Along with doing the actual work of videoing and being with the buffalo during harsh roundups and slaughter, they write books and create educational videos for adults and children alike.  They have always treated their donors with respect and I know in my heart that they are the best non-profit around. Even when things get tight financially, we donate to Buffalo Field Campaign. Their work is that important to us.

Buffalo Field Campaign	203839	5	/users/profile/265884	momlovell	Donor	5	06/26/2014	As far as I know, the Buffalo Field Campaign is the only nonprofit that is trying to keep our wild buffalo (bison) alive and well and not confined to only one place, but spread out like they used to be before they were nearly exterminated. They have had a hard go of it with the ranchers and still do. The buffalo are mistreated and/or killed by the ranchers at times, even the baby calves. Sad situation. They need all the help they can get so that our descendants can still see part of our history in America.

They harm no one and just want to live their lives as do all wildlife.  None should be protected over another, all should be respected by all.  Special interest has no place moving and invading in places where they need not be.  Please donate anything you can to help protect these magnificent animals, who are a part of our history that we should be honoring .  That is what the work of BFC is all about, every single day.  They need our voice and our donations to help continue their important work.

When volunteering to save wild buffalo I felt like I was doing something very cause worthy. These buffalo don't have a voice. We must be their voice. This is the last remaining genetically pure buffalo in the world, and they deserve our attention and compassion.
Buffalo Field Campaign	205192	2	/users/profile/267306	WyomingEvie	General Member of the Public	5	07/05/2014	 This is the ONLY group working to save the last wild herd of bison.   Even tho federal laws state that federal lands are SUPPOSED to be partially for the preservation of the last wild herds of wildlife;  horses, bison, wolves, mountain goats and sheep.....TOO OFTEN ranching interests and energy company interests trump these promises.  Buffalo Field Campaign volunteers and staff live there near the bison, they monitor what is going on, and keep the rest of us informed when the Feds and the ranchers start hazing or murdering or trapping  these wild herds.   NOBODY else does this work.  
Buffalo Field Campaign	205175	2	/users/profile/267280	marylahren	Donor	5	07/04/2014	The Buffalo Field Campaign is simply the best.  They are the only ones that try to protect Yellowstone buffalo from harassment and death at the hands of the National Park Service and the Montana Department of Livestock in the winter; the very same buffalo that visitors from all over the world come to see in the summer.  What a crazy agenda.  I love and respect the Buffalo Field Campaign for their dedication and hard work against a corrupt government system.
Buffalo Field Campaign	204755	1	/users/profile/266795	lilrebel67	General Member of the Public	5	06/30/2014	I have followed this organization for a number of years and have been impressed with their persistence, passion, and dedication to the last genetically pure herd of bison left in the U.S.   They never bow to intimidation by local, state or federal authorities because they operate within the structure of the law.  Their work is both physically and emotionally draining, and they may become discouraged, but they never give up.  They know they are the only voice the buffalo of Yellowstone have, and if they stop advocating, this last pocket of genetically pure buffalo will be lost to the greed of the livestock industry.  This is an organization that operates basically from volunteers and donations, and they do so much with so little.  Educational and outreach programs, along with documenting buffalo migration, hazing and slaughter by officials, and cooperation with local ranchers and land owners, make this organization an outstanding non-profit.

After hearing there pitch and making a donation, I have made a donation every year since then as they continue their mission. I love that my donation is going straight to the actual people in the field, not to fund raisers or highly paid executives. I get their weekly newsletters and appreciate the local information when planning a new trip to the area.

They are an amazing group of people who truly care about our bison and work not only on paper and over the internet, but literally have their boots on the ground everyday out in the field to make sure the bison are not being harassed by state/federal agencies. I love the buffalo - bought my home because of the bison that come through every spring/fall. Please help this wonderful organization as they go around the country and to Washington, D.C. to speak out on behalf of the wild Yellowstone bison.

Buffalo Field Campaign	204582	1	/users/profile/148383	mimejuly	Donor	5	06/29/2014	This is a wonderful organization which has set about to preserve the last remaining free roaming herd of wild buffalo in this country.  These people spend their lives out in the elements (winter too) protecting the buffalo of Yellowstone from our federal government as well as the government sponsored activities of Montana.  The Buffalo Field Campaign faces insurmountable odds as they try to protect the buffalo from the ignorance of the cattle industry, while the cattle industry has the backing of the state (of Montana) and federal officials.  The Buffalo Field Campaign survives from donations only.  One of the most pure and selfless organizations out there.  
Buffalo Field Campaign	109048	1	/users/profile/148383	mimejuly	General Member of the Public	5	04/05/2012	I ran across the Buffalo Field Campaign website after a visit to Yellowstone a couple of years ago.  While photographing these magnificent creatures, I had no idea of the danger they must face each and every year in order to survive.  We call ourselves a civilized people, but the cruelty unleashed on the buffalo is beyond inhumane.  The Buffalo Field Campaign is the only organization standing up to the cattlemen and the state of Montana in the constant inhumane battle that ensues year after year.  I shutter to think of what would have become of the Yellowstone Buffalo without the Buffalo Field Campaign's watchful eye and reports from the field.  The Buffalo Field Campaign struggles admist unfathomable conditions to protect these animals and to report to the public the grossly inhumane acts committed by our federal government in addition to the State of Montana.  They are the only honest voice for the Yellowstone Buffalo.  Roam Free! 
Buffalo Field Campaign	204578		/users/profile/266603	vonettabarnes	General Member of the Public	5	06/29/2014	BBC has consistently dedicated themselves to protecting our last wild buffalo. They have made amazing strides against the arrogant and the ignorant who would willing exterminate these intelligant, hearty, and family oriented living creatures.
Buffalo Field Campaign	204567	1	/users/profile/266591	ljstoffel	Volunteer	5	06/29/2014	For 10 years I have watched the activities of the Buffalo Field Campaign and 5 years ago volunteered for 2 weeks at their headquarters in MT.   They are well organized and use their limited donated funds very efficiently.  I have never seen a group of people so dedicated to their cause of holding Montana government and the Federal Park Service accountable for their actions relating to their treatment of the wild buffalo - with such love for these animals that they put themselves in harms way to protect them (always within the law, of course).   I honor their work and their humanity.  
Buffalo Field Campaign	204541		/users/profile/266565	Bucks	Volunteer	5	06/28/2014	What an awesome place. I discovered passion for a cause greater than myself. A wonderful community doing amazing work!  I wouldn't be the man I am without BFC. Spent 2+ years on site... Some of the hardest work but best memories of my life. 
Buffalo Field Campaign	204518		/users/profile/266538	Patrick42	General Member of the Public	5	06/28/2014	After everything they have endured my heart goes out to the Bison . Nowhere else can I get such good information on the current herds . And learn about the current struggle for their survival . 
Buffalo Field Campaign	204513		/users/profile/266533	Michelle224	Donor	5	06/28/2014	Buffalo Field Campaign is a great example of what a nonprofit should be and do. They are professional and passionate staff and volunteer members. It's obvious that they put their funds into their work for the benefit of the buffalo and not to benefit themselves. 
Buffalo Field Campaign	204511		/users/profile/266530	Buffalospirit	Donor	5	06/28/2014	I have been a donor AND I also volunteered one week with this amazing organization.  Every bit of resources goes into efforts that directly affect saving the buffalo.  I work in the nonprofit area myself, so I am keen to seeing how a nonprofit uses its resources and the results it is attaining.  Buffalo Field Campaign is one of those organizations that I am more than happy and willing to assist in its mission to save these magnificent icons of our nation's history.  In addition to the animal rights work that they do, the organization also addresses environmental rights as well as human rights in relation to the "battles" that Native Americans still experience in the region, including those that connect them with the buffalo.  Education and on-the-ground, one-on-one work with the buffalo and the public make this one of my top organizations to support.  
Buffalo Field Campaign	204508		/users/profile/266527	Bibi_LeBee	General Member of the Public	5	06/28/2014	BFC is one of the best front-lines organizations working for animal and environmental rights.  I greatly admire them because they consistently distribute scientific evidence against the main underpinning of ranchers' prejudice against bison; and because they work on many levels to ensure the last wild bison can survive not just in Yellowstone, but also in more of their preferred habitat beyond park borders.  Their on the ground coverage of what happens during the annual hazing of the bison speaks louder than any words they could say, and their love for the creatures is clearly their driving force.
Buffalo Field Campaign	204507		/users/profile/266526	Bethany Y.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/28/2014	Buffalo Field Campaign is one of the best nonprofits I've ever supported.  Never have I seen such a professional outfit run by such passionate volunteers and staff members.  It's obvious that they put their funds into their work for the benefit of the buffalo and not to benefit themselves as you sometimes see with other nonprofits.  BFC's mission is clear, and they live it every day, in the field, in the courtroom, in ACTION to make a real difference.  We are so fortunate to have such a wonderful nonprofit protecting America's last wild buffalo.
Buffalo Field Campaign	204504		/users/profile/266523	msbandit	General Member of the Public	5	06/28/2014	Few organizations -conservation oriented or otherwise - actually work in the field and keep their purpose as focused and pure as the Buffalo Field Campaign. This is a frontline, active group of dedicated people trying to preserve a vital part of our American heritage.
Buffalo Field Campaign	204497		/users/profile/40021	katy5	Donor	5	06/28/2014	BFC was the first organization to bring the plight of America's last truly wild bison to the public view over a decade ago. Through bitter cold and heat 365 days /year they are in the field with the buffalo documenting and publicizing the senseless outrages committed by state and federal government agencies against these iconic creatures. They soldiered on through many grim sad days when 100s of bison were inhumanely rounded up and hauled to slaughter, for the supposed bogus reason of controlling brucellosis when the real purpose of the kills was for population control. Ranchers don't want bison grazing on range that they could be running cows on even if that range is located on the public's land.
Buffalo Field Campaign	111082		/users/profile/40021	katy5	Donor	5	04/29/2012	I have been following and supporting this fine organization for over 10 years. They selflessly follow the last genetically wild remnants of the Great Herd that was all but wiped out in the 1800s. They document and spread the word about the atrocities commited against these buffalo by the federal government and the state of Montana who are perpetuating the range war against the buffalo. These icons of the West, which are valuable wildlife belonging to all Americans, are being senselessly harassed, injured and slaughtered with taxpayer money. Buffalo Field Campaign deserves my praise and donations because they efficiently and selflessly stretch those contributions; they are the only group in the field day in, day out patrolling on behalf of the buffalo.
Buffalo Field Campaign	39089	5	/users/profile/40021	katy5	Donor	5	05/15/2010	Their excellent newsletters keep me informed about what is happening to the herd and let me know what I can do to help out. They are compassionate, caring, committed individuals who have dedicated their lives to the cause of preserving this last remnant of a once mighty herd of buffalo. They have responded with handwritten thank you notes of gratitude for donations -- a couple I really cherish -enclosed in one was a small tuft of real buffalo hair that had been shed in the spring-- the front of another card had a group picture of the volunteers and staff with snowflakes falling. In the 10 years since I discovered the Buffalo Field Campaign they have  worked tirelessly to protect these bison, have accomplished much and saved many buffalo lives.
Buffalo Field Campaign	204494		/users/profile/266513	buffalogirls	General Member of the Public	5	06/28/2014	I first heard of the Buffalo Field Campaign when a young man disrupted the slaughter of the buffalo this spring. I was very impressed with his commitment and understood his feelings and frustration at trying to deal with agencies that get so bogged down in red tape. I am very impressed with the amount of sourced, educational information on the Buffalo Field Campaign's website. These folks are so committed and clear in their goals and they make a lot of sacrifices to protect the buffalo. For those who value the lives of some of the last truly iconic and wild animals on our continent, this organization deeply deserves our support.
Buffalo Field Campaign	204478		/users/profile/266498	Gerry2	General Member of the Public	5	06/28/2014	They go above and beyond to show the plight of our buffalo. They speak the truth and show the pictures of how the buffalo are being harassed by the state and fed govt.  They are in the field with the buffalo rain, shine and snow, such dedication.
Buffalo Field Campaign	204457		/users/profile/266475	Greg48	General Member of the Public	4	06/28/2014	The BFC is out 365 days a year working to protect the bison.  They document, report and speak for the bison at meetings.  And as far as I know they are all non paid volunteers!
Buffalo Field Campaign	204453		/users/profile/266472	pms_ing	General Member of the Public	5	06/28/2014	I love the work they do and the information they provide about the cause.  I have learned a lot from them over the past year.
Buffalo Field Campaign	204451		/users/profile/266470	Daniellah	Donor	5	06/28/2014	The Buffalo of the America's are a great symbol of strength.. an icon of what America once was and can be again. The Buffalo Field Campaign is an amazing organization helping to protect these humble giants. Helping to preserve their rights and land access. They are one of the best non-profits working in America today. I truly wish they would get more recognition and support.
Buffalo Field Campaign	204450		/users/profile/266469	Ann_83	Donor	5	06/28/2014	BFC is the only organization working in the field and with policy-makers to protect Yellowstone's wild bison from hazing and death. Their work is indispensable to saving the nation's last, truly wild bison herd. I had not idea the bison were being 'hazed', i.e. bullied, chased and driven to death until I heard a presentation by Mike of the BFC. I have visited Yellowstone twice in 2014, and have fallen in love with bison. It's a shame that local cattle ranchers, and many in the Montana government, insist on their plan of exterminating wild bison by continuing to perpetuate the myth that bison are carriers of brucellosis. Bison are America's iconic land mammal, and BFC is to be commended for its 'boots on the ground' work. I am proud to be a supporter of Buffalo Field Campaign.
Buffalo Field Campaign	204447		/users/profile/266467	JMBundy	Donor	5	06/28/2014	The Yellowstone buffalo is very special to me.  a number of years ago, by accident, I was blessed  when I went eye to eye with one of these magnificent creatures and their Soul became part of my soul.  BFC  puts their heart and soul into trying to provide the buffalo with peace and justice on their land.  This group is one of the few nonprofits who give completely of themselves in an effort to preserve and protect  part of our countries heritage, the wild and free buffalo.
Buffalo Field Campaign	204445		/users/profile/266465	wolfshield	General Member of the Public	5	06/28/2014	For years I have followed the work of the Buffalo Field Campaign and I must say with all sincerity without them the Buffalo population would be treated without regard.  In very recent time they have kept us enlightened to the plight of the great buffalo and has made it possible for us to react to each dilemma.   As of Native American descent, I believe, that the Buffalo should stand side by side with the Bald Eagle as the American symbol.  This organization is the trustees of the Buffalo.  I will stand to say this nonprofit is a GREAT nonprofit and deserves recognition for all their hard work. 
Buffalo Field Campaign	204444		/users/profile/266464	Jim_103	Donor	5	06/28/2014	Buffalo Field Campaign is the only organization I know of that actually has a "boots on the ground" philosophy when it comes to protecting and saving our nations' last wild bison herds.  When you stop to think that literally millions upon millions of these noble beasts once roamed wild and free, it should break your heart to learn that state and federal government agencies seem to desire nothing more than the complete eradication of bison from our planet.  I support BFC and their mission and I ask that you join me and the others who believe the Bison should be protected and left to roam free and wild.  Stop the hazing, stop the trapping and stop the killing!
Buffalo Field Campaign	204443		/users/profile/266461	Jim_102	General Member of the Public	5	06/28/2014	I support and believe in their mission:"Buffalo Field Campaign is the only group working in the field and on the policy front to protect the wild bison of the Yellowstone ecosystem."
Buffalo Field Campaign	204441		/users/profile/266459	Debbie124	General Member of the Public	5	06/28/2014	I was invited to visit BFC and spend a few days with them last summer  it was a great experience the people at BFC are an awesome bunch they are hard working and the Buffalo are there life,and it was the best life experience I have ever had.Keep up the good work guys and gals you all rock.
Buffalo Field Campaign	204434		/users/profile/266453	Steve110	Client Served	5	06/28/2014	I want the last wild bison to roam free. Buffalo Field Campaign helps protect the herd, educate the public, and encourage the survival of the last remaining wild bison in the United States and world. This is important to all conservationists, US citizens and biodiversity advocates the world over. The alternative is extinction.
Buffalo Field Campaign	204432		/users/profile/266452	hmsenita	Donor	5	06/28/2014	Buffalo have always been a spirit of Spirit in our presents. The destruction of their life brings huge sadness to all of God's creation. This is the most respected 501c3 I know of to help protect buffalo. too much bloodshed has happened already. These are the bravest, true to their calling I have  ever known. I only wish I could help them even more.Blessings,HMSenita
Buffalo Field Campaign	204344		/users/profile/266358	ihunktonwan	Professional with expertise in this field	1	06/27/2014	This organization has no integrity when dealing with people who do not fully agree with their positions. They utilize their membership to attack organizations and individuals by using false statements and when confronted for their actions place the blame on their membership by stating they can't control what individuals do. They act as an agitator yet do not accept responsibility for things they cause.
Buffalo Field Campaign	204321		/users/profile/48597	rumpfl	Donor	5	06/27/2014	As they say, they are the only group IN THE FIELD helping this much-endangered American icon and I am proud to help BFC in any way I can!
Buffalo Field Campaign	204300		/users/profile/266316	suzigard	Donor	5	06/27/2014	The BFC is the ONLY organization that is doing something hands-on, proactively to protect the bison. They devote their lives to saving the last wild bison; educating the public; having the courage, the guts, to stand up to the governmental (both state and federal) agencies who allow themselves to be manipulated by ranchers. I had the honor of hearing Daniel Brister give his first-hand experience as the head of BFC. He explained in detail  what BFC does and  elaborated on the experiences of BFC. He gave anecdotes and examples  of the behavior of the bison, which made  the importance of saving them so much more powerful. 
Buffalo Field Campaign	204278		/users/profile/266296	codygoodnough	Volunteer	5	06/27/2014	With so much harassment that is put on bison in Yellowstone and through out the country, the BFC is wonderful for what they do and is an absolute necessity to end this ridiculous harassment that is put on bison for ridiculous reasons. Although there are many people who disagree with what happens with bison, there aren't very many organizations doing much about it except for the BFC. They're an excellent organization and they make a difference everyday.
Buffalo Field Campaign	204260		/users/profile/266278	ladykspiderclan	Volunteer	5	06/27/2014	Totally worthwhile organization that is trying to protect the last few iconic animals before greedy ranchers destroy them all.  I enjoy getting the photographic updates and specific suggestions on what I can do to help their efforts. 
Buffalo Field Campaign	204239		/users/profile/266259	Eensii	General Member of the Public	5	06/27/2014	This is a wonderful nonprofit agency that is in the field yearround to preserve our last wild buffalo.  They do wonderful work trying to protect the buffalo while having to watch constant harrassment of the buffalo, especially the mothers and new calves every spring being hazed by various governmental departments for absolutely no valid reason.  This is a very important organization constantly working in the field through volunteers to protect our last living wild buffalo.  These wild buffalo MUST be protected to preserve our last living animals that are free roaming in Yellowstone National Park.  Please give my review some serious attention so that we can preserve our last wild buffalo.  Thank you for your consideration.  
Buffalo Field Campaign	204235		/users/profile/266256	Roger27	Volunteer	5	06/27/2014	Montana bison are the icon of our western history. BFC is a small but efficacious organization that hourly dedicates itself to preserving this historical icon.
Buffalo Field Campaign	204222		/users/profile/265387	TripleJAZ	Donor	5	06/27/2014	This is an organization that without a doubt has been in the trenches day in and day out for the buffalo. They are 100%++ committed to the buffalo's well-being and the right to live, even when there are others who want to abuse them and kill them.   They are there while we cannot be there, raising awareness, watching out for their safety on the roads, tirelessly trying to protect them against very misguided and wrongful politically-driven hazing and round-ups by government entities. If BFC didn't exist I wonder if these buffalo would ever have a chance against the politically-driven forces that want to wipe them out.  BFC is a critical member of the greater Yellowstone community.  When I support them and their efforts, I am a part of the greater Yellowstone community, along with local residents and ranchers who want to see these buffalo live.  BFC vigilently fights for the buffalo's right to live.  All with extremely modest financial resources.  Thank you BFC! 
Buffalo Field Campaign	204165		/users/profile/266184	Yellowstone	Donor	5	06/27/2014	The Buffalo Field Campaign works tirelessly in the greater Yellowstone area for improved treatment of our free roaming herds of wild buffalo.  They  monitor the herds, keep tabs on law enforcement harassment of herds and fight legislatively to protect the buffalo.  I have loved the strength and endurance of the buffalo for many years.  The thought that they were on the brink of extinction, from numbers in the millions, all due to human intervention is tragic.I am so grateful to the members of the Buffalo Field Campaign for their on site efforts to help the buffalo to survive and thrive.  They deserve to be more widely known and supported.  I hope this review helps.
Buffalo Field Campaign	204162		/users/profile/266181	Buffalolady	General Member of the Public	5	06/27/2014	The BFC volunteers live their lives with and for the Buffalo. I became aware of them about 20 years ago. I have donated money and bought books to help in what little way I can. Following the BFC over the years I have to admire them for what they do. They have grown in their impact for what they do for the Buffalo. Out in the field 365 days a year, enduring the weather to help the Buffalo live their lives in peace. What the DOL does is pure harrassment. A truly admiral group of people, the BFC deserves any and all the support they can get. Reba Holt
Buffalo Field Campaign	204140		/users/profile/266160	DonR2	General Member of the Public	4	06/27/2014	Rarely do you find a group of people doing so much on a shoestring budget.  They accomplish this through resourceful use of assets, close community contact and leveraging social media tools; three keys of success for a Great Nonprofit. The staff has tremendous courage of conviction to  stand against the efforts and actions of multiple federal and state agencies as well as local and regional cattleman associations.  Such dedication takes on a "David and Goliath" character when you consider the wealth and power they're up against.  This perseverance in the face of adversity speaks to their staying power, both physical and philosophical. We visited Yellowstone on our family trip to the High Plains a few years back and were inspired by the iconic wildlife; antelope, elk, bison, wolves and more.  Upon our return I discovered the efforts of BFC and others to expand wild bison habitat within Greater Yellowstone.  Since bison are a linchpin species of the plains I can think of few other wildlife conservation efforts that merit more attention.
Buffalo Field Campaign	204103		/users/profile/266124	BabsBryan	General Member of the Public	4	06/27/2014	Buffalo Field Campaign provides valuable information to the public about the plight of surviving buffalo in this nation. This is information that the public would never hear learn from broadcast news or any media outlets. It also educates interested citizens about interactions they can have with elected officials and state and national bureaucracies on behalf of buffalo.
Buffalo Field Campaign	204101		/users/profile/37780	mylesmom	Donor	5	06/27/2014	The BFC volunteers are extremely dedicated and are in the field 365 days a year working to protect our beloved buffalo from the unnecessary harassment and slaughter by the MT Dept. of Livestock. They put donations to good work by raising public awareness and fighting in the courts. They are one of my favorite animal rights organizations and know that one day because of their hard work and dedication, the buffalo will be allowed to roam free on their land once again.
Buffalo Field Campaign	110234		/users/profile/37780	mylesmom	Donor	5	04/19/2012	The Buffalo Field Campaign is one of my favorite charities.  They are the only ones in the field 24/7 working to help keep our Yellowstone buffalo from being exterminated by the Montana Dept. of Livestock. They use peaceful means to film the horrors the state of Montana continues to perpetrate upon these gentle giants. There is no brucellosis issue, but the govt. makes one up to keep the ranchers happy. The people running BFC do so on a shoe string budget and are always in need of supplies and funds so they can continue their fight to make the public and politicians aware of the the buffalo's plight.
Buffalo Field Campaign	37014	6	/users/profile/37780	mylesmom	Donor	5	04/26/2010	The Buffalo Field Campaign is a dedicated, courageous group of people who have dedicated themselves to stop the slaughter of our precious Yellowstone buffalo herd. The buffalo are hazed, abused and slaughtered every year by the Montana Dept. of Livestock to keep the ranchers happy. It is totally unnecessary and cruel beyond belief and the BFC volunteers are there to witness and speak out on behalf of these magnificent animals 365 days a year.
Buffalo Field Campaign	204096		/users/profile/266119	donala	Volunteer	5	06/27/2014	As an animal welfare activist for 30+ years I have never seen an organization so fiercely dedicated to their cause of protecting America's last remaining wild bison!  These folks don't just talk the talk, they walk the walk, come hell and high waters!  
Buffalo Field Campaign	204081	1	/users/profile/266105	Joyce39	Donor	5	06/27/2014	I have watched and read all their emails and they are working so hard to protect America's original herd of Buffalo without a lot of funding and continually fighting an uphill battle with our Government that they deserve more recognition and applause and support than they are currently getting.  They definitely deserve 5 Stars.
Buffalo Field Campaign	204060	1	/users/profile/266085	Moonflower	General Member of the Public	5	06/26/2014	This is an amazing and caring group of individuals who keeps the public aware of the plight of the buffalo through hot or cold, rain or sunshine and thick and thin.   They are dedicated to the cause....not only those in the field but Stephany Seay and Dan Brister, too.   So many are involved in planning activities that keep the buffalo in the public's eye.    I have been a supporter of the BFC for many years and will continue to do so.   This compassionate group of people who volunteer their services is just amazing.   They are true blessings.   Thank you BFC for all the good work you do!    I know it is a slow process to win freedom for the bison but you have stood strong through it all.   
Buffalo Field Campaign	204033		/users/profile/266059	Advocate100	Donor	5	06/26/2014	I have been donating to Buffalo Field Campaign for many years.  This is a group of dedicated, committed individuals who will risk their own well-being for the benefit of the Yellowstone bison herd, and the Yellowstone bison herd definitely needs all the help it can get defending itself against special interest groups in Montana. This is a grassroots organization that can use more help as it has to go up against special interests as well as state and federal government.  Any activism and/or donation is time and money well spent!!!       
Buffalo Field Campaign	204007		/users/profile/266035	ivanprice13	Donor	5	06/26/2014	I have been limitedly involved with BFC, a pirchaser of supplies, a donor, and a limited activist. I am so impressed with what they do and am really irritated with how the State of Montana and the Federal Government have to spend money to haze and creat problems for the wonderful critters that BFC assists and cares for with all their efforts and their volunteers.
Buffalo Field Campaign	203983		/users/profile/266017	Bend_lady	Donor	5	06/26/2014	When I first learned about the BFC I checked out the website and was extremely impressed with their work and their commitment. Volunteers are there year-round in temperatures reaching 60 degrees below zero as well as in the heat, going out in the field daily to document the abuses brought on by government agencies. These abuses are the result of urging from the huge cattle industry in Montana and are spurred by grazing issues, not the health issue they claim exists. The scientific and common sense arguments that have been explained on the BFC site are very compelling. I wanted to help so I gathered a carload of items from their 2013 Wishlist, using a few of my own and buying others at yard sales. In September I drove them from Bend, Oregon to their lodge outside West Yellowstone. I was able to see the facility with its main lodge, cabins, yurts, and tee pee and it was obvious that the staff lives a very simple lifestyle. It's a small but hard working group and their advocacy efforts have lead to successful changes so far while more is needed . While there I learned that they receive praise and thanks even from those who oppose their efforts.  That's because the BFC helps protect buffalo in any way they can, including posting road signs warning motorists when the huge animals are on or near roadways. This not only keeps bison from being killed but keeps humans from having accidents and totaling their cars, to say nothing of possibly being hurt or even killed. The weekly email updates with new videos, photos, and commentary are both excellent and inspiring when we see the truth about what is happening. I've already gathered more needed items from yard sales and will be making another trip in September of 2014. The people of the Buffalo Field Campaign are truly dedicated and appreciate all donations of any size, tangible or monetary. 
Buffalo Field Campaign	203970		/users/profile/266005	Cheryl96	Donor	5	06/26/2014	I support the Buffalo Field campaign for their non-profit work to protect the Yellowstone bison herd. This herd is descended from the small group found in the park after it was assumed that all the bison were gone.  The BFC is trying to expand the area that the bison are allowed to roam while following their natural migration pattern.  They are up against strong opposition from various agencies with the objective to confine the bison to Yellowstone Park. The herd is faced with hazing, abuse and slaughter during the spring. BFC is there to document and observe. They spend time educating the public about their goal to have the bison allowed to roam free. This group has the support of many across the country for their dedication to such an important cause of protecting this herd for the future.
Buffalo Field Campaign	203967		/users/profile/266003	bben805	Donor	5	06/26/2014	BFC has wonderfully dedicated volunteers who work tirelessly for the only continuously wild bison herd in the United States.  They do a great job informing the public about the need for help, and the illegal actions of the Montana DOL.  Progress is being made, at last!  Someday soon I hope to go out there and volunteer for a month or two for this group, BFC. 
Buffalo Field Campaign	203957		/users/profile/265993	fflover	Donor	5	06/26/2014	What a wonderful group, standing up for the rights of the bison in and around Yellowstone.
Buffalo Field Campaign	203954		/users/profile/150832	BobKat	Donor	5	06/26/2014	I support the work of the Buffalo Field Campaign for several reasons.  First, the white man nearly drove the bison to extinction, as a means, to gain control of Native Americans.  Native Americans were very dependent on the bison for food and clothing.  Today, big business(cattle) do not want to share grazing space, on public lands, with the bison.  BFC is standing up for the bison's right to graze on their native lands.    
Buffalo Field Campaign	110813		/users/profile/150832	BobKat	Donor	4	04/26/2012	Please support the Buffalo Field Campaign!!  They are the only friends the buffalo have.  Man's intolerance of the buffalo did not stop once they were almost driven to extinction.  Even today, man does not acknowledge the buffalo's right to exist and live its life as a free wild animal.  Does using the word "manage" and "wildlife" in the same sentence seem rather out of place to you?  All of God's creatures have the "right" to live on this planet, but man seems to think that he is the only one that counts.  SO WRONG!!!  Please help support the Buffalo Field Campaign.  The buffalos only hope!!!
Buffalo Field Campaign	203935		/users/profile/265972	Michael253	Donor	5	06/26/2014	BFC is trying to save buffalo, that have not been mixed with cattle, from extinction. They are opposed by cattle interests, supported by the federal government, that, in violation of Montana law, value animals only as direct cash commodities.  Against intense government/corporate opposition and with few assets, they do the work of St. Francis. 
Buffalo Field Campaign	203921		/users/profile/265959	Karmen	Donor	5	06/26/2014	BFC does on the ground tangible actions that make a difference. They are the only group doing this work. 
Buffalo Field Campaign	203920		/users/profile/265958	Brenda58	General Member of the Public	5	06/26/2014	I came across this organization  and found that they were doing  seriously needed work. They are the only group trying to save our iconic Buffalo from extinction. The government agencies involved appear to have one goal and one goal only and that is the total extinction of these buffalo. There is no reason except there made up ones. Like the buffalo are a danger to cattle .There has never been any livestock contaminated by a buffalo.. Thank God that these people have the moxie to stand strong against the government and livestock industry. They can use all the help they can get, they are standing strong against a formidable enemy. BUFFALO FIELD CAMPAIGN is  a great nonprofit.  Even though I have only sent information over the net I still feel that this is a very worth while organization.
Buffalo Field Campaign	203908		/users/profile/265946	KC04	Donor	5	06/26/2014	The work done online and in the field by the Buffalo Field Campaign is amazing and awe inspiring.  The see the need to protect these wild bison and go above and beyond performing their duties to make these great animals free roaming.  I am a avid supporter for them because I see daily the good work they do.  They are a valuable asset in the fight for the wild buffalo and educate people as to the importance of allowing them to be free roaming.  I can't also donate but when possible I try and send small donations when I can.  I can think of no greater joy than the sense of pride I feel when I know in my small way I am doing my part to help out.

Buffalo Field Campaign	203902		/users/profile/265938	Jacki H.	General Member of the Public	5	06/26/2014	 I have followed Buffalo Field Campaign for a number of years cheering them on for their tireless devotion to "our" last herd of wild Buffalo in hope they will some day be free to roam. I know of no other wild animals that are restricted in their movements ! This hazing done by the DOL, I believe is so their cattle have all the grasses while the buffalo have to dig quite a ways down in the snow just to get a mouthful of grasses. My hat's off to these tireless volunteers watching over the buffalo, I wish I could do more for them outside of getting 2 of their calendars... Gentle LightJacki
Buffalo Field Campaign	203878		/users/profile/265917	BostonGreenmonster	Donor	5	06/26/2014	Buffalo Field Campaign is a wonderful organization working to save the last wild buffalo.  It is an extremely valuable nonprofit group whose dedicated leadership, volunteers, and donors work tirelessly to save the magnificent wild buffalo.  I have donated to them on several occasions, and I have volunteered for them by helping to spread the word about the struggles of the last wild buffalo.  A gift to this organization is an extremely worthwhile use of your hard-earned money.
Buffalo Field Campaign	203853		/users/profile/265896	Tallen2007	General Member of the Public	5	06/26/2014	They are dedicated to preserving our last freely migrating herds of bison. This organization not only educates the public about the reason why the laws are should be overturned that encourage slaughter of healthy bison (because they do not spread brucellosis to cattle) but they also keep us informed of the illegal operations of the State and Federal Gov when they break written laws and trespass on private property so we can then write letters to Congress with our concerns. 
Buffalo Field Campaign	203847		/users/profile/265890	BuffaloNationalTreasure	Donor	5	06/26/2014	I have donated monthly to this group since 2006 when they visited my small town and gave a presentation including video of how the buffalo are being harassed by state agents and prevented from following natural paths to their food sources. They showed buffalo being shot dead at a 15 foot range, and another buffalo nudging the dead one trying to get it to stand up.  It was absolutely heartbreaking.  It was clear that these animals understood the loss of their herd mates. Members of this group have periodically revisited my town in subsequent years, and told several stories which indicate that the buffalo seem to understand that some humans are trying to help them. Some people will accuse us of anthropomorphizing, but there is more and more scientific evidence coming to recent light that different kinds of mammals have complex emotions and have similar patterns of brain activity as humans do when having experiences that would elicit emotions in humans. The on-the-ground volunteers in this group are out there monitoring the buffalo situations in all kinds of bad weather conditions.  They are true heroes.
Buffalo Field Campaign	203845		/users/profile/265888	MusicLover67	General Member of the Public	5	06/26/2014	A worthwhile project carried out on a shoestring.  Roam Free!
Buffalo Field Campaign	152373		/users/profile/150916	Mary Franck	Donor	5	04/05/2013	Kudos to these folks who look out for the wild buffalo by being with the buffalo, watching the buffalo, videotaping the buffalo, and placing themselves between the buffalo and the government and private enterprises targeting the buffalo. The government and private livestock interests attempt and succeed at capturing and killing the wild buffalo who happen to wander outside of Yellowstone National Park. The job that BFC does is dangerous, controversial,  and with few rewards other than the safety and continuation of the last native free roaming herd of buffalo. Study and support them, please.
Buffalo Field Campaign	110871		/users/profile/150916	Mary Franck	Donor	5	04/27/2012	I am deeply moved at the commitment exhibited by the Buffalo Field Campaign.  I am amazed at their thoroughness of communication. I am impressed at their research. I am grateful for their physical presence in the field on behalf of the wild buffalo.  Their webpage and weekly updates are second-to-none.  Not to mention that when working in the field they are dealing with some of the harshest weather in the lower 48.  West Yellowstone leads the nation in being the  coldest spot and to think of living there and being out in the field day after day speaks volumes to their passion. 
Buffalo Field Campaign	146588		/users/profile/37384	suki1	Donor	5	12/13/2012	Buffalo Field Campaign is the only non-profit fully dedicated to the rights of the last native free roaming herd of buffalo in the U.S.  This herd of buffalo is genetically endangered and our government is treating them as livestock, harrassing and torturing them so that cattle can graze the public lands that the buffalo have migrated on for eons.  Buffalo Field Campaign is on the ground daily to document the horrific treatment of these majestic animals.  They travel the country to bring awareness and truth to what's happening to the buffalo and interact personally with all donors.  The cattle industry in Montana and Wyoming are very powerful and Buffalo Field Campaign needs all the help they can get to fight the elimination of the buffalo for the sake of the holy cow.
Buffalo Field Campaign	89216		/users/profile/37384	suki1	Donor	5	05/25/2011	There is currently a war on against the last free roaming herd of buffalo in our nation.  Several thousand have been slaughtered since 2000.  Buffalo Field campaign is the only non-profit that is on the ground trying to save these amazing animals and fighting to keep our government from slaughtering buffalo for the sake of CATTLE, that are not endangered and could go anywhere other than where the buffalo roam.  BFC is a small non-profit w/o the worldwide awareness and support that  other large non-profits get.  Buffalo Field Campaign needs ALL the help it can get to help save the Yellowstone herd.  LET BUFFALO ROAM! 
Buffalo Field Campaign	36590	6	/users/profile/37384	suki1	Donor	5	04/22/2010	Thank God there is this great group of people dedicated to saving our last native bison herd. Why is it such a fight to save this amazing part of American heritage. Why is it ok to slaughter to extinction, the animal on the nickel and the National Park Service logo?? For the sake of CATTLE, which should not be even be on the bison's native range, justifying their slaughter for a disease that has never been transferred from a bison to a cow! This is criminal behavior toward our native wildlife and needs to be stopped NOW before more beautiful buffalo are slaughtered for walking over an invisible line to try to live their lives as they have for eons.
Buffalo Field Campaign	142354		/users/profile/188816	Saveourwest	General Member of the Public	1	11/24/2012	These idiots do not know ANYTHING about buffalo; but pretend they are somehow experts because they follow buffalo in Yellowstone around with a camera & terrorize them.  There are over 500,000 buffalo owned privately in the USA & over 20,000 in National & State Parks.  They are not endangered in any way & all of these buffalo (including Yellowstone's) are of the same exact genetic DNA.  All descended from the last remaining buffalo saved by ranchers in the West.   To claim YNP buffalo are somehow "wild" is preposterous & untrue.  This organization is a sham & dosen't deserve NPO status. 
Buffalo Field Campaign	126620		/users/profile/171628	mt_ocean	Donor	5	10/17/2012	What an incredible organization Buffalo Field Campaign is! I recently learned about them and sent my first donation. I have never felt so appreciated for contributing to a cause in my life. Within a few days I received a hand-written thank you and a newsletter describing all their efforts to protect the Yellowstone buffalo, America's only continuously wild herd.  I will continue to support this hard working group.
Buffalo Field Campaign	125917		/users/profile/148408	Michela	General Member of the Public	5	10/16/2012	Buffalo Field Campaign is the only organization helping to restore the last wild population of American Buffalo. They are there day in and day out in the field with the buffalo to document the very unfair way the buffalo are treated in and around Yellowstone. I very much look forward to supporting BFC.
Buffalo Field Campaign	109068	3	/users/profile/148408	Michela	General Member of the Public	5	04/05/2012	Buffalo Field Campaign is the only organization that tells the truth about what is going on with America's last wild buffalo. They are on the front lines everyday to document what goes on in Yellowstone. They are a truly wonderful organization and I always look forward to news about the buffalo (especially when it is good news). 
Buffalo Field Campaign	111193		/users/profile/151339	Elizabeth47	General Member of the Public	5	05/01/2012	Its been several years since i have had the opportunity to visit the Buffalo Field Campaign but since that time i've done everything in my power to support them because i just can't think of a more dedicated grassroots movement or a more just cause.  A mad complex of government regulation, livestock and property laws and human dominion have woven an incredibly complex web around North America's last wild herd of Buffalo.  The BFC tirelessly roams great expanses of land in solidarity with these wild and majestic beings who predate our presence there and who's territory humans have carved up into pieces, drawing lines on the land that no creature can fathom.  BFC volunteers work in extreme weather conditions and extreme emotional conditions, standing witness as other humans harass, harm, capture and kill the Buffalo as they migrate across their instinctual homelands.  BFC volunteers work with local land owners, with the National Park Service, with all the government and state agencies involved in regulating the treatment and placement of the Buffalo.  They jump through the legal hoops, they work with the media, they travel the country to tell the story of the last wild herd of Buffalo and to call people's attention to the abuse inflicted upon them.  But what I stand in awe of is that the volunteers go back to the field, day after day to witness and record the hazing operations, mostly powerless to interrupt or stop it.  Imagine standing by with only your video camera and witnessing a very pregnant mama Buffalo birth her calf while surrounded by government agents on ATV's on in helicopters.  Imagine that calf's introduction to this world!  The calf's very first experience on earth is to be chased and harassed by humans, its first activity is to run for its brand new life, its first emotion is terror.  I saw this first hand many years ago and it took me to a deep place of dispair and complete shame, to watch people treat wild animals so heartlessly and agressively.  Many people of the BFC were present that day and are still present today.  They return again and again to a largely thankless, physically exhausting, emotionally taxing experience because their hearts compel them to honor, respect and stand in solidarity with the Buffalo.  I stand with the BFC for eternity, may their love and generosity prevail!
Buffalo Field Campaign	111170		/users/profile/151313	RobinA	General Member of the Public	5	04/30/2012	I find BFC's work in Yellowstone very important in saving native Buffalo. Our governmaent must be stopped from doing these kind of dastardly acts of "murder" to a animal that have been slaughter by us "Americans"! Wan't it bad enough we tried to exterminate the  Native Ameican (the real Americans)Peoples of this land!!! We are acting no better than the Nazi's did to the Jewish race!!BFC is our only real hope to save them, if and only if our government listens to the cry from it's people!!   BFC is #1 in my book!
Buffalo Field Campaign	111160		/users/profile/151301	Sunshinewmn	General Member of the Public	5	04/30/2012	They run an operation on a shoestring to be able to have people in the field, actually out with the buffalo, to document the hazing.  The buffalo are our national icon.  I am outraged that the federal government protects private cattle interests by hazing our national icon using taxpayer dollars.  Buffalo Field Campaign is the best watchdog for the buffalo.
Buffalo Field Campaign	111114		/users/profile/68884	ellengoodman1942	General Member of the Public	5	04/30/2012	The Buffalo Field Campaign does oustanding work in publicizing and protecting the bison of Yellowstone Park.
Buffalo Field Campaign	111112		/users/profile/151244	Brennan M.	Volunteer	5	04/30/2012	This is one of the best groups out there. I have spent time with them in the field. They make it possible for many people to directly support the yellowstone buffalo. They have housing, and activities for volunteer. They even feed everyone. Hand down, best green non-profit i know. 
Buffalo Field Campaign	111054		/users/profile/151139	kannice	General Member of the Public	5	04/29/2012	BFC is a wonderful organization bringing awareness of the plight of the American Buffalo to the public. Their compassion and endeavors to educate make them a phenomenal group that has been effective in protecting Buffalos.  Thank goodness they exist.
Buffalo Field Campaign	111035		/users/profile/37416	cin	Volunteer	5	04/28/2012	BFC  is an incredible organization that does more on the buffalo issue with a small budget than most of the big name, big budget enviros put together. They are amazing to volunteer for, and have trained countless new activists with skills they will carry for the rest of their lives, as well as a respect and understanding for wild that is irreplaceable. 
Buffalo Field Campaign	36626	7	/users/profile/37416	cin	Volunteer	5	04/23/2010	I have spent 5 spring seasons volunteering with BFC and find them to be one of the most dedicated front-lines environmental activist groups out there. They have a true vision of a land full of wild free-roaming buffalo that is inspiring, and have a multi-faceted practical approach to getting there - working not only in the field with the buffalo, but through the courts, through the legislative process, through public awareness campaigns, and through impressive coalition building.
Buffalo Field Campaign	111011		/users/profile/151085	mandbfox	Donor	5	04/28/2012	Buffalo Field Campaign works every day year-round to protect the Yellowstone Buffalo, (that belong to you and me) from harm to them from the Montana Department of Livestock,  (from hunting and hazing,)  the US department of Agriculture, (from useless and harmful testing,) and sometimes complicity of the Park Service that is supposed to protect the Park's wildlife, with the above two entities.  BFC keeps us appraised of current issues, and enables us to send messages to the appropriate agencies that need to hear from us on behalf of the buffalo.    While doing all of this, volunteers also man/woman the frontlines to observe and record the day-to-day things going on with the buffalo.  They endure cold, disappointment, even grief when a buffalo of any age is captured or killed.  Yet they keep working at this vital task to save our nation's last pure wild buffalo, considering it a joy and a privilege to serve these magnificent and endangered animals.   
Buffalo Field Campaign	111010		/users/profile/151084	sonoranconnect	General Member of the Public	5	04/28/2012	I had the opportunity on Thursday evening to attend Mike Meese's presentation on the treatment of Yellowstone National Parks wild buffalo herd at the hands of the Interagency Bison Management Plan. For those of you who are unfamiliar with the IBMP it does a great deal to protect local ranchers access to public lands and cheap grazing at the expense of the Yellowstone bison and the American taxpayer. Under the guise of disease prevention the last wild buffalo herd has been slaughtered, experimented on, hazed and generally mistreated in a way that can only be described as abusive.The video presentation was at times hard to watch as well as maddening but it was also at times uplifting in ways that I didn't expect. Images of injured newborn calves struggling to keep up with the herd as they were being hazed by agents of the government forced to run 15 miles in a single day will stick with me for a long, long time but so will the images and words of the BFC volunteers.The amazing level of commitment Mike and the other BFC volunteers exhibit is nothing short of inspiring. Willing to endure all kinds of weather and to place themselves in harms way to bear witness to the treatment of these magnificent animals while at the same time forsaking the creature comforts that most of us enjoy is frankly one of the most selfless acts I can recall. Bringing the plight of the Yellowstone Bison into public view has slowed their killing to a trickle to the credit of the BFC but BFC marches on not satisfied with their enormous success, concerned only with the work that still needs to be done to protect the bison. After more than a decade of advocating for the buffalo at Yellowstone BFC's commitment has not wavered and I have no doubt that they will continue until the buffalo can roam free.The buffalo's instinct's lead them to return to their ancestral lands but they are seeking more than just food. They are seeking their heritage, their place in a world that at least on public lands, lands that belong to you and me, should be guaranteed to them. Public lands should not be in the sole control of an industry that seeks only to enrich itself by removing native wildlife to make way for cattle grazing, an immoral and unjust act that should be outlawed.Buffalo Field Campaign continues to fight for the right of the last wild bison in America to exist. They are  fighting in the field and in the media as well as in the courts and they need our support. The first step is to contact BFC and become educated about what is really going on in Montana. Spread the word in support of BFC and the buffalo and make a donation to this amazing group.The Buffalo Field Campaign can be reached via: www.buffalofieldcampaign.org/ and don't miss these very compelling videos documenting the treatment of the buffalo. www.buffalofieldcampaign.org/media/bisonvideogallery.html On a personal note I would like to thank Mike and Stephany and all the other volunteers for their hard work and dedication to the buffalo. You guys are awesome! Ray GoodwinSonoran Connection 
Buffalo Field Campaign	110982		/users/profile/151054	mkat64	General Member of the Public	5	04/27/2012	Every time  I read the the the Buffalo Field Campaign newsletter, it saddens me so to hear what is happening to these beautiful animals.  This is where they belong, it's their home and rightfully so.  To hear that they are constantly being run off is cruel and ignorant.  They will keep coming back.  It reminds me of the Road Runner cartoon where  Wiley Coyote tries his darndest to outsmart the Roadrunner but he just can't do it.  That's what it reminds me of when these government rangers or agents keep trying to move them.  I guess they are just gluttons for punishment!  A big thanks to all the staff and volunteers of Buffalo Field Campaign for their selfless efforts.  Please keep up the great work.  I'll be here signing every petition.  Together we can hopefully see a time where the buffalo roam free as they were meant to be.

Buffalo Field Campaign	110938		/users/profile/151008	Dianne D.	Donor	5	04/27/2012	What a great organization to monitor and save our wild bison from greedy ranchers and the government.  Every life has a purpose.   All animals are individuals and they have feelings and thoughts and they suffer the pain and the joy that we do.  They are entitled and they deserve an opportunity to live.  As Chief Seattle said, "If all the beasts were gone, man would die from loneliness of spirit, for whatever happens to the beast, happens to the man.  All things are connected.  Whatever befalls the earth, befalls the sons of earth."   "The greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated."  Mahatma Gandhi
Buffalo Field Campaign	110925		/users/profile/150992	Mary Anne W.	General Member of the Public	5	04/27/2012	For years they have documented the degrading and destructive practices of hazing and capture of the beautiful wildlife that has become part of the American West Legend.  Wild Buffalo should be protected and revered, not killed for fear of spreading disease to cattle that graze on our public lands.  The Buffalo Field Campaign is a group that has brought all this to our attention and they work hard every year to promote and protect the last wild buffalo in our northern states.
Buffalo Field Campaign	110917		/users/profile/150984	Corey Sundog M.	Volunteer	5	04/27/2012	The BFC is a one of a kind project. A camp open to all who want to come and help protect the Sacred Buffalo, located in some of the prettiest land and last intact eco-system in the lower 48 states. I have been serving with BFC for almost 15 years. I have been honored by being able to grow close with the buffalo herd we protect, the family of volunteers who come from all over the world to live and work together, nature in its still and majestic ways, and most importantly with my self.      I met my wife through the campaign, and we have lived together with our children there.  We live on the west coast now, but will always come and volunteer when we can. There is no community quite like it. Please help support the last pure and wild herd of Sacred Buffalo, help bring back the buffalo in our lifetime, and come on down to the Buffalo Field Campaign to be on the front lines of this historic movement, there is always an extra bunk, great healthful home made foods, gear and all you need to stand with the last of the wild ones.

Buffalo Field Campaign	110879		/users/profile/150931	Edna K.	Volunteer	5	04/27/2012	Volunteering in the field for the Buffalo Field Campaign is one of those great experiences in which you truly do hands-on work that directly fuels results toward the mission of the nonprofit.  In this case, you get to experience first-hand what is happening to the buffalo, what the threats are, and how you can help the buffalo.  A volunteer with this group gets real-life education on the history of the buffalo and about the daily lives of these great animals.  They are a remnant of our country's great history and a link to our continent's fascinating past; you could never get this type of experience through a book or by volunteering in  an office somewhere.  The Buffalo Field Campaign is indeed on the front lines 365 days a week, 24/7 with dedication toward saving the last wild and free-roaming herds of buffalo through courage to protect these animals from their enemies, education of the public about the buffalo's plight, and compassion for these beautiful animals.  Because of the large numbers of volunteers, the organizaiton is also able to use its donations wisely and to get the most bang out of every dollar donated.  
Buffalo Field Campaign	110875		/users/profile/150924	xylem	Donor	5	04/27/2012	I've been a supporter of the Buffalo Field Campaign since I first learned of their existence in 2001. Two close friends, Corey and Amber, were volunteers for the organization. Through their personal stories and growth as individuals I came to understand the BFC as an organization of integrity and action, and over the years I've been inspired by their continued education and efforts to observe and save the last herd of wild Yellowstone buffalo from the continued harassment and slaughter in the name of wildlife management. Their message is powerful and consistent, and they have my support and recommendation.
Buffalo Field Campaign	110874		/users/profile/150919	aloha8	Volunteer	5	04/27/2012	I volunteered with BFC for an entire season-October-May. I was amazed at the nonviolent direct action work that is done everyday(including wekends). BFC is  committed to videoing the cruelty done by state & federal agencies to these gentle creatures. BFC is the only group out on the front lines, trying to stop the hazing operations and senseless slaughter of the buffalo. I am truly grateful for having had the opportunity to be in the midst of such amazing creatures. I am truly grateful for the neverending commitment of BFC to defend & protect the last wild buffalo.  I invite all lovers of the wild, of buffalo, of nature to support in any way, physically,monetarily, or legally the work of BFC. THANK YOU.ALOHA

They are the only few organizations that are out in the field gathering information about the cruel and bad acts that are being done to our nations last wild and pure buffalo in Yellowstone National Park. They are out doing hands on work getting the word out and informing the public out what is being done to wild bison. They are also a very kind hearted group, when we went to go visit they gave us clothing and a place to stay as well as food that was also very vegan and non vegan friendly. They are an amazing group of people with  an amazing cause .
Buffalo Field Campaign	110866		/users/profile/150908	andrewc-a	Volunteer	5	04/26/2012	I Volunteered with the BFC in the spring of 2011, and the experienced changed my life.  The entire crew was welcoming and I soon felt like I was home with BFC.  Learning about the plight and suffering of the buffalo was heart breaking and inspiring.  This history of genocide and control of the wild runs deep and is pervasive in every aspect of our lives.  Freedom for the buffalo to roam and freedom from a toxic and degraded environment is crucial for our well-being and prosperity.  All of our struggles for justice are interconnected.  BFC is at the forefront of this struggle!  Also the continuation of the way of life of the Buffalo People, the indigenous folks of this continent family with the buffalo, is integral to supporting the biological diversity of the wild.  BFC is forging these relationships and networks to maintain cultural and biological diversity.  Learning how to confront destructive government policies and their agents in a constructive manner was a valuable lesson that I gained from my time at BFC.  These people are amazing and deserve all the support we can give!  Thank you!

Buffalo Field Campaign	110855		/users/profile/58851	Vivianne	General Member of the Public	5	04/26/2012	The Bison are a part of the history of this country and icon for many Native Americans.  These people that are standing up for the bison are the only ones doing it.  No one else has been helping the bison. They need all the help they can get.   That alone is a good enough reason to nominate them.  the Bison used to be so large a species it would take a couple of days for them to go by a area.  Now  they are close to being gone forever.  Bison have a right to live too.

As the welfare ranchers take our money and our land, they demand the removal of OUR wildlife from OUR public lands! Fish and Game helps them, as does Yellowstone Park. The whole situation is corrupt and immoral...and BFC is the only organization working to save OUR wild bison. They are a national treasure, and I have unmitigated respect and admiration for all the volunteers, and everything they do.
Buffalo Field Campaign	110816		/users/profile/150841	Yvette T.	General Member of the Public	5	04/26/2012	I have been in contact with Buffalo Field Campaign for years.  The people who initiated this organization and all who have been working ever since to help the Yellowstone Bison are tremendously gifted individuals.  I and my parents did visit Yellowstone while I was a child.  My father is the grandson 10 generations or so from the last Chief of the Wicocomico tribe, and my mother's great grandmother was Kiowa, so, it runs in my make-up to honor Mother Earth, Natural processes, Spirit, the buffalo, indigenous lands, waters, sentient beings and people. I am against the cattle industry, the theft and poisoning of land, the insidious attitude against buffalo.  By going veg'n, I hope to promote a restoration of Nature and a possible return of some of these lands stolen from indigenous life.

They do a lot for this beautiful, majestic animal. If it weren't for BFC, countless buffalo would be dead now. Without BFC, we would never know what the BLM/Parks/Ranchers are constantly putting these creatures through. Their work matters! Once the buffalo are gone, they are gone forever. BFC is fighting hard to see that baffalo roam their native territory for generations.

Buffalo Field Campaign	110810		/users/profile/150828	kms3lobos	General Member of the Public	5	04/26/2012	The BFC are the only on site recorders of the remaining wild buffalo and the plight they still suffer....if the DOL Agents do not like buffalo, why in the name of Creator are they put in charge of them. They do not have the best interest of the buffalo, so not understand the buffalo's roaming instincts, and have the cruelest mean streaks of any so called government group, their real interest seems to be to cowtow to the rich land owners who want free grazing rights....
Buffalo Field Campaign	110807		/users/profile/150825	Jan_8	Donor	5	04/26/2012	This is the only NPO trying to keep the last genetically pure Buffalo free. . They advocate for the last wild Buffalo in court and try to get the state and federal governments to allow them to migrate naturally. The last wild Buffalo should be allowed to roam and migrate naturally like any other animal. Let them roam free again!
Buffalo Field Campaign	110803		/users/profile/150820	Misha3	General Member of the Public	5	04/26/2012	Through being with the buffalo directly in the field and documenting the way they are treated by state agencies, their advocacy immediately reaches the hearts, minds, and guts of many, many people. Every time I read about how the buffalo are treated just outside Yellowstone - when it is fairly clear that there is not enough land for them in the park, and there are neighborly, cooperative options available to all private and public landowners outside the park that would enable the buffalo to migrate - I just cry. It makes me so angry, and motivates me to action. I have involved myself in their advocacy efforts more than other nonprofits I also care about simply because of their approach towards reaching people, and the direct, on-the-ground information they provide. I do wish they - or someone - pursued a more collaborative approach towards resolving this problem. Such as, encouraging the governor or agencies in charge to collaborate with all stakeholders to create a lasting solution to this problem. However, I understand that may not be BFC's role. I, for one, and so grateful for the difficult work they do to get the word out about how these incredible, iconic animals are treated.
Buffalo Field Campaign	110801		/users/profile/150818	Stephen D.	Donor	5	04/26/2012	This is a great organization trying to keep the last genetically pure Buffalo free. They document the state of Montana and the US governments harassment of the Buffalo. They advocate for the Buffalo in court and try to get the government to allow them to migrate naturally.

Buffalo Field Campaign	110795	1	/users/profile/150807	Wolfgrrl	Volunteer	4	04/26/2012	BFC is in the field, following bison and what is being done to them, throughout the year. They document hazings, capture, shipment of wild bison to slaughter and injuries done to bison during these operations. It is deeply upsetting to witness, but they keep doing it day-in and day-out year after year. And they will keep doing while the bison are being treated like livestock instead of wildlife. The damage done to ecosystems through these activities is not just upsetting, it is detrimental in ways we have not yet begun to understand. The US government is continuing a policy of bison capture and slaughter instead of protecting this vital species as the federal mandate for National Parks instructs them to do. Bison are a national treasure and should be conserved as such. The status quo of hazing and slaughter for bison has to be changed and without BFC in the field, we would be far more ignorant of how federal and state governments are handling bison populations--BFC brings light to a dark, upsetting situation. 
Buffalo Field Campaign	110794		/users/profile/101166	patp	Donor	5	04/26/2012	My heart aches every time I see photos of the Yellowstone bison being hazed and trapped. I have to wonder about my country. Is this a country that honors its history and cherishes its living past? Or is this a country that slaughters members of the last remaining herd of wild buffalo that we have? The volunteers for the Buffalo Field Campaign have worked tirelessly for years to try to save this living nation monument: the Yellowstone bison. They've done so in all kinds of weather and with almost no money at all. I've been following their work since I discovered them at a table in Yellowstone before email and the Internet were even being widely used. These are amazing folks. As amazing as the bison they work to save. 
Buffalo Field Campaign	89237		/users/profile/101166	patp	General Member of the Public	5	05/25/2011	The Buffalo Field Campaign is the ONLY group out there in the field every day working to save what's left of the only original American bison herd left, the Yellowstone bison. Though a shoestring organization, they have been working for years against the cattle lobby and the other forces that seek to destroy these American icons. Hazing, capture, slaughter...this is what the bison face, this is what this organization fights against.  The folks at BFC deserve all of the support they can get! 
Buffalo Field Campaign	110685		/users/profile/150663	Helena Martin	General Member of the Public	5	04/24/2012	I live half way around the world but grew up watching majestic buffalo herds thundering across the plains. It seemed that every time we watched any movies or documentaries about the US there were these iconic buffalo on the screen running free. That was what America stood for - freedom...for all who live there. Without BFC this would not be possible. The DOL and other interests are very powerful but the American public are more powerful and BFC has managed to garner much support to save an American icon. Thankyou BFC for your vision and passion to preserve what is uniquely yours.
Buffalo Field Campaign	110623		/users/profile/150590	deborah24	Volunteer	5	04/24/2012	No other group is in the field every day in defense of the last wild buffalo population in the U.S.  They are working to stop the the slaughter of Yellowstone's wild bison because each animal lost is a tragedy for our nation. There were 1631 buffalos killed in 2007 and last year 29 in 2011. They continue to fight to keep the wild free-roaming bison in their natural habitat despite all the numerous obstacles from the government. 
Buffalo Field Campaign	110497		/users/profile/150425	Judi G.	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2012	The BFC volunteers are courageous folks who deserve some help.  This non-profit operates on a shoestring budget to protect the last remaining buffalo herd in the U.S.  I'm 67 years old and it would be so satisfying to know that long after I'm gone the buffalo will remain for generations and generations that come after me to enjoy.  Like so many other endangered species we need to protect the bison and with the help of BFC that is being accomplished.
Buffalo Field Campaign	110465		/users/profile/150380	KMS3628	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2012	The only group that is fighting against the US Government and the Montana DOL & livestock interests that believe they trump wildlife interests.  BFC shows America how our tax dollars are being misused.  It is hard to believe how these wild free roaming majestic animals can be abused and mistreated by the same government and officials that are charged with protecting them.  Go BFC, I will keep on supporting your efforts, and I thank them for it.
Buffalo Field Campaign	110447		/users/profile/21539	mtstorms	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/21/2012	For many years I worked in another small conservation nonprofit in Montana and interacted regularly with many other conservation groups across the country, both large and small.  I remain continually impressed with BFC's commitment to adhering to a core set of principles in how they conduct their work.  Too  many other conservation groups are willing to chase political expediency in order to claim hollow victories or allow funders to control and shape their missions and strategies.  BFC has consistently remained true to its principles and puts its volunteers out there on the ground year-round.  Several years ago a colleague of mine in one of the D.C.-based Big Greens led an effort to create national legislation to protect the Yellowstone bison.  The bill had numerous congressional co-sponsors signed on.  But at the 11th hour a number of other Big Greens withdrew their support thereby killing  the bill.  The reason?  They believe there is only room for a certain number of green bills in Congress at one time, so they decided amongst themselves which ones would be their priorities and the excellent bison bill was one that they then dumped.  This illustrates the difference between emphasizing  politics over  principle.    Unlike some, BFC has never turned its back on the bison and consistently continues bearing witness to this beautiful animal's plight.

Documenting the injustices against these iconic creatures and educating the public of these injustices is so important in creating change..I look forward to reading my BFC newsletter in keeping me abreast of whats happening in the wild lands thousands of mile from my home..makes me feel like Im a part of their cause. I only wish I could be there with them..they are an inspiration in a time of challenges for all of our wildlife..I pray that their mission is someday successful...buffalo will once a gain roam free..without BFC, I dont think it would be even a possibility.

Buffalo Field Campaign	110350		/users/profile/56995	dragonfluff	General Member of the Public	5	04/20/2012	Buffalo Field Campaign is the only group working in the field 24/7 to document the cruel treatment of the last surviving free buffalo herd in the world.  Cattle interests in Montana pressure the government to haze the buffalo out of their historic calving grounds before and during calving causing stress, i njury and even death.  Buffalo Field Campaign is all volunteer and supported by donations.  They are definitely a great nonprofit who could benefit a great deal from additional financial assistance as recognition for their dedication.

Their work is to make the general public aware of the plight of Yellowstone's wild bison and the need to protect this ecologically endangered species.  I'm so glad that Buffalo Field Campaign is out there, letting government agencies know that they're being closely watched of their cruel treatment of America's genetically pure, wild bison.

I truly admire Buffalo Field Campanign's passion, perseverence and courage.  They have a wonderful website with a wealth of information about the buffalo and the organisation's uphill battle with the US government and the cattle industry.  I think the US government is so un-american to kill off a very american icon, the bison.

After just a few days as a volunteer in West Yellowstone, I felt at home, surrounded by folks who were passionate about the buffalo.The spirit and energy of the campaign, while met with daily challenges, remains strong. They take care of their volunteers as well as the buffalo. The organization has been at it for a very long time, and it shows.

It is the only org that is actually in the field documenting what is happening to buffalo  - the injustices these animals suffer because they need the grass and water that ranchers covet exclusively for their cattle.  The org operates year round, from fall to spring when the buffalo are directly under attack, and during the summer does outreach to national park visitors.  It has done more than any org to educate the public and Congress about the plight of buffalo in this country, and the need to preserve these iconic animals, symbols of the American west.

They are heroes in the real sense of the word.
Buffalo Field Campaign	109790	1	/users/profile/149557	RobynL	General Member of the Public	5	04/12/2012	The Buffal Field Campaign is an amazing group of people who work in some of the most bitter winter conditions to observe and protect the last wild herd of buffalo in the United States.  They are getting the truth out to the public about what is really happening to this herd.  Without the Buffalo Field Campaign the public wouldn't know about the manmade hardships and cruelty these animals face every year and  the way their newborns are mercilessly driven by motorized vehicles away from the areas of good grazing.  Without them this herd would slowly but surely be decimated.  The BFC is leading the way in the battle against those who are spending thousands of dollars trying to take away the land where the ancestors of this herd have grazed for centuries and where they should be the safest - public land.  I fell in love with bison when I was a child.  I was born in Montana and it was there that I first saw them.  After 52 years I clearly remember the moment they came into view and how majestic they were.  As long as the Buffalo Field Campaign is around I believe there is reason to hope that there will be wild buffalo walking out of a misty fog on a crisp Montana morning for others to see 100 years from now.

Buffalo Field Campaign	109207	1	/users/profile/148744	Barbara56	General Member of the Public	5	04/06/2012	The Buffalo Field Campaign is an heroic effort to save the precious lives of bison incapable of defending themselves against decades of murder, injustice and pursuit of those willing to diminish, if not, vanish their beautiful and mighty existence.  Despite rough terrain, deepness of snow or treaherous storm a warrior appears armed with an invisible shield of justice and a sword of preservation yielding every protection possible through actions that are strengthened by the dedication of true and loyal hearts. Many lives have been saved, inhumane cruelty would have gone unnoticed, senseless slaughter would rage a terror so fierce and devastating to the point of no return of free roaming buffalo. If I were speaking of human life, shock would arouse heartfelt concern from the masses. Why shouldn't it matter just as much for the campaign of saving the buffalo?  Their cruelly interrupted world  consists of a family with children, a mother, a father and a community of life.  "Save Our Buffalo."

Buffalo are treated as if they were livestock all over the country, even those not kept in fences. The Buffalo Field Campaign documents abuses committed by government agencies committed against the last wild herd of buffalo, and brings the evidence to trial and to the legislature to stop the abuse and slaughter of these magnificent creatures. The buffalo is almost extinct! The Green Award would go a very long way to saving an endangered species from annihilation and torture. Please help us bring this attention to the public sphere.

It is my experience after working for several non profits that the BFC has an integrity to match that of the majestic bison.  Every dollar raised goes towards the preservation of our North American Bison.

Buffalo Field Campaign	109120		/users/profile/148603	basque	Donor	5	04/05/2012	BFC is the first organization to bring to the attention of the general public the sad legacy of both Yellowstone NP and the livestock industry of Montana's regarding wild bison in the Yellowstone area.  While other organizations have begun to focus on the travesty that poses as wildlife management concerning wild bison in Montana, they are new to the action.  BFC has worked tirelessly to protect the last  pure, wild bison left on their home range.  Without the dedication of the volunteers and staff of BFC one shudders to think what would have happened to these iconic creatures.  The battle is not over but the Buffalo Field Campaign continues to protect the Yellowstone bison (doing a far better job than the park service) from the livestock industries continued assault on the wildlife that belongs to us all.

They answer any questions and reply to my e-mails (something rarely done by others).  They endure hardships and harrassment on behalf all all people interested in saving what's left of the "real American West".  They are informative, honest, and cooperative in their efforts.  They put themselves on the front lines, and work with Native Americans to try and preserve a way of life eons old.

Buffalo Field Campaign	109088		/users/profile/148503	lindaserfass	Donor	5	04/05/2012	As a lifelong resident of the eastern US, I am still shocked by the news that BFC reports regarding wild buffalo. If not for BFC bringing the federal government's slaughter and harassment of wild buffalo to public attention, these animals might not even exist in the US anymore. The members of BFC are incredibly dedicated to their cause, in spite of their small budget, remote location, and the fact that their opponents are supported by all US taxpayers. The BFC is working to dispel the myth that brucellosis is spread by wild buffalo to domestic herds, which is not a documented means of transmission and is an excuse for federal agencies to continue to harass and kill buffalo. When I read their weekly updates, I get a feeling for buffalo as social animals with family structures and lives that matter. This means that every buffalo death is a death to a member of a family and a society. The dedication and personal interest that the BFC feel toward buffalo really comes through in their updates. They don't see the buffalo as resources for human use, but as individuals in a society with a right to live their lives as nature intended. The BFC needs more funding in order to spread their message to the whole country, so that more people can be outraged that their taxes are funding the slaughter and harassment of wild buffalo. Honestly, before I heard of the BFC, I assumed that wild buffalo were living as well as any western animal who is restricted in range by human settlement and perhaps occasionally hunted during short seasons. The BFC is working for a population of animals in a remote location whose fate has up to now been decided by wealthy landowners and federal agencies, and the rest of the country needs to know about it.
Buffalo Field Campaign	109075		/users/profile/148439	Wayne Ude	General Member of the Public	5	04/05/2012	I grew up in eastern Montana, attended U of Montana, and worked summers in Yellowstone as, of all things, a bellhop. The first live buffalo I ever saw were in Yellowstone; the reality was far beyond anything I'd read in novels or history: huge, powerful beings seeming to be peacefully at home. At the time, I believed the Park was focused on preserving and protecting buffalo as part of its mandate, and I was delighted to learn of the herd's existence. Only after I began receiving information from Buffalo Field Campaign many years later did I realize how tentative is this last free buffalo herd's existence and that I could help preserve these buffalo with letters and e-mails. Buffalo Field Campaign has made a huge difference in the herd's treatment and its hopes for survival; without BFC, this symbol of the West might no longer exist.  
Buffalo Field Campaign	109071		/users/profile/148411	DanaGFB	Donor	5	04/05/2012	A few years ago I was lucky enough to be snowshoeing in Yellowstone during a very cold January.  At first, we would see small groups of bison at a distance.  But as the weather got more severe, we came upon a larger herd that had wandered into our camp.  I had a bison encounter of the too-close-for-comfort kind but came away with a deep respect and love for these enduring animals.  It's no wonder that the wild bison has become an American icon and the symbol for many of our states.  Since then, I've been a supporter of Buffalo Field Campaign.  These are people who give up their time and comfort to spend hours working to protect these iconic aniamls.  The health of Yellowstone and all our prairies can be measured by the health of their major animals.  Please consider Buffalo Field Campaign as the champion of not just the buffalo but all of the land and other animals who live "where the buffalo roam."

There is much competition for the land and ranching interests seem to be in the forefront getting in the way of every other creature. Please help BFC to continue their vital efforts by recognizing them as the great not-for-profit animal welfare organization that they are -- and thereby recognizing the need to preserve the Yellowstone buffalo without government harassment. Thank you for your consideration.
Buffalo Field Campaign	109064		/users/profile/148405	Sharla L.	Volunteer	5	04/05/2012	I'm here at the BFC lodge, waiting to go out on afternoon patrol.  This is my fourth time volunteering here at the BFC.  I usually come at the same time of year each year, in and around the time my kids have spring break.  I watched some horrible hazings and a 600 bison capture my first year here in 2008.  The cruelty and inhumanity of the process made me ill and will never leave me.  Agents stabbing panicking buffalo with giant gaffes, before packing them into horse trailers to head to eventual slaughter.. Last year the winter was so bad, the spring so late in coming.  Buffalo were everywhere on the road, ribs showing through thick mangy fur, heads hanging hang-dog, as they slowly plodded down the road.  The hills were buried in snow, grass very hard to come by.  Buffalo would try to graze at the old, exposed tufts on the side of the highway, but mostly they were just exhausted, reserves spent in the long harsh winter.  At night they commonly tried to bed down on the pavement as lying in the snow would require even more energy.  If those buffalo had their free will, where would they have been during that long harsh winter?  This year is a totally different picture.  Same time of year, and the snow is mostly gone from the field in front of the cabin, new spring growth coming through everywhere.  The buffalo look so healthy!  They still don't have free will, though they are currently gathering at their calving grounds on Horse Butte.  They have little interest in the roads this year, except for dangerous crossings, hoping the cars and semis thundering past at 80 mph have drivers intelligent enough to slow down when they see the hot pink "Buffalo in Road" signs tirelessly put up and taken down by BFC volunteers.  The buffalo need this warm spring.  They also need to be left alone.  They need a wild life corridor!  The BFC is the real thing, working, working, working.  
Buffalo Field Campaign	109060		/users/profile/148398	Sbooher	Volunteer	5	04/05/2012	My firsst visit the Yellowstone my wife and I saw a large number of Buffalo.  A few years later we returned and found a far lesser number. On returning home I began looking into why they were missing and I found only BUffalo Field Campaign would explain what was going on. My congressional members, USDA, and Dept of Interior were all in denial. 
Buffalo Field Campaign	109054		/users/profile/61434	Gail Richardson	Donor	5	04/05/2012	I have been a member/donor of Buffalo Field Campaign (BFC) since it began I think in 1996. As a naturalist guide and conservationist I appreciate every day the amazing work they do often in frigid temperatures for our native Yellowstone genetically pure bison that have been singled out by the cattle industry.  BFC has exposed the horrific Interagency Bison Management Plan for what it is--a campaign led by the livestock industry to keep wild Yellowstone bison out of MT. They use the disease, brucellosis, as the reason, but it is really all about competition for grass. Native wildlife belongs on our precious public lands, not the damn cows! BFC has led the way to help return these bison to MT.
Buffalo Field Campaign	57949		/users/profile/61434	Gail Richardson	Donor	5	11/27/2010	I have been a member of Buffalo Field Campaign since it began, as I share love and admiration for the magnificent genetically pure buffalo of Yellowstone National Park and disgust at the way they have been inhumanely treated by Montana and the federal government to placate the powerful livestock industry. The waste of taxpayer dollars is obscene. BFC exposes the horrific treatment of our iconic buffalo and lays out solutions: allowing bison limited migration and access to habitat on our federal lands outside Yellowstone and on lands of willing owners; emphasis on private livestock for disease prevention rather than on bison; retiring of livestock grazing allotments by the Forest Service in sensitive areas for bison. Wildlife should come first on our public lands, and BFC represents the best of wildlife preservation efforts. 
Buffalo Field Campaign	109038	1	/users/profile/148371	Marcia10	Donor	5	04/05/2012	This group has worked so hard and under extremely difficult circumstances to help the remaining bison.  These animals were hunted almost to extinction just for sport in the 19th century and even in recent years there has been continuing  harassment and killing. The animals deserve to live in peace as a national treasure and symbol, and those who have worked so hard on their behalf deserve recognition for all their efforts.

The dedication to this great historically significant herd is amazing.  I wish I could give more than I do and just hope others will learn about their personal sacrifices on all American's behalf and for the Buffalo of Yellowstone.  Not enough good words in my vocabulary!
Buffalo Field Campaign	57899		/users/profile/36154	ojibwawife	Donor	5	11/25/2010	I can't begin to tell you how these men and women do what they do, but it's amazing that they haven't lost fingers and toes in the bitter Montana winter.  Operating every year on a shoestring budget, living in a cabin heated by a wood stove, putting themselves on the front to keep these last remaining free roaming American Bison from being exterminated.  I feel every American should know that these great symbols of our country are slowly losing their battle to the Department of Livestock and the ranchers in Montana, who would like to see them exterminated.  Please go to their website and make a donation to help keep these wonderful beasts from becoming extinct.  What a shame it would be!

They keep an eye on various agencies to try and make sure that they follow the law; they work hard to change policies that aren't working as intended; they try to stop unlawful hazing and trapping. They are dedicated to keeping the public informed as to the truth of what actions are being done for and against the buffalo.

Buffalo Field Campaign	63154		/users/profile/69024	oakotter314	General Member of the Public	5	02/04/2011	The american bison in and around Yellowstone National Park represent the only remaining genetically pure herd of bison, also called buffalo, left on the planet.  In spite of this, the Montana cattlemen are opposed to any protection and determined to exterminate any animals that leave the park to find forage in the winter.  The Buffalo Field Campaign is the only organization dedicated to preserving this amazing American heritage animal.  This legendary animal once roamed the west in the hundreds of thousands has been reduced to around 3000 animals..  The extremely dedicated individuals in the BFC are on the front lines working tirelessly to protect these remaining animals.

I have full confidence that they will continue to do all they canto safeguard the buffalo, until they are permanently protected by law.
Buffalo Field Campaign	58014		/users/profile/61576	Tia S	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/29/2010	BFC has single-handedly brought one of the most important species-related issues to the public's attention - the annual hazing and slaughter of the last genetically pure, free roaming American buffalo herd. Not only is the federal and state governments stressing, maiming, killing, and moving these animals, but they are doing it with tax payer dollars. All the while many Americans may think that the government is protecting these species, when in fact they are not. They are also lying, saying that bison will transmit disease, yet this has never happened, but all the while, every year, they kill our wild bison. Yellowstone National Park is a refuge for the bison, but migrating animals such as the bison follow natural patterns of food supply and birthing areas, not political boundaries. YNP is too high in elevation to supply bison with enough food year-round, and has boundaries that do not take into consideration wildlife migration patterns, and so the bison migrate out of the park. During these times the government stampedes in with helicopters, horses and ATV's, forcing the bison to run for many, many miles. Calves die, legs break, animals drown, exhaustion sets in, laws are broken... Why? To invest in the cattle industry so that private cattle can graze on public land - our land - wildlife's land. Why, still today, are we "paying" private companies by giving them our public lands and our tax subsidies, to have their cattle overgraze and ruin these lands? The land gets tramped and this kills native grasses; without the grasses many species die out (snakes, rabbits, birds of prey, etc). Without the diversity of wildlife, plant species suffer, further reducing biodiversity of our public lands. Overgrazing causes erosion and topsoil depletion and pollutes waterways. Need I go on? Other wildlife are poisoned and killed, gophers, coyotes, wolves, and others are killed. PROTECT bison, protect OUR land, or corporations will simply take it over, overuse and deplete the natural resources and wildlife, keep the profits, and let us flip the bills, leaving us with barren lands. We all must invest in our private lands, no one will do this for us. There are only a handful of wild bison left; an American icon - a species that helps restore native prairies and meadows, a graceful animal you should see free roaming on our public lands. Help BFC help the bison - they are the only organization committed to this effort!

Buffalo Field Campaign	57925		/users/profile/61391	Konekikan	General Member of the Public	5	11/26/2010	My husband  and I donate when we can to this remarkable organization.They work in the field in Montana climates to save the American icon-the SACRED BUFFALO. They have dedicated volunteers from all over who join them as like us they believe in the cause. More Americans need to step up to save these precious animals for future generations to admire and respect. They are a part of this earth and deserve the right to remain free as was intended, and not harassed by people who think only of themselves and how they want to run things. They are not willing to compromise and we all will be responsible for a great loss if we do not speak out for the Buffalo.
Buffalo Field Campaign	57924		/users/profile/61390	wayra	Donor	5	11/26/2010	I have been making donations to the Buffalo Field Campaign -- and encouraging others to do so, too -- for more than a decade. We live in a country and culture that extols the use and abuse of the earth and her inhabitants, of all species, for personal gain and convenience. The Buffalo Field Campaign is an organization that stands firmly, unapologetically, in opposition to this violation of the laws of nature, to insist that the buffalo be protected and their rights honored. The committed, caring women and men who work with the campaign exemplify the meaning of service to the community. They truly stand with the buffalo, serving as conscientious, compassionate witnesses and sharing with their followers clearly documented information about what is taking place in the field and through their efforts to change public policy. They are consistent in their communications with contributors, sending updates and promptly responding to contributions, sometimes with a hand-written thank-you note, which is rare these days. It's a joy to read about their experiences watching the four-leggeds who symbolize the wide-open spaces of the American west and who are sacred to indigenous cultures. I encourage everyone to support this organization so that they can continue their vital work to keep the buffalo "free to roam."
Buffalo Field Campaign	57915		/users/profile/61380	Ann S	General Member of the Public	5	11/26/2010	As a life long resident of the Horse Butte, my grandfather homesteaded  (Before Hebgen Lake was a Lake) what is now Hebgen Lake Estates, and my Father worked on the Ranch that is now the Yellowstone Ranch Preserve, (former Munns Ranch) Breaking horses in the 30's and 40's.  I still live in the homestead cabin they built in 1938(the second cabin on the original homestead). At the moment I'm living with my mother next door in 'our' family cabin, because she lost her sight  and has developed dementia.  We have witnessed  the atrocities put forth  against the Bison from the beginning.  We have seen the carelessness  of the 'Gvt.' officials first hand.  My father pretty much told them all to keep off this road and property or else, and they pretty much have.  That does  not stop them from using the power-line  behind our house that  is on forest service, and public  access. We support the BFC in their endeavors.  They are  some of the most dedicated, caring  people you could ever meet.  If it weren't for them and their help not only would the Bison be exterminated from the Horse Butte Peninsula, but I'm afraid, so would my mother and I.  If we need anything,  they are the first to respond.  Even when a stupid neighbor started a fire  in the afternoon just as the wind was coming up which spread the fire fast a furiously.  One call to the BFC, (they were in the middle of documenting a haze) and they scrambled people  over to our  area.  Of course the Department of Livestock Agents tried to stop the BFC from  helping us put out the fire, but  with some persistence from the BFC and my mother, father and I, they then let the BFC come fight the fire while the deputies and DoL agents sat on their behinds and watched.  All this while waiting for the Fire dept.  to show up.  Needless to say the BFC volunteers were able to stop the fire from exploding a propane tank of a Member of the Livestock communities home, they were able to stop the spread  before it hit the timber.  at NO Thanks to any other State or Gvt. agency that was there.  When the Fire trucks finally arrived, the BFC went back and caught up with the rest of the volunteers, and the muddled mess of the haze.  The Fire Dept. told me later that had the BFC not done what they had when they had we could  possibly have lost EVERYTHING.The Buffalo Field Campaign is out in the field no matter what the weather, protecting the Bison to the best of their ability,  and protecting the 'humans' that aren't smart enough to know that a Bison can  do serious  damage to a motor vehicle, along with it's occupants.  You won't see anybody BUT the Buffalo Field Campaign out there all hours of the day and night in all increments of  weather, warning drivers  of Bison that are right along and sometimes ON the highway.  I have many stories of how and what has happened out here in this battle  for the Bison.  But I won't take any more  of any one's time right now.

If a government program was as successful as has been the Buffalo Field Campaign ....considering the declining numbers listed each year of murdered buffalo as reported in your newsletter....people would be dancing in the streets.

Buffalo Field Campaign	57911		/users/profile/61375	susanmtns	Donor	5	11/26/2010	In a time when so many are frustrated, alienated and downright angry, a group of people come together to protect for the buffalo from belief systems that have gone awry.  Amidst extreme temperatures, they stand together with limited creature comforts because they know everything is connected.  They also want you to feel connected.  And, they want you to care about our environment, too.With only a vision, they amass, from all points of our world.  Often they don't realize fully why they come together.  They are just driven to do so.  They want to stop the murdering.  They want the majestic buffalo to roam like they always have. Safe. Protected. Honored.Long ago humanity was an integral part of nature, and nature an integral part of humanity.  It is time to return to that oneness, because everything... every thing is connected to something larger than itself. To disconnect any part of this eco-system is an instant recipe for demise.  It is time to return to wholeness. 
Buffalo Field Campaign	57910		/users/profile/61372	laural	General Member of the Public	5	11/26/2010	In winter of 1996-97 after my fall visit to the Tetons and Yellowstone over 1,000 wild bison were slaughtered at the borders of Yellowstone and Montana. I was horrified. Online I discovered Buffalo Nations and Cold Mountain Cold River - buffalo activist groups which evolved into Buffalo Field Campaign. Always honest, direct and consistent in their determination to regain habitat for the wild herd - the BFC intensive website has helped me inform myself while responding to calls for action to write letters, make calls etc. Their persistence in documenting the situation is remarkable. The email updates are always informative great for supporters near and far. BFC is a wonderful hard working group and I am always moved by their strength and commitment to the future of the bison herd. 
Buffalo Field Campaign	57903		/users/profile/61355	ayani	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/25/2010	Buffalo Field Campaign is one of the wisest, most compassionate and caring organizations of dedicated people who truly understand the meaning of our place as human animals among other animals and all life on Earth. We are all related. We are all interdependent. We all share this small planet in an enormity of galaxies and an ancient universe, and our sacred responsibility as humans is to walk humbly and lightly on this Earth, to protect its life, to halt ANY destruction and the 7th extinction of biodiversity that we are now bringing about, and which will inevitably include our own, unless we wake up. As a lifelong "animal person," advocate and activist for human and environmental justice, as a cofounder and coordinator of a small nonprofit fair trade indigenous organization, I am honored to be able to speak personally and professionally on behalf of BFC. Working on a shoestring they are with the bison to be free. They understand. They care. The bison respond and migrate and follow their ancient paths, and together we can all live--from the tiniest microorganisms to the largest mammals--in Yellowstone, in the Northern Rockies, in this particular amazing ecosystem, wisdom and real science may intersect and prevail. And if it does, it's BFC who stands with the bison at its center."But ask now the animals, and they shall teach you; and the birds of the sky, they will tell you. Or speak to the earth and it will teach you; and the fishes of the sea shall inform you."  (Job 12:7-8)
Buffalo Field Campaign	57902		/users/profile/61354	Olivia	General Member of the Public	5	11/25/2010	I've been following Buffalo Field Campaign efforts to protect wild bison in their habitat for about five years. What impresses me is how these committed volunteers maintain their cool, candor, and compassion under all circumstances. When BFC isn't patrolling the migratory routes on behalf of bison bulls, cows and calves, who are perpetually hazed, run ragged, darted, drugged, and slaughtered, they're attending meetings, lobbying, writing policy papers, educating the public, providing objective facts, and countering self-serving lies (about brucellosis, for example) that cattle ranchers and hunters tell in their war on these beautiful beasts of the plains and forests.

Buffalo Field Campaign	37207	8	/users/profile/37934	4thebuffalo	Donor	5	04/28/2010	I visited the Buffalo Field Campaign in Montana.  It is a group of deeply committed, caring individuals, who have stood up against the squandering of Federal and State tax dollars that are used to cruelly harass and kill our nation's last Bison.  The BFC opposes the Montana cattle industry's propaganda that Buffalo should not be allowed to roam freely on our Federal Lands.  Also, the BFC educates Americans regarding the influence of the state's cattlemen and the reckless control they exert on the MDOL (Montana Department of Livestock) and other 4 members of the IBMP.

Buffalo Field Campaign	36695	5	/users/profile/37480	pattyjo	General Member of the Public	5	04/23/2010	I first ran across BFC volunteers when they were just starting out. They had a table with information near Old Faithful in Yellowston. Since then, their emails have kept me informed of the appalling treatment of Yellowstone Buffalo, a national treasure. Without the BFC, the Yellowstone Buffalo might not have survived until now. Please help them continue their courageous work.
Buffalo Field Campaign	36646	5	/users/profile/37433	Barbara	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/23/2010	The BFC is extraordinarily effective in protecting harrassed Yellowstone buffalo who roam out of Wyoming into Montana, and in bringing awareness to the reasons this happens and what can be done to help. My contacts with BFC workers (in person and over email) show them to be committed activists but, as importantly, approachable and polite who devote themselves in all conditions and climates to their goals.
Buffalo Field Campaign	36627	6	/users/profile/37417	peter-leusch	Volunteer	5	04/23/2010	In the nightmare, Im on the north side of the Madison River, just west of Yellowstone National Park.  A thick, grey fog obscures everything but the ground at my feet.  My heart sinks as I hear the sound of high powered rifles and the pounding of heavy hooves in the distance.  Suddenly, a massive bull buffalo charges from the mist and pins me against a pine tree.  Im not hurt, but am stuck between his horns and the tree.  Im helpless as the slaughter approaches, hearing and feeling the earth shake as many buffalo are killed and fall to the ground.  I awake in a pool of sweat and realize that I was dreaming.  Slowly, too, I realize that I am safe and warm in the lodge at the Buffalo Field Campaign.  I can hear the soft breathing and occasional snores of the other volunteers sleeping around me.  In reality, the senseless slaughter of the buffalo continues, but my hope lies in these volunteers.  They come from all over the world, old and young alike, to answer the call for help.                                                          Soon we will rise and head into the field, into the offices, into the schools, the courtrooms, the street rallies, anywhere that we can advocate and educate about how important these last wild American buffalo truly are.  Some can only come for a weekend, others have devoted their lives, but all who have been blessed to be in the presence of wild buffalo are changed by the experience.  For every volunteer who comes to Yellowstone to brave the cold and bear witness to this harsh injustice there are thousands more who work and support from afar.  I am hopeful because I can see that together we are making progress.  Slow, painful and bittersweet at times, but progress nonetheless.  With the stubborn persistence of buffalo headed into a winter storm, our numbers grow, our collective voice becomes louder.  I can feel it now, like a huge wave growing in the ocean, we are poised.  Wide awake, our dream of the return of wild buffalo and justice for the native cultures that cherished them begins to take form.  Together, with dedication, hard work, and a boundless hope, we will make this dream reality.

Buffalo Field Campaign	36601	6	/users/profile/37390	bison11	Donor	5	04/22/2010	The Buffalo Field Campaign has such dedicated, hard-working members in the field year round, safeguarding the magnificant bison that belong to all citizens.  They never give up in their fight; even though, at times the odds are stacked against them. Members lobby at the local and national levels to get laws and policies changed to allow the Yellowstone bison access to their natural migratory routes.  I believe, if it weren't for BFC members, the Yellowstone bison would be no longer.  What a sad story that would be to tell our grandkids about the demise of the bison, and they would only know them by pictures in books.  Hats off to the Buffalo Field Campaign!

They face an uphill battle against the cattle industry for fair treatment of the last wild buffalo herd in America. They work tirelessly year-round to document the harassment, capture, and slaughter of the buffalo. They are a small group of people that don't have a lot of exposure but they persevere despite their shortcomings. I wish they had more ways of getting people involved. It is hard to get people to write letters but I know that form letters are not as impactful. I look forward to the day when i don't have to read the BFC newsletters because they were finally successful in reaching their goals. This is a non-profit worth supporting!

Buffalo Field Campaign	36565	6	/users/profile/37358	csimonuneedu	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/22/2010	I met the Buffalo field Campiagn (BFC) about a decade ago in Yellowstone National Park when I was working with a coyote/wolf study group, Yellowstone Ecosystem Studies. BFC was always there, in the field every day, tabling events and spreading the word. I met some of the volunteers and was inspired by their honesty and passion. With bare resources, they had some of the best eucational materials, and most educated and dedicated volunteers, I had ever met. An environmental activist, educator, and University instructor with 25 years experience, they continue to be one of the best groups I support. Simply and within their means, they educate the public about the American bison's struggle to survive and thrive human threats in thier native rangelands. With so few truly wild, genetically pure bison left in America, they work all the harder to protect, advocate for, educate about, and stand alongside the bison. They are involved on all levels, from escorting bison across dark paved highways from car collisions, to educational booths, to attendance at political meetings, to involvement in litigous and celabratory activities, they stand true. This, they do from the ground. With wool hats and armfulls of firewood, withstanding whiteout blizzards and frostbite, they are in the field with cameras, peacefully and without confrontation, documenting the atrocities and crimes against a fellow creature with no voice. There is no greater and no purer work than that done by the BFC. Please support them.

Granted, it seems like they can't win the battle considering their opposition is the cattle industry!  But every buffalo they save is a blessing!  These animals deserve better protection than our government agencies give them; along the same line as the wild mustangs and burros, who are also being attacked by the same - cattle industry!  God bless the volunteers of Buffalo Field campaign and all the supporters who help these animals!
Buffalo Field Campaign	36556	7	/users/profile/37350	amjm03	Volunteer	5	04/22/2010	I cannot say enough about the important work that the BFC does every single day in and around Yellowstone.  If it weren't for them and their completely grass-roots efforts, there might very well be no native, free-ranging bison left in our greatest National Park.Volunteering with BFC was effortless; they provided for my every need while I was there, and equipped me to help their cause not only in Yellowstone but also back east at home throughout the year.  Working even a little with BFC provides a glimpse into a life-and-death struggle that few might be aware of otherwise.
Buffalo Field Campaign	36515	12	/users/profile/37299	Buffalo	Former Volunteer	5	04/22/2010	This was one of the most incredible experiences of my life.  Every day we woke before sunrise, put on skis, and went out onto the buffalo's habitat.  While most days were absolutely perfect--watching buffalo, elk, and wolves in their natural grace--other days were absolutely horrible as Montana livestock agents came out with helicopters and snowmobiles and disrupted the entire ecosystem.  I watched and videotaped as they chased buffalo right through barbed-wire fences and into traps, from where they were loaded onto trucks and sent to slaughter houses.While I was there we also made several trips to the state Capital in Helena, where we testified in support of the buffalo.  It was a great way to take some of what i learned in the field, fueled by the passion of how I saw them treating the buffalo, and use it to help change the policy under which the buffalo are mistreated.

We met many passionate and committed people, who brought the region's issues to life. We covered a lot of ground. We learned a lot. And we had a blast. I came away extremely impressed with IJNR. This is a quality organization.

The exposure to how to ask probing questions and to come up with a more complete understanding of complicated topics was extremely valuable. Like most reporters at small newspapers, I have to move quickly from one complex topic to another and get it right. And be able to pull readers into stories and topics and hold their attention. The travels tested my stamina, too. Unfortunately, Frank had to leave part-way through the trip to keep an eye on his house in Montana, threatened with wildfires. Otherwise I might have learned more about setting up a story. But it was a wonderful experience!
Institutes For Journalism & Natural Resources	80736		/users/profile/88110	Roger Archibald	Professional with expertise in this field	5	03/01/2011	      Beyond the stimulating total emersion within a journalistic milieu that IJNR offers its selected Fellows on each of its highly organized Institutes, the most remarkable aspect of the experience   they provide is the complete financial support   that's included with each invitation to participate in one of their unique journeys of discovery. From the moment of arrival until the final departure, Fellows' expenses for each Institute are all covered by IJNR and its generous supporters. I hadn't experienced funding support like that since I served in the Navy, and IJNR doesn't even require you to wear a uniform or stand mid-watches. And the food is so much better than Navy chow, there's no comparison. But the best food IJNR brings to the table is food for thought, both in the outstanding speakers and other resources they present to the Fellows day after day, and the careful selection of the Fellows themselves for each journey whose members are chosen with the intent of creating a symbiotic whole that will continue to  evolve from their shared experience long after their particular Institute is complete. Like the old wisdom about college--that education is what remains after all you learned has been forgotten--the IJNR experience only gains with time, investing intellectual capital in its alumni that continues to grow like compounding interest, and which will benefit the collective Fellowship on each journey for the rest of their careers, even lives.

Institutes For Journalism & Natural Resources	80683		/users/profile/88057	Sammy	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/28/2011	The great thing about IJNR is  learning about emerging environmental issues on the ground. You're hearing from the experts, while you're also in the field. It's like going to a cool seminar, but you're not in a sterile classroom or conference center.  You're actually outdoors and learning. I remember one night in southern Georgia helping with a controlled burn while on an IJNR fellowship. I'd often spoken with experts about how fire can help forests, but seeing how controlled burns are conducted was eye opening. It was interesting to learn the preparations that go into it, then how the burns are managed. We later discussed what the burning would do for the landscape. It gave me much greater insight and perspective on an issue I only knew in the abstract before.Another great experience was simpler. Our group was taken to a mixed forest in South Carolina. In the forest, we heard birds, squirrels and other sounds of wildlife that lived in the woods. We then were taken to a pine  plantation. The thing I remember most is how eerily quiet it was in the pine plantation, since it lacked a diversity of tree species. No birds or animals making sounds. The only real sound was the spring wind blowing in the pines.

Covering environmental issues well demands knowledge of the subject covered, a critical eye, and an appreciation for the complexity of viewpoints and perspectives. IJNR expedition fellowships take journalists into the field and into the heart of many of the most important environmental issues of the day. I was a fellow in November 2009 in the American Southwest, specifically New Mexico, to study how this region is emblematic of the nation's reliance on 20th century sources of energy, such as highly polluting coal, and at the same time at the cutting edge of developing alternative sources of energy, including wind and solar. We toured wind farms by air, talked with coal executives, and saw how Native American communities are adopting 21st century solar energy technology to improve their economic standing -- among many other activities. The staff of IJNR was wonderful -- organized, supportive and incredibly inspiring. I met some terrific journalists, and two years later I still keep in touch with many of them.

Institutes For Journalism & Natural Resources	79064		/users/profile/86365	John Flesher	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/27/2011	To comprehend the ecological wonderland that is the Great Lakes, you must get to know Lake Erie -- the shallowest and warmest of them all, yet home to the most abundant fishery. The Institutes for Journalism and Natural Resources' Great Waters Institute in May 2009 provided a crash course on the challenges confronting this fascinating inland sea.  I was among a group of journalists fortunate enough to take part in the expedition. Beginning with a cruise on the St. Clair River, ground zero in the debate over low water levels on the upper lakes, we embarked on a nine-day circle tour of the Lake Erie basin. Among the stops: Ohio State University's Stone Laboratory on Gibraltar Island; the Cleveland waterfront; Niagara Falls; the Ontario fishing villages of Port Stanley and Wheatley; and Pelee Island. We observed scientists taking water samples for quality analysis and laborers filleting perch and walleye. We heard experts debate how best to stop the flood of invasive species into the Great Lakes and the future of wind power in the region. Among the highlights was a boat trip to an uninhabited island for a look at damage wrought by a surging population of double-crested cormorants. Evenings provided time for food and fellowship with like-minded journalists who became fast friends. At a time when many news outlets are reducing travel budgets and cutting back on the environmental coverage, the importance of IJNR cannot be overstated. The Lake Erie institute enabled me to step away from the crush of daily deadlines and learn the issues in more relaxed and authentic settings than the newsroom. It introduced me to scientists and policymakers who remain valuable news sources, provided a wealth of background knowledge and inspired a lengthy list of story ideas. For all this, my company paid only the cost of getting me to and from Detroit, the anchor city. I'd strongly urge any journalist with an interest in the environment to seek out an IJNR institute. As an Associated Press correspondent based in Michigan, I have been honored to take part in five IJNR Great Waters expeditions. Each has enriched me professionally as well as personally.

For many, this was valuable time away from their busy newsrooms, a rare opportunity to explore environmental issues in greater depth without the pressure of deadlines. I, on the other hand, was looking to return to environmental journalism after some years away from it, and further develop my knowledge and skills. IJNR provided the inspiration, the story ideas, the mentoring and the practical tools to help me take significant steps toward that professional goal. I have since published stories about renewable energy development on tribal lands that were a direct result of the contacts I made and conversations I had while participating in the IJNR institute. The program was comprehensive and extremely well-organized, designed with the understanding that it is a challenge to get these important, complex stories told in a news environment that increasingly favors speed and quantity over quality. Here, an exceptional group of journalists had the space to think about their professional values and start developing some important stories. For the IJNR staff, this is a labor of love, and their support of the participants extends well beyond the nine-day program. They always make themselves available for questions, and the participants become sources of help to each other after the program. IJNR is a much-needed resource to ensure the continuation of thoughtful, investigative environmental journalism.

Client Served	5	02/27/2011	Like other journalism fellowships, IJNR puts journalists and experts together to help the former better understand environmental issues and their repercussions. Unlike other programs, IJNR puts journalists on the sites where these stories are unfolding. Sometimes that's on a wind farm. Sometimes it's a Superfund site. Sometimes it's out in the woods late at night listening to a man howl at wolves. Or sitting down to a meal of fresh fish, flanked by two people who each see the other as a threat to his own existence: an American sportfisherman on one side, a Canadian commercial fisherman one the other and the air thick with resentment. Whatever the case, IJNR doesn't just tell, it shows. And that depth of experience allows journalists to understand the scientific, cultural and economic impacts of each issue they explore. It is unparalleled in my experience.

Now I am writing a book soon to be published, having taken my interest in rivers to South Asia.  The organization provides training of unusual depth, allowing the reporters to interact with a range of experts across the spectrum of interest groups.

IJNR is notable for among other things helping journalists tell stories that I feel contribute to a more sustainable and healthy planet while also being fully objective and exploring all the intricacies and complexities of these stories, giving full credit to the industry and other viewpoints which are sometimes demonized by the environmental movement. The staff and leadership of IJNR have such an obvious passion for journalism, the environment and the individual journalists with whom they work, it truly is an honor and a pleasure to be involved with the organization. I would recommend IJNR expeditions and events to any journalist, especially young journalists looking for direction and background knowledge and a wonderful network of peers.

Our group of journalists had the opportunity to meet, listen to, question and learn from an impressive array of experts on several of the key natural resources/environmental issues specific to the region. The program, organized by Frank and his staff, really delivers on its goal to educate journalists in these issues so that they can provide insightful coverage with the depth, context and background that these complex issues merit.

As we traveled around the area, we saw first-hand the threats to the Great Lakes ecosystem and met and talked with people who were dealing directly with these issues. The highlight for me was our trip to Isle Royale in Lake Superior, one of the country's most remote national parks.

A week in Maine with IJNR staff and fellow journalists took me out of the office and into the woods to probe forestry issues and onto a lobsterman's boat to talk about marine fisheries. The experience gave me context useful in covering the beat back in North Carolina. IJNR packed the week with experts, put me in places I wouldn't otherwise have access to and took care of all logistical details. It was professionally a week well spent and personally a pleasure.

(The mountain-top mines in WV are not eager to give tours to journalists.) I have seen wind turbines outside WY up close, but chiefly in the "green vs green" context, so it was very helpful to learn how farmers need and appreciate getting revenue from otherwise underused land. Frank and Maggie Allen, and colleagues who have since moved on, were very helpful at drawing out our sources without dominating conversation.  They also lead writing workshops and hosted additional presentations (around campfires and in lodge lounges) to let local natural resource and industry representatives provide more information. The only complaints I can remember are trivial -- lodge first night stuck several of us in smoking vs non-smoking room.  And at one farm practicing a unique form of wetland water conservation (in arid region!), I ended up sleeping on deck (fine -- my choice), but became unwilling second host to border collie fleas!  (Both nothing compared to what I ran into in Africa.) A wonderful, never-to-be-replicated experience!  I urge you to help them keep it thriving. I don't understand question below, so don't know how to answer.  "Don't know" doesn't seem to be an option.

Institutes For Journalism & Natural Resources	74499		/users/profile/81407	michael	Client Served	5	02/24/2011	As the human population grows and places increasing pressure on crucial natural resources, we will inevitably become progressively more reliant upon science and technology to solve problems of resource availability -- ie. clean water, productive soils, quality food, uncontaminated air and energy. It is essential, then, that journalists have the tools to critically analyze and report on that convergent place where land use, science, politics, economics and sociology overlap. That is precisely what IJNR trains journalists to do. I have traveled with IJNR as a journalist-fellow, and can say from experience that the hands-on approach -- immersing reporters directly, for extended learning trips -- is tremendously effective. Any honest review and discussion of land-use policy must be grounded in a depth of understanding made possible only by the sort of rich context IJNR provides. It is an important and unique mission.

Sure, journalists can write, "the species is threatened and the future looks bleak."  And while that's sometimes part of the story, we've read it before. And it's not the whole story.

But as a reporter I known that deadlines bring their own perils- every reporter knows that sometimes we have to report on topics that we do not have a full grasp of ourselves. What IJNR does is give reporters like myself one week to reflect, digest and get an education without the pressure of a deadline.  IJNR takes reporters into the field so that we may learn to do our jobs better. By exposing us to an array of experts and academics who speak to the environmental issues of the day we become better, more informed reporters. And IJNR has been at this long enough now that they have the "1-week" fellowship down to a science. It's a densely packed, non-stopped week of immersion into the deepest, most difficult to crack issues in the fields of environmental science. I've been to two IJNR fellowships over the last 10 years- one in the southern Cascades and one in Puget Sound. Both fellowships gave me story ideas and insights that I was able to immediately apply to reporting when I returned back to the world of deadlines. I have nothing but the highest regard or what IJNR contributes to environmental reporting across the county.

Or maybe they get to their state capitol. Or city hall. IJNR gets reporters into the farmer's field, or forests, or oil patch, or onto a river or a lake -- often into rural areas where natural resources battles are fought. The expedition-style career development journeys introduce participants to all sides of issues such as water supply and quality, forest and wild land management, farming, commercial fishing, tourism and energy development. For a little more than a week at a time, these journalists get to go deep -- and hear stories of workers, of local residents, of developers, of farmers, of environmental advocates, of policy makers. These are really difficult times for journalists, and programs like IJNR offer can help journalists feel more engaged in the issues they cover, help them tell stories with greater authority, help them feel better about their chosen career path -- and help them do better work.

Institutes For Journalism & Natural Resources	71691		/users/profile/78396	AKeech	General Member of the Public	5	02/20/2011	Institutes for Journalism & Natural Resources provide unique and invaluable opportunities for journalists to learn firsthand about environment protection,  resource protection and economic issues related to development.  The subjects are extrememly complex and it is through the different Institutes that journalists can experience, learn and report for the betterment of us all.  Each Institute is in a specific region and environment, but the lessons are broad and deep...resource conservation, water, energy, land use, growth, development, fisheries, forests, farming, outdoor recreation, climate destabilization, ecological sustainability, etc.  Institutes this year include Great Waters, Lake Ontario Basin; Puget Sound Institute, Western Washington State; Energy Country Institute, New Mexico & Colorado.  The Institutes also has an established network and mentoring of journists and is Directed by two brilliant, organized, extremely knowledgeable and wonderful people, Frank and Maggie Allen.  Five stars - more if allowed!

I was exposed to a very broad array of opinions and knowledge on energy issues. I was on the ground for an entire week in Wyoming, where the issue is playing out in many important ways. Being there gave me a perspective I would not have gained anywhere else, most importantly in my understanding of how the issue effects local people.

The trip exposed me and other reporters to issues we had only passing knowledge of, from the loss of coastal wetlands to the growing industrialization of agriculture. Frank and the rest of the IJNR, including the greatly missed Andrew Weegar, were very capable guides to a variety of otherwise daunting subjects. I owe them a debt of gratitude (and a donation or two).

The IJNR conference last year in Missoula was so well attended and demonstrated the continuing interest and growing need for service-teaching organizations that directly advance the need for a clear understanding of our complex social-economic interactions with the natural world. Hats Off to IJNR!

I saw, first-hand, clear cuts, sustainable forestry, lobster fishing, paper producing, and other aspects of environmental journalism that I'd had to write about previously but had to do so from a distance. I made valuable contacts with experts, got some good story ideas, and experienced rejuvenating camaraderie with fellow journalists.

Consistently, they lead groups of interested professionals to physically investigate  the critical resources in the U.S., initiating them to the historical and immediate relevance of these natural commodities to our present and future survival, and to the personal part that each of us must play in the grand scheme of preservation.

The words "vision", "integrity", and "enlightenment" quickly came to mind.  I believe nothing informs as well as a hands-on experience, and I have been impressed by the testimonies of those whose experiences during IJNR explorations have literally changed their lives and their ability to communicate their recently acquired knowledge.   In an age of some deliberate misinformation  it is  imperative that the public know the truth about threats to our environment as well as actions which they can personally undertake to lesson the peril. 
Institutes For Journalism & Natural Resources	71101		/users/profile/77729	leechqueen	Donor	5	02/18/2011	I believe in a free and an informed press to help us make the best decisions in our democracy.  IJNR's work is absolutely unique and vitally important in helping us meet that goal.   For journalists who report on natural resource issues in the West, IJNR provides in-depth understanding of the players and nuances of Western resource issues.  Most of our nation, plus our members of Congress, live on or near the two coasts and know relatively little about the West.  But clean water, clean air, vast forests, recreation, and mining are our national heritage and are of concern to us all.  It is frustrating to those of us here who are concerned about these issues that a large number of our decisions are often made elsewhere by those who are not necessarily well-informed.  We at least want an informed press reporting on those issues; IJNR does a remarkable, creative job.  I know that journalists keep in touch for years after they have attended IJNR programs....that speaks well of them.   I am greateful for them!

If you work in natural resources/energy/or the environmental community and frequently complain about the quality of reporting on your industry, then do something about it and invest money and time in IJNR.

I had the privilege of working with Montana Maps, and The Rosten Foundation a couple of years ago when i was asked to help them with a project they were working on. It was at this moment when i became familiar of what MAPS was. The students I worked with were very professional, and were wise beyond their years. When i asked many of them of what they thought of MAPS, most of them said the same thing: it inspired them. By the end of my experience, I was envious of the students for the amazing resource that they had. Not only is there no program like it within the state of Montana, but I venture to say that few programs do what MAPS does on a national level.

Peter Roster started this idea at Corvallis High School where I had a front row seat to watch him develop it and guide it to where it is at today.  The unique opportunity he provided to so many students filled a niche that was much needed in our community.  The MAPS program gives countless high school students experience in the film industry in the remote mountains of Montana.

Irwin and Florence Rosten Foundation	150979		/users/profile/201378	Ceran W.	Volunteer	3	03/12/2013	I first developed my love of film in 2004. As immature as I felt at that age,there is one thing that has never left me from that year: how much MAPS helped me develop my skills, strategy and an ever growing love for the motion picture, and Media Arts in general. I then graduated from high school and managed to attend Montana State University, Bozeman  to further pursue my love of film. My freshman year, I was granted the opportunity to teach Media Arts classes at the Bozeman Boys and Girls Club. It was there that I got to interact and share what knowledge I had of film and social media with the youth of Bozeman. It was there that I learned that MAPS and institutions like it have a vital role in informing our youth of the secrets and motives of media as well as film. In life, there are always going to be stories told, whether they are made up or true. However, by teaching young individuals to tell the difference and decipher for themselves what they think to be true and false is both a blessing a curse. A person should always be given the option to choose for themselves, which is what I was taught to do. What I loved about MAPS the most was the creative skyline- the opportunity to make a story into reality and to work together as a team to ultimately approach an entertaining and liberating product for all to enjoy. What I wish I had done differently when involved with MAPS was work harder to make it a more statewide and recognized facility, and perhaps try harder for more funding because it would have been worth it in the town of Bozeman and probably all of Montana. Having said that, I would like to share a more personal story that I don't think many can say they have had the honor of experiencing. I was 18 years old when I came to Bozeman and first started teaching classes. If teaching is a word I can use loosely, I will, simply because I myself was quite inexperienced on instructing others how to splice Final Cut Pro frames. In all of my mediocre, and stumbled through lessons, there was one person who seemed to have an affinity to film, just like myself. He was a great artist, loved to laugh, and overall enjoyed the sheer company of those who loved to make movies. However, he and the other kids did not share something in common- the rest of them did not have autism. He was one of the only kids who ever came on time, came every time, and put forth all of his effort EVERY TIME. He was dedicated, he was challenged, and he persevered because he was so passionate and so enamored with making films that even his own mental disability could not stop him. I share this story simply because I would like to see most of us in our normal mind even try to make our dreams come true, even if we think we can not. And with MAPS, I think it could be possible, and with MAPS, it is possible.

Peter and the rest of the MAPs staff have created an inclusive program that demands excellence from the students who are clearly thriving.  I am happy to support MAPs and the Foundation -- there are so few programs that actually deliver a transformational experience for students as MAPs has done.

Irwin and Florence Rosten Foundation	150928		/users/profile/201295	Kelly75	Professional with expertise in this field	5	03/11/2013	I am a huge fan of the MAPS program. Providing students with ways to connect and feel valued and important is the goal of many programs, and MAPS stands out in the field because of its uniquely creative approaches to teaching real-world media skills to youth. Montana is fortunate to have this program and its clear that the students involved truly love the program and appreciate all that they gain from MAPS.
Irwin and Florence Rosten Foundation	150922		/users/profile/201284	JMarino	General Member of the Public	5	03/11/2013	The Irwin and Florence Rosten Foundation, which funds MAPS, is the creation of Peter Rosten. I am one of the few people who knew Irwin and Florence because they were the parents of my best pal growing up, that being Peter. For all those who are considering to contribute money and/or time in MAPS, rest assured that the person at the helm of the organization is very special. In addition to MAPS being a great idea, the people supporting this idea are top notch. I know Peter. I know what he has done in his life, I know what he did for me, I know his capabilities, and I am learning more and more about how he is contributing to the advancement of youngsters throughout the Bitterroot Valley who want to pursue the film production industry. MAPS is a breeding ground for expanding creativity in our youth. Its all good! John Marino
Irwin and Florence Rosten Foundation	150918		/users/profile/201272	John152	Volunteer	5	03/11/2013	I became involved with MAPS by volunteering as an adult in the film project they were partnering with the Forest Services Trapper Creek Job Corps. From there I spent the better part of two years volunteering in the web design and graphic design classes. The work that MAPS does in an after school setting with local youth is trend setting. While much of High School is dull busy work, Peter Rosten's program gets youth involved in real world projects, forcing them to collaborate, break down social barriers, and dig deep for their creative process, work ethic, and due diligence. As an adult I learned skills and fostered relationships with area youth that benefit all as we learn to bridge gaps between ages and backgrounds. MAPS continues to be be fluid in response to an ever changing dynamic world of design, able to change curriculum to meet the needs of local businesses and the demand for creative design and film projects. Peter hires top notch real world people who actually work and are successful in their discipline which lends a much more real world feel to the classes and environment as these pros are constantly needing to adapt and learn new skills as they appear in the various disciplines. In the end MAPS acts more like a mentor to area youth and they gain so much more from learning that way.

I was amazed at the program, the quality, the experience they were giving to local teens in film - to develop and experience at such a high skill level within each of their technology programs.  This is an awesome program that the Bitterroot is fortunate to have for our kids to express their passion in for the arts.  The staff is over and above the mark without question!  To produce the film, commercials and product that they do is quite amazing.

They are doing tremendous work with children and giving students top-notch video production training.  Their work not only teaches students about the process and hones and expands children's creative abilities, but their work is focused on quality high enough that much of their work actually see on the air!  As the state agency that provides seed funding for this work, the organization goes through a rigorous review as to how it approaches the work, what the students are learning and the quality of the training they receive.  The Rosten Foundation consistenty gets highest marks on all counts, and we are very proud to be associated with the product of their efforts.

In Bozeman to attend a conference at which I was speaking, I found their team set up in the living room of the guest house in which I was staying. The only thing that differentiated their process and dedication from seasoned professionals was their age. Later I again witnessed them hard at work, behind the scenes (they had been working on a brief documentary), and their enthusiasm was so apparent I drafted several of their member to help with a presentations of my own, which made my presentations that much more enjoyable for ME. I've nothing but good to say about the leadership I witnessed, as well as the dedication and spirit with which they embraced their efforts.
Irwin and Florence Rosten Foundation	150867		/users/profile/201195	Sandiwat	Professional with expertise in this field	5	03/10/2013	The Bitterroot Valley MAPS program is an outstanding program that gives youth an opportunity to pursue careers in the technological world.  This programs allows youth, who are interested in pursuing technological careers, access to instructors and employees from the movie/TV industry.  These instructors introduce the students to programs that are generally not found in local high schools.  The expertise from these instructors, who share their skills and talents, is phenomenal and many of them are straight from Hollywood.  MAPS students are learning real world skills by creating docudramas and PSA's.  Many of these students would have dropped out of high school because they could not find their niche in a traditional high school.  Some future Hollywood movie makers may come directly from the MAPS program.
Irwin and Florence Rosten Foundation	150866		/users/profile/201192	cbj232	Volunteer	5	03/10/2013	I joined MAPS to fulfill a school credit initially. But it turned out to be so much more than just another class! I learned so many skills from my year in MAPS that have enabled me to do many amazing things in my life today! I learned hard work, determination, creative writing skills, and so much more. I will always value my time in the MAPS program and hope that my children can one day have the opportunity to participate in such a wonderful program. I love you friends in MAPS.

Our community is somewhat conservative and Peter Rosten came from that hated place, "California'. But here they are 10 years later and I've know a lot of the kids who went throuogh the program and came out of it as better people. You can't really ask for more from a school program, can you?
Irwin and Florence Rosten Foundation	150859		/users/profile/201185	Tim_20	Donor	5	03/10/2013	What started as one couple's vision to educate and facilitate career growth amongst our student population, has now grown to a full scale community effort of local, county and statewide participation.  MAPS offers students the opportunity to learn and utilize real-world practicum for developing industry knowledge to move beyond High School in pursuit of college and professional careers.  In a time when budget cuts and rising unemployment figures muddle the water for our graduating seniors, MAPS builds independence, creativity, business sense and confidence in our youth... all traits that will suit them well in their pursuit of productive and happy lives in the working world.  By continuing to support MAPS, we are choosing to support and better future for all.

The kids see, to enjoy being there, and they pick up skills that can help them in the difficult job market.  The staff are all great to work with, and really passionate about getting the next generation interested in the various forms of media production. As a client I have been very satisfied with the more 'business' side of the operation as well.   The people at MAPS have made sure everyone involved has regular communication, client-side concerns are taken seriously and addressed appropriately, and most of all they really want the client to be satisfied with the finished product.  Excellent service and business practices are being modeled for the kids in this program!

Both of our children are very different in their learning styles and interests, yet it effectively serves all of their needs in different capacities. I've been so impressed with the mentor's abilities to recognize their needs and teach them accordingly, not bad considering how many children they're dealing with! It has opened up an entire new world to both of children and helped them realize possibilities that none of us knew existed. The mentors are also great at helping find resources beyond the program that pertain to our children's talents and interests. This is our first year with the program and we look forward to several more.  We highly recommend other homeschool and traditionally schooled teens to check out this valuable program.

Irwin and Florence Rosten Foundation	150528		/users/profile/200723	Mike71	General Member of the Public	4	03/05/2013	My interaction with this nonprofit organization is largely from a bystander point of view. I have never volunteered for the organization. I have never been a student member of the organization. Rather, I bore witness to the positive effects the MAPS program can have amongst involved students by talking to friends (who were members) while in high school. Based on their experiences and communications I can say with confidence that the MAPS program made an impact on their understanding of the video technology field which no doubt spurred their interest after high school concluded and into a collegiate setting where they pursued a corresponding degree in a similar field. They were offered the opportunity to engage with fellow students of similar interest while participating in fun and creative projects which often incorporated the community in some way. The MAPS program is a truly indispensable community asset.

I moved from Missouri to Montana just to see what the program was like and what was it all about. I never regretted that decision. Since then, they allowed to discover my filmmaking talent that i could never discover in any other place. They taught me that "one yes can change your life" and that i should "find your voice." As a result, i decided to follow those passions by getting a degree specializing in filmmaking because i love it so much, and so i can take my voice and talents to the next level. ITs all thanks to them. Thank you so much MAPS!

I have had the opportunity to attend MAPS for 4 years, i would say that this was a life changing experience, it helped me learn to co-operate with others on group projects,  not be afraid to share my idea's, and turn my idea's into reality. The teachers are very helpful and informative as well as friendly, if you have an idea they will help you complete what you want to do, even if the inspiration comes during a class project.

While I had been interested in theater for years, MAPS was one of the first programs that encouraged me to diverge into the medium of film. Peter Rosten greatly encouraged me as a writer, and as a mentor to my fellow peers. Without the MAPS Program of the Irwin and Florence Rosten Foundation and their encouragement, I wouldn't be where I am today: Graduating with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Film Production from the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, BC. Peter still takes the time to get me advice on any projects I've sent to him, and the program is still a supporting group in the background of my career. I can't thank them for their kindness, and can't speak more highly of what they are doing for students in a location where such film resources would not otherwise be readily available.
Irwin and Florence Rosten Foundation	150069		/users/profile/200093	Nick Andrews	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/26/2013	Thanks to the Irwin & Florence Rosten Foundation and it's support of the MAPS Media Institute, the youth of Montana have an incredibly special and rare resource for creativity and knowledge not easily found in the wild west. It's hard to imagine such a beneficial program with direct contact to the professional film world could be found in rural Montana. I have seen first hand the intimate understanding of film technique and craft the kids are exposed to, and then challenged to put to use, creating commercials for real world clients, music videos, and films.  I was first made aware of the program by a friend in a college film class, a MAPS graduate and star in her own right at film school. She put us in contact and soon, we were head first producing a statewide commercial, written, cast, and dreamt up by the kids, for the Governor's office! It was such a rewarding experience working with their quality content, and getting to teach them one on one about professional film set practices, working with green screen, and child actors...also a dog actor. Several years later, the kids came to a local film festival, packed with Hollywood power hitters, and in a few days time and many late nights, crafted an amazing documentary short on the untamed power and importance of mentorship, of which I was humbled to partake. The beauty of this program is allowing the kids to get dirty, get their hands on the gear, and get creating. In this business, you must have firm, unbridled creativity, and the technical knowledge of the craft to bring your vision to life. Giving the kids the opportunity to learn and practice at a young age and fostering a relationship with top established film professionals to mentor them provides a level of skill and confidence I've never seen before. But with these bright minds, the mentor street certainly isn't a one-way.
Irwin and Florence Rosten Foundation	150066		/users/profile/200090	Elysha R.	Volunteer	5	02/25/2013	My name is Elysha and I am proud to be a former MAPS student of the Irwin and Florence Rosten Foundation. In my 3 years of being in the program I learned everything from camera angles to stage lines, editing, how to hold a boom, a camera, writing scripts and much more. I have become a more social and a brighter thinker . I am so grateful for my teachers for creating such a phenomenal hands on well rounded program. I developed such a strong work ethic from working with fellow students, clients and also well known professionals in the field of media arts. One of my proudest moments of MAPS was helping create a commercial for federal financial aid. Our class took on the project start to finish. The news interviewed us and we later saw our commercial on TV which was so rewarding. I loved being able to write and read scripts and bring them to life. We went on locations to shoot our short and films. We each took on different roles directing, producing and everything in between.  I feel so proud to have been a part of a program that has inspired an amazing creative process that turns hard work into a finished project that we can all share forever. MAPS brings students together to work as a team and create beautiful movies, activities, and more for the community. Peter Rosten  & the MAPS team goes up and beyond for every student in that program. In our small town there are absolutely no other programs like MAPS!

The platform inspires youth to be proactive in assisting the community, a great bridge for them to expand in higher education after high school, and a milestone in job creation. In an area where little to nothing is to offer for this young generation, the Rosten Foundation and the Media Institute is a much needed platform for inspiring youth in creativity, team efforts, and hard work. Having been once enrolled in this service myself as a young man, the Foundation's service continues to inspire me on a path in expanding my career and achieving my goals. Please consider this great non-profit.

When Peter first started the project, he had to rely on donated computers.  I was happy to be part of a State of Montana program that could supply surplus computers to MAPS.  They've grown to where the State of Montana contracts with them for public service announcements and programing. Can't wait to see them become a major player in the film industry!
Irwin and Florence Rosten Foundation	149946		/users/profile/199927	Orangeglow	Client Served	4	02/24/2013	My son was involved with the MAP Program for two years. He got his first interest for media arts from this program. He loved it so much he thought he would major in college in media video. Since he has left the program his interest has changed in a different direction, but the experience he gained while involved have served him well in his new direction in life. He has used skills learned at MAPS to further every creative endeavor he has pursued.  Thanks you for the opportunity to enhance my sons life.

It is teaching much needed skills for those interested in filmmaking. It hope it is able to expand to other parts of Montana as well. 
Irwin and Florence Rosten Foundation	149930		/users/profile/199910	Brendan3	Volunteer	5	02/24/2013	I was one of the first students involved with the program when it began at Corvallis High School, and I cannot express my gratitude at creating the opportunity to embrace my dream. They don't sugarcoat the inner workings of hollywood, they provide the tools that the Pro's use and show us how they work. We learned to write scripts from actual pro's from the industry and we worked on the many roles on set. It's exciting, and enriching to work with kids your own age who share the same interests. We were excited to come to school for once, just because we loved the opportunities the class provided, Now it's become a large after school program for all of the bitterroot valley, and it's helping kids be more than they can be, and I would love to see it get the support it deserves.

I began attendance in my Sophomore year of High School and continue to use skills that I learned in MAPS even as a freshman in college. Thanks to the Irwin and Florence Rosten Foundation MAPS taught me not only media skills, but also valuable social skills. MAPS has helped me to get to where I am today, and without it, I wouldn't have the abilities and work ethic to succeed.

Client Served	5	02/23/2013	I can't even begin to explain how important the MAPS media institute is in my life and the positive effect it has had on me. I started MAPS my junior year of high school and I instantly fell in love with the environment, the teachers, and the skills we were learning. For the rest of my high school career, MAPS was the highlight of my week and I couldn't wait to see what we would be up to next, whether this was designing and animating out own digital art or shooting the old west sequence of our new short film. No matter what I would be able to come and hang out with an amazing group of people and let our creativity soar. Moreover, the program has impacted my future as I will always have the skills taught to me at MAPS and I don't rule out the possibility of a career in the field of filmmaking or design. It is a truly beautiful thing to have a place so welcoming where one can not only be themselves and learn awesome ways to express their creativity, but also have the privelege of interacting with great mentors and being able to take their experiences with them for the rest of their lives. I would highly recommend the MAPS media institute to anyone who is ready to find their voice!

I have seen young adults with no direction in life & no desire to participate in anything, open up & come to life. I love how these once shy kids are now involved in something productive & willing to step out of their comfort zone. I wish there was a program like this when I was in high school. Keep up the amazing work. Continue to give kids something to be involved with and proud of. Thanks for the positive influence!

I am currently enrolled at the University of Montana, and hope to be accepted to the Media Arts program their as well. I Highly recommend this program to EVERYONE in high school.

Irwin and Florence Rosten Foundation	149875		/users/profile/199860	Jim_51	Client Served	5	02/23/2013	A number of years ago, in a desperate attempt to help my youngest son find a passion in his life, I asked the director of MAPS if there might be room for him in the program.  Of course he said yes, and so began my sons odyssey into the world of Media Arts.  In a small town in Western Montana the MAPS program exposed to him a world that captured his imagination and ignited a flame within him that burns brightly to this day.  He is currently attending college and beginning to working within the industry, as well as preforming on stage in theatrical productions.  MAPS Media Institue has been a vital link to the world outside the boundaries of our small rural communities.  The program has helped to instill  passion in the lives of many of our young men and women.  Thank you Irwin and Florence Rosten Foundation for helping support the MAPS Media Institute, I doubt it would be here without you.

With out this organization, these kids would never learn about films, film-making, promotional skills, and the personal skills required to get the projects done. The staff is dedicated, dynamic and so supportive of each and every student. This program fills a very special need in the valley while giving back to all of us in the community and business sector. It is well run and progressive. Please take some time to learn more about them, what they do, how they do it and why you should support them with money, words and time. They will be very grateful and you will be better for it. Thank you.

General Member of the Public	5	02/23/2013	The Irwin and Florence Rosten Foundation is responsible for the MAPS Media Institute, which has been a boon to my home in the Bitterroot Valley. The MAPS program provides a fantastic outlet for creative expression by kids who, given the limited amenities of the area, may otherwise lack such opportunity. I have made a point to attend every screening of MAPS student films that I can see at the local cinema, and I cannot recommend the organization behind it highly enough. With classes in film, music, and design, the MAPS Media Institute is prepared to educate people with a wide variety of interests across the media spectrum. I have had nothing but good experiences with their instructors and students, and I encourage anyone with an interest in media to check them out!
Irwin and Florence Rosten Foundation	149866		/users/profile/199848	Rachel R.	General Member of the Public	5	02/23/2013	I had the sheer pleasure of meeting Peter and his wife Susan on a plane. When they told me about the program I knew it was the perfect program to inspire high school students. Peter is so warm and kind; his decision to work with high school students is proof enough of that. I have nothing negative to say about the MAPS program. Students learn about media and film, gain experience that they can put on a resume for years to come, and benefit from the experience of some genuinely amazing teachers. I cannot imagine anyone going into the program (either from a volunteer or a participant standpoint) and not benefiting astronomically. Even though my first meeting with Peter was only a few hours, I learned a great deal about media production. But my time with Peter has been so much more than that. Though I am a college student, I would still place myself in the "troubled youth" category. I have suffered from depression for years and was at a very low point in my life when I met Peter and Susan. They took me under their wing and are always checking in on the girl they met (totally by coincidence) on a plane. If the people working at the MAPS Media Institute are half as supportive, knowledgeable, and caring as Peter Rosten, then it is an institute worth noticing.

Programs helping youth and adult education in the valley have been designed and lead with the highest integrity. MAPS is well known in this small community; it is all about education, creativity and returning their learned media skills back to other nonprofits in the community. A dollar is stretched with efficiency in this program; I wouldn't hesitate to donate to this organization.

Students learn technical editing skills, filming, music, photography, and the foundation of hard work.  While working with these students I have been  impressed with their knowledge of technology and its applications.  These students also are polite and very respectfully of their peers and elders.   They have learned Civic Engagment giving back to their communities and the State of Montana. This program has made a big difference in so many students life giving them real life experience and helping them believe in themselves.

This opportunity rarely exists in the Nations secondary schools and has mapped out the path of practical applications for film and video and deserves the best efforts of Great Non-profits.

This program takes young learners and gives them a look into the world of the film industry. From editing programs to proper documentary filmmaking  this program will take you from learning to press record to making a short film. Peter and his fellow teachers will sit with you hands on showing you the ropes to the latest and greatest technology they have to offer. If you can create a program from merely nothing that lasts 10 years I think they have been doing things right all along! 5 years ago I was a student with M.A.P.S. and now I am a full time student at one of the greatest "hands on" film schools in the Carolinas. Without the knowledge and the program Peter has created I would not be here learning and getting a better education in the Film Industry.

The diversified content of media, art, and business, makes this program accessible to young people from all backgrounds, with all ambitions. Not only do high school students learn skills that translate into life outside of the classroom, they interact with industry professionals and experts, a powerful boost of confidence and motivation.

As an active community leader I have a pretty clear picture of which non profits fit where in a 5 star rating and I can only think of two or three out of the hundred are so I am familiar with that would gain that rating.  The Irwin and Florence Rosten Foundation promotes The MAPS program in our county and with no reservations deserves a 5 Star rating! Our children are our most important asset as a nation and rural children are very blessed in so many ways in that our values hard work and strong morals and supportive communities make us a great place to grow up however opportunities like the MAPS program were kids are introduced to high quality communications training is just unbelievable and a miracle for our children in the opportunity it represents and the doors it opens to new ideas and directions for their future rarely found in rural America. In researching this type of program I find it available in urban areas, the uniqueness of the MAPS program sponsored by the Irwin and Florence Rosten Foundation is that it is available to our high school age children in our county.  That it is impeccable   in all aspects and has been in our community for many years and never had one issue that would indicate poor management or purpose is something wonderful in the non profit world.  The success and positive results are living works of art called high school graduates who move on the higher education far better prepared for their future endeavors as they have gained such confidence both in front of and behind the camera as well as all of the skills required to produce products that can be shown on media outlets in our market.  The commercials produced by MAPS are as professional as any product put out by the major outlets and that is saying something.

These young adults  just love it and throw themselves wholeheartedly into their projects.  This is real world training... So valuable in this day and age.A real  self confidence builder!!  I personally know a few of these students and they are wonderful people.

I heard so many positives about the program from my friends. This is a great opportunity for those who have an interest in the media arts and want to focus on their creativity!
Irwin and Florence Rosten Foundation	149563		/users/profile/199374	DanC	Client Served	5	02/18/2013	I was one of the first students in MAPS when the program began. In a state where there are few elective options for the arts, MAPS was ground breaking. Aside from learning about scripts and camera angles our class learned to reach out to our community. So many problems or unexpected challenges arise while trying to make a movie or music video; we learned to problem solve quickly. The experiences I had have helped me not only as a youth but prepared me for other challenges in adulthood. I know this progam continues to provide opportunities for Montana's adolescents and I am honored to say I was apart of it.
Irwin and Florence Rosten Foundation	149552		/users/profile/199345	Michael157	Volunteer	5	02/17/2013	Hello I have worked with maps as a student in 2012 and it was the best youth program I have heard of and still to this day it is the best. It was exciting every day and that is all I looked forward to day after day. I learned more in this program in one week then a month in a professional college in preforming arts. The people here are like my film family they are so easy to work with and at the most professional manor they get the job done the first time on time. I really really hope I get to work with you again MAPS! -Micheal Muro  
Irwin and Florence Rosten Foundation	149547		/users/profile/28167	iawoke004	Volunteer	5	02/17/2013	I have volunteered for MAPS for 9 years. The staff focus is on the teens and their current and future needs, helping the youth be better prepared for the job market. I have never seen in any youth program this type of focus. The students learn about writing, communication, professionalism, accountability all in a fun and rich environment.  They have an end product, their film or web site, that they can be so proud of. What a great program. Teenagers need to be believed in and mentored. MAPS does that!!!!

They are given a opportunity to display such talent as writing, acting, composing along with developing interpersonal skills. MAPS has given direction skills and hope to many young people.
Irwin and Florence Rosten Foundation	149538		/users/profile/199332	pwalczak	General Member of the Public	5	02/17/2013	The Irwin and Florence Rosten Foundation- also known as the Media Arts in Public Schools (MAPS)  program, is a brilliant educational concept that  promotes creativity and constructive learning  for students in school districts that would otherwise lack outlets for these kinds of developmental experiences.  Here in the Bitterroot Valley and Ravalli County, MT where MAPS got its start through the Foundation, kids get a world class introduction to the media arts through the volunteer efforts of film, graphic arts, audio and web professionals.  As entre to a career field  that is quite distant from the traditional work experiences and educational curriculum here in western MT, MAPS stimulates students to explore hands on skills that can reach beyond the bounds of the current  local economy , and projects opportunities for those with nascent talents that would not be nurtured  without MAPS.    I believe there is already some empirical evidence that MAPS has helped keep kids on the track to graduating from HS, and other school districts in the state are adopting MAPS programs.  Having met many of the MAPS staff members and volunteers I  wholeheartedly endorse the Foundation and the great work they do.  A great program that is making a difference for our next generation, a non-profit organization worthy of wider support.

This is what MAPS meant to my Son. A Junior in High School and he was in a difficult period, thinking of quitting school. MAPS was his life line. At that time MAPS was part of the curriculum and through this program we were able to keep him interested and in school through to graduation. MAPS was the catalyst for his success. As a Mother watching her Child advance into a life long love is a truly miraculous journey. The Irwin and Florence Rosten Foundation has fueled this experience for many families. I would not have had the knowledge or the funds to do something like this for my Son without the foundation. I am grateful. And want other kids with a similar heart's desire to experience what my Son found through the Media Arts.

The experience I had was beyond phenomenal, it was life-changing. I've since moved from Montana and I haven't been able to find any comparable organization in any of the places I've lived. While I was there I saw kids find their way onto straighter paths, make goals to graduate high school and attend college and accomplish goals and projects that most adults would find challenging, if not impossible. I myself grew immensely in knowledge, talent, confidence and responsibility. Would I recommend MAPS to others? To that I give a resounding yes!!!

Irwin and Florence Rosten Foundation	27281	6	/users/profile/28326	marketsher	General Member of the Public	5	02/07/2010	I have watched the MAPS program develop in our local school system then move out through our valley to all schools.  Before this program started there was nothing that offered a media experience in our school system.  This foundation has given many kids a new view on their future and working in the community to help other non-profits produce materials to promote their message. Personally I have seen the dedication in the students that would take their own time to do live radio chats to promote what they were doing and why it is important to our community.Great program - I hope it continues to grow and develop exceptional youth!

Mr. Rosten treats us like adults, like business partners. The respect that he gives to us is great, it helps us to realize what the real world will be like and makes us want to do our best work. This is a great outlet for people to express themselves in so many outlets, from writing to filming to editing, there are so many different aspects of film making that fit every personality.

It offered him his creative out let and lead him to realize his dream of writing, teaching and Media Arts as a career. Without this program I don't believe that my Son would have found his talent as early in life and had the opportunity to focus on what truly made him happy at such a young age. It was this program that kept him in school.

With a positive and professional curriculum they have enabled these kids the opportunity to experience and contribute to all aspects of the film making industry. Many of these children are "at risk" and may otherwise end up on the streets or without any real skill or education. Through the education process at MAPS, they learn a work ethic and real life skills that they can apply to so many other areas of their lives. As a parent of a former student, and a business owner in the community, I can't say thank you enough to the team that has made such a significant impact to the children and our community.

Media Arts has done this with the institute in west central Montana, yet getting the youth to the classes remains difficult.  Lucky are those youth who are able to attend the classes and gain very real skills that translate into real jobs that pay living wages.

It's media program not only instructs but allows for the students to actually produce finished advertising campaigns, documentaries, scripts and other related media projects.It prepares students for real jobs servicing an area of Montana that is mostly rural and impoverished.

We had odd jobs around the base, from cleaning out the cow's water tub to helping build a house for staff to looking for a rattlesnake that bit 3 horses early one morning. If you need a set schedule of things to do, this base is not for you. Mission Builders with an open mind and a willingness to fall in where needed will greatly benefit this base. Kevin and Sherri Cooley, the base directors, were a blessing to our family by allowing us to be a part of their Cowboys With A Mission family!

This summer,  2-RVs belonging to George and Sue Spear and Lynn and Jacky Battermann were invited to the training center to replace the exterior end wall of the Girls-Dorm building. Tag Larson, Director had the plywood on site and with assistance of two staff members we quickly accomplished our task. we had materials and time leftover, so George said, " were having so much fun, lets do the other end of the building too as it is in bad shape." Yes, we agreed and finished out the week with accomplishing twice as much as had been requested. Tag and Deidra Larson were truly blessed that the Lord had given us the strength and wisdom to complete the task. We always enjoy volunteering at Discovery Bay, making new friends from around the world who come as students to train for the call of world missions by attending a DTS, Discipleship Training School for 3 months and 2 month outreach to a foreign  land.You would love serving there, give it a try, call MBI office and get started today.

No students were on campus as the fall semester had not begin.  We had a variety of jobs awaiting us and had some staff also helping with various chores.   Accommodations were quite satisfactory.  We enjoyed our work trip and learned more about the campus and their goals for providing students with the necessary skills for mission work.

I felt just like a member of the family right away. As soon as I arrived I was shown around this Christian base  and was continually amazed at all they had done with this 75 acres in the mountains. They generated their own electricity, grew their own vegetables and had their own water supply. The water was so clean....it didn't even need to be treated. I was helping with a woman whose name is Angel and we cleaned windows, bathrooms, and the laundry room. I pitched in with meal preparation as well for the small SST school that was in progress (Summer of Service and Training - for young people, 2nd photo) and staff, about 23 people. I was welcome to attend the classes which were very powerful. The grounds were immaculately kept with room for well over a hundred and fifty people. A nice private room was given to me in the dormitory with my own bathroom, frij and microwave - like a hotel, with laundry facilities across the hall. I went into town for one evening and on another day I hired a wrangler to take me horseback riding throughout the five days that I was there. I was expected to join in the weekly early morning intercession and be involved in after-meal cleanup. Leftovers were made available and food was plentiful so even though I came prepared to take care of at least half of my meals, I took most of the food that I brought with me back home. Other guests and volunteers came and went and were treated very graciously. One pastor/writer came from Texas to rest and recuperate and another family lived in their own house where the mother was undergoing chemo' for cancer so you can imagine all the generosity involved. Where do they get all this stuff? Staff is unpaid. I was so very blessed to be a part of this missionary training facility and hope to continue in this volunteer activity in other locations as well.Sarah HartmanRoosevelt, Utah

A bit worried as I arrived after 5 PM, I was met eagerly by the head of the base, Barb.  I was given a tour and made to feel really welcome.  Supper was at 6 & all the staff and students were friendly.  Now I am 73 & most of the students are in their early 20's BUT all talked to me, shared their stories with me when asked.  I was Blessed beyond words by my 2 weeks on this mountain top.  The genuine faith filled, humble attitudes; but normal young dress and actions so inspired me.

It is a great experience to see the kingdom of God at work around the world!  Even if you start out by volunteering for a day, it is a start !  That's what counts!  Not all bases are the same, but when you find one that fits, be prepared to be amazed at the people you meet and things that get done!  A couple of words will put a new meaning in your heart.  Yes...

Having seen an urgent need request posted on Mission Builders International (MBI) website for Berlin, GE, we assembled a team of four people and headed there for a 4-week mission trip. We were blessed beyond measure, as Jesus promised, serving those full-time missionaries on the tip of the spear. Not only did we complete several work projects and cooking for 25 people daily,  we provided much-needed encouragement and built relationships with staff and students that will last a lifetime! We have taken several mission trips in concert with MBI and cannot more highly recommend this fantastic organization to anyone interested in short-term mission work. They can use those who are skilled as well as those who think they are not but just want to serve. MBI provides mission builders to YWAM bases around the world - just pick where you want to go. If you have ever considered mission work (see MT 28: 19-20) check into MBI for opportunity and encouragement - you WILL be blessed!!Len & Lynne Benson

This facility has 1st class RV sites, or very nice room accommodations. They serve 3 meals a day. They appreciate volunteers and make us feel welcomed and useful. There are many varied taskes to do, from sewing, cooking, landscaping, office assistant, housekeeping, carpentry, painting, and very importantly the soup plant that produces literally thousands of servings of dehydrated soup mix, to ship overseas to 3rd world countries. It is not only used to feed the hungry, but also a tool to spread the Love of Jesus and the Gospel message. There is a job for every skill level. We have always enjoyed our time there.

YWAM Mission Builders dba Mission Builders International	231086		/users/profile/294690	patandthelma	Board Member	5	10/30/2014	The purpose of Mission Builders Int. is to come along side front line missionaries, the world over, and be a support to them. This entails anything that helps to make the life of the missionary easier and more successful in spreading the gospel of Jesus. As we read in Exodus 17:11-12, sometimes it is as simple as saying, "lean on me". We go to help make the missionary successful for God's Glory. In return, we get blessed beyond measure!!In being a member of the Board of Directors, for MBI, we have had the privilege to "go and do" many times. We try to take others with us in hopes of them catching the heart and vision of "Serving God Through Serving Others".  There are so many opportunities to available. It is amazing what God is doing around the work and that He allows us to partner with Him. Pat and Thelma Lewis

Sharing meals, conversation, worship, work, Bible studies and life experiences was refreshing and recharged our spiritual batteries.   Brian served by teaching carpentry as well as building cabinets for 8 kitchen units and working on Fridays at the Habitat for Humanity project in nearby Kalispell, MT.  Teaching a life skill like carpentry is a valuable outreach tool as well as being useable around the world wherever there is a need to build something.  Brian, who celebrated his 73rd birthday while in Lakeside, was immensely proud of the young men he trained and he absolutely loved teaching them. Karen was the front desk receptionist answering phones, emails, questions from visitors as well as handing out mail and packages---Amazon at Christmas time.  Because she handed out packages, she was  often a recipient of chocolate gifts.always yummy.     Occasionally, she was Mom or Grandma to students and staff with pray time and long conversations.  This base is a community that worships, plays and works together and does a great job of welcoming Mission Builders into their family.  Hearing what these staff and students do overseas and stateside was like hearing a continuation of the Book of Acts.  The staff that leads, teaches and guides this base is exceptionally gifted at modeling Jesus, the servant.  It was a privilege for Brian and Karen to serve them in return and they hope to return to YWAM MONTANA and work there again.    Brian and Karen Langton

We had a wonderful time. We approached MBI less than a month before we wanted to leave and they did awesome finding us a spot on such short notice. The leaders at YWAM Chatel were kind, generous, and so helpful in fitting us into the base's flow. We felt like we were a part of the team at Chatel and had a great time working, growing, worshiping, and admiring the Swiss Alps over Lake Geneva. We would happily recommend volunteering through Mission Builders.

We were warmly greeted and made to feel like valued members of the team there. We had good basic accommodations and enjoyed meeting people from around the world each day in the dining hall (good food too).  My husband worked on maintenance projects for the four story YWAM building we stayed at in a prime location in central Amsterdam. I was assigned to hospitality which involved everything from laundry to front desk reception duties. We had time to explore Amsterdam and the surrounding countryside. There were the usual study/training programs going on and also some special events that we were invited to be part of. We were told several times how much they appreciated having people our age there, and of course they were very thankful for the volunteer work we did. We would like to go back some time and will definitely explore volunteering at other YWAM bases as well.

I was glad to be able to help out in a useful way, but also found plenty of time to rest and to engage with the community. I loved working alongside other people - staff, students and other Mission Builders - and it was encouraging and inspiring to listen to other people's stories as to why they were in Montana, and what God was doing in their lives.

With the acquisition of the stores they support the homeless work. Sometimes we also helped whit the homeless minestry where we gave food to the homeless people and were their friends. We had a lot of time to build our relationship whit god. Also we could see, what it means to do a dts outreach.

YWAM Mission Builders dba Mission Builders International	257858	1	/users/profile/346327	jwithrow	Volunteer	4	09/16/2015	I had been to Guadalajara, Mexico before and so I wanted to return. I was thinking about how I could get there and enjoy my time there when I remembered YWAM. I had other friends do DTS's with them and all had had the most positive experiences. So, in short,  I trusted YWAM. That's what gave me the courage to go alone.  I found out that I didn't have to do a DTS but instead could be Mission Builder--simply volunteer. This was right up my alley. I wanted a low cost way to stay for a month and simply serve people and expand the kingdom of God. The people who helped me with the application process were excellent and hooked me up with Jose at JUCUM (YWAM in spanish) Guadalajara. After a few emails back and forth with Jose, I decided to buy the plane ticket.  My time there was so restful--even though I was serving. The time when I most realized this was after I had returned. The Mexican culture I was in was devoid of materialism and the drivenness of success that I constantly feel while living in the big city here in America.  So when I returned, all that "stuff" hit me like a wave. But, now that I'm back into the swing of things, I can see how my experience serving the peoples of Guadalajara, Ixtlahuacan, Chapala, and Ajijic will help me to live better while I'm here in the states. I have a much broader perspective on life--one that I don't believe I could have without physically going outside America.  I loved the Mission Base, all the people there, and the beauty of Lake Chapala (which the base overlooked from a mountain side). I got to learn more Spanish and was able to touch so many peoples lives with the love of Jesus. I felt so useful! All my gifts in teaching, music, and audio engineering were used. It was a life changing experience. I would actually love to go back and live in that area for an extended period of time. Maybe 2 years or so. I would love to serve the people there.  Overall, it was an absolute blast! I did expect it to be a good experience, but it was certainly better than I had thought! I would be a Mission Builder again in a heartbeat. 
YWAM Mission Builders dba Mission Builders International	254549	1	/users/profile/342897	Seulgi K.	Volunteer	4	09/01/2015	Hello. MY name is Sophie, and I vountaried as a missionbuilder at YWAM LA for 3 months.  The things I ususally do were landscaping, hospitality, and kitchen jobs. Most of work I usually do by myself and I'm so shy, it was hard to get along with people in that base. So I had plenty time being alone, I tried to use that time spending with God. Read the Bible, joined the worship time in the base.  During that time, I met holy spirit vividly. He said to me, "I love you so much, I love you and I love you." and repeat several times. And also, he said "I sent you here. Don't be afraid to be alone. I will send you people at the proper time, and I have been sending people since you have been here."  After that whenever I feel hard, I was trying to remind what God told me. I still remember what God told me. It makes me so cheerful and being loved by him.

YWAM Mission Builders dba Mission Builders International	253055	1	/users/profile/341198	ScottandSherie	Volunteer	5	08/15/2015	My wife and I spent a week at Lakeside, MT MBI/YWAM in May 2015. Our intent was to come serve and get a feel for the people involved with MBI and CDTS and to seek God's direction. We were very pleased with both programs as we were able to attend morning CDTS sessions while  meeting some very wonderful servants of God such as Arnold & Deb, Pete & Fran and  Donna Burgess. The classes were wonderful and we felt the Holy Spirit's presence during our stay, through the lives and the teachings of classmates and instructors. We look forward to future trips to Lakeside and beyond as we have plans, Lord willing, to explore more opportunities to unite with God's servants at Lakeside and eventually overseas, serving as Mission Builders and perhaps coming on staff eventually.

Always, we have been very happy that we did.  The different places where we went treated us extremely well with both food and accommodations.  Each time we met wonderful people in charge and also other wonderful volunteers.  With some , we have become friends for life. This kind of activity could be called vacation with a purpose even though we put in 6-8 hours a day.  Weekends are always free to explore and get to know the area.

YWAM Mission Builders dba Mission Builders International	245195	1	/users/profile/332310	ctriley	Volunteer	5	06/13/2015	My wife and i spent a week with YWAM Burtigny Switzerland.  This was a great experience from the first contact. Email inquiries were returned on a timely basis. Information was provided in advance to prepare us. Phone calls answered immediately and a smiling happy welcome when we arrived. This is critical particularly for first timers out in the field for the first time.  Then the real test is how are we intigrated as part of the  team...?  It was so easy. Everyone made an effort to sit by us at a meal and share. Answer questions and direct us as needed. None were aloof. We felt as part of the family.   This was a time when we're were able to serve others and yet made to feel as if we were the honored ones. We were blessed beyond our expectations....and then to add to this the natural beauty of Lake Geneva and all the towns to visit...we could not have asked for more.Craig and Karen Riley age 65 Stat of Washington USA

I filled out a 30 minute application, the was easier but hard because my skill set was not where I wanted to help out.

My list was early by home locations about as the months was fall by two of three location did need my skills.

Many of the volunteers there were retired people who had been coming to Tyler for many years, some were new. Several different organizations were represented. We had a great place to stay and the host was wonderful, Karen, made us feel so at home and welcome. The food was all included and usually quite good. We did have a kitchen and did some cooking ourselves. We had opportunity to meet and talk with many of the missionaries there, staff and students from all over the world. All were so appreciative of everything we did. Myself, I did a variety of things includig: cleaning, painting, cooking, and counting pills for un upcomming medical mission trip.

YWAM Mission Builders dba Mission Builders International	237777		/users/profile/322644	Manoela F.	Volunteer	5	02/08/2015	Hello everybody, This is Manoela from Brazil. I'm almost 22, industrial engeneering student and intern worker at Bosch Brazil.I got my vacation from work and college to be a mission builder in YWAM San Jose, Costa Rica. 10 months ago (April/2014) i understood a calling from God saying that i needed to go to some place not so reach and make the people feel loved through things that i like to do, for example, playing soccer.Actually the soccer program was for DTS people. But since there was soccer in Costa Rica I didn't see that like an obstacle. I arrive in Costa Rica on the 2nd of January and I stayed in a friend that I met in the USA last year and then in amazing friend of him until my journey volunteer journey starts.I went to the YWAM base on the 6th. At first I was really scared because my first roommates were 2 big spiders and I really got crazy. Anyway,  I was there a little bit afraid because it was at night so i didnt have so many people to talk. Before i sleep i just prayed to God saying that I was really afraid and really anxious because I knew nobody and I didnt have the things by my control overthere. So this was the most important  point to be worked on me. God is awesome, He just surprised me on the next morning that I woke up.  One thing that I was always afraid was dont have something to do like having too much free time. It was awesome because everytime that I started to think: I will have nothing to do in some time, He always surprised me with something, like in my second day in the base: everybody was playing soccer. This is something that I really like to do, actually, I could spend my whole life playing. On the next day I could go to the beach and day by day until my workduties start I always had something really exciting to do and everyday i could meet some new people. As a mission builder, I could work in sooo many things like I could help in the hospitality, I could help in the kitchen to cook to the base, I could play soccer again, I met the new DTS people and they are amazing I could not have better people to know. I could help the Homes of hope and the Metro Ministries too aaaand i could join some of the DTS soccer classes 
YWAM Mission Builders dba Mission Builders International	234640	1	/users/profile/301868	LPeter	Donor	5	11/29/2014	My wife and I joined Mission Builders International (MBI) in the late 1990's.  We served for several years on the Board of Directors; as "assessors" (i.e. is this project safe, strategic, and doable?) of foreign locations looking for help; and as missionaries to some of those foreign countries.  MBI, as it's mission statement indicates, "connects Christians to front-line missions"; equally as important in my view, MBI offers Christians wonderful opportunities to grow dramatically in their faith as they interact with very different cultures from their own and as they address real-life problems on the cutting edge of "preaching the good news to all creation".  In addition, when Mission Builders return to their home churches, they come with a wealth of legitimate hands-on, faith-buildiing experiences to share with their friends.  It's a win-win-win ... experience!  Who can pass up that kind of an investment? L. Peter Larson

I have witnessed this organization starting from no more than 2 people and their dedication to serving God. The donations received have always been responsibly spent and the example demonstrated by MBI has been a very real witness to thousands around the world. Many have grown in their walk with the Lord as the result of a well organized and dedicated leadership and staff. I am confident that God will continue to bless this incredible ministry.
YWAM Mission Builders dba Mission Builders International	234061	1	/users/profile/298143	Michael302	Advisor	5	11/20/2014	I was asked to join MBI some years ago after I met John Briggs and told him what I had seen in the mission field.  Living this past 25 years in Asia I have seen the great need for mission support, not just financial, but more importantly through having supporters come physically alongside and get involved.  The mission field can, at times, be lonely and daunting, but having witnessed how effective MBI is in helping relieve those stresses (not just by sending teams to help with projects, but also simply by having supporters help with day-to-day chores), I believe they have proved themselves to be a caring and professional ministry that is first amongst equals.

It's October 31st and winter is closing in here at YWAM Cimarron, Colorado. My husband Dean and I, in our role as Mission Builders, have just spent the last week helping the staff prepare for a remote, high mountain winter.  Dean has been hauling wood for the various buildings and doing maintenance while I have spent all week in the kitchen preparing food for the freezer...and whipping up daily sweet treats for the hard-working folks here. It is always a delight to spend time at this well-kept facility.  But way more than that, it is so heartwarming to see the way the staff here is so intentional about making a difference in the world.  They have all done outreaches to bring hope and help to hurting people in many rough places. Being part of the ministry of Mission Builders International is a richly rewarding way of living as we vividly see hope for the future happening before our very eyes.
YWAM Mission Builders dba Mission Builders International	232044		/users/profile/295596	Amy_203	Volunteer	5	10/31/2014	This past Spring my husband and I participated in a Crossroads Discipleship Training School with MBI. At the conclusion of the classroom portion of our school we went on an outreach with MBI staff to Romania. Through the experience we learned so much about God, his Word, missions and ourselves. We had our world view enlarged, our strengths matured and our weaknesses uncovered. We are so thankful to have had this special season together with Jesus. It has drawn us closer as a couple, opened doors for future ministry & learning and it has clarified our purposes for life. The staff were true mentors to us who cared about our individual growth and assisted us in having the best possible experience we could have. I would encourage those looking for a short term missions experience to consider allowing Mission Builders International to help them find a suitable placement, so that they may be blessed as they bless others.

After attending a Youth With a Mission Crossroads Discipleship Training School (CDTS), I discovered the opportunity to work at Mission Builders International.  I have been here as a full-time volunteer staff member for almost two years.  I have the unique opportunity to assist in the placement of volunteers from all corners of the world who want to serve in short-term missions around the world.  Mission Builders International makes it easy and safe for the volunteers, and it opens the door to new horizons!  Helping people to have a life-changing experience is an awesome job!  
YWAM Mission Builders dba Mission Builders International	231964	1	/users/profile/295522	greggcscott	Volunteer	5	10/31/2014	I have been associated with MBI for almost 20 years.  I have had Mission Builder oversight at a MB location in Kona Hawaii and seen hundreds of people of all ages come through our location to serve our Mission from 14 year olds to 80 plus year olds and most lives were incredibly changed or restored as well as for some at later ages, they would say "their lives had just begun". Serving others takes ones focus away from oneself to others and allows God to work in both lives in truly amazing ways. For the past 8 years I have served as "Field Staff" with Mission Builders International in third world countries helping to train people with to "capture" and "clean" water using Appropriate Technology. I have been privileged to have worked with the poorest of the poor but have seen lives changed as we empowered these precious folks to empower themselves.  Mission Builders has made this possible by providing a place for people to 'simply serve' those whom have needs both in developing nations and the 1st world. Thanks to all involved on the Board and Staff for giving Field Staff a platform to work from.

I love this role because we help lift the arms of full time missionaries around the world by placing short term volunteers on the field. It is a double blessing as those who go to serve actually benefit by exposure to a different culture and have an opportunity to create relationships with a myriad of people.. sometimes creating friendships that last a lifetime.We get the privilege of acting as a free travel agent for those who want to make a difference in the world, but may not know how to navigate the journey!We also get to go on the field and serve as well.

YWAM Mission Builders dba Mission Builders International	231343		/users/profile/294937	samsarvis	Client Served	5	10/31/2014	Some 15 years ago, we in Youth With A Mission Thailand asked Mission Builders International (MBI) if they would help us build a training facility in the northern city of Chiang Rai. We got much more than we expected! They first sent a team over to help us think through exactly what we wanted to use the facility for, and do strategic planning for it. Our eyes were opened in great and valuable ways by the team of volunteers who were very friendly & helpful, but extremely professional. From there MBI began sending teams over to help with the actual building, following up until it was completely finished. It has been an incredible blessing to our organization, and people from all over Thailand (and the world!) have been trained, equipped and mobilized from that Training Center.  We are very grateful to MBI for their invaluable assistance, and highly recommend them to any organization. You'll find that they do much more than "just build". They can also help you envision and think through goals for the future, and  make realistic and attainable plans, as well as helping with the practical aspects of construction, etc. We in YWAM Thailand have greatly benefited from the help of Mission Builders International.

They simply need to know where you would like to serve, when can you go and what skills do you have that you want to use.  Our family has served now in 4 locations that Mission Builders has connected us with.  We now have ongoing relationships with the ministries in those locations and are now making return trips.
YWAM Mission Builders dba Mission Builders International	231186		/users/profile/294787	JimJoy	Volunteer	5	10/31/2014	We have been serving the Lord as volunteers with Mission Builders International since 1994.  They have provided opportunities to serve as volunteers many places throughout the world at various Youth With A Mission campuses.  The needs for volunteers and the opportunities to serve are so numerous that it would take a separate book to compile.  We can safely say that this opportunity, thru MBI, has been a life changing experience and continues to change our lives still today.  The joy in the words, faces, and attitudes of those we serve and serve with, might normally be sufficient in itself, but there is still much to do  for the Lords Kingdom, and MBI has just the opportunities to fulfill those services.

YWAM Mission Builders dba Mission Builders International	231164		/users/profile/294764	lynnbatt36	Board Member	5	10/31/2014	Mission Builders International was founded out of the North American Office of Youth With A Mission in Seattle, WA in 1990. My wife, Jacky and I were part of the founding team of MBI in order to facilitate connecting  volunteers, skilled and unskilled with YWAM training center around the world.  MBI was modeled after a very successful mission builder program in Kona, Hi. at the University of the Nations Campus of YWAM. During our 2 1/2 years of volunteering in a leadership roll, assisting volunteers, in helping to build a world class campus, we learned how valuable volunteers can be to a non-profit ministry like YWAM.  MBI has given us, as a couple, wonderful opportunities to serve YWAM in numerous countries of the world building several training centers in Nepal and Thailand. In addition, doing many short-term assignments in support of getting YWAM ministry locations prepared to receive volunteers and making many wonderful friends as we served these front line ministries. We loved every assignment working with staff, students and volunteers over the years. Our lives have been truly enriched as we came alongside the missionaries in the foreign fields of the world and in North America.  We would encourage everyone to listen to God's voice, take a step of faith  and  volunteer with Mission Builders International. It will change your life forever. ShalomLynn and Jacky Battermann-MBI board members

They are friendly and have been doing this for many years. I highly recommend MBI for those who want to volunteer.  
YWAM Mission Builders dba Mission Builders International	230618		/users/profile/294246	Michele79	Volunteer	5	10/30/2014	A chance to use the gifts that you possess to help further the gospel message. From cooking to computer programming, and gardening to construction, there are so many ways to help. My husband is a mechanic and I am an avid gardener and cook. We've served all around the US and are so glad that we can be a part of mission work without having to go to a seminary for training! We just serve using the gifts and skills that we already have.  YWAM is s global ministry, so you can travel the world while helping others. 
YWAM Mission Builders dba Mission Builders International	230252		/users/profile/293901	GeoBatt	Board Member	5	10/30/2014	I am blessed to be a Board member of MBI. For me it truly is a two way street.  I get to see the results of Our lord and Savior reaching our thru MBI volunteers to serve people in need and people who are hurting.  And hearing first hand the of miracles precipitated by teams working world wide. On the giving end, helping set goals and directions for MBI and participating in the give and take of open discussions of how, when and where we go.  A big part of the board work is supporting the MBI staff with funds, prayers and encouragement.  Setting goals and watching the Lord bless us and help us reach those goals.  Board members also help the process of connecting volunteers with mission projects by being active volunteers and also describing how MBI works in making the connections.  
YWAM Mission Builders dba Mission Builders International	229020		/users/profile/292690	Eachus	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/28/2014	I have had vast experience in receiving YWAM Mission builders into our community to come along side long term missionaries in such a variety of services.  'builder' can be misleading if you take it literally. You do not have to be a carpenter or know the trades.  Our Mission Builders have served us in the kitchen, in the garden, in our pre school, in leading a daily devotion, in our worship team, being a hostess and decorator,  and yes, installing electrical, framing walls, laying carpet and tile.   Joining Mission Builders International is the key to unlocking the most exciting investment of your life and opens the world of missions to you.  You will always receive more than you give and that in itself is the blessing God has waiting for you.
YWAM Mission Builders dba Mission Builders International	228937		/users/profile/292612	MTTripper	General Member of the Public	5	10/28/2014	It's important to consider the leadership of an organization when assessing whether to volunteer, support, partner, etc. In the case of Mission Builders International, I have known and worked with the leaders for 20+ years and am proud to call them friends and neighbors. They quietly go about their business with integrity. The result is a loyal and passionate following for their important work. 
Central Asia Institute	305000		/users/profile/396206	EmmaKK	Donor	5	09/16/2016	We've set up our  donations  to Central Asia Institute to be deducted monthly automatically.  This ensures we continue to support this admirable, far reaching, non profit organization.  With two daughters of our own, we feel good about making education a reality for girls in challenging environments.  
Central Asia Institute	302971		/users/profile/394129	ephworks	Donor	5	09/08/2016	With all the talk in this election cycle about winning the war on terrorism, very little has been said about fostering peace.  CAI has determined that the best way to foster peace is through providing education to people who need it, especially women and children.  This has been their focus since the beginning, and I couldnt be prouder to support.  If your tax dollars go to fighting wars, send your donation dollars to create peace.  And, perhaps, with this model, we could better educate our own population and elect enlightened leaders to instill real peace throughout the world!
Central Asia Institute	301639		/users/profile/392617	willhendricks	Donor	5	08/27/2016	CAI against difficulties both internal and external has succeeded beyond expectations.  My wife and I have been regular supporters of CAI since reading "THREE CUPS OF TEA".  Education of girls is the key to peace. No one has done more with less in this area than CAI.
Central Asia Institute	301539		/users/profile/335795	ericholden	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/25/2016	The work done by CAI is critical to improving the health of the populations in the areas they serve. Educating girls in particular decreases family sizes, increases maternal age at first birth, and increases rates of vaccination and extended breastfeeding. Providing education for children allows them to envision a future in which they can surpass the roles their culture would place them in. It allows local children to become nurses, doctors, and engineers who return to serve their home villages. Please continue to support this critical work.

Central Asia Institute	300717		/users/profile/391601	Sharon192	Donor	5	08/16/2016	I think the future of the human race depends on educated people and so was drawn by the effort to educate girls and women to better care for families.  I appreciate the efforts to include young school children in more advantageous circumstances to participate as well.  The beautifully illustrated reports are very informative. I feel that my contributions can really make a difference in the lives of those less fortunate. 
Central Asia Institute	300686	1	/users/profile/391566	Faziak	Donor	5	08/16/2016	I first read Greg Morteson's book "Three cups of tea" about 7 years ago.  That's when my life changed! .  I was left in awe of this simple man's spirit and determination to help those who so  desperately need help.  His courage and perseverance,  putting his life at risk several times for strangers...  not many people do.  So I called the number at the end of the book and started my monthly donations.  I am tremendously pleased with the progress of his organization CAI,  and am very proud to be a donor.  So many young girls now have a future because of him and and others like myself.  He is a true inspiration and I wish one day to meet Mr.  Mortenson so that I can shake  his hand and say 'Thank You'  for  all that you have done.  He is truly one person that I can say has literally changed  the world!  If you're a reader you must get his first book at least "three cups of tea". Fazia Khan Very proud supporter and donor.  
Central Asia Institute	300650		/users/profile/391524	Writer	Donor	5	08/16/2016	We were looking for a group that was helping in an area of need that wasn't being addressed by other organizations. CAI was the only group that we were aware of that was helping girls get an education in some of the remotest villages on the planet.  CAI has been a consistent and growing presence in helping these villages set up schools where there had been none.  CAI has been there to help the villages rebuild their schools when nature has shaken them to the ground.  Their efforts and those of the villages they are helping have over time born the fruit of educated young women who have returned to their communities as teachers, healthcare providers and other professions.  These returning young women are inspirations for the girls and boys in their communities to strive for something different and to give back.  What more would one want from a donation?
Central Asia Institute	300383		/users/profile/391239	Anita56	Donor	4	08/12/2016	I remember way back in 2006, it was a rainy night on march 20, that I met Greg Mortensen on his book promotion of Three Cups of Teas on El camino Real, Palo Alto, California.I admired his passion for building schools for girls in such remote and barren region and echoed my belief that world peace through education, especially so in middle east wheremost girls don't have opportunity to get educated.it has been more than a decade since i became a donor of Central Asia Institute and i will continue to do so because the world is in need of our efforts more than ever.
Central Asia Institute	299816		/users/profile/390630	Writer	Donor	4	08/08/2016	I believe it is important to educate girls and women especially in countries that don't usually do this.  It not only helps the girls when they become adults and have families of their own but helps the villages they live in to advance too.  I think the world will be a better place when everyone, man or woman has a chance to be educated.  Building schools in central Asia is a beginning and I am happy to know that many girls have received an education due to my donations.  
Central Asia Institute	298547		/users/profile/389420	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	07/29/2016	I was initially inspired by Three Cups of Tea - the story of how the idea of building schools in remotest parts of Asia all started.  I have been a campaigner for the global environment for decades, and also for women's rights to control their own fertility - only when soaring rates of population growth are cut almost to zero, will efforts to conserve the natural environment really succeed.  Vital to this is the education of girls, so that they can aspire to a wider future than constant child-bearing.  As teachers, doctors, lawyers they will power the development of more harmonious societies.
Central Asia Institute	236001	11	/users/profile/319710	JasonStrand	Donor	5	12/28/2014	Central Asia Institute is a unique nonprofit, doing difficult, complex work of establishing girls schools and promoting women's projects in some of the most difficult, dangerous, parts of the world. I have yet to find someone working in the exact same areas for the last two decades, and able to produce. Central Asia Institute CAI produces a project master list  CAI also unfortunately has been the subject relentless media attacks, which has reduced its funding by 80%. These include flawed attacks by CBS, NBC, Washington Post, Jon Krakauer, Tom Brokaw, and others, some of which regarding financial information is accurate, but the large portion are biased, out of context, misrepresented, and even false statement in the case of CBS, which has produced critically flawed, wildly inaccurate, sensationalized, also been caught flagrantly lying about Benghazi, NSA and Social Security Administration. Instead of following the media to learn about CAI, please look at the Attorney General's report, lawsuit dismissal, IRS investigation report, all which state the organization has not committed any crime or fraud, as the bias media would have one believe. The law is more accurate than the media which no longer has the credibility to protect the fifth estate. Watch the documentary "Shadows Of Liberty" to see how corrupt and flawed TV media has become in a sell-out to corporate conglomerates. Watch "Shadows of Liberty" documentary to see how media has been bought out and TV  stations like CBS seek to destroy nonprofits and companies doing good work.
Central Asia Institute	235386	9	/users/profile/318898	Jan_61	Donor	5	12/12/2014	I continue to donate to this organization and have faith in CAI's management.  They have addressed funding/organizational issues responsibly and continue extraordinarily important work in central Asia.
Central Asia Institute	234890	21	/users/profile/305612	ikatshahn	Donor	5	12/03/2014	I have donated to this charity for years and intend to keep doing so. A while back 60 Minutes did a piece on this charity to highlight claims of abuse by a climber and author. As I had promoted giving to this charity with family and coworkers, I was interested in learning more about the claims presented by 60 Minutes. What I found was that to learn more about the specific charges, I was expected to pay a fee to access a website containing an online book. After using every other avenue available and finding out all the information about the charges, here is my summary view of them: The otherwise peerless CBS 60 Minutes was duped into providing free publicity for a money making effort by the person who made the claims. Furthermore, in investigating Mr. Mortenson's so called lavish personal travel benefits: I looked at the event schedule, trying to find a date to hear him speak in person. Day after day, week after week, month after month was filled with events for faculty, students, groups, and boards. I have had to travel extensively for my job as a staff trainer. I could not have held up under Mr. Mortenson's schedule. Each day of every month was crammed full of educational and fundraising events throughout the morning, day, and evening. Then a flight to another destination, sometimes with another event taking place upon arrival at that new location. Most of the events were at U.S. colleges and universities, and at community groups where those institutions are located. His detractors would have us believe that he was flying around the world on a vacation junket to luxurious tourist destination resorts. Also, one reviewer here said building schools is cheap, but staffing and maintaining them is the difficult part. This is quite true. Please use the links here to go to this charity's webpages to see how paying teachers, providing school supplies, and supporting attendance is a large part of their efforts. U.S. government military built schools may be very generous, but unfortunately are viewed by locals as attempts to subvert their culture. CAI does not just go somewhere and build a school in hopes that teachers and students will somehow show up. They receive requests from village councils to build a school in a remote village, one that the government will not serve with its own resources. In lands that are dominated by warlords, zealous clerics, and tribal chiefs, no one is going to send their children to a school unless such community leaders support it. The brush with 60 Minutes caused the charity to make many changes to ensure transparency, protect the investments of donors, and ensure the long term viability of its charitable operations. If you want to make your own decisions about these concerns, please visit the archives of the Daily Bozeman, the court documents, the charity's website, and good old Google searches. I trust you will arrive at the same conclusions I have.
Central Asia Institute	234776	11	/users/profile/303440	herringj	Donor	4	12/02/2014	After serving with the U.S. military in Kabul, Afghanistan, I observed the effects of discrimination against girls and women. The Afghan Major General in charge of the Ministry of Defense (MoD) legal department proudly claimed, "Four women equal one man!".  Greg Mortensen, though imperfect, has broken the code on breaking the cycle of illiteracy, poverty, and ignorance in South Asia. His organization needs our support. The solution, rather than military might, is soft power through education. Please help us turn the tide--donate to CAI.
Central Asia Institute	149018	5	/users/profile/105732	Marc Silverstein	Donor	1	02/06/2013	David Starnes joins CAI team as new executive director  Will move to Bozeman in late Febuary.Central Asia Institute announced today that it has hired a new executive director, David Starnes.  David, a 57-year-old father of three, will join us in late February after winding down his work with USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives-Pakistan. He brings to the job more than 30 years experience as a professional and organizational development consultant, working with nonprofit, for-profit and government organizations, including 19 years as executive director of the Baltimore-Chesapeake Bay Outward Bound Center. David joins us just as we are gearing up for the 2013 building and maintenance season. In the past year, bolstered by our supporters' continued confidence, we sustained our commitment to more than 300 existing projects, and initiated 60 new projects: 20 in Pakistan, 36 in Afghanistan, and four in Tajikistan. As most of our projects are in the remote Karakoram, Hindu Kush, and Pamir mountains, springtime is the busiest season. "I am looking forward to working with CAI's team both in the United States and in the communities it serves," David said. "CAI has made a profound impact on people's awareness of the need for education and community health initiatives in the remote and rural villages of Pakistan, Afghanistan and Tajikistan. I'm excited to be on board." Greg Mortenson, CAI's co-founder, served as executive director from CAI's founding in 1996 until December 2011. He remains on staff, playing a supportive role, primarily with overseas programs and relationships. He will also continue to help with fundraising.  "With a new, capable board of directors and the experienced leadership of David Starnes, CAI is ready to move strongly into the future," Greg said.   David currently serves as the deputy country representative for USAID-Office of Transition Initiatives in Pakistan. He has been in Pakistan since January 2010 working with the Pakistan government in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas and Khyber Pakhtunkwa Province to provide basic support and stabilization services for communities in the critically important border areas of Pakistan and Afghanistan.   Prior to taking the USAID post, David spent a month as a volunteer in Jordan, teaching English at a Palestinian refugee camp. From 2008 to 2009, David worked as a senior program analyst with Stanley, Baker, Hill LLC in support of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE)-Office of Safety and Health in Iraq.   Stateside, David worked with Outward Bound USA for more than 20 years in a variety of senior executive roles, including his years at the Baltimore center, Outward Bound's first urban center. He worked with local government officials to initiate the Philadelphia center, and played a key leadership role in shaping Outward Bound USA's long-term strategy on urban centers.  David earned both his bachelor's degree in parks and recreation administration and master's in public administration at Western Illinois University. He has three adult children, Justin, 28, Rachael, 26, and Sarah, 24.   CAI launched a nationwide search to fill the executive director's position and received dozens of qualified applicants, said Steve Barrett, chairman of the CAI board of directors.  "CAI is excited to have someone of David's background and experience join us in our mission to promote literacy and education, especially for girls," said Steve, a Bozeman attorney and former member of the Montana University System's Board of Regents. "David's extensive experience in community development and his past three years in Pakistan uniquely qualify him to help CAI continue to fulfill its mission of the last 17 years. Our board is thrilled and we look forward to David joining our team."  Last August, Greg noted on the CAI Communique: "Being executive director of Central Asia Institute is a unique task with incredible rewards. More than a job, it is a calling. ... We look forward to the added vitality that this person will bring to the CAI team - especially during these particularly challenging times in the communities CAI serves in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Tajikistan."  
Central Asia Institute	147346	9	/users/profile/194682	Karen151	Donor	4	12/27/2012	I am not a little disturbed by your information on Central Asia Institute, as it is badly out of date. Greg Mortenson resigned as Executive Director some time ago and recently has left its Board of Directors in order to preserve what has been an important mission of both Mortenson and the Institute. I shall continue to contribute.
Central Asia Institute	133203	15	/users/profile/178909	doremi	Donor	5	11/04/2012	I feel Greg Mortenson is one of the great men of the world and question whether that can be said about 60 Minutes or Jon Krachauer.  One of the reviewers commented that his was an impartial report.  How do we know that?  Obviously, Mortenson is not necessarily good at handling money and it appears that the institute has recognized that and is now using him where his talents are strongest.  How many of us can say that we have done so much to change the world for better?
Central Asia Institute	113884	8	/users/profile/154967	PJ Glavey	Professional with expertise in this field	1	06/05/2012	I've spent many years in Afghanistan. I donated good money to the CAI nearly a decade ago. Greg Mortenson has been proven a thief. Believe me when I say this: putting up schools in these countries cost's nearly nothing out of pocket, but costs nearly everything out of heart and passion. When I was in the Marines, we built three schools in 1 DAY! You know what took 6 months? Getting students there, getting teachers to stay, getting girls there and getting supplies. Mr. Mortenson, you may think one day that people will see your overall effort as positive. Don't, for a second, think that I will. Spending $1.5 million on domestic travel for yourself. What you've done is beyond forgivable - not because we can't forgive, because we must forgive - but because a man of your malicious moral fiber can never be upstanding. There's a reason you spent your twenties living in a car - if that was even true - because you can only steal your wealth.

CN should continue to display the CAU financial information, and put an advisory about the allegations, but let the donors make up their own mind.
Central Asia Institute	102759	2	/users/profile/135563	stillprayn4peace	General Member of the Public	1	01/01/2012	I have no idea why people would want you to take down your "Donor Advisory"; I, for one, appreciate it and it's one of the reasons I use Charity Navigator!  No, simply reading the reviews and other info doesn't speak for itself - the advisory is helpful.  As a co-founder of a non-profit that works with war-injured children, I'm appalled at the "salary" and perks that Greg Mortenson was taking from his "charity".   I think what the CAI does is wonderful, but without removing Mortenson from the Board, I can't have much faith that the money is going where it should.
Central Asia Institute	102648	5	/users/profile/134835	sam amirfar	Donor	5	12/26/2011	I agree with the other reviewers. Please just present the facts and treat them like any other charity. Information about their financials would be very useful. Links to outside web articles and a blinking red advisory seems excessive.
Central Asia Institute	99177	8	/users/profile/118671	connierae71	Donor	5	10/10/2011	I agree with other reviewers who have asked you to simply post the charity's information and financials as you do for other charities so potential donors can make their decisions based on data.  I believe you lose some credibility when you allow news magazines and authors trying to sell their inflammatory books to make your evaluations.
Central Asia Institute	97987	10	/users/profile/115925	Corey B.	Donor	5	09/23/2011	Charity Navigator, please take down the Donor Advisory.  Just post their financial information and let it speak for itself.  On their website, CAI says they have averaged spending 83% of their revenues on programs. Maybe recently they've been saving up, because of all the added revenue from the books.  It would be wasteful to spend money that fast, just to say that their spending percentage met a certain requirement.  They obviously have a larger revenue stream than ever before, and they want to be careful how they spend it.  It takes a lot of time to lay the social and political groundwork for a new school.  They can't just say, "let's build 100 schools this month, because we have the money for it."   I've been a loyal donar to CAI for about a year, and all this controversy honestly scared my wife and I enough that we've stopped our monthly contributions to them.  Reading the reviews of others on this site, and looking at CAI's site has reminded me how awesome they are.  We'll be giving monthly to them again soon.  
Central Asia Institute	96777	1	/users/profile/113053	flyboy4014	General Member of the Public	1	08/28/2011	People have to start looking into more and more charities. The public is just taking for granted that when the word charity is involved, that the money u give is being used in the charities best interest.  What I am finding, is that alot of charities are benefiting contractors or members of these charities or services provided to these charities are profiting greatly and only a small % of funds are going to help the charities mission...please investigate the %of money made vs. money given to charity grants (not salaries, not expenses, not questionable payments to 3rd parties...one on my radar is Susan B Coleman that spends over 70 % for salaries and other questionable expenses...hundreds of millions collected for the AWARENESS OF BREAST CANCER...Im aware, how spending hundreds of millions on cure, research, care, and prevention
Central Asia Institute	96600	6	/users/profile/96419	Yellowfang Greystream	Donor	5	08/25/2011	I want C.N. to remove their "warning" as I belive CAI has satisfactorily answered all the allegations.  It's over.  I have confidence in their belief that education is the only way.  Hey, all that killing and all that bombing have not changed a thing.  Education both in the US and Pakistan and Afghanistan is our only hope in getting them out of the stone age, giving women the freedom of choices they deserve.   
Central Asia Institute	90527	2	/users/profile/96419	Yellowfang Greystream	Donor	5	06/12/2011	I beleive all the allegations have been answered by Greg Mortonsen and CAI.   I believe this "warning" of these unproven accusations should be removed from Charity Navigator.    I believe that the money is being used appropriately and I suspect some of you critics may not know a lot about his work...he is the attraction, he is the one that must travel, and sometimes to places where commercial planes, etc. would not be practical.  He recently spoke at a small town in Michigan and spent hours signing autographs adn speaking to people personally.  How many of us would kill our selves for a cause we fully believe in?   I will continue to support this man.  His approach, I beleive, is the only way to change things in the Middle East.  And it's a lot cheaper than war.
Central Asia Institute	86217	2	/users/profile/96419	Yellowfang Greystream	Donor	5	04/18/2011	I'd like to know what the ulterior motive behind this is.  And if it's on TV we should all believe it right?    If you check their website you will see that questions about Greg's "use" of funds has already legal been reviewed and found to be alright.  I'm sure the CEOs of other charities do not fly around the country and pay from their own pocket. I saw him speak here in Michigan last year...he is obviously passionate about helping these kids, he stayed and signed autographs personally for well over an hour, speaking with each of us personally and seemed tired, but never rushed anyone that wanted to talk. His schedule is day after day after day of travel and you sure can't depend upon commerical flights for dependability.  Reference the salaries of a few other charities who are having less of an impact on the world and our future and compare salaries.   The only way to stop the hatred of the US by these countries who are uneducated and secluded from the real world is education.  I couldn't care less if he "condensed" his Korphe experience, so what. What matters is what is accomplished now.  He spent a lot of years of his own effort to get this going.   Please tell me what the hidden agenda of this Krakauer guy is???
Central Asia Institute	94029	10	/users/profile/108576	knichols	Donor	5	07/19/2011	My husband, a Peace Corps volunteer teacher in Afghanistan during the 1970's, and I have been steady supporters of CAI since we initially learned of its activities several years ago. The building and schools and the training of teachers, focusing on female students, is of prime importance to the future of Afghanistan in our experience. All the information from CAI rings true to us. We follow their website, meet with their personnel, and attend their meetings on the West Coast.  The "60 minutes" program appeared to be based primary on a disgruntled employee. CAI has mounted all its financials on its website. We continue to support the group fully and gratefully.
Central Asia Institute	93374	5	/users/profile/107360	Anthony A.	Donor	4	07/04/2011	NAME ONE ORGANIZATION THAT HAS BUILT ANY SCHOOLS IN THESE CONTRIES???? HAS 60 MINUTES BEEN INVOLVED IN ANYTHING HUMANITARIAN IN THE US OR THE WORLD??? DOES DESTROYING AIS HELP ANYONE??? WHY DID 60 MINUTES DO THIS INSTEAD OF USING A  HELPING APPROACH???
Central Asia Institute	91222	4	/users/profile/104275	Susan Whitmore	Donor	4	06/17/2011	The CBS News / Jon Krakauer allegations of 4/17 and thereafter PLUS the ongoing investigations by the Montana AG and Penguin / Viking Books cause me to enter a 4 rating rather than a 5. In other words, I continue to support the organization fully as I have for 3+ years, but I recognize that there are questions to be answered. I subscribe heartily to CAI's philosophy and success in gaining village agreement, resource support, and sweat equity for every bridge, school, women's center, and medical center they fund. Also their financial support for teacher training and stipends without any attempt to  say what the subject matter and curriculum should be. Lastly, I believe in the engagement of students throughout the US (and beyond?) in funding school supplies and uniforms for village children who will attend those or other schools, taught by those or other teachers. I expect CN to drop the Donor Advisory as SOON as the investigations are published, unless those results cause CN instead to reduce its own valuation of CAI's worth and viability.
Central Asia Institute	90496	4	/users/profile/103230	Dawn C.	General Member of the Public	5	06/11/2011	Yes, I saw the 60 minutes report -- but did anyone actually take the time to read his responses (and the CAI's board of directors) to the 60 minutes report?  You know, his side of the story? The fact that perhaps the reporters who questioned folks in Pakistan and Afghanistan might have talked to the wrong people?  60 minutes raised some good questions, but they gave him less than ONE WEEK and were in his FACE demanding an answer.  Anyone take a look at the CAI tax returns on the CAI website?  Mr. Mortensen was making $28k in 1996.  In 1997, it was $31k.   In 2003, something like $50k.  TO LEAD AN ENTIRE ORGANIZATION AND BUST HIS TAIL DOING SOMETHING NOONE ELSE WAS WILLING TO DO!  You can start criticizing the day you go over to Afghanistan and build a school.  Give the guy a break.  His compensation now takes that into account (again, read the response from the CAI board on the 60 minutes website, at the end of the article). Perhaps he needs to hire a PR person or a business manager to handle the reporting better, or hire someone to track exactly how many schools are built and visit them each once a year to check on their progress, but Krakauer himself said that Mortensen's a good guy with a good heart.  Don't believe everything you read, but don't believe everything 60 minutes reports.  Everything is ALWAYS slanted, on both ends of it.  I'm giving it 5 stars to compensate for the ignorance of some of the other reviewers.
Central Asia Institute	88466	2	/users/profile/99602	Wayne	General Member of the Public	1	05/07/2011	Not impressed... if I want data on a publicly trade company I can access that data without registering, or being "authorized" to review the data.  At first glance it appears that you are hiding something.  I bought the book, but I have not donated and at this point will not donate.
Central Asia Institute	88404	2	/users/profile/99467	E H Wilson	Donor	4	05/05/2011	Charities that do this type of work  are desperately needed in places where war zones are present in Pakistan/Afghanistan.  Greg M had the foresight to see the need for schools and then figure out a way to implement his ideas after voluntarily deciding to get involved in this activity.  From the beginning as he states in his books he is a much better volunteer than a businessman or accountant.  Unlike many of us fellow Americans safe in our homes he is risking his life every time he goes to Pakistan alone.  Often he has to deal with the diverse and confusing Pakistani political scene  to travel and to procure materials.  Logistics are a nightmare and often require extreme patience and money to protect and store supplies.  His campaign for building schools starts and ends with the local population in each village.  This most significant fact was omitted in the 60 Minutes interview.  On top of all this he has had to deal with religious leaders and issues that could have not only stopped him in his tracks from continuing but could have lead to his death because he would be viewed as an infidel as well as an American in terrorist infested areas.   I don't know of John Krakuaer's involvement other than that he is complaining about a fellow mountain climber and has some strange idea about what  it takes to do the things Greg and his family have accomplished.Clearly, some accounting must be made to clear up Greg's good name and to reaffirm his voluntarism.  I plan to continue my support of CAI as I know of no other similar organization that has had such a positive impact on the Northern tribes of Pakistan.   They rely on CAI much more than on the broken promises of the Pakistani government.
Central Asia Institute	88346	2	/users/profile/99335	Leslie Richter	General Member of the Public	1	05/03/2011	The news about CAI's alleged fraudulent activities continue to grow.  I would like to know how Charity Navigator can continue to list them as a 4-star charity given the amount of data that is now available.
Central Asia Institute	88036	3	/users/profile/98872	Ann E.	Donor	1	04/29/2011	I have discontinued support of this organization because the funds are not being used properly. Something is amiss when travel accounts for more than 50% of service expenditures. Something is amiss when no per diem monies received by GM are returned to the organization despite it paying for his travel to events where he earns per diem (sometimes first-class according to the 990). Something is amiss when the CAI publication purchases exceed $700,000 and the obvious purchase option is GM's books. I don't agree with the conclusion of the internal review of potential conflict of interest; GM has a conflict of interest that has not been adequately resolved. 
Central Asia Institute	87974	2	/users/profile/98802	RVanS	General Member of the Public	1	04/29/2011	Guidestar apparently does not rate these charities, but must regurgitate whatever marketing comes from the organization.  Don't just watch "60 Minutes", read Jon Krakauer's unbiased report.  I am only adding this ZERO (but made into a 1 because the system does not allow below that) rating to neutralize some of the 5star opinions listed here.  BUT I am informed.
Central Asia Institute	86893	1	/users/profile/97410	Paul Eklof	General Member of the Public	2	04/23/2011	I think Charity Navigator needs to explain how it arrived at its 4 star rating (and stands by it). In particular, how idd you calculate that 88% of funds go for "Program Expenses"?
Central Asia Institute	86726	1	/users/profile/97182	Seth Archambault	General Member of the Public	1	04/21/2011	The fact that this has 4 stars is a major blow to charity navigator's credibility.  $4,607,300 spent on "domestic outreach"(telling people in America about the problem) while 3,954,644 was spent on actually building and supporting schools."A donation to Central Asia Institute, at least in 2009, was more likely to be spent on costs related to educating people in the U.S. about problems in Pakistan and Afghanistan than on helping children in central Asia with their education." -American Institute of PhilanthropyHaving these two completely different costs lumped in together as "program costs" on charity navigator's rating page is just not helpful. The rating should compare how well the finances line up with what the charity purports to care about, not what they can legally define as "program costs".  If CAI rebranded as a charity partially devoted to educating Americans about the importance of education in Afghanistan and Pakistan, they would have a much harder time gaining funding.  My faith in Charity Navigator is seriously shaken, and the donor advisory warning is ridiculous: "Charity Navigator, as an impartial evaluator of publicly reported financial information, takes no position as to the seriousness of the issue(s) nor does it seek to confirm or verify the accuracy of such reports."Why have a rating system then? Reporting numbers without context is just helping the organization whitewash it's numbers and lend false credibility.  This is serious problem. sources:http://www.charitywatch.org/articles/CentralAsiaInstitute.htmlhttps://www.ikat.org/about-cai/financials/
Central Asia Institute	86595	2	/users/profile/96992	enrightesq	Donor	5	04/20/2011	Shame on Sixty Minutes for creating a tempest in a teapot! Had Sixty Minutes investigated Greg Mortenson himself, I believe they would have found a modest man, living rather modestly with his wife and 2 children in Bozeman Montana.  No yachts, no jets, no vacation homes on every continent, no bank accounts in the Cayman Islands, no garage full of expensive cars.  In short, no evidence of using CAI funds for his personal benefit. Instead, Sixty Minutes published ugly innuendos made by Jon Krakauer, a former CAI board member who has had no personal experience with the organization for over a decade and who, for reasons known only to Mr.Krakauer, chose today to throw stones at Greg Mortenson's Schools.   
Central Asia Institute	86548	1	/users/profile/96934	JohhnWright	Volunteer	1	04/20/2011	 SCAM I looked at their website... It reads like a hustle. I would not trust this organization. - Just my subjective belief (opinion).
Central Asia Institute	86476	2	/users/profile/96811	RDAA	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/20/2011	Regardless of whether or not CAI has exaggerated its reports, one should pay particular attention to the impact that CAI has had at the grassroots levels - on the "local" populations. It appears to me that those higher up the bureaucratic chain are quick to join the bandwagon in pointing out how CAI could have been sounder in its decisions, or conducted better work. However, at the end of the day, let us be realistic. We are dealing with areas of the world where the government, NATO, or US security forces had a minimal presence and most definitely did not address the education needs of the marginalized. CAI has been performing and continues to perform great feats under great challenges.  Thank you A helpful article to put what I have said into perspective:http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-13125953
Central Asia Institute	86425	2	/users/profile/96742	stan Frymann	Donor	1	04/19/2011	After reading the book I called CAI and offered to fully fund the construction of a school, however it had to be a specific school and I had to see a specific budget as well as see pictures of the site and village served before construction as well as during construction and upon completion.  I was told, "We do not do that."  I was invited to give money for a construction fund, but  was told it wasn't possible to fund a specific school.  I was astonished. I found that the board chair was a professor, so I got his e-mail that way and made my offer directly to him.  He didn't even reply.  I thought this was very strange that they would so easily refuse $30-$40K, but this fits very well with the charges that have come up.
Central Asia Institute	86247	2	/users/profile/96463	Mark Underwood	General Member of the Public	2	04/18/2011	I'm only responding to the "60 Minutes" piece. Despite the glowing defenses made here, I think prospective donors should watch the piece and make their own conclusions. There is a transparency issue with nonprofits who believe avoiding journalists -- even "yellow" journalists -- will benefit them. By not participating in the dialog, it creates the impression that the charity has something to hide. In the case of this charity, at the least, it creates an uncertainty about the Board's veracity. At worst, it undermines trust in the nonprofit's governance. I'm putting this in the "Nice idea, but . . ." category. I have no problem with Mortenson's making $, either directly or indirectly through the charity. It's not even unseemly; this is America. The lack of transparency is my complaint. I must confess that CharityNavigator's response to the report seems a bit complacent. True, they're just rating based on the public reports, but maybe it's time to look for additional metrics. I don't think this charity will be in the situation that the Philadelphia Orchestra finds itself anytime soon.
Central Asia Institute	86215	1	/users/profile/96417	sarah	General Member of the Public	1	04/18/2011	Need to release yearly finacial statements and to have an audit every year befor I would give money to this organization.
Central Asia Institute	86167	2	/users/profile/96357	Gloria Wolk	Donor	5	04/18/2011	The "60 Minutes" expose is not the first time this program has been sloppy, at best. Before detailing another example that is not well known I wonder why they challenge someone who risks his life to make a difference in an admirable way, something not done by anyone else--and there have nearly two decades for someone to replicate his activities. Did the program compare Mortenson's salary with that of others in similar situations? Nope. And it is not excessive. Did the program take into account the risks Mortenson faces when he appears publicly--because he has friendships with and helps Muslims, who are viewed in this country today the way Japanese-Americans were viewed during WWII? Did the program include Tom Friedman, who wrote about his experience with Mortenson when a new school was opened? No.  Too often "60 Minutes" shows its fondness for yellow journalism. And now the vulture media--the parrots--repeat and exaggerate everything concluded by the program. Now for another grievance about "60 Minutes." In December 1996, featuring Morley Safer, there was segment about the new viatical settlement industry. Safer seemed to praise it. He was widely quoted by viatical companies as stating this was "the perfect no-risk investment." The phrase was taken out of context, but it led to tens of thousands of elderly people investing in fraudulent viatical contracts. I contacted the program, asking to speak to several anchors, finally left a message asking them to retract the apparent endorsement and run a correction. Silence.  A number of viatical companies even used a video of that segment as a marketing device.  In a follow-up message I told "60 Minutes" that they were co-conspirators, helping to induce people into becoming fraud victims.  No response. In my mind, "60 Minutes"chooses not to be responsible.  ln my mind, the veracity of reports on "60 Minutes" should be questioned whenever they attempt an expose.
Central Asia Institute	86148	2	/users/profile/96332	willsterlondon	Professional with expertise in this field	1	04/18/2011	If you are considering donating money to CAI, please understand that this organization has effectively been committing fraud. I have spent years in the development field and this is not an uncommon result when an individual sets up a program without a good management team, board of directors and other forms of proper oversight. Until the management team admit their mistakes and make the necessary changes you should consider giving your hard earned money to more effective organizations.
Central Asia Institute	86121	1	/users/profile/96291	Chris H.	General Member of the Public	1	04/18/2011	There is no accountability with CAI. One audited financial statement in 14 years is unacceptable for an organization bringing in $10M+ every year. Their operations appear more like an organization in its first year or two with very small revenues. In addition, 60 Minutes revealed that half of the supposed CAI schools either do not exist or were not funded by CAI. 
Central Asia Institute	86115	1	/users/profile/96280	barryeaustin	General Member of the Public	1	04/18/2011	The lack of transparency of this organizations leader, and the personal use of the bulk of funds it raises, is cause enough to not support the Central Asia Institute.  Continuing to rate them highly certainly calls into questions the basis by which GuideStar makes and monitors its ratings.
Central Asia Institute	86106	1	/users/profile/96267	O. Burns	General Member of the Public	1	04/18/2011	I do not understand why Charity Navigator awarded this charity a 4 star rating.  The annual tax filings prepared by the organization do not satisfy the need for annual, independent audits. With respect to the other reviewers comments regarding the inspirational books, how can they inspire when the author (exec. director of this organization) freely admits that these events never occurred? Their response that they do not have time to respond to the concerns of the public is unacceptable.  His book tour expenses should be paid by either his publisher or himself, not the organization.  I also question the figures reported on the Form 990.  It appears the organization materially understated both the fundraising expense figure and director compensation totals.  If the charity funded all the book and speaking engagement expenses, they need to receive the income from those activities.   Unless and until they submit to annual independent audits, I sincerely hope their 501(c)(3) tax exemption is revoked.
Central Asia Institute	86104	1	/users/profile/96260	Tim Oey	Donor	5	04/18/2011	Despite the critical 60 Minutes report (http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/04/15/60minutes/main20054397.shtml) and AIP report (http://www.charitywatch.org/articles/CentralAsiaInstitute.html), I currently still highly recommend this organization. In the big picture this organization has had a huge positive impact on how the general public and the US military understand what is happening in Afghanistan and Pakistan.  Even its critics and 60 minutes admit that it has succeeded in educating many girls and having a tremendous positive impact. No the organization or the leader can be expected to be perfect. CAI is working in an area that is extremely challenging. By his own admission in his books, Greg Mortenson admits to not being so great with administrative matters -- he is a doer, not a detailed administrator. It does appear that some issues need buttoning up. But it is important not to throw the baby out with the bathwater. Give CAI some time and I believe it will address the concerns that have been raised. The US government itself has made many much bigger errors, yet it has survived and continues to improve. Life is complicated and messy. Even with some "inefficiencies", CAI and Greg Mortenson are still doing more for Peace with fewer dollars than any other organization I know. Greg's books are still worth reading.

Central Asia Institute	86061	1	/users/profile/96204	Stephen Smith	Donor	2	04/17/2011	I sent this question to Charity Navigator on 12/20/2010 re:  Central Asia Institute:  The American Institute of Philanthropy has a detailed report about CAI in the April/May issue of Charity Rating Guide and Watchdog Report. I am concerned about this: "Having received many inquiries from donors about CAI, AIP sent a certified letter to the charity last year requesting its financial documents, including audited financial statements. When the charity failed to respond after many months, we followed up in November of 2009 and were told by CAI's operations director, Jennifer Sipes, that the charity "[does not] have audits." When asked why not, Sipes told AIP that CAI's board of directors is currently working with an attorney to "get this sorted out," but could not say for sure when an audit would be available, or what years it would include." Is this information consistent with your information? Seems pretty serious to me, and, if true, would jeopardize the 4 star rating of CAI. Disclosure: I am a donor to CAI but have no other affiliation and certainly no axe to grind.  Here is the response:  Dear Stephen Smith,  Thank you for contacting Charity Navigator. You can view their audited statements for FYE 2009 on their website: https://www.ikat.org/about-cai/financials/ Sincerely, Farhana Arastu I sent the same question to Central Asia Institute on 12/22/2010 and received this response:  Thank you for contacting us.  Central Asia institute recognizes its obligations to provide information regarding its programs and activities for review by the public.  To meet this obligation, our policy is to provide the reports and information to the official local, state and federal governmental regulatory agencies as required by law.  These entities include the Internal Revenue Service and Attorney General Offices in the states in which we conduct activities.  We address donor inquiries, and provide current financial information, including our tax Form 990 and our Audited Financial Statements, on our website (https://www.ikat.org/about-cai/financials/) to ensure transparency.  There are numerous charity watchdog organizations who have requested our information.  Each have their own arbitrary analysis, guidelines, and application process to assess non-profit organizations.  To apply with them all would be counterproductive to our limited overhead and low operational costs.  Therefore, when donors request independent information, we direct them to organizations that receive their information and comply with IRS stipulations, such as Guidestar (http://www.guidestar.org) and Charity Navigator (http://www.charitynavigator.org/). We also direct donors to individual state attorney general offices, who can provide registration information on Central Asia Institute. Please let me know if you have further questions or comments.  Thanks for your support. Best wishes, Jennifer SipesOperations DirectorCentral Asia Institute

They invited me to participate in a bicycle riding event fundraiser.  My grandson, Nolan's artwork had been chosen as the logo for the official fund raiser shirt.  My daughter informed me at that time about the wonderful work that Watson does for the benefit of the underprivileged and often abused children of the Missoula community.  My grandson's are both so touched by what Watson does for the children of Watson that they have donated their own personal belongings to the shelter for use by the children.  By grandson, Eli, even donated his birthday money this year to Watson Children's Shelter.

Watson Children's Shelter is a one-of-a-kind non-profit in Missoula, Montana who's sole mission is to provide a safe and nurturing environment for children who have experienced abuse, neglect,abandonment, or other family crisis and as a result have been removed from their home environment.  I recently visited the Shelter and was so impressed with the dedication and professionalism of the staff and volunteers who are so committed to the mission and values of the organization.   The first thing that is provided for a child who is brought to the Shelter is a stuffed bear and a hand made quilt.  Nothing like a warm blanket made with love and a soft teddy bear to make one feel safe and secure.  I was so impressed with the spacious and immaculate facility that has been provided for these children.  I heard so many heartwarming stories of support and love provided in such heartbreaking circumstances.  What a wonderful mission and what loving individuals carry out that mission.  I can't say enough about Watson Children's Shelter and the important role it plays in the community.  Ron H.

I am always so amazed by the stability, care, and safety the shelter affords these children in their time of need. The kids express how safe they felt there and how kind the staff is. No child is in the shelter for any good reason, rather, the worst possible circumstances one could imagine have brought them there. And still they find security and nurturing in the storm.
Watson Children's Shelter, Inc.	227203	1	/users/profile/290932	Crystal P.	Donor	5	10/27/2014	This is my first year working with Watson Children's Shelter and I couldn't be more happy to work with them! I toured the facility earlier this year and couldn't believe what a fantastic home they have put together for their children. The children that end up in this shelter are usually taken suddenly from their homes and placed for shorter periods of time while awaiting permanent placement. For this reason, the shelter likes to make sure each child gets some new weather appropriate clothing and new blanket to take with them where they go next. This was especially heartwarming to me because I can't imagine my child being cold. The shelter also makes sure each child has a little birthday celebration, which I think is important for them to feel like individuals. They also have areas where children can play independently for when they need some space from the other kids. With all the non-profits I've been involved with, this is my favorite because it is clear they truly care about the kids and the quality of care they receive.

The most important thing is no matter what has happened in a needy child's past, they can come to Watson Children's Shelter and just be a kid again.  No child should be punished for the poor decisions of their parents and this organization does an exceptional job to turn these kids' situations into a successes.

K9 Care Montana	256036		/users/profile/344425	Writer	Board Member	5	09/10/2015	I have observed David Riggs for many years working with the Wounded Warrior Project and also autistic children.  He breeds Labradors,, raises them, trains them according to the individual needs of the warrior and child.  Then  he DONATES the dog, free of charge, to the warrior or child. During the year, he holds numerous fund raisers in order to do this.  Most individuals who train dogs for this purpose, either charge a large fee, or make it mandatory that the warrior or child's parents raise the money themselves.  He feels the need to give back after suffering from a spinal cord injury when he was  younger.  He know the importance of a Service Dog to the healing process and the assistance the dog can offer  He deserves this award more than anyone I know.

He deployed 5 times in those 11 years.  He now suffers from severe PTSD and is limited with his mobility.   I heard of K9 Care Montana thru Montana Wounded Warriors and put in an inquiry for getting a dog to help my husband with his mobility and PTSD disabilities.   David had been an AMAZING friend to our family since the first inquiry and he has gone out of his way several times for us.  I am currently deployed and my husband is at home with our two very young children.   Our dog, Nala, is currently being trained by David and we look forward to being reunited with her and I personally look forward to seeing all David's hard work in action!

I wasn't even aware of the organization until just a few days ago when my wife told me about a fundraising golf event they were hosting in Bozeman.  We have always been passionate about caring for veterans and animals so K9 Care Montana sounded like our kind of organization to support.  I never knew going into yesterdays events how humbled I would feel at the end of the day.  David Riggs does amazing things for these veterans.  He is such a genuine person that truly cares about the veterans.  I also can't say enough about how grateful the recipients of his service dogs are.  K9 Care truly makes a difference for our wounded veterans, all at no cost to them.  I find myself as a supporter because I appreciate supporting an organization where my donations directly support the veterans and not a bunch of salaries for office types.  Keep up the great work K9 Care Montana!
K9 Care Montana	232732		/users/profile/296306	andreasekora	Client Served	5	11/03/2014	Thank you K9 Care Montana for donating a mobility service dog to my husband Keith (a disabled veteran).  You've given Keith the gift of mobility through the service that Pintler provides him on a daily basis.  He regularly catches Keith when he falls, helps him back up, makes sure he's ok, picks things up when he drops them, turns lights on to make sure he doesn't fall, keeps clear paths for Keith when in crowds, and protects his back. Keith more independence, confident, less stressed knowing Pintler is there to help.  He's able to go to public places, maneuver crowds, and travel more easily with Pintler by his side knowing that he's there to help.  Pintler helps Keith more fully live life again and has brought incredible joy to our family. Thank you David Riggs for founding K9 Care Montana and sharing your amazing dog training gift with us!  You're providing families with autism and wounded warriors unmeasurable gift through the high quality and exceptionally trained service dogs and on going training that K9 Care Montana provides.

This organization not only raises, trains and gifts service dogs to Wounded Warriors, they provide support and friendship for life for the soldier, his service dog and his family.  K9 Care Montana gifted a phenomenal service dog named Trooper to our eldest son who had lost his quality of life due to physical and mental injuries he developed during his 5 deployments.  It's almost miraculous how Trooper and K9 Care Montana have given a lot of that quality of life back to him!

Women's Voices for the Earth	315112		/users/profile/406180	MollyHauck	General Member of the Public	5	10/26/2016	After getting their newsletter for a couple of years, I went to a fundraiser for Women's Voices for the Earth last year and was very impressed by what  I heard  and the women who I met. Women's Voices for the Earth works to reduce the toxins in products made for women, such has  feminine pads and tampons, hair straighteners like the Brazilian Blowout), fragrances, and cleaning products like Swiffer.  They also try to reduce toxins in nail salons in order to protect the  women who work in them.All of these could be made without toxins, which would reduce the illnesses  caused by them, such as cancer, diabetes, and neurological disorders.  The Toxic Substance Reform Act that was passed decades ago left a lot to be desired, and the one that replaced it this year was heavily influenced by the chemical industry, which made it impossible for states to pass laws to  reduce toxins in products.Womenn's Voices for Earth also includes women of all ethnic groups and colors, rather than just focusing on white women. They are a small, underfunded organization that  do an excellent job of focusing attention on reducing toxins. This is very important to me and I think that this is an important organization.

Many others, including myself, have been inspired by WVE's Green Cleaning parties as a way to educate and share and more important, encourages women to come together and discuss.  I would not be where I am to day in my own advocacy without the efforts that WVE has put out into our world.

WVE also does an amazing job educating woman on how to make better choices in their life to lead a cleaner household and lifestyle. I love that they don't just spit out info, but really work on community engagement and supporting individuals to help themselves.

Their expertise and tireless advocacy on behalf of our families is effective. We carry their "No Secrets" seal on our website to inform our customers how important it is to read labels and know the chemicals that harm. WVE teaches us all: organizations, businesses, and individuals alike. We support their work and hope others will as well. WVE makes it easy to participate in change with their newsletters full of helpful information, campaign successes, and inspiring stories.

These women are passionate about the work they do and practical in the solutions they advocate for. For being such a small organization, WVE has connections all over the place and their work should be recognized by all people concerned with public and environmental health. WVE deserves all the praise and recognition they get (and more!).

Women's Voices for the Earth	225102		/users/profile/288876	KateJakubas	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/22/2014	Women's Voices has staff that is exceedingly professional. Their scientists and communications staff have a remarkable ability to take laboratory and published data and make it accessible to the public in a way that doesn't oversimplify the problem by using vague language such as saying 'chemicals are bad'. They truly help women understand the impact of their choices. I also appreciate that they do three things that create change without fearmongering. 1) they help people understand that health and environmental impacts of their choices, 2) they call out bad practices in companies and governments to affect change in laws and in products, and 3) they call out GOOD practices such as companies that do protect health and environment. The last step is critical to helping women take back a feeling of power to create change in their homes and it is one too often overlooked by NGOs.

Women's Voices for the Earth	115158		/users/profile/156872	jwelborn78	Board Member	5	06/14/2012	I had the privilege of having my body burden tested years ago and I was appalled to find out that my body holds a variety of toxic chemicals that are linked to cancer, reproductive health issues, and a host of other diseases. My body's chemical burden is a direct reflection of the toxic chemicals that we are exposed to daily through the products we use, the foods we eat, and the air we breathe.So, I choose to give my money and my time to Women's Voices for the Earth (WVE) because they are committed to eliminating toxic chemicals that impact women's and children's health. Although this is health and environmental issue that impacts everyone, WVE emphasizes that exposure to toxic chemicals is a social and environmental justice issue. With that in mind, WVE effectively educates women and mobilizes them to raise their voices and speak out about the injustices of living in world where exposure to toxic chemicals is a daily reality.
Women's Voices for the Earth	115148		/users/profile/156859	LeighAWilcox	General Member of the Public	5	06/14/2012	When my son was diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome, an Autism Spectrum Disorder, and I began to realize that he - like many other children with ASDs - had underlying health conditions related to toxic overloads, I started searching for ways to "clean up" our home and his immediate surroundings. Searching for safer, non-toxic options for the multitude of items in our home was a little overwhelming until I found Women's Voices for the Earth. Not only did WVE have excellent reports and science to share to benefit the health of women and children (the whole family - really), they were also very open and available. When I had specific questions and needed help - they were there to help! They continue to be one of my favorite organizations helping to spread the word that the immediate environments of women & children matter and that easy-to-implement options abound. I am happy to say that my son and I are both healthier thanks to the wonderful work by the women at WVE!
Women's Voices for the Earth	115071	1	/users/profile/156770	Juliam.	General Member of the Public	5	06/13/2012	I found WVE by complete accident on some blog somewhere. I visited their site and thought, 'this is one little powerhouse of an organization.' They understand that women's health is directly connected to the home--the cleaning products we use--and to our personal care products. They understand that this is not acceptable. And that women, children, men, the planet are at risk if legislation isn't changed; if consumers don't become aware of what's in all the many products we use. They shouldn't fly under radar. They get things done. I am so grateful to this organization because they're not shy about creative action-taking. I love participating in these actions. I feel like they keep track of what I don't have time to track. My health is improved because of the work they do. So is my family's. So is my planet. Yay for WVE! Yay for all of us!

I have been following their work, participating in their campaigns and sending my support for several years now.  From exposs on cleaning products to make-up to food can linings -- Women's Voices for the Earth is out to educate for the greater good.  Their impact has been substantial -- campaign after campaign -- causing proposals for new laws (The Safe Chemical Act) as well as the establishment of grass roots groups to challenge the status quo (The Stroller Brigade, Cleaning Parties, etc.).  I believe my initial contact with WVE concerned toxins in make-up and grooming supplies -- a topic I never thought much about but have since become an incredible advocate for and I am spreading the word!  Thanks to WVE, I now check the toxin levels of every product that touches my body and hope we can all do the same for ourselves, our children, our grandchildren, and great-grandchildren too!

I couldn't believe my eyes the first time I entered their office and saw so few women - "Where is everyone else?!"  I asked in shock.  These women are creating change on a national level, and their work is reaching into other countries, as well.   I carry their list of toxins with me wherever I go in order to buy the safest products, and I write to the companies they research in order to foster change.  Their research is extensive, and their hard work benefits us all.  Amazing!  They deserve every possible accolade!  I wish that more people knew how much this organization needs their donation - this is such a great cause and donation dollars are wisely used.  I am so proud of the efforts of Women's Voices for the Earth!!  ~  Debra

Women's Voices for the Earth was an amazing resource to help me navigate my way to using better products and obtaining better health. I thought that perfume free meant chemical free when it came to laundry detergent. WVftE uncovered the hidden truth about these products that I was spending so much money on. Now I make my own detergent and cleaners for a fraction of the cost, and feel safe knowing that they are safe to use in my home. I love showing my kids how to make our own cleaning products from safe ingredients and passing this info. on to instill in them how important it is to avoid having toxic chemicals in the home.

Women's Voices for the Earth	114238	1	/users/profile/155458	Sian W.

The work they've done has resulted in fewer people exposed to toxic chemicals prevalent in everyday consumer products, and more women educated about how their consumer choices and activism can improve the health of their families and communities. Plus, they're some of the nicest women you've ever met.

Missoula Aging Services	301488	1	/users/profile/392422	Writer	Volunteer	5	08/25/2016	Missoula Aging Services is a wonderful resource in many different ways.  I personally am familiar with two of them.  Each year I make an appointment to discuss and update my Medicare supplementary insurance.  This not only saves me money with healthcare expenses, but also ensures that I am aware of any changes in coverage of medical care or prescription drugs by my insurance company.  This wouldn't be possible without the advice and guidance of the professionals and volunteers at Missoula Aging Services.In addition to seeking personal help from the agency, I also volunteer several hours a week as a Senior Companion.  This involves spending time with seniors who are in need of human camaraderie or transportation to grocery stores or doctor's appointments.  Some clients are active and love to get out; others are lonely or isolated and just need someone to talk to.  Often, the time that a volunteer gives to these individuals means the difference between staying in the comfort and familiarity of their homes and moving to assisted living facilities.  In some cases it gives family members respite from the daily stress of caring for a loved one living in their home.  It is tremendously satisfying to know that a few hours a week can make such an important difference in the lives of others.
Missoula Aging Services	300672	1	/users/profile/391550	Writer	Board Member	5	08/16/2016	This organization is essential to our community, providing a light in the darkness for so many seniors and caregivers, MAS allows our citizens to live the lives that they want.  I believe that the strength of their staff and volunteer force,  is their passion and belief in the MAS mission.  They arrive to work each day knowing that they will make a difference, and this community is so much stronger because of their involvement.  I recommend them as the first and most complete resource for elder care, connection, health, and financial and mental well being.

Since that time we have been privledged to have participated in Meals On Wheels and recently the Respite Services Program both of which have significantly contributed to our well being.My wife is 73 years old and an amputee (left leg) since age 17.I am 78 years old and also have significant health problems such as MS , open heart surgery,and diabetes.My wife is also diabetic,has stents in her left carotid artery,and also had a stroke a few years ago.As you can well see Missoula aging Services  has, and continues to be, a significant contributor along with excellent  medical care here in Missoula, MT, to our continued well being. Sincerely , Joseph A. Pietro   
Missoula Aging Services	300134	1	/users/profile/390985	JoAnn19	Volunteer	5	08/10/2016	When I lost my job at 59 I spent a long time searching for another.  I applied for every kind of job but had no luck at getting one.  One day my friend said she had heard on  the public radio station that Missoula Aging Services needed volunteers. I was getting close to my 60th birthday so I decided to check it out. I talked to Alicia and was told about the Senior Companion program.  I applied and was accepted and went to training soon after my intake.  It was a life saver for me.  That was 6 years ago.  I switched to the Foster Grandparent Program and for the last few years worked at Franklin School. I have made good friends with other seniors. I appreciate all  contact  I have had with Missoula Aging Services.
Missoula Aging Services	300043	2	/users/profile/390881	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/10/2016	I am a service coordinator in an independent living nonprofit retirement home.  Many people here do not have much money to pay for services.  Through the Senior Companion program at Missoula Aging Services several of the elderly residents here have  a friend that really makes a difference in their lives.  In a few hours weekly with each client good things happen.  Errands are done, trips to medical appointments take place and friendships flourish. These helpers bring continued independence with their visits. They receive thanks from their clients, and a small stipend from MAS.  This works well for everyone involved.

Missoula Aging Services	299985	1	/users/profile/390811	Risciu	Client Served	5	08/09/2016	At Missoula Aging Services in Missoula, MT,  counselors assist clients in (a) becoming aware of, (b) understanding, (c) applying for,  and (d) following through on  a wide variety of governmetally- and privately-funded assistance programs.  Speaking only for mtself, their expertise has helped me to successfully apply  for and receive benefits from ~ ~ Social Security Disability (and subsequently simple SS Retirement)~ food stamps (SNAP)~ Low Income Energy Assistance Program (LIEAP)~ State of Montana Elderly Homeowner/Renter Tax Credits (2-EC) for several past years plus the most recent year~ State of Montana assistance in paying for Medicare monthly premiums~ and probably a few other's I'm forgetting.The counselors at M.A.S. are uniformly well-trained, wel-informed, know the  appropriate agency and its contact people (including all pertinent phone/FAX numbers, as well as any needed email, postal, and physical addresses. They are also cordial, professional, respectful, and a pleasure to work with.My only quibble (and it is a small one) is that among the M.A.S. counselors there is one who is very, very slow in responding to phone messages or email inquiries.  This is the only exception I know of in an otherwise universally successful organization ~ one which deservedly enjoys a high reputation within the Missoula communities of service providers and service users alike.In the opinion of this 69-year-old retired man whose life is burdened by Parkinson's and a dozen other conditions (for which I am far too young, if you were to ask me), M.A.S. should serve as a national model for prompt, courteous, efficient, thorough, empathic, reliable and professional non-profit community service.  I never walk out of their offices without feeling accomplished and in better spirits.Thank you.Richard LammaMissoula, MT

Each day she receives her meal, she is also asked how she is doing and there are times she asks for help or information on something that may be bothering her - like recent changes to her insurance plan - and the volunteer always makes sure a staff person follows up so she gets the answers and peace of mind she needs.

St Labre Indian School	320348		/users/profile/412748	Writer	Donor	5	12/20/2016	I have been donating a small amount to St Labre for years and realize that they must raise money to run the school.  Education is so important whether it be for Indian children or any other.  Our country is currently going to the dogs and we need educated citizens to run our great country.  Those children at St Labre may be the ones to get us back on track.
St Labre Indian School	318368	14	/users/profile/409530	Vanessa38	Donor	1	11/05/2016	My in-laws have been giving to this charity for years, and receiving fleece blankets with 'tribal' prints as thank-you gifts. Do not give to them! They have been sued by the tribe, as only a few Northern Cheyenne children attend the school, and it is marketed as being 100% N. Cheyenne. It's really just a rich private school that solicits donations using false pretenses. Do your homework!
St Labre Indian School	318213	3	/users/profile/409357	Squarejaw	Donor	5	11/03/2016	The major objections I read here, have to do with the expenditure of 50% of their budget for fund-raising.  Now, there are a number of schools with similar missions, who serve less people, are constantly financially strapped and consequently can't do the job St. Labre does.  Few people have heard of these schools, and fewer still support them.  St. Labre may spend a lot of money fund-raising, but it looks to me that they are raising two dollars for every one they spend.  Yes, it would be nice if they could spend less, but common sense tells me that if they spent less, they would likely raise less.  I am greatly impressed with their success with graduating students, and how many go on for higher learning.  So I don't care how much they spend to raise the money to do this.  What is important to me is they seem to be succeeding very well in their mission.  I am happy to increase my donation now. 
St Labre Indian School	310477	24	/users/profile/401827	Michael407	Donor	1	10/13/2016	I, too, have received numerous solicitations for this outfit.  At first, many years ago, I was tugged by the heartstrings to donate because of the charity and what it is doing; however, when someone suggested Charity Navigator as a good site to check with before donating any money to any charity, I did so with these folks. too much wasted money on fundraising and "administrative" money goes out and not nearly enough to the charity itself. If you go to GOOGLE and type in the name - St. Labre Indian School - you'll see that it no longer is rated because it "cannot qualify and prove some information and, it does not (or is not available) IRS forms 900's to verify its activities. Now, I just throw away the wasteful mailing that I know I have repeatedly asked to be taken off the mailing list.I will not donate to this charity.
St Labre Indian School	298638	40	/users/profile/389528	teacher21	Donor	4	07/31/2016	I have read both positive and negative reviews, but my experience has been all good.  I donated money and received my blanket...which was never promised to be handmade...right away.  Then I received a student-written thank you note for my gift and photos of the children.  After that, I received a card which played "Let Me Call You Sweetheart" sung by the children when opened.  The response of thank yous impressed me and demonstrates the values taught at the school.I read a review written by a reporter about how one tribe had sued the Catholic Church and Diocese because they feel the school is exploiting the Cheyenne tribe who are not benefiting enough from the school.  I am not donating to a tribe, I am donating to a school who is spreading the values of Catholicism. If a person donates to a school, then he or she needs to realize, unless the donor explicitly states what the money is to be used for, the school can use its own discretion.  700 students are getting a free education and three meals a day.  That is what I am donating toward.
St Labre Indian School	297589	51	/users/profile/388396	Writer	Donor	5	07/21/2016	My husband and I have been donating to St. Labre since 1985.  My parents long before that. We usually go to the school every summer and this last year went to their ranch.  What a great place!! We have had some very interesting talks about St Labre's  educational opportunities with Curtis and the staff, for students, especially the cultural experiences they receive.  I know that the fund raising goes directly to support the school.  I'm a little confused as to why the Cheyenne Indian Nation thinks they should share in the monies donated to the school.  After all the money is to educate the Cheyenne and Crow students. The educational opportunities are excellent and the resulting statistics surpass ordinary public school high school and college graduation rates for peers. Our family will continue to support this school and other Native Schools.  
St Labre Indian School	293982	30	/users/profile/384678	Writer	Donor	1	06/27/2016	In the early 1970s, I donated to St. Labre each month and at the time 90% of the money went to the charity. I just got the first solicitation in years and was going to donate, but not after reading all these reviews.

Six months ago I placed her name on the "Do Not Mail" list and yet, they are still mailing her.  Former reviewers have indicated that they spend half of their revenue on advertising.  I believe it.  
St Labre Indian School	271750	80	/users/profile/360643	Disappointed2	General Member of the Public	1	11/10/2015	My father has dementia and is now living in an assisted living facility.  While he still lived at home he sent hundreds of dollars to various charities and sweepstakes.  I have now assumed responsibility of handling his finances and mail.  St Labre is the only charity so far that is unwilling to stop mailing the frequent requests without my providing the copy of my Power of Attorney.  Strikes me more as an attempt to protect their ability to bleed seniors dry.
St Labre Indian School	254732	113	/users/profile/343095	TrueGrit	Donor	5	09/02/2015	This is a sad commentary of Native American heritage. 1st no one should give in hopes of receiving anything; and should the school insist in doing so - than how about true Indian art work that is bought and purchased from the tribal peoples. I do have a problem when 50% of contributions are for marketing in any charity - Its about the Children, and I honestly believe that people are willing to give for the sake of giving (everyone wants to make a difference but no one wants to be exploited nor do they want the purpose of their gift exploited). Even an adoptive program for each child with several donors (receiving semi-annual updates on the child's progress while preserving the child's name is worth considering. I hope that all donations are kept local and within the school - none going to the Catholic Church; I do not support religious organization, but do support them when they keep God's mandate :"True religion is the care of the widow and the fatherless child". And this is all charities. It is easy to say that I will not give my donation because 50% will go to jobs in China and obscene gestures of abject poverty to tear jerk a donation. This is proud Nations of Native Americans (the only true Americans without benefit of law). I send my donation that they can be successful in a changing world and maintain their proud traditional heritage at the same time. I will continue to donate at this time and pray God that you change your marketing methods to bring that figure closer to 10% or less. One fully realizes that teachers and staff cost money and should be included in the cost of educating and schooling children as well as bills relating to building maintenance and grounds up keep and that should be that 90% inclusion. It is obscene that 50% of contributions is going into a toilet or Neverland. I'm sorry to hear of the Tribes lawsuit against the school and I hope that some lease agreement can be reached on the lands and/or some involvement with the tribes that they can clearly understand that the future economic benefit that a well ran and highly educating school can provide in the long term for the future of their peoples and especially their children. Educate them to the fact that I already pay taxes into a dead beat public school system. I'd rather donate my money to them through your school. I also donate to ST Joseph Indian School as well. I'm not into "well this Indian tribe is more worthy than that one", tell them to shove that crap. It's about the children and their future, not about past hatreds-divisions-derisions. It's about moving on and forward.
St Labre Indian School	245132	66	/users/profile/332237	AlPacker	Donor	4	06/12/2015	Don't believe everything you read on the internet, and don't jump to conclusions. These people appear to be doing significant work, of considerable social value. That's a guess; when I can, I would like to visit the place, and get some sense of the whole situation. What I think, on no hard evidence, is that a dysfunctional tribal group is trying to get their hands on as much money as possible. It seems fashionable to sue the Catholics these days, but I don't see anything actionable in what St. Labre is doing. The Northern Cheyenne are on a fishing expedition, seems like. They have little to lose, and plenty to gain.
St Labre Indian School	238333	138	/users/profile/323526	captcha	Professional with expertise in this field	1	02/21/2015	Yesterday I received a solicitation for donation from this organization. Having never heard of it I decided to investigate on Guidestar. No 990's have been filed so I reviewed their annual reports for 2012 and 2011. They spend approximately 50% of annual revenue on fundraising so 50 cents of every dollar one donates goes towards printing,paper,postage and gifts. After other expenses only a small % goes to help the 700 or so students! Stated another way fundraising costs over $35,000 per student. I'll send my money elsewhere.
St Labre Indian School	207512	66	/users/profile/270183	Harry M.	General Member of the Public	4	07/28/2014	There is a lot of jealously among Native American tribes and internally with their members.  A close relative taught on the Rez in NM, loved the kids and what she did, but hated the parental and tribal council infighting.  She left after a couple years for the local public schools. In the case of St. Labre, don't believe everything you read on the internet and remember anyone can sue anyone for anything.  St. Labre did a better job of marketing their good works than some other tribes.
St Labre Indian School	196371	72	/users/profile/256695	mrrmart	Donor	5	03/25/2014	This charity seems to do good work by all accounts.  People seemed miffed at the gifts, but I am not sure why anyone would require a blanket or any other gift to donate to a charity anyway.  Use SouthwestIndian.com if you just want stuff to order and still get a tax writeoff.  The lawsuit by the tribe sounds absurd.  If the tribe cared so much and did even 1/2 the job the school does to take care of these kids, there would never have been a need for this school, but they didn't, they don't, and as far as I can tell, they never will.
St Labre Indian School	196293	90	/users/profile/256607	Lucee	General Member of the Public	1	03/24/2014	INVESTIGATE this charity by using the great tool of the Internet...you may discover, it is a ruse and NOT a charity that benefits the Native American Indians it claims to help....but it DOES enrich the church and the people who are on salary at the "Charity." The tribes in question has SUED this charity AND the church, for reasons of using the Native People to make money...CHECK IT OUT!!!

St Labre Indian School	160767	52	/users/profile/213148	Hugh M.	Donor	4	06/16/2013	It's just about money for the Northern Cheyenne Tribe. They've done little for themselves while St. Labre Indian School has educated their children and provided numerous employment opportunities over the last 50 years. They see an organization that's been successful and feel they are required to "give us" what we haven't earned ourselves.  Lawsuits are for the liberals, those that want what others have earned and to suck from their success due to their own failures. St. Labre and the Catholic Church owe nothing additional, in my opinion, to the Northern Cheyenne Tribe than what they've provided for years and continue to give.  You want something better? Go earn it!
St Labre Indian School	157207	58	/users/profile/208470	dmccrary	Donor	1	05/06/2013	I gave last year without much quesiton due to the Catholic connection --- But, just did some research today after receiving more solicitation. With surprise I found: March 12, 2005Church, school sued by tribe By JAN FALSTADOf The Gazette Staff  The Northern Cheyenne Tribe filed a lawsuit in Billings Friday against the Roman Catholic Church and the St. Labre Indian School Educational Association alleging that the school has used the tribe's "plight" and "financial need" to operate one of the most successful fund-raising enterprises in American history.  Today only a small percentage of students at St. Labre Mission are Northern Cheyenne, the lawsuit said, yet the school continues to raise money by marketing the tribe's poverty.  Northern Cheyenne President Eugene Little Coyote and the tribal council, which voted unanimously to authorize the lawsuit, allege that the school had "reaped enormous financial revenue and benefit" during the past 50 years.  "We're trying to make sure there is a more equitable distribution of the funds raised on the Northern Cheyenne reservation," Little Coyote said.  In just two of the past four years, St. Labre has reaped $57 million while poverty is rampant throughout the reservation, the lawsuit stated.  The lawsuit filed in Yellowstone District Court was first considered in 1998.  Billings attorney Cliff Edwards and his law firm are representing the Northern Cheyenne. St. Labre officials could not be reached for comment late Friday.  "It is not known to the Northern Cheyenne where these tens - probably hundreds - of millions of dollars have gone," the lawsuit stated.  The tribe is demanding that St. Labre open its books for the past half century through "forensic accounting" and pay all compensatory and punitive damages due under Montana law.  Other charges against St. Labre and the Catholic Church include: Trespassing on tribal lands  Not compensating the tribe for the school's "impressive buildings and facilities" just outside Ashland Imposing church values and religion on the tribe  Using without permission "the faces, stories and symbols of the Northern Cheyenne"  St. Labre Mission School was started on the reservation in 1884 to educate and to help the Northern Cheyenne. The small mission school has grown into a 100-acre modern campus.  The school raised money through mass marketing. It built a factory at Ashland in the early 1960s where tribal members made plastic items, including Indian dolls and costume jewelry, which were sent to donors.  The lawsuit names The Roman Catholic Church, the Dioceses of Great Falls/Billings, St. Labre Indian School Educational Association and St. Labre Home for Indian Children and Youth.  Jan Falstad can be contacted at (406) 657-1306 or at jfalstad@billingsgazette.com Copyright  The Billings Gazette, a division of Lee Enterprises.

St Labre Indian School	155781	66	/users/profile/206716	Stressed1	Donor	4	04/23/2013	I'm writing this in response to one for_the ride 's comment and concerns.Anyone else who takes the time to read through all this. Thank you for making the time. This is what happens when you are involved ( giving ) to a place for 10,12+ years. Here are 2 much more recent articles from the Billing Gazette, the same newspaper that had the story about the lawsuit , which mind you, I was very concerned about myself. http://billingsgazette.com/news/state-and-regional/montana/st-labre-school-celebrates-history/article_fa591d9d-21ef-50cb-bdf0-7991bd67dbd3.html http://billingsgazette.com/news/state-and-regional/montana/parts-of-st-labre-ruling-overturned/article_17fbe127-642a-54dd-8bfb-e2f425a87a9a.html***************************************Over the many years that I have been giving to St. Labre Indian School, I have learned  things, by asking and by experiencing, and reading. - They don't share their mailing list, though they GET lists. We have a unusual last name spelling. I asked for them to correct it. I don't remember ever seeing ANY OTHER junk mail to show they shared us. - They're very good at keeping track of your donations, it seems. I wouldn't always get an acknowledgement, but at $100, you get a certificate for the Century Society.- The number of students has increased from 650 to almost 800 students at the school. The quality of their education also gone up at the same time. No small feat. I can tell by what is written/seen in their newsletter.- Students used to "end school" after the 8th grade; then after high school, and now they provide support into college by scholarships and mentoring. - St. Labre's only started in like, the 1950's, and struggled for a bunch of years. They are learning as they go what helps the children to thrive. [For College: The mentoring program just started a couple years ago =>So Many promising students who went to college were struggling from 'culture shock' and 'home sickness', and after a short time would drop out.]- Misti, who is in charge of "donor relations" seems very well informed and very easy to work with. By the way, the times I have spoken with her, I had to go through a couple transfers (I called). I think that equals old phone equipment that hasn't been replaced just because it was old.-  They are there for the children, first. That said, what they have been doing has changed over time. They used to be like regular schools with one meal a day; then they started breakfast; I think they added something at the end of the day too - all because they were finding out that the children were going hungry and failing to thrive. - I've seen in their mailings: In Fall into winter they watch for children dressed in appropriately for the weather and ask, "Where's is your coat? If the child gives an answer like "I don't know" or something, they know to be prepared to provide one: They learned that the children had no coats(or had outgrown theirs) and started a program for that. That are just SO MANY needs that the Indian children had that other children don't.  - Their services outside of education to the children(and adults) have expanded over time. IT's taken time.- Long ago, Curtis had written to me that they never turn anyone away that comes to them for help-that was 10 years or so. But improve a structure for a person(That's what it sounds like the Northern Cheyenne Nation is asking for) That I'm not sure is within their scope. - An estimated 92 percent of students are Native American. About 50 percent are Catholic. Tuition for all of them is free. I'm guessing that some of their stuff have children and go to school there.- Curtis Yarlott, the executive director of 20 years, said this year the school awarded $250,000 in scholarships to 55 students - some of them older graduates who have decided to pursue a higher degree. [From the article above.] They aren't really that big of a school. That is BIG CHUNK in scholarship money.- Per a mailing: Last year, they were trying to raise money to replace their old water pump, which was on it's last legs. It looked like it had been in been in need to replacement for a very long time (Major rust)and had finally given out. Why couldn't they have taken the money from their ample savings. I'm sure that some of it DID come from the savings. You don't leave 800 people (staff and kids) without running water, when you have a minimum of 30 kids staying the night all week. Replacements like that don't just happen. I think sometimes one needs to hold money aside.- Curtis Yarlott, the executive director of 20 years, said this year the school awarded $250,000 in scholarships to 55 students - some of them older graduates who have decided to pursue a higher degree. From the article above.-The online article states: the priest Hoffman, said: The old chiefs befriended me and they said, 'We need it[the school] for the children'.....Who knows what the truth is? I DO see, that the couple(who gave their opinion) below says they saw what they should of. Programs, food, and positive energy. Power/Heating costs, especially during the winter, can really add up. They've increased in side. I've gotten numerous acrylic blankets, that have changed in design. I was going to give to them anyhow, but with this encouragement, I gave more. I believe I made a difference. They send a newsletter quarterly highlighting one student in particular and with various articles about what has been happening/going on. Curtis has his column and talks about the state of things.It's funny, I don't usually recommend ANY charity to ANYONE. I just don't; maybe I need to start.I have recently suddenly retired early, after a disability, but otherwise if money were no object I think my heart would lead me to still be giving to them. Maybe I wouldn't increase anymore in amount, $25, $35 and if I was well off, $75, but I would still give.  Anyone else who has taken the time to read through all this, Thank You for making the time. This is what happens when you are involved ( giving ) to a place for 10,12+ years. And I'm a caring type; I get all involved, like they are "my own".

St Labre Indian School	142845	21	/users/profile/169458	Lisa133	Donor	5	11/26/2012	This school has helped to make great strides in giving the vulnerable Native American children on reservations a chance to get out of the clutches of abuse and poverty.  They use their money wisely and they always keep in contact with their donors as to how the money is used and to show appreciation.  I strongly recommend donating to this school.
St Labre Indian School	122926	45	/users/profile/167473	d_peck	Donor	5	09/24/2012	My wife and I have contributed funds for several years.  We have visited this school twice and talked with staff, students, and volunteers.  The school continues to grow and improve its facilities.  The classrooms are alive, the kids happy, and evidence of learning is all over the bulletin boards and classroom walls.  Teachers are enthusiastic.  Most of the high school graduates go on to further education to community colleges, Montana State University, nursing schools, and several to the best colleges in the nation (with the help of scholarships and continuing counselling).  The school also provides family help and jobs.  I believe that funds are spent carefully and wisely.  
St Labre Indian School	110751	38	/users/profile/150751	lyric	Volunteer	5	04/25/2012	March 12, 2005Church, school sued by tribe By JAN FALSTADOf The Gazette Staff  The Northern Cheyenne Tribe filed a lawsuit in Billings Friday against the Roman Catholic Church and the St. Labre Indian School Educational Association alleging that the school has used the tribe's "plight" and "financial need" to operate one of the most successful fund-raising enterprises in American history.  Today only a small percentage of students at St. Labre Mission are Northern Cheyenne, the lawsuit said, yet the school continues to raise money by marketing the tribe's poverty.  Northern Cheyenne President Eugene Little Coyote and the tribal council, which voted unanimously to authorize the lawsuit, allege that the school had "reaped enormous financial revenue and benefit" during the past 50 years.  "We're trying to make sure there is a more equitable distribution of the funds raised on the Northern Cheyenne reservation," Little Coyote said.  In just two of the past four years, St. Labre has reaped $57 million while poverty is rampant throughout the reservation, the lawsuit stated.  The lawsuit filed in Yellowstone District Court was first considered in 1998.  Billings attorney Cliff Edwards and his law firm are representing the Northern Cheyenne. St. Labre officials could not be reached for comment late Friday.  "It is not known to the Northern Cheyenne where these tens - probably hundreds - of millions of dollars have gone," the lawsuit stated.  The tribe is demanding that St. Labre open its books for the past half century through "forensic accounting" and pay all compensatory and punitive damages due under Montana law.  Other charges against St. Labre and the Catholic Church include: Trespassing on tribal lands  Not compensating the tribe for the school's "impressive buildings and facilities" just outside Ashland Imposing church values and religion on the tribe  Using without permission "the faces, stories and symbols of the Northern Cheyenne"  St. Labre Mission School was started on the reservation in 1884 to educate and to help the Northern Cheyenne. The small mission school has grown into a 100-acre modern campus.  The school raised money through mass marketing. It built a factory at Ashland in the early 1960s where tribal members made plastic items, including Indian dolls and costume jewelry, which were sent to donors.  The lawsuit names The Roman Catholic Church, the Dioceses of Great Falls/Billings, St. Labre Indian School Educational Association and St. Labre Home for Indian Children and Youth.  Jan Falstad can be contacted at (406) 657-1306 or at jfalstad@billingsgazette.com Copyright  The Billings Gazette, a division of Lee Enterprises.
St Labre Indian School	58669	64	/users/profile/62671	L Zaiontz	Donor	5	12/10/2010	I've supported the Indian children of St. Labre for more than 20 years. This is a place that is actually accomplishing good things not only for the children it serves, but also for the families of these children. The only way these kids are going to make something of their lives is with the exceptional education they receive at St. Labre. Their fundraising expense may appear high, but that is because they also provide good jobs for the people of the Northern Cheyenne and Crow Indian tribes -- something that is seldom fully explained by those groups who "rate" charities for their effectiveness. If you question their financial statement, I suggest you dig a little deeper. Go see them. Visit the schools. Talk to the kids. You'll discover St. Labre Indian School is an organization that squeezes every dollar and is fully appreciated by the Native American people it serves.
Orphan's Lifeline of Hope International	219671		/users/profile/283294	ranchmama12,	Donor	5	10/03/2014	Orphan's Lifeline really is doing God's work in helping care for so many children across the globe.  Our family has been helping support for awhile now after learning of them through our church. We are very selective when it comes to charities based on the fact that many have such high administrative costs that not much money makes it to the actual cause and maybe then isn't managed properly. Orphan's Lifeline is so open and honest in their yearly financial review and helps donors understand down to the grocery lists of those homes how closely monitored the expenditures are! I feel confident that the money I give helps to serve those kids so desperately in need.  The homes not only provide safety and physical nourishment but a true sense of love and family to so many! The feedback from them in updates about the homes and correspondence from the kids is heartwarming beyond words. I couldn't be more happy to recommend them!
Orphan's Lifeline of Hope International	278481		/users/profile/368435	Writer	Donor	5	01/31/2016	I have been a supporter of Orphan's Lifeline for many years and cannot speak highly enough of the great work they are doing.

Orphan's Lifeline of Hope International	218089		/users/profile/281640	dskcdawes	Donor	5	09/28/2014	The stories of this organization from it's inception and forward are remarkable!  Maybe not to everyone, but to the children and the families it has helped and touched is life changing.  I have heard from those who started this organization personally and know their intentions and their hearts.  And their hearts are of a servant as our Lord is.  Funds are used first and foremost for children, in many countries.  Homes are created to love and care  for children as they are in families.  Only 11% of donations are used for running the organization and fundraising.  Wonderful, wonderful group doing much for our world.
Orphan's Lifeline of Hope International	214780	1	/users/profile/278077	gabrielle2001	Donor	5	09/11/2014	Orphan's Lifeline of Hope International is, without doubt, a Christian organization devoted to providing loving homes and education for orphans around the world and, more importantly, teaching the children God's message of hope and salvation. 
Orphan's Lifeline of Hope International	214359	3	/users/profile/277607	astarry.dreamer	Donor	5	09/09/2014	Christine Nantale of Uganda took it upon herself to take in orphan children in her community. When Orphans' Lifeline of Hope found out about what she was doing, they began to sponsor her efforts. She was stricken with cancer, and Lifeline went into action immediately to secure funds to make sure the children would be housed and taken care of. The quilting group from a church family in Oregon stitched a "star of hope" quilt to be raffled for the fundraiser. Orphans Lifeline of Hope's efforts raised over the amount needed, and made sure all the funds went to the care of the children. After Christine's death, the children's well-being came first. This organization is also special because they have such a low percentage of donated funds  that go to administrative expenses. Donations go to take care of all the needs of the children, including education and spiritual growth. They are demonstrating true religion according to James 1:27.

I appreciate the photos and stories that I receive in a monthly newsletter showing the good work that my donations are doing.  They send out special requests for specific orphanages, so it is easy to see how my money makes a direct impact on the lives of children.  I recently "liked" them on Facebook, and I now regularly receive even more pictures from orphanages showing kids who are grateful for our gifts.  I plan on increasing my giving to Orphan's Lifeline  as my income increases.

They are doing for these children what I can't, but I can help support them in their efforts. Orphan's Lifeline of Hope International are caring, supportive, and trustworthy. I am so grateful to be involved with an organization that makes such a huge difference in the lives of children. 
Orphan's Lifeline of Hope International	214156	2	/users/profile/277394	daulton	Donor	5	09/08/2014	Orphan's Lifeline of Hope is one of the most reputable and well organized charitable organizations I'm aware of. They send regular communications to donors with a variety of options (homes) to choose from to donate to. They also apply rigorous standards to the quality of care in their homes and inspect them to ensure the funds are being used responsibly, so donors can be confident their funds will be used to meet real needs. I am looking forward to meeting some of these precious children in heaven one day.

The ad included a picture of a baby standing in a crib crying.  We began supporting this ministry on a monthly basis immediately. We are so impressed  that nearly all contributions go directly to the  needs of the children with only a small percentage for administrative expenses. Each month we look forward to reading the newsletter and the stories bring us to tears. Tears of sorrow for precious children that have been neglected and tears of joy for the ways Orphans Lifeline changes their lives by sharing the love of Jesus by providing  food, clothing, shelter, education and introducing them to the King of Kings.  Susan and Doug Ambrose

They are totally open, we can call and ask them anything at any time, and it is hard to imagine any orphan's organization using donated money more efficiently. We love it that they are a Christian organization and everything they do seems to radiate a Christ-like attitude. We are amazed at the number of children they have served and continue to serve in the few years since they began.

Some charitable organizations have changed over the years, causing me to review my contributions and even sadly dropping a couple.  However, Orphan's Lifeline is a gem to which I've been blessed to give more each year.  I appreciate being able to earmark my gifts to specific areas of the world or even to specific young people with clearly explained needs.  I look forward to future donations to outstanding Orphan's Lifeline of Hope International.

Through a personal friend I found Orphans Lifeline and received assurances that almost all of my donation would go toward the care of children as opposed to advertising and administration.

I can say without reservation that the Staff and Board of the Emerson totally believe in and are devoted to it's unique mission.  The mission is unique in that it has both a promotional component and a custodial component.

As a nonprofit, they are constantly on the cutting edge of fund-raising activities and projects to better the community as well as the Emerson. They work hard to achieve success and sustainability not only for themselves, but for their tenants as well.
Emerson Center for the Arts & Culture	223813		/users/profile/287568	Terri49	Volunteer	5	10/17/2014	The Emerson means so much to so many throughout Southwest Montana it's hard to put a label on it:  it's a historic building, it's a gathering place to share life events and celebrations; it's an art gallery; it offers discounted studio and office space for a diverse selection of artists; it's a public space; it's a theater venue; it's a venue for art, dance, music, yoga and cooking classes.  Bozeman is a wonderful place to live and having the Emerson as an integral part of this community makes it even more so!

The Bozeman and southwest Montana community have a treasure in the Emerson, with everything from artist tenants to 3 art galleries to community arts programs. There is a performance venue, The Crawford Theater, and a ballroom to host private and public activities and nonprofit functions.

Hopa Mountain Foundation	184903		/users/profile/191958	artheart	General Member of the Public	5	10/29/2013	Hopa Mountain and its premier program, Indigenous Scholars of Promise,  for the past two years  has supported and helped several Native American high-achieving high school students search for and connect with top colleges and universities!  As a mentor organization, Hopa Mountain and ISP are making a huge difference in the lives of these  mostly-rural youth who don't usually have an opportunity to know about college opportunities!  Our twin daughters were two of the first four graduates through ISP and benefited immensely from the support and encouragement! And I know that Hopa Mountain is involved in many other community endeavors that are making a huge impact in rural Montana communities!
Hopa Mountain Foundation	145465	1	/users/profile/191958	artheart	General Member of the Public	5	12/01/2012	Hopa Mountain has been a transformational influence through its constant support for the conception and continuance of a program begun in October, 2011,  Indigenous Scholars of Promise.  Indigenous Scholars of Promise is a real and concrete support for the very highest-achieving Crow and Northern Cheyenne high school juniors and seniors who live on these reservations in Southeastern Montana, in a very remote part of the state. Many have traveled thousands of miles over long distances just to receive their educations and  have already persevered through many obstacles and difficult situations in order to earn the distinction of top students,  However, these students still are in  need of support in terms of awareness of higher education opportunities, college application requirements and deadlines, and a  general overview of the entire process of the college quest.  Coming from  rural areas with high poverty rates, these students have gained immeasurable benefits from the care and support of Hopa Mountain and Indigenous Scholars of Promise.  Our twin daughters were two of the first four graduating senior ISPs and have gone on to study at a highly-regarded liberal arts college. ISP continues to support them and they will in turn stay involved in the program in order to support the other students who are coming up. The program continues to evolve and improve, gaining more depth and breadth. In June, 2012, the upcoming seniors were able to take a life-changing trip to visit several Ivy League colleges on the East Coast!  Hopa Mountain and Indigenous Scholars of Promise is impacting the futures of these young scholars, their families, their tribes and their communities!  Hopa Mountain is impacting eternity!
Hopa Mountain Foundation	183398		/users/profile/240312	DeborahG	Client Served	5	10/28/2013	I have worked for non-profits and served on non-profit boards for almost forty years. Without hesitation I can tell you that I have never experienced a nonprofit with a compassionate heart and soul such as Hopa Mountain. This is a tough time to work in the nonprofit world, in this country, when many fingers - some very few rightfully so - point to the waste or enabling some nonprofits are responsible for. This is not the case with Hopa Mountain. Hopa Mountain gives 100% to give nonprofits in service to the neediest populations the tools and resources they need to help their people. The compassion they have for their communities and their clients is palpable, and their services are delivered with respect and humility. This nonprofit is human-scale, human-based and makes a difference - a REAL difference - at the grass roots.  Hopa clients become like a family, and we are all encouraged to succeed and help others succeed. It is an incredible organization, and I am so glad they exist - they make the world a better place. 
Hopa Mountain Foundation	145608	1	/users/profile/192120	Jodi R.	Board Member	5	12/02/2012	Hopa Mountain is totally community oriented organization offering a wide array of services. I particularly appreciate the work being done to strengthen Native non-profit organizations, the one entity we need more of Indian Country. Hopa Mountain makes free training available to anyone who would like to participate via a number of webinars. Hopa has developed a great social media outreach campaign to keep the Native community up to date on Hopa activities. In addition, Hopa Mountain has several strong programs geared towards developing indigenous scientists. For example, Hopa is bringing a well known professor of environmental and forest biology, Dr. Robin Kimmerer, to the University of Montana in late February 2012. Kimmerer, director of the Center for Native Peoples and the Environment,  will present to a UM campus-wide audience. She will  also work with Native students and discuss indigenous models in science application. What I write represents just a sliver of the great work being done at Hopa.  When asked to join the Hopa Mountain board of directors in 2012-- I said, yes.  I knew I would be working with a great team.

I became involved with the organization right out of college and was quickly captivated by Bonnie (the organization's founder) and the entire Hopa team. Hopa is one of the most genuine and self-reflective organizations that I have had the pleasure to be a part of. The staff and amazing group of partners are committed to their work in a deep and meaningful way.  I have spent time with many different non-profits and have found few with such conviction and contagious energy. I look forward to seeing how this organization continues to grow and impact the lives of those it touches.

The positive energy that this organization brings to their work, their willingness to listen, and the respect they have for the communities they work with sets them apart. I really believe that Hopa Mountain has found a uniquely beautiful yet effective approach to creating positive change from the community level up. As a VISTA volunteer, I grew tremendously both personally and professionally from my time with them. I am grateful for what they did for me, and what they work tirelessly to do for folks living in the Northern Rockies.
Hopa Mountain Foundation	145413	1	/users/profile/191915	Art W.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/30/2012	I've been following the growth and development of Hopa Mountain for the past six years, and have been a donor on several occasions. Bonnie Sachatello-Sawyer and her staff are an inspiration to many as they work with students and communities in the tribal and rural areas of the northern plains on the educational and environmental challenges that go with the territory. An added bonus is the teaching of best practices for non-profit management that Hopa Mountain offers to community organizations - something that is building stronger organizations in a region that sorely needs them. My family and I will definitely support Hopa Mountain in the future, because they truly epitomize the spirit that will save and revitalize communities and individuals in MT, ND, SD, and WY!

They are at the forefront of combining the promotion of early literacy skills with native languages and culturally responsive methods, through their Story Makers program. They are investing in youth leadership: advancing native science practices through their Native Science Field Centers, while incorporating additional subjects, such as math and technology. Hopa Mountain's Strengthening the Circle supports Native non-profit start-ups through ongoing education and networking.

Their programs have powerful and lasting impact in the rural and Native communities they serve. Hopa Mountain listens to the desires of the people and helps them develop the resources they need to fulfill the dreams thay have for their communities. As a mentor in the Strengthening the Circle program, I have enjoyed helping Native nonprofits to develop and implement marketing, community relations and media relations strategies to help "get the word out" about the work they each do in their respective communities.

What a great training to have so many diverse groups stepping up to help natives do good work in their communities.  We have continued those relationships and have greatly benefitted.  As with many other organizations, we would have never been able to afford their services.  For me personally it was gratifying that when something was suggested- Hopa Mtn and crew listened and then took action to make it happen.  They ask, how can we help and then DO it!!  If you ever get the chance to meet Bonnie you will know exactly what I mean.    If you want to start a non profit-here is a great place to start and with great people.
Hopa Mountain Foundation	137937	1	/users/profile/183967	IreneG.	Board Member	5	11/13/2012	Hopa Mountain is an agent of change in the rural and American Indian communities in Montana, Wyoming, and North Dakota. Its programs are carefully crafted to promote the well being of these communities. Using a bottom-up approach, in which people's voices take precedent, Hopa Mountain implements programs focusing on: the development of toddlers' early literacy (Story Makers), middle school students (Native Science Field Centers), high school students (Indigenous Scholars of Promise), American Indian college students with interest in STEM areas (Native Science Fellows), promotes future leaders with interest in developing Native non-profit organizations (Strengthening the Circle), and offers many community leadership programs and support to emerging non-profits organizations. Hopa's work is inspirational and vital to achieve a better  tomorrow.

Our Board President found Hopa Mountain while searching for a way to learn more about applying for grants.  She applied for us to attend their Strengthening the Circle seminar and we were accepted.  We went there  not really knowing what to expect.  What we encountered were the most helpful people and the most professionally run seminar.   Clearly careful thought and preparation were put into this event.  There were numerous classes on grant writing, marketing, strengthening Boards of Directors and more... everything that we needed to know to become better and enable us to do more in our communities were part of this event.  Our needs for comfort, sleep and food were met as well.  I went into that seminar knowing I did not have the skills to accomplish the things I wanted to do, I left there feeling as if I could do anything.  Bonnie Sachatello-Sawyer is a powerhouse with endless energy, ideas and a willingness to help.    Under her supervision and with her incredible staff, Hopa Mountain is doing so much to help so many.

The Director, Board and staff are energetic, engaged, extremely hard working and sincerely strive to help. They do not broadcast their achievements, but their impact on helping patients and improving quality of care for Montanans is big and inspiring. From the St. Patrick House for families needing a comfortable place to stay, to helping cancer patients in need, to assisting with brain injury prevention and education efforts--they truly shine in all they do. The Foundation has been very instrumental in working with our Neuroscience Institute to raise both money and awareness around the significant issue of brain injury in our state.

And in 2009 Seedlings of Change was founded and I have been on the Board of Directors since that time and work very closely with Eveline and the other members to try and make changes in the world that help to improve the lives of everyone and teach people that they, through their individual lifestyles and efforts, CAN make a difference.  I am most proud of our mini-grant program which provides, after a detailed application, description of the group and a check in plan with Seedlings that follow through is apparent, small grants to local and international groups teaching children and adults, in projects, how to make changes in the environment.  We have one in Africa, Thailand, several in Montana, and elsewhere and, although they are small amounts, $600 to $1,000, a lot is accomplished by each organization with our assistance.  My hope is to be able to raise funds to continue to do more and larger mini-grants and continue to make a difference in our world because, to my mind, it is each one of us, making an effort and following through on our thoughts/actions that CAN make changes so sorely needed all over the globe.  Thank you for the opportunity of sharing about Seedlings of Change.  Sincerely, Joan Douma, Secretary, Board of Directors of Seedlings of Change.

I was asked to be on the Board and I was proud to be a board member as I so believe in the general mindset and goals to improve our world, in any small way that is possible, and wanted to be an active part of this nonprofit and website.  We have provided several mini-grants within the past year and a half, in various locations and helping various project, many of which involved children who are, as we know, the next leaders of our country.  We continue to grow and our goal is to do all we can, as an organization, to bring peace, understanding and positive action and reinforcement to make our world a better place for all people to live in.  We welcome all new members who have a similar interest and walcome you to join our nonprofit.

The focus is diverse--from a project to encourage strength and confidence in young women in Missoula, to supporting development of a school garden in a small village in Africa--sending the message that a small seed planted indeed can create change.

They have provided a mini-grant to The Creative Gig Project to help the local artists within the community find work.  Which as we all know is a dying profession due to lack of funding and interests in our schools.  I wish there were more organizations like this one!  Because Artists are never going to save the world but they will make it worth saving!

Seedlings of Change	60721	1	/users/profile/66116	Sharon	Volunteer	5	01/22/2011	I first heard of Seedlings of Change through my sister, Joan Douma.After reading Seedlings Mission Statement and investigating further, I signed on.  Seedlings of Change, under the guidance of Eveline contantly moves forward to touch people around the globe with many different projects.We began work on the Global Harmony Quilt and asked for small bits of fabric from around the world.  We were amazed at the response and interest and this beginning lead to the discovery of various other projects touching the world.A couple of examples:  A group of quilters making quilts and donating them for the soldiers injured in the war. A lawyer in a 3rd world country setting up a program to teach women who had been taken from their families and when they escaped, were not welcome back into the villages.  A place was formed with a teacher to teach sewing.  When the time was over, they got $100, a sewing machine, and fabric.  These 2 examples are just a part of the type of work that Seedlings of Change is in the midst of.  Eveline constantly searches for more ways of bettering our world, one person or group at a time. Seedlings of Change is a gift to all.Sharon Emmett - Napa, California-USA

Sowing seeds of harmony, tolerance and cultural bonding can ensure a better and peaceful world. The cutural harmony quilt created by the members from all over the world is a heart-warming and wonderful example of vasudhaiva kutumbakam, ie., the vision of entire world as ONE family. It has paved the way and made us realise its possibility bringing us a step closure to its realisation. It sows seeds of such bright and positive change so needed for us to survive and thrive. We owe it to Earth, to ourselves and to our children & the following generations.I wish more seeds for strength & more success towards realisation of a better world.

Without their support and strong encouragement for our S.A.P. program designed to empower students in Thailand to design and implement 2 environmental-community based projects of their own, we never would have been able to make the difference that we have.

Intermountain	292092	4	/users/profile/382571	Bruce46,	Client Served	5	06/04/2016	Our 14-year old son just returned from an 18-month stay at the Intermountain residential program in Helena.  The experience was transformative for our son and our family.  We are grateful that this unique program exists and that our son and our family were willing and able to participate in the program.  Through the Intermountain program, our son has developed a dramatically improved ability to regulate his emotions, to navigate social situations constructively and to  make positive/safe behavioral choices.  He is back home and on a completely different path.  Our son was nurtured, cared for and grew tremendously through the experience.After coming to the difficult realization that our son required residential treatment, we explored all available local programs in the San Francisco Bay Area and also investigated residential programs across the country.  Intermountain stood out to us as the clear choice for our son.  Several schools had comparable therapeutic, behavioral and academic resources, but we felt that Intermountain had a sense of "heart" at the core of the program.  The program takes a relational approach which focuses using and developing positive relationships as the foundation of the program.  I have often described it to friends as a "loving" atmosphere.   It was the ONLY residential program that we visited that felt like a home environment instead of an institution.  The program expects a lot from the kids (and from their families) and also offers abundant affirmation, support and tools to help kids and families navigate the very large and very real problems they face.  It's not a party, a camp or a vacation.  It's a 24x7 therapeutic/behavioral program designed to help kids understand their behavior and its consequences on themselves and others.  The goal is to shift behavior, emotion, thinking, patterns, habits into more constructive and appropriate outlets.  Parents are expected to participate actively and need to consider how their own behavior and attitudes have contributed to the dysfunctional family dynamic.In our experience, the program works remarkably well.  Our son developed strong relationships with cottage staff, his teacher, his therapist, classmates and many others on campus.  The staff is well trained, supported and "get" challenging kids in a way few places do.  Instead of treating challenging kids as "bad," they understand that our kids need help developing the more constructive tools to handle the emotional, social and behavior challenges they face.  Intermountain was the first time we felt confident that our son's needs wouldn't overwhelm the resources of a program.  Throughout our son's life, we have dealt with dozens of neurologists, therapists, psychiatrists, psychologists, behaviorists, OTs, PTs, aides, teachers, etc. and found the staff at Intermountain to be remarkable and consistently among the warmest, most dedicated, most insightful that we have encountered.  Over the 1.5 years of our son's treatment, we visited Intermountain each month and spent many hours and days on campus and in the cottage.  We also attended many off campus activities and events, including a 5-day boys summer camping trip where I was the only parent in attendance.  During that time, we never witnessed anything even remotely resembling the problems described by a few on this website.  We have no affiliation with the school in any way and if we saw anything resembling abuse or inappropriate behavior, we would be the first and the most vocal in addressing those problems.  Because the allegations are serious (and so different from our own experience), I want to respond in detail to several of the concerns.  I have great empathy for any parent who has had to make the painful decision to place their child in a residential treatment program and want to respect their opinion.  However, since the criticism bears no resemblance to our own experience and makes claims that are factually untrue, I want to share our experience so other parents have full information when evaluating comments on this website and deciding whether the Intermountain program is right for their child and family.Holdings -- Intermountain does use physical holdings as a tool of last resort to prevent disregulated children from hurting themselves or others.  It is not therapy -- it is a tool to avoid physically unsafe behavior.  We witnessed holdings in the cottage and at school on several occasions, in each case triggered by a child hitting or threatening impending violence.  Witnessing a holding is an unpleasant and emotionally challenging experience.  In our experience, staff remained calm, spoke softly to the child being held and each holding ended with the child becoming re-regulated.  If you are not comfortable with your child being held (or if you are a self-identified "anti-holding activist" as is the case for one of the negative postings), do not enroll them at Intermountain.  I hate holdings and felt awful each time our son was held; however, compassionate holdings done as a last resort seemed like the least worst of the alternatives.  If holdings are ruled out, instead would he be drugged, tranquilized, isolated, tied down or turned over to the criminal justice system after he hit or harmed another?  These aren't easy issues to decide as a parent, but we felt that holdings were a better tool than the available alternatives.Medications -- Intermountain takes a therapeutic/relational approach to treatment.  Based on our son's therapeutic progress, Intermountain recommended and we agreed to eliminate a few of his medications and reduce the dosage of others.  In our experience, medications were an adjunct to the therapeutic program and Intermountain was less medication oriented than other programs we have experienced.Monitoring -- The Intermountain program takes an integrated approach to therapeutic care and works hard to share/communicate information across teams from school, the cottage and home.   The belief is that kids do better when everyone involved in their care has current information about what's happening with them across their day/week.  Events and discussions from school can influence behavior in the cottage or vice versa.  Likewise, family calls can trigger/influence a child's behavior.  Staff did participate in our family calls and sometimes offered suggestions.  This was not a surprise or a concern to us, and in fact it was often helpful to have staff participate.  In our calls, staff might redirect our son or prompt him to reconsider his behavior/thinking, but it never felt like oversight or we never experienced any effort to censor or limit what our son discussed with us.  There were a few occasions where our family call was cancelled at the last minute because our son was struggling or not in a constructive space to talk.  Those calls were rescheduled if we wanted.  In our experience, we were always free to talk to our son about anything at any time, and no one ever suggested otherwise.  Visitors on campus sometimes are not allowed to interact with children (other than your own child), which is perfectly appropriate in my mind.  We sent our child to Intermountain to be treated by professionals, not engaged by strangers or other parents who happen to be on campus. Food -- We had lunch or dinner in the cottage 40-50 times and ate the school cafeteria dozens of times.  In our experience, meals were well rounded, balanced and bountiful.  Kids served themselves, had seconds if they wanted and lots of food was left over.  The school cafeteria serves a hot lunch on school days, usually some meat served with a starch and vegetables.  Kids also have access to a salad bar that includes fresh fruit and kids have free access to milk, juice and water.  The cottages prepare breakfast/dinner and lunch on weekends.  Breakfast might be french toast casserole, pancakes or eggs.  Dinner was usually a meat served with starch and veggies.  If a child didn't like the main meal, they could prepare a sandwich or other food.  I wouldn't call it gourmet dinning, but no child came anywhere close to going hungry.  We never heard of or saw access to food being using a therapeutic tool, reward or punishment.Chapel -- As part of the Intermountain intake process, families identify the religious/spiritual traditions relevant to their child and are asked to provide direction about their child's religious education.  Our son attended "chapel" once a week in the school's multi-purpose room.  We attended chapel twice during visits and also met with the chaplain 2-3 times to discuss our son's spiritual education. Both times we attended chapel, the group leaders (one Christian and one Jewish) read bible stories and then the kids played games loosely related to the stories.  Religious education was not a key factor for us in selecting Intermountain and our primary concern was to ensure that our son wasn't being told that there was one "right" way to worship.  Our son enjoyed the program and it felt inclusive and compassionate to us.Staff -- In our experience, Intermountain staff are a remarkable collection of kind, compassionate, caring and well trained individuals.  From the beginning, we were struck by the love and care that they bring to their interaction with the kids.  One critical post on this website states that "many of the people they hire are white trash and don't even like kids."  This kind of attempted character assassination speaks volumes about the judgment, values and temperament of the person writing the post and says nothing about the qualifications or capabilities of the Intermountain staff (not to mention the inherent race- and class-bias of such a statement). Our observations and experience were the exact opposite.Making the decision to send our son to residential treatment was incredibly difficult, but the Intermountain program has given our son the tools to understand himself, his feelings and his behavior.  He is happier, more centered and more socially engaged than ever.  We are so grateful for Intermountain and the positive changes it has brought to our son and our family.  I just asked our son what he would want to say to parents of kids who are thinking about sending their child to Intermountain.  He said that staff are very kind and help keep you safe when you are struggling.  He said that kids have fun at Intermountain and get to be kids, even though they also have to do hard treatment work.  He said that Intermountain is a good place for kids who are struggling.Bruce
Intermountain	291112	1	/users/profile/381471	lisadawn1976	Client Served	4	05/26/2016	SAVED OUR LIVES!!! When we brought our son to Intermountain he was defiant, depressed, suicidal, and out of control. The relationship between him and myself (his mother) was terrible. He hated me. We could not communicate. He had never completed a full year of school as he was always getting kicked out. That day we dropped him off was the hardest day of our lives. It took a while to see the changes but when we did they were amazing. My son and I finally were able to talk with each other without yelling. We enjoyed our weekly visits together. When we brought him home for home visits it was like having a totally different child at our home. He was respectful, polite and followed the rules. The program at Intermountain not only taught our son the tools he needed to be successful but it taught our whole family the tools we needed. It wasn't just him that was getting the treatment. We were involved in every aspect of his treatment and ours. They were there any time day and night for support. After a year my son was able to come home. He is now about to complete his first full year of school. Prior to intermountain he was always in the ED classroom. This year he has stayed in the mainstream class and has been very successful. We still have our hiccups every once in a while but we now have the tools to deal with them. Intermountain changed our lives for the better and given us hope not to mention a happy successful son. 
Intermountain	291033	1	/users/profile/381379	jbw48	Client Served	5	05/25/2016	Some times it is necessary to receive help from others in order to be able to see the beauty in life. Intermountain has, time and time again, come through for our family and given us the mental tools and attitudes that have allowed us to keep our lives and family intact. I cannot praise them highly enough. In a world where conceit and deceit constantly try to erode the better parts of our frail human nature, they have been a true and consistent beacon of selfless help and hope. What should there be not to like in that?
Intermountain	290972	2	/users/profile/381315	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	1	05/25/2016	Intermountain should be closed down!! Intermountain try to keep the child as long as possible for their own financial gain ($15,000 per month per child!!). I am also disgusted with how Intermountain treat the children. They use 'holding therapy' (physically restraining children against their will as therapy). They also practice 'strong sitting' (the child is made to sit on the floor and is not allowed to move or speak). Intermountain use holdings as threats and punishments to the children. They use it as a form of discipline and this needs to be stopped. The authorities need to investigate this. It causes the children emotional harm, anger, frustration and low self esteem, not to mention risk of injury. IM amplifies and enhances the children's fears and traumas. The children are violated from the holding therapy and have strong feelings of helpnessness. A child should ONLY be restrained to protect them from hurting themselves or others and should ONLY be done using a basket hold (standing). Intermountain do not practice this, they restrain on the floor, often with 2 members of staff and for extended periods of time, for reasons such as non compliance or a child being rude! Intermountain monitor all phone calls that the children make. The calls are all on speaker with IM staff sitting with them. So, if the child was suffering from mistreatment or abuse from a member of staff they would be too afraid to report it. Intermountain is a cesspool. They only write negative things about the children in reports and meetings, most of which are misinterpretations of the truth.I have witnessed IM staff belittling the children and speaking to them in a cruel and demeaning manner. There are others that share my view that many of the staff are not positive role models for the children. To put it blunt many of the people they hire are white trash that don't even like children. Some staff members don't even take care of their own children. IM staff do NOT have the children's best interests at heart. They couldn't care less about what the children want and do not give them choices.They do not spend quality time with the children and are there to enforce rules only. The therapists heighten the children's fears with many talks about being safe/unsafe. IM re-activates their trauma, causing them to become anxious.Children are given too many (and unnecessary) medications. Children are often wrongly diagnosed by the dr that sees the Intermountain children.Parents are sending their children to this facility hoping their children will come back fixed. Intermountain is not the answer and just leaves the child with more issues and emotional scarring.IM is extremely strict, which wouldn't be AS bad if they also had the nurturing and caring piece, which they don't.Children feel alone and are left crying with no one to comfort them.Intermountain invent and exaggerate children's problems in order to keep them at IM for longer. They have denied the children loving families in order to keep them at this institution. They also pass false information on to social workers and families.It is true and has been said that IM treat children like objects. They claim to be one of the best treatment centers in the country, yet they do not care for children adequately. A hard look needs to be taken at this facility and its staff. They really need to be more selective about who they hire.The staff do not respect the children's religious preferences (such as putting pork on a Jewish child's plate against her wishes when the staff were fully aware she was on a kosher diet).In some of the cottages, visitors are not allowed to speak to the children. They make these children feel worthless. They also deny children visits with family members if they have a bad day.The children are fed very small portions of food and often go hungry. The lunches at IM consist of a small bowl of canned soup and canned fruit. The dinners are freshly cooked at least yet they are still not given a sufficient amount.As one of the IM rules is asking permission to go to the bathroom, some of the children become desperate or wet themselves as they are ignored when asked if they can go or are to afraid to ask.The intermountain staff all need to take training in TBRI (Trust-Based Relational Intervention). It will teach them that children need to feel taken of. They need to do things for the children so they will feel cared for. They need to offer them second helpings of dinner, listen to them when they have a problem and give them TLC.The staff also need to learn safe ways to restrain and when it is appropriate to restrain.The children are very seldom taken off campus and so they are confined to the grounds of Intermountain. Over time, some of these children become fearful of leaving the campus or feel like they don't deserve to go.Children are forced to attend religious services at the chapel at IM, even if it is not their belief to practice that specific or any religion.Many of the staff should not be allowed to work with children. I have witnessed control freaks, cruelty and emotional abuse.When visitors come to IM they appear to make IM look amazing (to try and encourage more donations). They will give speeches on how the children have made progress and make a lot of effort into making themselves look good.Even though IM get a large amount of money for each child, they STILL use donations to buy clothing/shoes and other items for the children. What are they doing with the money for the children??Intermountain have a tendency to split siblings up. They will say that the child does better without the sibling even when there has been no evidence of abuse or issues between the siblings. I witnessed siblings that missed each other and wanted to be placed together. Not only did IM not have them placed together but they also did not allow visitation!IM staff do not understand what reactive attachment disorder is. RAD is often a misunderstood condition, it does not mean that a child is incapable of attaching to caregivers or others. It means that some children that have been abused, neglected or subjected to poor early relationships may develop certain ways of relating to others based on their early experiences. Most children who have attachment problems are able to form bonds and IM staff need to understand their attachment styles. IM staff have no experience with adoption related issues and IM hire many people that are simply just looking for a job.Intermountain is in an isolated location, far from many of the children's families. Statistics show that residential care is rarely helpful/beneficial to children. Families need to be actively involved and visit their children at least weekly. Studies prove that instead of residential care, there are other better alternatives. Such as: Functional family therapy and trauma based cognitive behavioral therapy.Families that are reading this please think carefully about this and do not send your children here.IM staff and DHS are in cohoots with each other, nothing is being done to address the issues. The running of IM needs to be evaluated and changed. The staff are incompetent and don't have the needs of the children at heart. Intermountain is money motivated and not child focused!Lastly, I am doubtful that the authorities in MT will close down IM. MT allows places like IM (and even worse) to operate, including residential homes without licenses (if they are faith based). In states that are not so remote, such as NY, residential homes like this would not even exist!

I used to work there - first with the board of directors and then as part of the fundraising team. Now, I'm able to own my own business and give back my time and money as a volunteer. I believe so much in the mission of Intermountain that I want to tell everyone to give back as much as they can so we can ALL help children heal and even more - so we can protect them. Intermountain believes in real results and real impact. The people there have a true heart for healing kids and make a lasting impact on our communities. My husband and I believe in the mission of Intermountain and will continue to share it. We hope you'll join us!

Intermountain	215199	1	/users/profile/278577	PutKidsFirst	Professional with expertise in this field	1	09/16/2014	If you are looking for a treatment center for your child, I would highly recommend you look at one that puts your child at the center of their decisions and not one like Intermountain that will treat you and your child like an object. If your child is doing well, Intermountain will take all the credit.  If they are not they will blame the parent.  They will continually write goals and objectives that point out everything that is wrong with you and your child, and will give you no tangible strategies on how to work to a better tomorrow.  At the same time, they are interested in keeping your child in their organization as long as possible for their benefit of the almighty dollar.  Intermountain has been pulling on the heart strings of their donors for years with lies of how treatment is going today, when the fact is, Intermountain was great once, but they have taken their focus off the children and invested in big business and expansion.  There is no accountability within the entire organization, and it starts at the top.  I pray that Intermountain will recognize they have and EGO problem, and return to what made them great. One assessment that they should really key in, is that if there are staff that do not have healthy relationships in their own life and with their own kids, friends, and wives, then how can they possibly teach someone else.  I wish the parents and their children the best in their search for healthy care, and that they would be able to see the beautiful child they have.
Intermountain	214118	2	/users/profile/277355	Pat_49	Client Served	5	09/08/2014	Our son spent 16 months at Intermountain in its residential treatment program. The child we took there was angry, depressed, and physically unsafe. He was almost expelled from school. The child we brought home is completely different. He has made so many positive changes. He is safe, polite, respectful, and a good student. He has successfully completed 3 weeks at a new school. He is making friends and doing well with his school work. He is such a pleasure to be around and we are so proud of him. Without Intermountain, this transformation would not have been possible. Intermountain isn't just a "program," it is an entire way of life. Life in the cottage, at school, in chapel, and in the community all play an important role in the child's transformation. We are very thankful for Intermountain. It is the best money we ever spent! 
Intermountain	191835	2	/users/profile/250388	MTMama	Client Served	5	12/30/2013	I am a single parent to two adoptive children, one of whom has suffered with the emotional/behavioral chaos of attachment disorder since early childhood.  Despite 4 years of intensive out-patient psychiatric counseling, tutoring and every imaginable therapeutic intervention available in our community, my daughter's condition continued to spiral downward to the verge of suicide and very likely homicide.  I was having to call our local police department on a regular basis to help restrain my daughter from serious violence.  I was at the brink of losing my family (and possibly my life).  Now, after 18 months of residential treatment at Intermountain, we are an intact family ready to thrive.  My daughter is returning home with the skills to manage her feelings and behaviors long before  they get to the rage that previously overtook her mind and body.  We as a family have learned important skills for success.  There are no words adequate to express the depth of my gratitude to Intermountain.  This program not only changes lives, it literally saves them!

The experience was transformative for our son and our family.  We are grateful that this unique program exists and that our son and our family were willing and able to participate in the program.  Through the Intermountain program, our son has developed a dramatically improved ability to regulate his emotions, to navigate social situations constructively and to  make positive/safe behavioral choices.  He is back home and on a completely different path.  Our son was nurtured, cared for and grew tremendously through the experience.After coming to the difficult realization that our son required residential treatment, we explored all available local programs in the San Francisco Bay Area and also investigated residential programs across the country.  Intermountain stood out to us as the clear choice for our son.  Several schools had comparable therapeutic, behavioral and academic resources, but we felt that Intermountain had a sense of "heart" at the core of the program.  The program takes a relational approach which focuses using and developing positive relationships as the foundation of the program.  I have often described it to friends as a "loving" atmosphere.   It was the ONLY residential program that we visited that felt like a home environment instead of an institution.  The program expects a lot from the kids (and from their families) and also offers abundant affirmation, support and tools to help kids and families navigate the very large and very real problems they face.  It's not a party, a camp or a vacation.  It's a 24x7 therapeutic/behavioral program designed to help kids understand their behavior and its consequences on themselves and others.  The goal is to shift behavior, emotion, thinking, patterns, habits into more constructive and appropriate outlets.  Parents are expected to participate actively and need to consider how their own behavior and attitudes have contributed to the dysfunctional family dynamic.In our experience, the program works remarkably well.  Our son developed strong relationships with cottage staff, his teacher, his therapist, classmates and many others on campus.  The staff is well trained, supported and "get" challenging kids in a way few places do.  Instead of treating challenging kids as "bad," they understand that our kids need help developing the more constructive tools to handle the emotional, social and behavior challenges they face.  Intermountain was the first time we felt confident that our son's needs wouldn't overwhelm the resources of a program.  Throughout our son's life, we have dealt with dozens of neurologists, therapists, psychiatrists, psychologists, behaviorists, OTs, PTs, aides, teachers, etc. and found the staff at Intermountain to be remarkable and consistently among the warmest, most dedicated, most insightful that we have encountered.  Over the 1.5 years of our son's treatment, we visited Intermountain each month and spent many hours and days on campus and in the cottage.  We also attended many off campus activities and events, including a 5-day boys summer camping trip where I was the only parent in attendance.  During that time, we never witnessed anything even remotely resembling the problems described by a few on this website.  We have no affiliation with the school in any way and if we saw anything resembling abuse or inappropriate behavior, we would be the first and the most vocal in addressing those problems.  Because the allegations are serious (and so different from our own experience), I want to respond in detail to several of the concerns.  I have great empathy for any parent who has had to make the painful decision to place their child in a residential treatment program and want to respect their opinion.  However, since the criticism bears no resemblance to our own experience and makes claims that are factually untrue, I want to share our experience so other parents have full information when evaluating comments on this website and deciding whether the Intermountain program is right for their child and family.Holdings -- Intermountain does use physical holdings as a tool of last resort to prevent disregulated children from hurting themselves or others.  It is not therapy -- it is a tool to avoid physically unsafe behavior.  We witnessed holdings in the cottage and at school on several occasions, in each case triggered by a child hitting or threatening impending violence.  Witnessing a holding is an unpleasant and emotionally challenging experience.  In our experience, staff remained calm, spoke softly to the child being held and each holding ended with the child becoming re-regulated.  If you are not comfortable with your child being held (or if you are a self-identified "anti-holding activist" as is the case for one of the negative postings), do not enroll them at Intermountain.  I hate holdings and felt awful each time our son was held; however, compassionate holdings done as a last resort seemed like the least worst of the alternatives.  If holdings are ruled out, instead would he be drugged, tranquilized, isolated, tied down or turned over to the criminal justice system after he hit or harmed another?  These aren't easy issues to decide as a parent, but we felt that holdings were a better tool than the available alternatives.Medications -- Intermountain takes a therapeutic/relational approach to treatment.  Based on our son's therapeutic progress, Intermountain recommended and we agreed to eliminate a few of his medications and reduce the dosage of others.  In our experience, medications were an adjunct to the therapeutic program and Intermountain was less medication oriented than other programs we have experienced.Monitoring -- The Intermountain program takes an integrated approach to therapeutic care and works hard to share/communicate information across teams from school, the cottage and home.   The belief is that kids do better when everyone involved in their care has current information about what's happening with them across their day/week.  Events and discussions from school can influence behavior in the cottage or vice versa.  Likewise, family calls can trigger/influence a child's behavior.  Staff did participate in our family calls and sometimes offered suggestions.  This was not a surprise or a concern to us, and in fact it was often helpful to have staff participate.  In our calls, staff might redirect our son or prompt him to reconsider his behavior/thinking, but it never felt like oversight or we never experienced any effort to censor or limit what our son discussed with us.  There were a few occasions where our family call was cancelled at the last minute because our son was struggling or not in a constructive space to talk.  Those calls were rescheduled if we wanted.  In our experience, we were always free to talk to our son about anything at any time, and no one ever suggested otherwise.  Visitors on campus sometimes are not allowed to interact with children (other than your own child), which is perfectly appropriate in my mind.  We sent our child to Intermountain to be treated by professionals, not engaged by strangers or other parents who happen to be on campus. Food -- We had lunch or dinner in the cottage 40-50 times and ate the school cafeteria dozens of times.  In our experience, meals were well rounded, balanced and bountiful.  Kids served themselves, had seconds if they wanted and lots of food was left over.  The school cafeteria serves a hot lunch on school days, usually some meat served with a starch and vegetables.  Kids also have access to a salad bar that includes fresh fruit and kids have free access to milk, juice and water.  The cottages prepare breakfast/dinner and lunch on weekends.  Breakfast might be french toast casserole, pancakes or eggs.  Dinner was usually a meat served with starch and veggies.  If a child didn't like the main meal, they could prepare a sandwich or other food.  I wouldn't call it gourmet dinning, but no child came anywhere close to going hungry.  We never heard of or saw access to food being using a therapeutic tool, reward or punishment.Chapel -- As part of the Intermountain intake process, families identify the religious/spiritual traditions relevant to their child and are asked to provide direction about their child's religious education.  Our son attended "chapel" once a week in the school's multi-purpose room.  We attended chapel twice during visits and also met with the chaplain 2-3 times to discuss our son's spiritual education. Both times we attended chapel, the group leaders (one Christian and one Jewish) read bible stories and then the kids played games loosely related to the stories.  Religious education was not a key factor for us in selecting Intermountain and our primary concern was to ensure that our son wasn't being told that there was one "right" way to worship.  Our son enjoyed the program and it felt inclusive and compassionate to us.Staff -- In our experience, Intermountain staff are a remarkable collection of kind, compassionate, caring and well trained individuals.  From the beginning, we were struck by the love and care that they bring to their interaction with the kids.  One critical post on this website states that "many of the people they hire are white trash and don't even like kids."  This kind of attempted character assassination speaks volumes about the judgment, values and temperament of the person writing the post and says nothing about the qualifications or capabilities of the Intermountain staff (not to mention the inherent race- and class-bias of such a statement). Our observations and experience were the exact opposite.Making the decision to send our son to residential treatment was incredibly difficult, but the Intermountain program has given our son the tools to understand himself, his feelings and his behavior.  He is happier, more centered and more socially engaged than ever.  We are so grateful for Intermountain and the positive changes it has brought to our son and our family.  I just asked our son what he would want to say to parents of kids who are thinking about sending their child to Intermountain.  He said that staff are very kind and help keep you safe when you are struggling.  He said that kids have fun at Intermountain and get to be kids, even though they also have to do hard treatment work.  He said that Intermountain is a good place for kids who are struggling.Bruce
Intermountain	47291	6	/users/profile/48055	patti4	Donor	5	06/30/2010	As a former foster parent and an adopting parent, we have received a lot of education and experience in dealing with attachment impaired children.  Intermountain has a research-based residential program for severely impacted children which is effective in helping the child rebuild a life and, just as importantly, supporting those who adopt these children to parent them in ways that are most effective so that the child can have the best chance to have a fulfilling life.  Intermountain also has programs to help less-severely impacted children and families through counseling and training for children, parents and foster parents.
Intermountain	43354	7	/users/profile/44185	flatgolfer	Donor	5	06/09/2010	My wife and I have been intersted in the important work of Inter-Mountain for a number of years because of the good results they are now getting and have gotten in the past, with the lives that have turned from despair to hope.  The foundation, the people who do the direct work with the children, as well as the entire organization, from the top director all the way through to the janitor, is so commited to building strong lives, that were once broken, is a real credit to the intire organization.  The fact that Faith is the beginning and the end, should make each of you wery proud and thankful. Carol and Roy
Intermountain	43231	7	/users/profile/44037	former-child-guardian	Client Served	5	06/08/2010	Plain and simple: Intermountain gave this child his life back. The child was severely emotionally disturbed... had been "cared for" by an even more disturbed mother... and was incapable of functioning in the "normal" world.... had literally been expelled from kindergarden.  After two years of care at Intermountain, he was interacting well with others, interested in school (and doing well), and actively engaged in outside activities. I visited several facilities before choosing Intermountain for him, and none came close.
Intermountain	43210	7	/users/profile/44013	beckber	Client Served	5	06/07/2010	Our adopted daughter spent two years at the Inter-mountain Deaconess Home for Children. After suffering repeated emotional trauma, our daughter learned how to trust adults again through her time at the home. My husband and I received training in how to parent an attachment impaired child and received wonderful support through the adoption. The staff really live out their motto..."Healing through healthy relationships".  I have the highest regard for Inter-mountain Deaconess Home for Children.

Great work all around.
Ecology Project International	89136		/users/profile/37090	katy-vandusen	Board Member	5	05/24/2011	EPI connects students with scientists and the  natural world, inspiring them and giving them the tools to take care of the earth.  I have walked in the dark (no flashlights) alonga Carbbean beach monitoring leatherback sea turtles as they emerge from the water to lay their eggs... and I have seen the transformation in the young people I was with, as they took data... counting eggs, measuring the turtle, and learning about this animal and its threatened existence.  EPI's experiences leave a profound impact.  These students go home motivated to talk to others about not eating turtle eggs, and about preventing plastics and pesticides from polluting the ocean.  And they go home with a better understanding of  how science works, ready to learn more.
Ecology Project International	36298	7	/users/profile/37090	katy-vandusen	Board Member	5	04/21/2010	I have lived in Costa Rica for most of the last 30 years.  I have watched the degradation of the biodiversity and natural environment here, including the forests and the oceans, as the country becomes increasingly
Ecology Project International	47643	5	/users/profile/48364	toyos	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/01/2010	As a  biologist and a high school teacher I have found that Ecology Project International (EPI) complement much of what I teach inside the classroom. The trips I have organized with them have helped me provide my students with experiences and expose them to activities that are almost impossible to do during a normal academic year.Their curriculum is intensive, well designed and balanced between field work and class time. Their locations offer access to (natural) resources ideal for science oriented and conservation activities. The professionalism of the instructors cannot be questioned.
Ecology Project International	38748	6	/users/profile/39645	jena2	Volunteer	5	05/12/2010	I loved the Galapagos trip I took back in March and April. I worked hard and had a blast meeting new people and learning about everything. It was worth all the hard work to come up with the money and I would trad a lot just to go again. When I was on the Islands I was able to work with little 3 month old turtles and stomp through the forests to measure and take data. The plant species and counting was something I have never done and it was different to see and learn how people have to find and record their data. When we went to see the turtles we were able to go into the baby turtle hatury areas with the 3 month old turtles. Our group had to weigh, measure and record our data for the place. Once all the hard work was done we got to hang out with students at the BEACH!! It was warm, fun and hard to communicate sometimes because I don't know much spanish but we found other ways to communicate. Everyone is so nice and the animals don't run away like they do in my town. I could go on forever but I recomend that anyone who doesn't grab on to this opertunity is going to regret it forever! This was an expirience I will never forget!
Ecology Project International	36118	1	/users/profile/36910	allyinsummer	Volunteer	5	04/18/2010	With Ecology Project International, I had the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to be hands on involved in marine biology. I spent five days living on a boat with four marine biologists, studding whales in the Baja Gulf of California. A typical day consisted of waking up on a beautiful beach, eating breakfast and working on research projects, observing the ocean for signs of whales, seeing a whale, chasing a whale, getting a biopsy of the whale, dissecting the biopsy, eating yummy lunch, continuing research projects, seeing another whale, getting another biopsy, set up tents at another amazing beach, eat dinner back at the boat, present the daily research projects, and fall asleep under the stars.EPI made this whole opportunity possible. I will never forget the amazing things I saw, the wonderful people I met, or the vast amounts of knowledge I learned. Im still in total awe at what I witnessed and the entire experience feels like a dream! I mean, since when can you be ten feet from the largest animals to ever live on this planet? Or how is it possible to swim with 300 wild dolphins in the morning and that afternoon have a wild sea lion touch your leg while swimming with them? As I said, I still am in shocked that I experienced that! The lesson I learned that will stick with me forever is, that there is so much more to our world than just what is on the surface.
Ecology Project International	35473	4	/users/profile/36303	annegraham	General Member of the Public	5	04/11/2010	I traveled with a group of my Spanish students, all aged 13, on an EPI trip to La Paz and Espiritu Santo Island.  We were thrilled with the success of the trip.  Although it was a pilot course for middle school cultural interaction combined with science and ecology, we felt as if the instructors had been doing this sort of trip all along.  They were helpful, responsive, caring, knowledgeable and fun.  There were a couple of times when an activity might have gone on too long, or the students may not have been clear on what was expected of them, but I would be hard-pressed to find any such experience that is perfect.  Specifically, during Each One, Teach One, some students read directly from the informational cards with which they were provided, rather than preparing a synopsis with a quick interactive presentation.  This was not due to the instructor's lack of direction; on the contrary, he was very clear about not reading straight from the card and about involving the other students by asking questions.  The only way to fix this would be maybe to have an adult with each group or to give the students a template for their mini-presentation.  The only thing that was stressful throughout the entire trip was air travel.  I know that EPI doesn't have control over that, so I was prepared to deal with it.  I would try to avoid tight connections, since our group missed our final flight home due to a flight delay.
Ecology Project International	35470	4	/users/profile/36299	april5	Volunteer	5	04/11/2010	I participated in the Costa Rica turtle conservation program, and I can easly say it was one of the most amazing experiences I have ever had. I made life-long friends with my crewmates and with the research assistants, and I will never forget sitting behind a turtle's cloaca, colecting her eggs. I was also able to obtain a partial scholarship to go on the trip.
Ecology Project International	35210	7	/users/profile/36046	kjameskavanaugh	Volunteer	4	04/09/2010	I went on the EPI trip to Costa Rica to help save and preserve the Leatherback sea turtle population. It was truely an experience of a life time. To be able to touch the gentle, prehistoric, giant turtles was crazy! With that in mind this trip was no vacation. Everyone worked hard walking for 4 or more hours during the night paroling the beaches. I would say that if anyone is going to go on this trip they should be a person who loves animals and wants to help them. If this description doesn't fit you, I don't think you will fully enjoy the experience. I loved this trip so much that I have signed up for another trip this summer in Yellow Stone National Park. I fully look forward to the people I'll meet and the animals I'll see.
Ecology Project International	35178	7	/users/profile/36018	animalover	Volunteer	5	04/09/2010	I went to Costa Rica with EPI through my high school and the experience changed my life. It gave me the opportunity to do hands-on research of the leatherback sea turtles when I was only 14. It increased my awareness of environmental issues and it sparked my passion for wildlife biology and environmental science.
Ecology Project International	35115	8	/users/profile/35960	meagan1	Volunteer	4	04/08/2010	Going to Costa Rica in high school with Ecology Project International was my first trip out of the States and what a trip it was! Our leader from our local area and the teachers and guides we met in Costa Rica were beyond wonderful.  They were so knowledgeable and trust-worthy which is exactly what you need when you're taking teenagers out of their home country.  The work was challenging - both physically and emotionally - and the whole experience was so eye-opening.  My desire to learn more about environmental problems was heightened and the realization that even at 16 years old I could make a difference changed my entire way of thinking.  I highly recommend EPI trips for young adults and hope someday to go again.
Ecology Project International	35069	7	/users/profile/35913	afternoonblue	Volunteer	5	04/08/2010	During my trip with EPI, I discovered the beauties of a culture completely different than the one I know in America. In Mexico, everything has a twice-used feeling, and though this may be in part due to Mexico's lack of money, it is interesting how people can get along with so much less than we do in America, and still support a vibrant culture. At the camp where we did whale research, I learned that using renewable energy is really more of a problem if you can't make the change in your head, because once the changes tangibly manifest themselves, using a composting toilet or re-using your water doesn't seem hard at all. I learned that all people are excited to share their culture, that even whale researchers who spend months whatching whales are excited when calves come up close, and that speaking Spanish is something I wish I could do.
Ecology Project International	35022	7	/users/profile/35868	wendy9	Volunteer	1	04/08/2010	My experience begins with the enthusiasm to participate in a Wilderness First Aide class.  When researching such class, I found the EPI website and remembered visiting the campus briefly in Mexico.  The website posted positions open for feild instructors in Mexico and I applied.  I did not get the job, but was excited to be a part of the Wilderness First Aide class in January that terminated before it started as it was canceled due to a lack of participants.  I know that EPI is not at fault for this.  With a degree in Physics and Math, a life of outdoor experience in the Inland Northwest and a history of living in La Paz, Mexico, I decided that I would like to become involved with EPI and thus, traveled to La Paz despite the cancelled class.  Upon arriving, I talked with the employees of EPI La Paz and even enjoyed a tour of the campus.  After a nice conversation with those who were working on campus, I offered my services, as a volunteer, to write curriculum for advanced students and any other bits and pieces that might need doing.  I was encouraged to keep in touch and made plans to receive data and general information about the specific ecology programs of the island and whales so that I may write the said curriculum for these programs.  Although I was told several times over the next few weeks that someone would be contacting me and that my services would be appreciated, I got the same lip service every week or so . . . Thank you for your patience, we are quite busy with opening the season I will be in touch next week about how you may be able to help us . . . After a month or so of this type of communication and my responses of the sort . . . just let me know what I can do, I am anxious to start writing curriculum and anything else that you may need. . . I felt that maybe my opportunity to volunteer and help EPI was passing.  There was still hope, though.  EPI has an internship position in La Paz which started in March, so in February, I organized my information and sent it in hopes that I may have been able to earn the position and still be a part of EPI.  A week passed with no word, the training date for the position was quickly approaching and so was my sister's wedding.  Although I had planned to miss my sister's wedding if I were accepted by EPI to work, I was getting worried that they had not yet contacted me.  As the days passed and I heard nothing from them, I bought my tickets to my sister's wedding.  The very next day, I received an email from EPI.  My heart pounding and mind swirling over what I might do now that I had plans to leave were settled when I read the email which stated "Your application for recruitment coordinator is complete, you should hear from us the end of next week"  Recruitment coordinator?  I asked myself.  I applied for a feild internship in Mexico, not a recruitment coordinator position in Montana.  I sent a quick email asking about what may have happened, then another within a day as I had decided that maybe moving back to Montana would not be a bad situation.  Oddly, I did not get a response to either of my emails, nor did I hear back from them at the end of the next week.  Sadly, I am not impressed at all with this organization.  It appears to me that they are not the real thing.  Either very unorganized, or just playing it by ear, or simply using ecology funds to do whatever sounds best at the time, I am not sure.  I can only say that I began with great hopes and a high regard for this program and have since been involved in a string of incidences that leave me to think that EPI could do a much better job.
Ecology Project International	35014	4	/users/profile/35861	mandi-q	Client Served	5	04/08/2010	I am a high school teacher and I chaperone groups of students on EPI's wonderful programs annually.  I have taken trips to Costa Rica where we worked hands on with the endangered Leatherback Sea Turtles.  We patrolled the nesting beaches at night and when a Leatherback came up to nest, we would collect various data and also ensure her nest was located in a good location.  During the day, we hiked and witnessed first hand our lessons of biology, ecology and conservation.  On a trip to Baja, we witnessed daily Blue and Bryde's whales.  The students collaborated with the scientists to locate a whale and then successfully obtain a biopsy of the blubber and skin.  All students have become super charged on these trips to persue a degree and a career in the science field.  Also, many have come home to make drastic changes within their own lives and community.  It is been really rewarding as a teacher to witness this change in a student.  It is an impact only trips like the ones EPI offers can initiate.

I am a pilot for Pilots N Paws and devote much time to flying rescued dogs to no-kill shelters and new forever homes.  I know how much time and effort it takes to conduct these charitable functions and I applause WMERR and all other similar organizations that look after animals in need for all the work they do.

Western Montana Equine Rescue & Rehabilitation Inc	176059		/users/profile/232409	hummerbird	Volunteer	5	10/09/2013	I have been a volunteer foster "parent" for WMERR for three years now.  Many hooves have touched my fields over the years and I have had two permanent elderly residents for a couple years now.  The director of WMERR has dedicated her life to the horses.  She and the board of directors give each horse we encounter thorough personalized attention.  Each rescue is evaluated very carefully for their state of well-being and an individualized plan formulated.  When a horse is ready for adoption, a application must be completed by the prospective new "parent" and then carefully reviewed by our Board.  If a horse does not qualify for adoption due to it's condition, it will either remain at the shelter or go to live permanently with a foster "parent."  Our horses are always afforded the opportunity to live their remain lives with love and dignity.  This rescue is well-deserving of any help you are able to give.  I cannot speak highly enough of our director, Board of Directors and volunteers.  Thanks for anything you can do to help!

Volunteering at WMER&R proved to be good for my insides, too. I hope to learn more about these intelligent and dignified animals when I return to my rescue chores this spring. WMER&R is one of those rare places where the people are as great to be around as the animals. Thank you for your dedication, and allowing me to participate; loved reading the updates in the newsletter, too.Robin
Western Montana Equine Rescue & Rehabilitation Inc	152028		/users/profile/203068	Julie107	Client Served	5	04/03/2013	I recently adopted Triska, an 8 year old Arabian Mare from Western Mt Equine Rescue and could have been more pleased with the process and how helpful everyone was. I started the adoption process back in November and everything went smoothly and the questions on the application were clear and relevant. Approval didn't take long but the time of year (winter) and the distances involved (I live in Colorado) meant I had to wait to come up and visit Triska for a few months. That posed no problems for the rescue and they were very happy to work with me. My first meeting with Kim, who had Triska on her property, was wonderful, and she was so willing to let me come out and visit her as much as I could while in MT. We signed the paperwork and began making arrangements to get Triska to Colorado. It turned out that I was able to get her myself and that worked out quite well. Now that Triska is home, she is settling in well and the stellar work the rescue did with her while she was in their care is really coming out. She's got great ground manners and training, is light and responsive and a joy to work with. A great experience. Thank you!
Western Montana Equine Rescue & Rehabilitation Inc	151735	1	/users/profile/202622	D.Lambiase	General Member of the Public	5	03/27/2013	I just received the first newsletter from the Western Montana Equine Rescue and it is amazing. I am not surprised, as all the people I have met in connection with this organization are amazing themselves.  Last year I met three horses that had been rescued and I have followed their total rehabilitation. This organization focuses on insuring individual care for each rescued horse. Volunteer caregivers see to the nutritional needs of each animal and those needs are constantly reassessed as the animal regains health. Then, a lot of time is devoted to finding the proper adoptive home. This group works by donation only and appreciate any contributions from the public. The horses receive every bit of the donations. My favorite stories are those of people who drive by one of the foster pastures of rescued horses and see the WMER sign. Then, they go ahead and donate a box of apples or a few sacks of grain (because their grandchild told them the horses looked hungry). Helping animals is a wonderfully fulfilling act. You can tell when you meet the folks involved with WMER, they are happy and fulfilled with their mission - rescuing horses.   
Western Montana Equine Rescue & Rehabilitation Inc	151675		/users/profile/202524	Carole8	Board Member	5	03/26/2013	WMER takes their role seriously - the intent of this organization is to help needy horses/horse owners and that is just what is done... no fuss, no muss, just get it done.  I've participated with other types of rescue and know how frustrating, tiring and heart wrenching this can be - yet WMER folks continue to do what needs to be done without complaint.  I am proud to be one of the newer board members and look forward to being able to support the folks who have been doing this work for years now.
Western Montana Equine Rescue & Rehabilitation Inc	119143	1	/users/profile/161991	Palomino	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/23/2012	The folks at Western Montana Equine Rescue & Rehab are absolutely amazing.   They put the animals' welfare far in front of their own personal wants and needs.  They are gentle and kind and will step out to help other rescues on a moment's notice.  They offer valid, helpful advice and are simply an example of what every rescue should be like.  Together, we can help the critters, and they are not concerned about ego issues or credit for what they do, but simply have dedicated their lives to helping these animals.  They are a shining example of the way all rescues should work together.
Western Montana Equine Rescue & Rehabilitation Inc	104003	1	/users/profile/136105	Mustang Man	Client Served	5	01/20/2012	This group worked overtime to find a home for a horse that was left on the property because he would not trailer load (had never been in a trailer in his 14 year life, then asked to load into a 2 horse trailer in the dark with a couple of hours to learn it) with instructions to put him down when he ran out of food. They arranged loading instruction for the horse on site and with their efforts to coordinate with other like minded rescues found a place for him where he is now in professional training and has a list of potential adopters lining up. Good work people. The state needs more of you for its horses!

Intermountain Opera Bozeman	231240		/users/profile/294843	DennisWentz	Donor	5	10/31/2014	This first-rate opera company is an amazing phenomon in Montana - grand opera for over 37 years, bringing the best young and upcoming opera singers from the Lyric Opera in Chicago, the Met and San Francisco Opera to Montana.   The committment is to always have Grand opera in Montana - backed up by a phenomenal local music talent scene - and it works.   Cosi fan Tutti and Romeo & Juliet were worthy of any city in the USA, over-the top productions that strived for excellence, and got there.
Intermountain Opera Bozeman	230475		/users/profile/294104	mgcurtis8	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/30/2014	As Artistic Director, I have been so pleased with the quality of our productions. When I travel around the country, attending operas and researching potential cast members it is clear that we have grown into one of the finest regional companies. Our Board, Volunteers and support staff are clearly committed to the production of opera in our beautiful mountain setting. Guest artists come to us from around the country while chorus and smaller roles are performed by our excellent regional artists. Our orchestra is made up of talented local and regional players who enjoy the experience of working with guest conductors. Our educational outreach has grown to include programs for all 5th grade students in the Bozeman area, the choir students at Bozeman High School and the Jr. High Schools as well as students attending the School of Music at Montana State University. I am thrilled to be a part of this fabulous organization.

I'm so pleased that the company has continued to grow and that the operas presented have been wonderful. The staging and talent, including principals, chorus and orchestra, are just amazing.
Intermountain Opera Bozeman	220113		/users/profile/283738	Kierna	Volunteer	5	10/05/2014	Intermountain Opera was my first introduction to opera as a child, and is a fantastic resource in a place where culture and the arts often feel out of reach. We have no Broadway shows, no great theatres and few big concerts, but the IOB produces professional shows every year. They won me over through outreach to the local schools' choir programs, and I love volunteering as a way to both help out and see the shows for free!
Intermountain Opera Bozeman	220106		/users/profile/283731	Tlavelle	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/05/2014	The artistic quality that this little company manages to achieve on a consistent basis is nothing short of miraculous, given the resources they have to work with. Professional-grade singers and performances are not what you expect to find way out in Bozeman, but I've never regretted a single ticket purchase. If you care about art and culture, nurture this wonderful institution with whatever support you can!
Intermountain Opera Bozeman	220101		/users/profile/283726	susanwplatt	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/05/2014	 For a town the size of Bozeman, we have a very rare phenomenon that is not seen anywhere else in the state.  I have been playing in the orchestra with Intermountain Opera Association for well over 22 years, and for the last ten have also been the contractor for the orchestra.   It has, by far, been the best musical experience of my adult life. There simply isn't an organization out there that has more energy and excitement for opera. And because it has a limited budget (what musical organization doesn't?) they manage to pull off fantastic full productions in a matter of weeks. The singers are brought in from all over the country, and sometimes the world, where they have sung with the Metropolitan Opera, San Francisco, and and Santa Fe to mention only a few. Our conductors have conducted at  La Scala,  New York City Opera and LA Opera and serve us up a healthy dose of professionalism and excellence. Our sets and costumes are often from Italy. Our directors are seasoned professionals who often travel long distances to direct our productions. Our community knows how very lucky we are to have this organization!
Intermountain Opera Bozeman	215534		/users/profile/278973	cgwalker	Board Member	5	09/18/2014	I have been a board member of IOB for just over a year, but have been a devoted opera lover since I saw my first IOB production, Madama Butterfly. The performances were exquisite and far exceeded my expectations. The fact that this little organization in a small Montana town can get world-class artists, conductors and directors -- literally stars from around the globe -- to produce such phenomenal operas made me fall in love with this community all over again. As the mother of young children, I also have tremendous appreciation and admiration for the way that IOB is exposing young kids to opera and creating a whole new generation of opera lovers. I look at this organization as a remarkable reflection of this community and the way we value art and culture. 
Intermountain Opera Bozeman	206812		/users/profile/269289	gdbyoung	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/21/2014	Since moving to Bozeman from Canada in 1988 I have enjoyed the Intermountain Opera as one of the cultural icons in this gorgeous state.  Playing principal clarinet with the opera for the last 26 years has been one of my most satisfying professional experiences.  The conductors, soloists, stage directors, chorus masters/choristers, fellow musicians and board members have produced a top-notch product year after year, and thanks to wonderful donors, there is no end in sight.  Bravi Tutti!
Intermountain Opera Bozeman	206789		/users/profile/269262	Peggy38	Board Member	5	07/21/2014	I have been a Board Member with Intermountain Opera Bozeman for several years.  I am an Opera Singer and am extremely passionate about Opera.  Being a singer myself, I have experienced many companies over the years.  Intermountain Opera is extraordinary!  Bozeman is such a small town, and yet we have a world class Opera company.  The Board and the Volunteers for this organization are intensely devoted and generous with their time and resources.  It has been such a pleasure to sing, promote, brainstorm, watch and interact with this organization.  They have grown on so many levels in recent years.  One thing that I find particularly wonderful is that they are willing to change and adjust.  They take intentional steps to thank and include their volunteers, they try to watch trends to make sure that their product will be well received and profitable.  What a fantastic Opera companymay it have a long and prosperous life!!!
Intermountain Opera Bozeman	206578		/users/profile/269022	susrellim	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/18/2014	I first experienced Intermountain Opera from the chorus in a production of Madama Butterfly. I had recently moved to Bozeman for the quality of life and to raise a family, having left a professional acting career behind in Chicago. Working with IOB was such a nice reminder of being in a professional performance environment. Rehearsals were run and scheduled with care and respect for everybody's time. The pros that are flown in for the leads are always top notch singers, and the production values are of the highest order. It's been a joy working with Intermountain Opera and a pleasure watching other productions from the audience. I highly recommend this company to singers or audience members.

The Biomimicry Institute	54100		/users/profile/55299	torrey	Professional with expertise in this field	4	09/30/2010	I came across The Biomimicry Institute a few years ago as I was preparing to teach a high school course on biomimicry.  New to the field, but excited to dive in, I contacted TBI so see if they had any curricular materials they were willing to share.  When they learned that I was planning to teach a semester-length course for high schoolers on biomimicry, they invited me to share my own materials with them for dissemination to other teachers, as they had little in the way of high school curriculum.Sam Stier, their Education Director, was great.  He was supportive and encouraging.  After seeing what my students produced, he invited me to attend TBI's education summit and to present my students' work.  The summit was full of really interesting presentations and networking opportunities.  Since then, I have seen many of the initiatives discussed at the summit implemented - the "Ask Nature" website and the certificate program in Biomimicry.  This is an organization that is making things happen!

The Biomimicry Institute has been instrumental in offering support to our faculty and students, developing curriculum and establishing research projects and networks. Our students have been involved in the Student Challenges, which is leading to ongoing research and potential internships for our students. Through the Biomimicry Institute we have established a broad network of educators across North America and Europe that has helped validate and support our research and curriculum efforts.

Rezq Dogs	209483	3	/users/profile/272245	NancyMT	Donor	5	08/08/2014	I am a personal donor to RezQ Dogs, and I'm also on the Board of a non-profit that works closely with them.  Jim and Anita are amazing in their dedication to the lost and forgotten dogs of the reservations. These dogs have no chance in life and are readily maimed and killed for 'fun'. But when they go to RezQ Dogs they are given the vet care that is needed, good food to eat, and most of all the love of a family. RezQ Dogs does absolutely amazing work on a shoestring budget.  They are angels!
Rezq Dogs	209040	5	/users/profile/271580	VickiInMT	Volunteer	5	08/07/2014	I have been a volunteer with RezQ Dogs since its inception in 2009 and am still amazed by what Jim and Anita have managed to accomplish.  Their love and dedication to the animals in their care is quite awe-inspiring.  Hats off to you both! Three of my dogs were adopted from RezQ Dogs.  I found the adoption process to be quite thorough, but not unreasonable or invasive.  Basically, they ask that you provide a safe, loving, forever home.  Given that most of the animals finding their way into the care of RezQ Dogs do so because their previous caretakers have failed in that regard, I dont believe this is too much to ask.
Rezq Dogs	208899	3	/users/profile/271650	Bonney	Donor	5	08/06/2014	We have the most wonderful dog all due to RezQ.  Quill (dog's name) came to us via RezQ.  This young sweet dog had gotten his snout too close to a porcupine and the result rendered him unable to eat and wounds deeply infected.  Quill was scheduled to be shot by local law enforcement.  Thankfully someone at this office stepped in and called Anita.  She picked Quill up and drove him many miles to the Missoula Humane Society, knowing they could give him the medical treatment necessary.  After numerous surgeries, drain tubes, and healing Quill came up for adoption.  As a volunteer at the Western Montana Humane Society, I knew he was one special guy.  Quill now shares his home with me and my partner.Without Anita's intervention, we would be without the best dog we've ever hadI am honored to have a RezQ dog and will be a donor for my lifetime
Rezq Dogs	208893	4	/users/profile/271646	Debbe	Donor	5	08/06/2014	REZQ DOGS - Jim and Anita take the ones who others consider disposable trash.  They come with lead embedded in their little frail bodies, broken bones that never healed, neck wounds so deep from embedded collars one must look away.  They come with porcupine quills in their faces in so much pain they can barely open their eyes.  Where is humanity, compassion, empathy for these voiceless, innocent dogs, let me tell you where---- with Jim and Anita Wilke  at REZQ Dogs Rescue. Even when they are full, they never turn away a helpless victim, they operate on a shoestring budget and when it looks hopeless, they find a way to make it happen.  I have never known two more dedicated and selfless people in this world.  They never put their needs first, hours upon long hours of saving lives is what they do. We are proud to know such extraordinary people as Jim and Anita.  When others would choose putting these animals down with a bullet or let them starve or freeze to death, they swing into action no animal will die on their watch.   If anyone wants to know their donations are going directly to helping save lives then please donate to this most deserving and worthy rescue.  We are honored to have donated in the past and will not hesitate to donate in the future,  Please join us in donating today! 
Rezq Dogs	208860	3	/users/profile/271608	Pamela73	Volunteer	5	08/06/2014	I met Anita & Jim last year when I helped by picking up kennel panels and gates from Great Falls & delivered them to them at their place.  I got to see all the dogs & deer (yes a deer), they were all so happy and you could tell they were loved and cared for.  Anita & Jim do so much and give so much of themselves for all they critters they rescue.  They have a good adoption procedure that makes sure the critters gets a good forever home.  They have a great vet that is there for them when some of they critters need a little help or a lot of help.  Thank you Rezq Dogs for being there.
Rezq Dogs	208842	3	/users/profile/271587	Zia C.	Donor	5	08/06/2014	I am amazed by the dedication of this organization and how much personal energy the administrators put into it.  The area they are serving is a very difficult and has a huge need for an organization like this.  In response to a negative review regarding their application process - I don't see a stringent application process as a negative, the devote a lot of resources into their rescues.  Having adopted a rescue dog (not from this organization), the psychological impact of being abandoned on a dog is real.  A lot of these dogs have never known and trusted a human, so for them to bond and trust, takes a lot of work and they want to make sure they go to a home where this trust and bonds can be forever.  Also the comment about the dogs being skinny and underfed - of course they are, if you read about the conditions these dogs are rescued from on their FB page, this wouldn't come as a shock.  Also, we have had our rescue for almost a year and she is extremely skinny, she is not food driven, has separation anxiety and part of it is her breed (Shepherd).  I blame the anxiety on being abandoned by her humans with her first family...    
Rezq Dogs	208837	3	/users/profile/271586	Kerri R.	Client Served	5	08/06/2014	Great organization!  They are seriously overwhelmed but are doing a great job with what they have.  There seems to be more abandoned dogs in their area than anywhere else.   They are always full to capacity but that doesn't stop them from taking another animal.  They do transfers to other rescues all the time. To the person who didn't get approved:  I don't know of any rescue who will let you adopt after you've given up multiple dogs when you move.   
Rezq Dogs	208805	4	/users/profile/271551	johnjjjj	Client Served	5	08/06/2014	I love our rezq dog and we adore anita and jim. I have seen first hand how hard they work to keep this much needed rescue going. They are extremely diligent in checking applications for the animals they serve and only adopt out to familys they know will love their new pet as a family member who should never be left behind, rehomed,or put down.
Rezq Dogs	208804	2	/users/profile/271550	Tahnee A.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/06/2014	I started volunteering for RezQ Dogs just about a year ago. Since that time, we have fostered 8 dogs for RezQ and along the way have gotten to know Jim and Anita as well as having become more involved with the entire organization. I have tremendous respect for the work that they do and the commitment that they have to the well being of animals. I am humbled for the small part that I am able to play. Because of the remote location and the volume of dogs that RezQ Dogs accepts, personal time and simple luxuries that many of us take for granted are absent in the primary caretakers lives. They work diligently to ensure that from the point that any animal enters their care, they never again want or need for anything and only ever experience love at the hands of humans. Despite so many odds against them, location, funding, and volume, the quality of adopters that they find for their dogs never ceases to amaze me! Anita screens applications with nothing but the best intent for the animals and sometimes has to make very difficult decisions. For all of the Rez Q Dogs that have passed through my home, this has meant amazing homes with loving families that will cherish them as family! They have inspired me to become more involved in not just their organization but with several other not-for-profits that focus on the betterment of our 4-legged friends!
Rezq Dogs	208791	3	/users/profile/271536	homersadie	Donor	5	08/05/2014	Rezq Dogs does a tremendous job under dire circumstances.  Anita and Jim take in sick, neglected, abused and abandoned animals and give them a safe place to recover, become part of a family, learn some manners, and just be a dog again.  Their untiring efforts to find the best possible home for each and every dog is truly commendable.  When most of us would give up, like after their facility was flooded and every dog had to be moved to Great Falls for several weeks, Anita and Jim just keep the goal in mind and keep on going.  As a person who does rescue on a much, much smaller scale, I know how difficult it is to screen all the applicants and try to decide when to say no and when to say yes.  We all want to place as many dogs as possible, but it if it is not a good adoption, the dog ends up right back where it started.   Personally, the minute I hear that a person left their so-called beloved pet behind because they had to move, I am done.  I have no reason to think that they won't do the same for this animal.   Anita and Jim commit to every animal that comes to their facility, and they keep them until the right home is found.  I say a prayer of thanks to them every day.
Rezq Dogs	208668	3	/users/profile/271412	Nora N.	General Member of the Public	5	08/05/2014	LOVE LOVE LOVE this amazing organization. They take in 100's of dogs from the reservations every year, in all kinds of conditions. They do not turn any dog away. They provide all vet care and exist completely off of donations. The dogs they take include extremely neglected animals. They have brought about a change in the kill rate for homeless dogs on the reservation from nearly 100% to nearly 0%. They work literally 365 days a year at salvaging these hapless creatures. There are no week-ends, holidays or vacations. Their moto, "providing hope for those who have none" pretty much sums it up. This is an organization who uses every dime of donated money toward the vet bills, feeding and transportation of the dogs they take in.  
Rezq Dogs	208645	1	/users/profile/271380	Anonymous112	Client Served	1	08/05/2014	Do not adopt from this organization. Anita the person in charge completely picks over your application then denies you for no reason at all. Then when you ask why she accuses you of dumping your dogs when we had to leave our dogs behind when we moved. She choses favorites when it comes to the adoption process. We were willing to give a dog a loving home but she attacked us and denied us. Do not adopt from them. Thier dogs are extremely skinny and underfed and the administration is extremely rude.

Financial help is so needed, and no one really wants to talk about this subject until they find themselves in it.  If my family had known of the support this organization provides to those in hospice care either at home or in a facility, this would have been so welcome and would have helped alleviate some of the financial anxiety and stress.  My family member would have greatly benefited from some of the programs this organization helps support like aroma therapy and music. Keep doing what you do!! Thank you!

I wholeheartedly recommend Hospice Care Foundation to others looking for a fine non-profit to invest their time, talent and treasure with.

Hospice Care Foundation	89833	1	/users/profile/102329	Josie	Donor	5	06/07/2011	My husband and I donate every year year by going to t he Hospice Ball.   We have a wonderful time and know that our donation for tickets and date night table are going to a really great cause.   I believe in Hospice care because, after being in health care  for almost 20 years, I know how needed this kind of care is needed. These days, people want to be at home when their final days come and that is where the hospice care comes into play.   Missoula Hospice is, in my mind is the best at what they provide for those in need of the end time cares.
Hospice Care Foundation	89783	1	/users/profile/102262	Carrie Rasmussen	General Member of the Public	5	06/07/2011	My first interaction with the Hospice Care Foundation was in the Fall of 2010 through my place of work in Missoula. I am the Director of Catering at a local hotel and I had inquired about placing a BID on their 2011 Annual Ball and began to create relationships with the individuals involved. We were not chosen to cater the event, but did have other opportunities to work with the organization and the committee memebers.  During this same time, my Grandmother had began to use Hospice Care (not in Missoula), and we got to know the individuals that vounteered and took care of her. If it weren't for the people who support these organizations and their services, there would be so many of our loved ones without the care that they need in their last moments of life. The Hospice Care Foundation is an organization that provides support to local hospice care facilities within the community.  By helping to reduce the high costs on the families and/or patients who may not have the  necessary resources needed in obtaining this kind of care, they offer a service that  is so valuable to the patient and their family.   
Hospice Care Foundation	89759	1	/users/profile/102213	Theresa M.	Volunteer	5	06/07/2011	I helped out with the Osprey Baseball Game back in 2010. It was great to see the community come together and recognize the importance of Hospice Care.  We were thanked and supported throughout the night.
Hospice Care Foundation	89746	1	/users/profile/102189	kevgal	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/07/2011	The organization has done a lot of work with volunteers who have raised funds to support hospice care in the Missoula area.  They have been in business for over 30 years and are fiscally responsible stewards of thier donatio ns.  As they turned from a volunteer group to a viable nonprofit, they have shown that the staff and board works well together which ensures fiscal and programmatic growth.

Vital Ground Foundation Inc	198271		/users/profile/234138	Earth Endeavours Media	Donor	5	04/17/2014	To see strong populations of wild grizzlies walk this earth, one feels comforted that all is well in nature. I have had the distinguished privilege of witnessing young cubs play and forage on the shores of Knight Inleta wondrous display of humour and intelligence. The connections become obvious as every element of the ecosystem relates to the health of these powerful and personable animals. Vital Ground strengthens these connections by preserving stretches of key habitat for grizzlies and other wildlife, providing them with safe passage to seasonal foodstuffs. Knowledge and community support are integral to their efforts, as such I invite you to share their vision and explore their cause.
Vital Ground Foundation Inc	37781	4	/users/profile/38477	thea2	Donor	5	05/01/2010	This organization gets it!  Their founders, Doug and Lynne Seus walk the walk.  They've been saving individual orphaned grizzly cubs for a long time.  Somehow, in spite of the demands of caring for these amazing creatures, they found the time to start an organization dedicated to protecting grizzly habitat.  They continue to nurture it, but have handed it off to a biologist-director who understands the importance of corridors for this species.  He and his staff work tirelessly to protect the range of this bellwether species because
Vital Ground Foundation Inc	37311	8	/users/profile/38043	curtisr	Donor	4	04/28/2010	They do excellent work! I've been a member since 2005 and have been pleased to see the progress the organization has made concerning protecting habitat for Grizzlies as well as in trying to mediate and eliminate conflict between ranchers and Grizzlies. The organization is also very good at keeping in touch with it's members, and in providing recent data and information about the organization and the Grizzly population.

Vital Ground Foundation Inc	37210	6	/users/profile/37941	fran8	General Member of the Public	5	04/28/2010	While I haven't had any personal experience with Vital Ground, I support & applaud any group that works to protect habitat for our wild creatures.  Our wild lands are disappearing at an alarming rate, Vital Ground plays a vital roll in creating open space for our large predators to live freely.
Vital Ground Foundation Inc	37196	8	/users/profile/37932	linda10	Volunteer	5	04/28/2010	I heard about Vital Ground when I was a bear viewing guide in Alaska. I had been learning to track and studying bears for a few years and I wanted to know how people could safely live around bears. I read everything I could about bears as I was also watching bears in the wild inter-act between each other. I have come to admire Vital Ground's work as I have come to value bears themselves. There is no better way to ensure that the great bears will survive than to protect habitat for them. Vital ground shares my personal mission to teach people more about bears so they will value them, learn to be around them with respect and safety. Vital ground has always been there to answer my questions and supply me with brochures to give out at my talks. In watching the organization grow and accomplish things for bears over the years it is one of my favorite non-profits.
Vital Ground Foundation Inc	37190	7	/users/profile/37925	mary17	General Member of the Public	5	04/27/2010	I think this is a great organization with an admirable cause. I have had nothing but a positive experience with Vital Ground.
Vital Ground Foundation Inc	37189	7	/users/profile/37924	chris18	General Member of the Public	5	04/27/2010	The majestic and misunderstood grizzly bear has almost vanished from the lower 48 states. Vital Ground's mission is to preserve what is left of this animal by purchasing private lands and using them towards grizzly re-population. Their work - and the organization's founder, Doug Seus - have inspired me to do my own work towards educating people about bears and helping to do away with the many of the old misconceptions. A fantastic organization whose work is critically important!

Vital Ground Foundation Inc	37185	6	/users/profile/37920	k-lee	Donor	5	04/27/2010	This is one of my favorite charities.  The work they do to save the wild lands for the largest predators in North America is invaluable to preserving not just an individual species but an entire ecosystem.
Sunburst Unlimited Inc	279125	1	/users/profile/369170	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	02/05/2016	This group reaches are community in so many ways. One of my favorites is the foster tomato program.  Coordinating with area nurseries,  they get tomatoes plants. Then, share  .  Those plants based on a voluntary agreement that a I portion of the harvest is donated to meals on wheels or the food bank. Wow!
Sunburst Unlimited Inc	110959		/users/profile/151032	David O.	Client Served	5	04/27/2012	Sunburst Unlimited is an important, focused, energized organization that has demonstrated an amazing ability to bring together local food producers, hunger agencies, schools, and the general public to work toward the goal of building a sustainable local food economy one backyard (and one school) at a time.
Sunburst Unlimited Inc	110885		/users/profile/150946	Phyllis K.	Board Member	5	04/27/2012	Sunburst Unlimited hosted our second annual FRESH FOOD FORUM.  We far exceeded our expectations last year and then aagain this year.  We had 150 people attend in 2011 and over 200 attended our Forum at the College of Technology in Great Falls Montana.  This organization is devoted to helping people learn about their food - the necessity of buying locally and, if possible, teaching them the value of raising their own food.  Sunburst Unlimited also is promoting composting of our food wastes and we make a product called "bokashi" that is a compost accelerant, using "cold" composting with no smell, no turning and good dirt in 60 to 90 days!  The Executive Director of our organization is totally dedicated to Sunburst - giving of ALL of his time to help, whether it be in with the School system, making the bokashi, going to other organization to teach them the value of the composting method or working with the local Food Bank.
Sunburst Unlimited Inc	110531		/users/profile/150473	Lisa82	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/23/2012	Sunburst Unlimited is one of the few non-profits that puts every ounce of volunteer efforts and funding into its philosophy of making our environment and community a better place to live. The board members and volunteers find out-of-the-box solutions to seeming conundrums and then follow through to implement those solutions. Of course, by finding non-typical solutions, the status quo is challenged so a part of all that  Sunburst Unlimited accomplishes is taking baby steps to change that status quo. Sunburst Unlimited demonstrates integrity, courage and innovation. 
Sunburst Unlimited Inc	110455		/users/profile/150368	ryansmith	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/21/2012	*A tiny seed can have a global impact! As president of Gardens FromGarbage with a background in architecture and green, sustainable design, we are truly planting seeds in our community. The awareness and emphasis the organization has on the creation of a sustainable food source is having the intended ripple effect in our community, state, and even at a national level. The Fresh Food Forum that took place here in Great Falls last weekend was proof that 200 like-minded people and 20 local vendors attended and share in our concern. The Forum met its objective by bringing together local growers/producers and local buyers. The Gardens From Garbage seed isgrowing!*
Sunburst Unlimited Inc	110427	1	/users/profile/150334	Nancy Anne	General Member of the Public	5	04/21/2012	Sunburst Unlimited has rescued me from the drudgery of composting.  I live on two acres in Montana.  Winters are dark, long and cold. I plant my garden around Memorial Day and figure that by Labor Day, it could freeze anytime.  My soil is crushed granite interspersed with large rocks.  No self-respecting worm would live in it. I am also a person who believes that if it is a bio-degradable substance, why pay to have it hauled away?   For years I tried to compost anything and everything I could  grass clippings, leaves, trimmings from my garden and garbage.   But composting by traditional methods takes more organization, time, energy and planning than I have ever been able to muster so I always had lots of green and brown material with little garbage. I could never seem to get it watered enough, turned enough or layered enough to decompose properly.   During the winter, I just dumped my garbage onto the top where it promptly froze until spring. When it thawed, it became a rotting, smelly mess that attracted flies and skunks.   It was, overall, a very unrewarding experience. Then I learned about organic fermented material  Bokashi.  Sunburst Unlimited introduced me to this anaerobic cold composting method and in one short year I have no more smelly compost pile, my garden soil actually is starting to look like soil and I have worms!  Using Bokashi and a bucket, my garbage (including leftover meat, fish, fat and catfood) transforms into a fermented material which further transforms into dirt when dug into my garden.  No smell, no flies, no skunks.  In the winter, after one bucket is filled I just put it into the storage shed where it freezes and I start another bucket.  In the spring, I create trenches throughout the garden, layer in the contents of the buckets, cover with dirt and by the time I am ready to plant, I have only rich, dark soil to plant in.   And the grass clippings and leaves?  They make wonderful mulch. Sunburst Unlimited does so much more than make and sell Bokashi. With minimal staff and dedicated volunteers, they work with schools; getting the students involved in cold composting (Bokashi method) their leftovers from school lunches and snacks.  They work with community gardens and have a seemingly unlimited array of innovative programs to help create a supply of fresh, wholesome food that is local. They are always willing to answer questions and teach individuals and groups about sustainability.  Since I live 100 miles from their home-base, I have not been able to be involved in all their programs but I am a member and a fervent believer in what they do.  Being able to compost year around means we reduce the amount of trash in landfills.  By growing and consuming local food, we reduce the dollars going out of Montana to truck produce in as well as reducing the amount of gasoline used to haul produce in. If you love the soil, believe in sustainability and the concept that local food is healthier, call Sunburst and volunteer!  At the very least, join their organization and help spread the word! 
Sunburst Unlimited Inc	110407		/users/profile/150304	mjahrendes	Board Member	5	04/20/2012	This organization has been built on the dreams and inspiration of one man, with the consistent efforts of Board members and volunteers.  It is the dream of Michael Dalton to bring local food sustainability to his community and the surrounding area.  He has inspired and led all of us with his dream to create a foundation upon which to build and meet this goal.  Composting in the elementary schools started in 2010 with the production of a product called bokashi.  The event called the FRESH! Food Forum brings together growers and buyers and furthers a farm-to-school agenda.  The Foster Tomato Program ensures that fresh food gets to the Great Falls Community Food Bank.  The energy of this all-volunteer organization is amazing, and the progress continues toward gardens dedicated to the Food Bank, and the development of a licensed commercial kitchen and food processing plant.  One of these days, we will have no food insecurity in our area!
Sunburst Unlimited Inc	110303	1	/users/profile/150177	Kris Dunn	Volunteer	5	04/19/2012	I am pleased to share this review of Sunburst Unlimited Inc.  I have worked with and served on many boards in the non profit world and found  Sunburst to be a strong organization bent on a strong mission.  Sunburst remains true and passionate to their mission. It is truly a noble and much needed mission.  Sunburst is deeply committed to our community  being able to feed ourselves with healthy food coming from our various modes of community gardens, composting and the true example of building community and sustainability. 
Sunburst Unlimited Inc	110075		/users/profile/149920	KevinMo	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/17/2012	Sunburst Unlimited has helped numerous local organizations and schools implement Bokashi composting systems. The Alternative Energy Resources Organization (AERO) has collaborated with Sunburst Unlimited to build Bokashi composting bins at the Helena Food Share and Carroll College. Sunburst's willingness to provide support to our staff and the staff of these institutions was generous and reflected their commitment to addressing food security and other community food system needs. Sunburst Unlimited's "Captain Compost" can be counted on to share his expertise in engaging and kid-friendly ways wherever the need may arise.  
Sunburst Unlimited Inc	110043		/users/profile/149876	DBrastrup	Volunteer	5	04/17/2012	As a past board member and now a volunteer for this organizaton I have found that the impact we can have on people and this earth must start with a single act, either individually or as an organization.  This organizations passion is to help people help themselves by showing them how to do a simple thing like composting food waste and how to use that compost to help build better soil to grow their own garden.  I have seen first hand the impact the organization has had on the llives of peope interested in bettering themselves.  I would recommend this organization to everyone.
Sunburst Unlimited Inc	109937	1	/users/profile/149741	Julie49	Board Member	5	04/16/2012	Having been involved with Sunburst Unlimited and Gardens From Garbage for several years now it still amazes me how much we have changed, how much we have changed peoples thinking, how much we are growing and how much there still is to do!  Having just wrapped up the 2nd Annual FRESH Food Forum and feeling like we spread the word so very well.  All our participants, all our vendors, all our volunteers made the morning a huge success!  People came with questions, they got them answered, they now know that Sunburst and Gardens From Garbage is the place to go for future answers to their composting, buying/using locally grown produce/meat...Thank you Sunburst for your vision and keeping us all striving to be better to ourselves and our environment and most important, helping those who need an extra hand.
Imagine Missoula	170695		/users/profile/226123	ChickenWing73	Volunteer	5	09/19/2013	Imagine Missoula is a unique organization - to become involved is simple, and the work is constant, depending on your own abilities, schedule, preferences.  IM has done a tremendous job of connecting the simple, over-looked needs of a community with those who are able and willing to lend a hand.  Relationships are built, community well-being is improved, and the city is a better place because of the efforts of IM and it's volunteers!  I love this organization!
Imagine Missoula	170655		/users/profile/226087	Afton R.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/19/2013	When Mayor Engen said that Imagine Missoula was the best bang for your buck, he was right.  The inspiring energy and enthusiasm that Imagine Missoula volunteers bring to their many projects is amazing.  I work with young mothers in our community and Imagine Missoula has been able to respond in short notice to help us with multiple projects.  
Imagine Missoula	170639	1	/users/profile/226066	sam-i	Volunteer	5	09/19/2013	When I moved to Missoula and wanted to get involved with my community, a handful of organizations told me 'no thanks' because I couldn't commit to a weekly or monthly time slot (worked a rotating night shift in healthcare, my schedule changed weekly).  Imagine Missoula was the answer to that problem.  I can volunteer when it works with my schedule, often it's very last minute or at odd times.  Like many other volunteers, I appreciate the opportunity to help the underserved in my community with the simple, often mundane, tasks that are beyond their capabilities.  It's so gratifying to get phrase and thanks for moving a few boxes or cleaning windows--I never get that gratitude when I'm cleaning my own windows.  I also appreciate the way Imagine Missoula communicates with its volunteers.  With multiple lines of communication, it's always been easy to get information about volunteer opportunities.  
Imagine Missoula	167098		/users/profile/221944	PaulieG	Volunteer	5	09/04/2013	I have been helping make my community stronger by volunteering through Imagine Missoula for about 3 years and it has been my absolute pleasure. One of the things that makes Imagine Missoula stand out from other non-profits is the breadth of services that we offer....by simply offering a neighbor a helping hand. I've filled sand bags amidst raging flood waters, pulled weeds, mowed lawns, roto-tilled gardens, shoveled snow, painted fences, fixed faucets, helped connect printers, helped navigate the internet, given rides, helped countless single parents, elderly and disabled move, even driven a U-Haul 1,200 miles......and it seems that each time, no matter what the project, they become more and more rewarding. One of those we helped put it best.  Earlier this year my young boys and I showed up to mow a lawn for Sarah, a sweet elderly lady.  She was so thankful "...people like us where willing to help"  when we told her it was no big deal she promptly corrected us with a teary eyed reply, "No! It is a BIG deal...you are helping me to stay in my home and maintain my independence."  There we stood, corrected with authority! One of the most common things I hear while volunteering is "we had no where else to turn".  Imagine Missoula is the 'catch all' that is at, what for many seems like the end of the proverbial road.  Yeah, we do 'THAT'.  By 'that', I mean it seems we can find someone to do almost anything. Imagine Missoula makes it EASY to volunteer and takes away any excuse you may have thought you had for not giving back.  I can volunteer on my time, when it fits into my schedule and many times these projects are simple tasks that usually take only an hour. While I reflect on the scores of projects I've taken part in and all those we've helped, at first it seems my heart swells with pride....then I realize how much it has helped me to become the type of person/neighbor I want to be......and how much a 'little thing' to you or I, can have the most profound impact to someone else. Making a difference is EASY.....you just have to show up! Peace & Love 
Imagine Missoula	167050		/users/profile/221897	ex266	Volunteer	5	09/04/2013	Imagine Missoula is a "community" of people helping other people.  What's particularly special is the extremely low overhead and the true grass-roots nature of the organization.  As a volunteer, I have the ability to see who is in need of assistance (through emails, facebook posts or the Imagine Missoula website); and, I can volunteer as my schedule allows (by not serving at all - maybe even for weeks at a time, or by opting to serve a very specific role).   I've had opportunity to meet some very sweet folks who live in my area, and I've had the pleasure of helping them with something that's potentially "major" in their eyes, but takes little sacrifice on my end.
Imagine Missoula	151797		/users/profile/202693	Colelee A.	Volunteer	5	03/28/2013	I recently learned of Imagine Missoula and I am amazed at the wonderful people who live in my community.  I am a new member of Imagine Missoula and cant wait to get started!  This organiztion helps everyone from the elderly, homeless, single parents to every day people who just need a helping hand.  It is a great way to meet wonderful people in the community and it feels great to give back.   
Imagine Missoula	151766		/users/profile/202652	Carmen G.	Volunteer	5	03/28/2013	What an amazing organization.  I just joined and have not been able to help them as of yet but plan to in the near future. I have always wanted to do something extra and could never figure out how or where to start.  Imagine Missoula  has changed that for me.  Now i can visit their page and see if there is something or someone that I can help out with.  I love to read the stories from people that have been helped. What a great feeling to be able to help in any small or large way that I am able. What a blessing Imagine Missoula is to the city of Missoula and the people.
Imagine Missoula	151753		/users/profile/202642	Laura118	Volunteer	5	03/28/2013	I just recently learned about Imagine Missoula and started to look into what they were doing in our community.  I was so touched and amazed by the wonderful connections that have been made and the acts of kindness and community that are constantly displayed here.  I am a social work major and Imagine Missoula is very close to my heart.  They are truly setting an example for other communities and are actively "Being the change they wish to see in this world."  They are amazing.  
Imagine Missoula	151745		/users/profile/202635	melaniehawk	Volunteer	5	03/27/2013	Imagine Missoula is awesome.  I have lived in Missoula for almost 15 years yet I had no clue it existed.  I have joined the cause only a few short weeks ago and have been truly amazed at the great works that I have seen and read about that come from this organization.  As a volunteer I am so excited to be able to help with future gardening activities as I am disabled and cannot necessarily do much more than that.  I feel useful now.  I haven't felt useful to Missoula for a long long time.  I am also excited to be able to donate some of my extra belongings to a family that has recently overcome being homeless.  I have been there with my two children.  It is an honor to be able to help donate my extra items for this cause.  Missoula is an extraordinary community like no other in existence.  I have seen many examples of the kindness and generosity in our community.  Imagine Missoula, as I see it, really is a link like no other.  It is various other organizations and individuals that have come together to fill the gaps and connect the organizations and individuals together.  Its a great and empowering cause that is beyond beautiful.  Imagine Missoula links "those who can and are able to" with "those who need that extra boost."  Isn't this what life is about?  To be charitable, sometimes sacrifice, and to be of service to others?   Imagine Missoula does exactly that.....  beautiful, just beautiful!  :-)
Imagine Missoula	151739		/users/profile/202627	KellyHH	Volunteer	5	03/27/2013	Imagine Missoula fills a much needed void in the community for the people they serve, and the community at large (including volunteers looking for unique and meaningful opportunities to make a real difference in their city.)

They are thorough with their information about the pet to be adopted as well as research the owner candidate's ability to care for the pet.As professional as Sandy Church is, the founder and president, she is still very personable, patient and friendly.The dog I adopted, Harlow, had a committed foster mom as well.  Britni didn't just "house" this young dog while she awaited to be adopted.  Britni obviously spent a good deal of her time training her.Due to Sandy's and Britni's commitment to the health and well being of this dog - I am able to provide a "forever" home and could not be any more pleased.  I am certain that because of Rimrock Humane Society's dedication they have an extremely low return rate and high customer satisfaction record.Thank you,Laurie Moe

The Rimrock Humane Society is a top-notch well run organization under the outstanding direction of Sandy Church.I have fostered and adopted precious doggies from The Rimrock Humane Society...each animal is treated with TLC and is never adopted out without background checks, home visit, previous vet background check and complete physical on the little one that is about to be blessed with a new home!Sandy has done wonders with Rimrock Humane Society....making it one of the top-ranked organizations in MT.I can't say more about Sandy and The Rimrock Humane Society.  If one is looking for four-legged love....Sandy is the one to call!Bless you for being there for us and the critters, Sandy!  Five stars and a big thumbs up from me!
The Rim Rock Humane Society Inc	38461	6	/users/profile/39342	alissa2	Volunteer	5	05/10/2010	RHS has a sturdy foundation, and their policies ensure that each animal is finding the perfect, long term home. I recommend this organization to anyone who is looking for a new pet, needs to find a home for a pet, or needs education in the areas of animal welfare. They are community driven, they have  support from every corner, and I have been honored to work with them.
The Rim Rock Humane Society Inc	38455	6	/users/profile/39331	vonda	Volunteer	5	05/10/2010	We have been fostering for Rimrock Humane Society for four years.  We are proud to foster for such a wonderful dedicated humane society.  It truly is all about the animals.  Sandy works hard to be sure every animal is placed in not just a loving forever home, but a loving forever home for that particular animal.  We feel so honored to be able to contribute something to this great humane society.  Many kudos to Sandy and the other board members who take each animal's specific health, emotional, and personality in to consideration prior to their adoption.  We think the best animals are the ones placed in foster homes so that adopters know everything about the animal when it is placed, increasing the opportunity that each adoption will be that animal's last adoption.
The Rim Rock Humane Society Inc	38362	6	/users/profile/39230	togdorn	Donor	5	05/08/2010	I have followed the progress of the Rimrock Humane Society closely since it's beginning. They are blessed with leadership and volunteers that are highly committed and dedicated to the care of animals in need. God bless their efforts in continuing to serve those that can't help themselves.
The Rim Rock Humane Society Inc	38247	6	/users/profile/39138	erica3	Client Served	5	05/07/2010	We are over an 8 hour drive from Rimrock Humane Society, and they had our dog. We drove about 6 hours and Sandy was willing to drive the extra 2 and a half hours to meet us to reunite with our dog that had made his way to Montana! It was a blessing, and this shelter is wonderful! They really go the extra mile.
The Rim Rock Humane Society Inc	38235	4	/users/profile/39127	janna1	Client Served	5	05/07/2010	I have had awesome experiences with Rimrock Humane's Society! We had 2 puppies that we needed to find homes for and they assisted in getting them forever homes with WONDERFUL people. I love how they inspect, interview clients before placing animals with them to make sure they are going to good homes.They have also helped me fix 3 of my dogs so we would not have any more puppies! I in return have donated money, and help contributed recently by attending the Rover Ramble in Roundup. You could not ask for a better dedicated person then Sandy and everyone else who helps her!
The Rim Rock Humane Society Inc	38234	5	/users/profile/39128	dyon	Volunteer	5	05/07/2010	Rimrock Humane Society, Inc. provides a vital service for Eastern Montana.  The Society is a no-kill alternative for hundreds of unwanted or cast-off dogs, cats, or other pets.  The Society sponsors an annual Fun-Run for supporters, adoptive 'parents' and former client dogs.  The proceeds are used to fund spay/neuter and necessary veterinarian services for current client animals.  Our first connection with Rimrock Humane Society was in 2001, when we took in Shelby - a tri-colored Sheltie that was so underweight that the vets advised getting him to add some weight before having him neutered.  Many rescue societies would have turned their backs to Shelby, but not Rimrock Humane Society, Inc.!  Long story short, Shelby gained the much needed weight, was neutered, and has come out of his very introverted shell.  He is now a much loved member of our family.  We highly recommend Rimrock Humane Society, Inc.!
Valley Veterans Service Center	320610		/users/profile/413343	PHendren	General Member of the Public	5	12/29/2016	I was first introduced to the Valley Veterans Service Office while attending a Community Symposium at the local community college. I had just recently relocated to the valley after retiring from public service with the federal government. I am also a 21 year veteran of the US Navy.I was attending the symposium looking for ways to give back to help our community. It was there that I was introduced to Mike Warner and Dan Griffin, the Veterans Service Officers. Their enthusiasm for what they do was very apparent as they spoke about the various services they offer. They invited me to come to the center for a tour which I took them up on their invitation.I am very impressed with the ingenuity and creativity these gentlemen have had to show to make the most of the limited resources they have in order to provide quality and compassionate service to our veterans. I was amazed at how many veterans they serve, and that number is increasing weekly as word of mouth is being spread that veterans can get help here. Mike and Dan are a personification of the concept of: "Work smarter, not harder!" Thank you for your service!!!
Valley Veterans Service Center	320604		/users/profile/413332	AFVet_F16	General Member of the Public	5	12/29/2016	 I cannot express what an outstanding asset the Valley Veterans Service Center is to this community and surrounding communities.  In addition to being a veteran myself, I work with veterans on a daily basis and refer anyone who might benefit from their services to them.  Not only do they understand the Ins and Outs of navigating the Veterans Administration, but they are a wealth of knowledge when it comes to the resources available to veterans and their families including, but not limited to: housing; food; transportation and mental health. The two CVSO's Mike and Dan and their staff are welcoming and always have a positive "Can Do" attitude.  They work hard to process claims, but they also take the time to listen to each persons story and build a rapport. They have done an excellent job of creating a safe, trusting environment where veterans can go and build comradery with other veterans.  Thank you for the work that you do. 
Valley Veterans Service Center	320597		/users/profile/413320	Bitterrooter38	General Member of the Public	5	12/29/2016	The VVSC is an asset to this county. I've known numerous vets in our community who have used the VVSC to file for well deserved benefits. After some consideration, I went in because I thought my original rating was erroneous. Mike and Dan helped me get my claim submitted the same day. While they made it seem easy, it was a daunting task for me that I probably would not have been able to do without them. 
Valley Veterans Service Center	320581		/users/profile/380865	Tim_77	General Member of the Public	5	12/28/2016	The VVSC and the Ravalli County Veteran Service Officers Mike Warner and Dan Griffin is leading the way into the 21st century with their technological advances in veteran claim processing. Their system is probably 90% digital and paperless. They have shown great initiative and intuition by partnering with the Missoula Ravalli Transportation Association to provide services to veterans where they live and get them to the services they need. The use of VA Work Study college students and Trapper Creek Job Corps students for no-cost administrative assistance while giving the students opportunities to gain work experience is a win-win. The office staff and board of directors has also built strong relationships with the Bitterroot Job Service, Bitterroot College, Sapphire Community Clinic and several local service organizations. The VVSC is truly a leader in community based veteran services.
Valley Veterans Service Center	34282	4	/users/profile/35103	mrg	Board Member	5	03/31/2010	I was very honored to be invited on the board for the Valley Veterans Service Center.  I have sat on other boards over the years and have never participated in a more well run, efficient, genuine non-profit.  As a veteran myself, I know how daunting dealing with the VA can be.  Our organization helps veterans navigate the system and obtain much needed and deserved benefits.  I am continually amazed by how effective Rob Embree, our one staff member, is in providing assistance to so many veterans in Ravalli County.  I've never seen an organization as small as ours provide so much benefit to so many in such a cost effective manner.  I'm proud to support this organization.
Valley Veterans Service Center	34122	8	/users/profile/34942	chris12	Donor	5	03/29/2010	I have the watched the Valley Veterans Service Center in Hamilton, MT, grow from the idea of a few local vets who wanted to help their fellow veterans in 2006 to a vital local service organization in 2010 with a state and even national reputation for quickly, compassionately and effectively serving veterans who need help of any kind -- from  groceries, shelter, or counseling to assistance in accessing much-deserved VA benefits they had, in many cases, hesitated to file or given up on ever receiving. Since its opening in 2006, this rural center in Ravalli County MT, has assisted an average of 9 vets per day five days a week. A few years ago former VA Secretary Peak honored the VVA by naming it a national frontier test site for a evaluating the effectiveness of teleconference technology in addressing the needs of rural veterans.  Even more important, VVA volunteers and now a certified claims agent on staff -- all veterans themselves who know the frustrations of working with the VA system all too well -- have doggedly pursued and consistently achieved unusually rapid turn-around times on completion of veterans'claims.  This small, committed veterans' service organization has already changed several thousand deserving lives for the better. I am proud to support it.
Valley Veterans Service Center	34103	2	/users/profile/34927	muleman	Client Served	0	03/29/2010	I was recommended to see if the Valley Veterans Service Center could be of help with hearing problems I have. The staff was very helpful and worked with me on filing paperwork and setting me up with a hearing specialist, and working with responses to the government, and helping me thru the process. Rob and Ron did offer much help and guidance, and were always ready to help me or others I met who came in for various reasons. All of this they did for no charge, and just wanted to help. They also do much for vets with more serious problems or those who may need help in finding financial relief or some that don't have a place to stay, or transportation to medical appointments.
Valley Veterans Service Center	34100	2	/users/profile/34925	ron3	Volunteer	5	03/29/2010	This org is a nonprofit that uses all their donations for VETERANS services and service is the name of the game. They will go to bat with any veteran for his benefits he/she has coming. They will go all the way to Washington to assist and never quit no matter how though it gets. They are the REAL DEAL for veterans. Veterans helping Veterans. I can never give them enough credit.
Valley Veterans Service Center	34097	2	/users/profile/34922	mtvet	Board Member	5	03/29/2010	The Valley Veterans Service Center is a one stop office for all veterans needs. The office has one full time employe, Rob Embree who is a Veterans Claims Agent. Through donations from the local communityu and small grants, the Valleyu Veterans Service Center has helped hundreds of veterans file successful claims with the VA. The office also assisted veterans in obtaining counseling for veterans with PTSD, medical assistance, death benefits for families of veterans, educations benefits and housing.
Glacier National Park Conservancy	98474		/users/profile/116946	sthorne	Donor	5	09/28/2011	Because of the on-going decline in federal dollars, Glacier National Park would be in a world of hurt without the efforts of the Glacier Park Fund to raise money, awareness, and support.  The GNP is well managed, provides creative mechanisms through which donors can contribute, and tirelessly promotes the beauty and wonder of Glacier Park.  The staff is competent and friendly whether it be leading a hike, creating accessible trails, supporting publications about Glacier, and collaborating with the Park Superintendent.  We have been visiting Glacier Park since the 1950s and are grateful for the presence of the Glacier Park Fund to preserve this wonderful place for the future.
Glacier National Park Conservancy	98246		/users/profile/116663	Geri L.	Donor	5	09/27/2011	Glacier National Park fund is staffed by extrodinary people who are passionate about the park and the people who enjoy it.  They are dedicated to funding projects that will preserve and protect the heritage and natural wonders of the park as well as projects that will enhance the visitors experience.  They are a hands on organization based just outside the west entrance of the park.  Many times one of thier staff members, or the director Jane, have taken the time to shuttle us as we've begun many of our journeys in the park.  I was honored to work on the Centennial Campaign dedicated to raising funds for special projects in honor of Glacier's 100 years.  I had no problem ensuring prospective donors that their dollars would be spent where they were designated or if requested, for the area with the greatest need.  A great organization!
Glacier National Park Conservancy	98222		/users/profile/116635	John234	Board Member	5	09/27/2011	The Fund does a great job of helping local schools and their teachers to get to the park for a variety of educational programs.  Other GNPF funding helps a number of NPS programs at Glacier.  It is one of the best ways to get public donations to where they will do the most good.
Glacier National Park Conservancy	98219		/users/profile/116632	Jenny C	Volunteer	5	09/27/2011	Through my time as a volunteer with Glacier's Citizen Science program my appreciation of GNPF has grown and grown. In addition I look at the park's webcams every day and am so very thankful for their support of that undertaking. This organization is certainly making a difference in the park and in the surrounding communities.
Glacier National Park Conservancy	56509		/users/profile/59035	Wendy Ross	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/08/2010	The Glacier National Park Fund (GNPF) uses an annual unrestricted fund source to fund important projects within Glacier National Park. Park staff submit proposals in one of four categories: preserve, research, discover, and celebrate. The GNPF is able to make possible projects that would otherwise not be funded by National Park Service funding calls or other funding sources. In 2011, the projects in the Discover category funded by this source are: Winter Ecology School Program, Reconnecting Children With Nature, Workhouse Native American Teacher Guide, and Two-Medicine/Many Glacier Valley E-Tours. The projects in the Research category that were funded include: Bat Inventory and Monitoring, Crown of the Continent Virtual Learning Center, Packrate Midden Research, and Expand the Citizen Science Volunteer program. Projects in the Preserve category funded in 2011 are: Bear Proof Garbage Cans for Private Landowners and Park Neighbors, Hidden Lake Overlook Rebuild, Rising Sun Picnic Trail Accessibility Upgrade, and Campground Storage Boxes. 
Glacier National Park Conservancy	54331		/users/profile/55598	kchicker	Board Member	5	10/02/2010	My husband and I recently attended Fall for Glacier, a GNPF fundraising weekend event at Many Glacier Lodge.  On the hikes to Iceberg Lake and Grinnell Glacier we had the opportunity to visit and learn from Grizzly bear expert Kate Kendall, research ecologist and climate change expert, Dan Fagre, and the Parks Chief of Science and Resource Management, Jack Potter.  We listened to Chip Davis (Manheim Steamroller) new, moving composition honoring the Centennial year of Glacier National Park, and viewed Doug McMains new film about Glacier, Walk in the Clouds.  And at the Cowboy Ball live auction, we had fun with the bidding on 5 plein air artists impressive paintings, created on sight over the weekend in Many Glacier.  Best of all, we spent the weekend in this historic hotel and magnificent valley making new friendships with invigorating folks from all over the country who share our passion for the Park.  The Fund orchestrated a packed weekend that accomplished so much: successful fundraising, breathtaking hiking and horseback riding in this falls first snow, the formation of new friends of the Fund, a wonderful venue for Park artists and scientists alike.
Glacier National Park Conservancy	53997		/users/profile/55167	jami1	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/29/2010	Glacier National Parks Citizen Science Program engages members of the general public to assist in gathering biological research data.  The program, now in its sixth year, is supported by the Glacier National Park Fund, and fosters stewardship while providing critical baseline information on Common Loons, mountain goats, pikas, and invasive plants.  Citizen scientists in Glacier National Park provide a wealth of data which is used to obtain much-needed baseline information and to increase our understanding of our natural resources.  In 2010  we had 178 citizen scientists were active our wildlife and plant monitoring programs, who contributed over 5,600 hours of survey effort.  This volunteer effort is equivalent to 8 employees working full time between May and September.Citizen science is a term that describes scientific programs and projects in which volunteerssome with no prior scientific trainingperform research-related tasks. Citizen science allows citizens to contribute to accomplishing research objectives that might otherwise be financially unfeasible while promoting public involvement with research and science.
Glacier National Park Conservancy	53986		/users/profile/55157	suec	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/29/2010	Thanks to funding from the Glacier Fund, my Freshman Earth Science Class from Flathead High School took 2 field trips to Glacier National Park this past winter and spring. This was a culmination of the things learned during the year and a chance to observe the differences in the seasons.  Our school is under stringent budget guidelines this year and there is little money available for field trips.  What money is available usually goes to classes for the upperclassman courses.  Only with funding for transportation were these field trips possible.  Prior to these field trips,some of these students had never visited Glacier National Park!  As freshman, it is necessary to "hook" them into the outdoors early or they may never develop that interest in the natural world.  There were many "aha" moments during our field trips and it was exciting to see the growth in knowledge of students.
Camp Patriot Corp	294554	1	/users/profile/385296	Sacam  alert	General Member of the Public	1	07/02/2016	This is a scam do not donate to this. From what we have heard this organization which has a great idea went south rather quickly. Fundraisers are still being held in Washington with thousands of dollars being funneled into Montana under the guise of "helping veterans". In reality the land that was purchased with the millions of donated dollars is being used as some crazy prepper compound. A few folks who have actually gone through the program have mixed feelings about it. Early on not so bad but the later vets say it's a joke. Last I heard the fundraising that purchased this ranch have basically been spent funding the owners own dream of owning land in Montana. Now he lives off the donations. Read the other reviews for yourself. The owner continues to hit up Washington and ask for money removing funds for legitimate charities who are actually doing something in the local community for local veterans. So if you want your money being funneled into a prepped compound that barley does anything for veterans this is the right place for you.

Camp Patriot Corp	262841	1	/users/profile/351542	Pissedyaaker	General Member of the Public	1	10/10/2015	Hey!! Wanna give your money away to a group of preppers who are building a compound based on donations supposedly for veterans!!  Then feel free to get scammed and give your money to this group.  They purchased  a million dollar property in NW Montana but haven't had one single veteran through in the year that they have owned it.  Yeah, they take a few veterans out once every few months in Washington but they do just the bare minimum to make it look legal.  This is a prepper compound being funded on the backs of donations for supposed injured combat veterans. This organization is worthless and shameful.  Don't give money to this outfit.

Camp Patriot Corp	142180	2	/users/profile/188625	E3Sovereign	Volunteer	5	11/23/2012	Camp Patriot is my favorite non-profit in the country.  These people know how to change lives for the better.  I've worked for a couple of years with Camp Patriot, through many outings and adventures and every single one of the outings was first class in regards to priority of the actual Vets/Heros.  I have seen lives changed and smiles returned because of Camp Patriot.  Every dollar donated to Camp Patriot is put to good use (for the vets).  The administrators of Camp Patriot are first-class people with great intentions...and they get the job done.  I look forward to many more life-changing outings with this awesome group of patriots.

Compassion Tanzania	93372		/users/profile/107352	Linda	Board Member	5	07/04/2011	As a board member of Compssion Tanzania, striving to provide clean water and health education for the African people of Tanzania.  I have not personally  gone to Tanzania with our group to oversee the drilling of wells but it definitely is in my plans for the future.  The people in or organization are passionate aboiut this project and each year we strive to drill more and more well for the health of the African people.  I am honored to be a part of this Organization and will continue to strive to raise fund for this great project.
Compassion Tanzania	93246		/users/profile/107061	Joanie	Volunteer	5	07/01/2011	Compassion Tanzania has drilled 11 wells in Northern Tanzania in the past three years.  This has brought clean water to the Villages and cuts the mortality rate by 50 % in these villages.  The children can go to school and bring clean water home with them instead of hauling dirty water from mudholes, that they share with the animals.  This dirty water is the cause of most of the sickness in these villages.  None of the money donated to Compassion Tanzania for wells is used for administrative costs.   The people that go to Tanzania to oversee the drilling of the wells pay their own airfare and other expenses.  There is no place you can get more 'Bang for your Buck" then to donate to Compassion Tanzania.  
Compassion Tanzania	93082		/users/profile/106866	Pastor Jeff	Donor	5	06/30/2011	Compassion Tanzania is a boots-on-the-ground organization that really does the job of getting water to villages in N. Tanzania.  As a church, we have, and will continue to donate to this charity, in which almost all of the monies goes into well drilling, placement and the needs of orphans and widows in the communities.  Last year, our church was able to provide the funding for the water for an entire village... it turned out that for about $4.00 (the price of a latte) we were able to supply clean drinking water for an indivudual for life!Compassion Tanzania is very well organized, hands on, and one of the very best locations for donated funding. 
Compassion Tanzania	92895		/users/profile/106638	Merideth	Donor	5	06/29/2011	I traveled to Tanzania as a donor sponsor of two well with Compasion Tanzania in September 2010.  The application and approval process for building the wells results in a functioning water board in each village.  Local contacts maintained by Compassion Tanzania help them keep in touch with the local situation and developments.  I met the drillers and contractors and witnessed the invoice detail first hand.  The money raised to build wells by Compassion Tanania goes directly to the local driller doing the work.  This is no in between, and Compassion Tanzania uses all of the money raised to fund the well building.
Compassion Tanzania	92229		/users/profile/105714	dvdltng	Volunteer	5	06/27/2011	Compassion Tanzania is an organization with a simple purpose; to save the lives of some of the poorest people on Earth with clean drinking water and basic hygiene and sanitation education. They accomplish this by raising funds here at home, then partnering with the individual villages in Tanzania to see the wells drilled, fenced, maintained, and free for anyone to use along with providing basic education about water borne illness, carried by most of the ground water sources in the area, and easily preventable disease pathways that spread germs and illness among the people and kill many each year. Compassion Tanzania does this work with great integrity to assure that every dollar given and every dollar raised by volunteers goes directly to accomplish this work. No money is spent on administrative fees, or salaries, or travel expenses, or for any other purpose not related to getting clean water out of the ground and teaching people how to maximize the benefits of having a safe water source. I have personally worked with Compassion Tanzania for over two years now both in raising the funds and travelling to Tanzania to see a well drilled and help teach a basic hygiene and sanitation course. They are a wonderful and fun group of people to work with and are absolutely focused on seeing their goals accomplished.
Compassion Tanzania	92136	1	/users/profile/105590	bokeyo	Board Member	5	06/26/2011	I was taken back when I first heard about Compassion Tanzania and their mission to provide clean water to remote villages in Northern Tanzania. I was shocked Tanzanians are suffering because they dont have clean water, something I waste every day. The news motivated me to help and serve where I could. 
Compassion Tanzania	91949	1	/users/profile/105337	stephencharris	Donor	5	06/24/2011	We have been involved with Compassion Tanzania for several years and our little country church here in Central Virginia has been blessed to contribute two deep wells with related equipment to two villages in Tanzania.  I have personally known John Henry Cook who heads up this organization for better than 30 years and I can testify to his impeccable character and desire to follow God's will for his life.  One young lady from our church went on a mission trip with Compassion Tanzania last September and was extremely impressed with the people there and Compassion Tanzania's tangible help in providing a ready source of clean drinking water to the villages there.   I can hardly think of any other way that so many deserving people can be helped but through the ministry of this well run organization.   It is astounding in this day and age that 100% of the money given for wells actually goes to that program without any deduction for administrative or travel expenses.  I think it is also noteworthy that the people who may be helped the most are the women and girls who would otherwise be traveling long distances each day for unclean water for their families. 
United in Light, Inc.	108085		/users/profile/147090	Jeriwid9,	Volunteer	5	03/20/2012	My husband and I have been going to see Dr. Deb and her horses at United in Light for almost two years now.   We are constantly amazed and delighted by the experiences we have each time we travel to Livingston to visit her and "our" horses.   Dr. Deb takes draft horses that have been abused or tossed away like garbage and loves them back to health.  She not only provides a safe home for them but she allows us all to be a part of the healing.   I wont go into all of the abuse and horror these gentle giants have seen but now they are treasured and loved.  We are honored to be able to spend a little time with them just to love them and talk to them.   To be a very small part of this is a miracle.   I have actually gotten emotional writing this!!  It means that much!!      Jeri and Ralph
United in Light, Inc.	201258		/users/profile/51058	marilyn-4-u	Donor	5	05/29/2014	Dr. Deborah Derr has passionately dedicated her life to rescuing and providing a forever home to neglected, abused, and about to be slaughtered draft horses, the wonderful gentle giants of our universe.  Her continued deep love and healing abilities has been witnessed by me since she first established her sanctuary in Chino Valley, AZ.  Moving the Sanctuary to Montana over six years ago has enabled her to enlarge her efforts and save even more of these deserving animals.  I have personally witnessed and been involved with her work, knowing the inside story of her rescues and ongoing care.  If I could, I would give her even more than five stars I have!
United in Light, Inc.	153236		/users/profile/178877	Amarilla	General Member of the Public	5	04/07/2013	I came to visit Livingston, MT almost six years ago now.  You can't go around town without someone knowing about Deb's hard work and love for those gentle giants at United in Light. Most of them come from bad, if not horrific, situations. With Deb's care and her healing hands they receive the care they need to make them whole.  These horses make 180 degree turn arounds, from scared and hesitant to let others touch them, to eager beavers when visitors come to visit. Amazing!
United in Light, Inc.	108141		/users/profile/147167	WillowNow	General Member of the Public	5	03/21/2012	If you want to meet someone who passionately devotes herself to her cause, meet Deb Derr. She truly walks her talk...and what a talk it is! The story of how she came to found United in Light is amazing in and of itself....and then you get to meet her "gentle giants" and you know her efforts are all worth while. Please, if you are ever within a hundred miles of Livingston MT DO make the time to visit her sanctuary. You will come away refreshed and amazed.
United in Light, Inc.	108082	1	/users/profile/147087	Sam_2	Volunteer	5	03/20/2012	United in Light is a wonderful home for older draft horses to go live out the rest of their days in peace and serenity.  Dr. Deborah Derr takes fantastic care of every animal at the Rescue, and is so welcoming to volunteers.  I spent six weeks with her and her gentle giants last summer, and I would love to do it again.  Deb works so hard to raise funds to provide these horses with everything they need, and to allow her to reach out and rescue more horses in the future.  Just this winter she raised the money to build a new, wind-proof shelter for the horses when the wind walls that had so faithfully withstood the powerful Livingston winds lost the battle and fell.  And she accomplished it in time to get the shelter built before the hard snows hit!  United in Light is the nation's only 501(c)(3) organization that offers a retirement home for older draft horses, and the cause is so important!  These horses have worked their whole lives, unable to just be horses.  Here, they finally get the chance to do just that: be horses.  It's such a life-changing experience working with Deb and the horses.  I hope I get the chance to do it again soon!

Pet Paw-See Inc	309751		/users/profile/401107	Jessica304	Client Served	1	10/11/2016	I start maternity leave in a couple weeks, I found an animal I feel in love with on there adoption list and sent them an email about it. Apparently they looked around my facebook (not sure how they found me but) they said they wouldn't adopt out to me for the sole reason that I am pregnant. Having a good place to raise an animal/nice house/yard and stable income to care for the animal meant nothing.

Pet Paw-See Inc	235398	3	/users/profile/318938	trailmix3r	Client Served	1	12/12/2014	Tried to adopt from them multiple times. Each time no one called me back or returned my calls about applications I turned in. It would have been nice to atleast tell me I can't adopt for whatever reason. I talked to them a few weekends ago when they were at petco and the 2 ladies I talked to did not answer my questions. They basically gave me a business card and "sent me on my way" I have heard multiple stories of the volunteers talking bad about adopters and past volunteers. Will not attempt to adopt from them again!!!
Pet Paw-See Inc	234362	3	/users/profile/298519	Outdoorfinatic	General Member of the Public	1	11/24/2014	I have known the pet paw see a couple of years, they seem to be a great rescue group on the outside, but they do like to talk bad about some people whether a person who put in an application or someone that had helped out in the past.   They seem so sincere at the adoptions but they treat some people badly. I have known people that have volunteered and they treat them differently from other volunteers.  Why?  Well I would just ask the top person /people who run it because as far as I know they never told these people why they are treated differently/never had a sincere nice conversation with them, definitely a 380 from how they treat the public and put their show faces on.  They practice and teache humane ways to treat animals and talk to kids in schools, well pet paw see why don't you try practicing being nicer to some of your volunteers and treat them the way they should be.  I  know a disabled person who used to volunteer who was treated badly because of this persons disabilities, well pet paw see why do you treat disabled like they are different than the rest of us, why do you have a bad stigma on them.  I  think pet paw see has some explaining to do. 
Pet Paw-See Inc	209001		/users/profile/234898	gadabouttrue	Donor	5	08/06/2014	No weekend goes by without Pet Paw-see's volunteers having an adoption event for the many cats and kittens -- and sometimes a dog or two -- that need homes. I've seen them go the extra mile in rescuing and providing veterinary care for injured animals, with good results. They make consistently fine presentations that attract the public, and they never fail to thank their supporters.
Pet Paw-See Inc	204624		/users/profile/265958	Brenda58	General Member of the Public	5	06/29/2014	I first became acquainted with this organization a number of years ago. Lesley Raynes is the operator of this rescue that includes volunteers that all take animals home with them until they can find good homes for them. The animals are vetted and  cared for. They help get pets fixed when people can not afford to do it. Pet Pawsee helped me to get two of my cats fixed. I was so appreciative of their help.They are a very good non profit that cares deeply for the animals around them. They also have an adoption fair at the local Petco Store which helps place a number of homeless cats and dogs.
Their Last Best Place	290751		/users/profile/381086	Writer	Board Member	5	05/23/2016	My name is Gilles and I have been friends with Barb since 1993.  When she had been in Montana for a couple years, after leaving Homeland Security, she founded her nonprofit.  When she was in North Carolina, she was doing the same thing with animals.  I drove her to the nonprofit Golden Retriever rescue who had reached out to Barb about a golden that they could not control.  She and I drove the dog to her farm, and that dog became a perfect picture of grace and control, and love.  You know, the golden with 5 tennis balls in the mouth.  I don't know how she did it in such a short time, but she did, and when she moved for a job, this dog went with her.  I saw her rehabilitate hurt wildlife on her farm, and release them back out to her 70 acre place.  What a fabulous individual.  Anyone should put their trust in her, and donate as much as you can as often as you can.
Their Last Best Place	290596		/users/profile/380971	Steph Q.	Client Served	5	05/23/2016	I had tried all that I could with my adopted pooch - intensive training, one-on-one care, even leaving my job to pay more attention to him... After he bit my mom, friend and went after my grandpa, it was time. I posted an ad on Craigslist that explained everything - his aggression but also the personality I knew was there. Ignorant people responded, looking for a family dog. Barb responded like a ray of hope in this sea of ignorance. We met the next weekend and I introduced her to Griffin. (I'm tearing up as I write this because I miss that dog so much and feel so bad that I couldn't provide more for him.)  After meeting her and seeing how well she interacted with Griffin, I knew it was the best thing for him. I took him home with me and thought it through. I brought him back to Barb a week or two later. She takes such amazing care of him and I can't even think about what would have happened to him if Barb hadn't reached out to me. I visited Griffin several weeks later and he was in a much better place. It was hard to see him not with me but I had to stop being selfish and know that he was in a better place. The shelters I reached out to said they would have to put Griffin down. Barb knew he had potential and a heart. I am forever grateful for her and Their Last Best Place. I think about Griffin daily and know he's in a better place. 
Their Last Best Place	289358	1	/users/profile/379597	Lisa543	Volunteer	5	05/10/2016	I was blessed to be able to work for Barb during the summer.  All the dogs are loved and cared for. This is not your typical animal shelter.   Barb *knows* each individual dog's needs, temperament,schedules and behavioral patterns by heart. It amazed me!  No dog was ever neglected or isolated or ignored.  I was with her when a young woman sadly surrendered her dog due to behavioral issues.  Barb worked with this dog and was able to rehabilitate it! Not all dogs are able to be rehabilitated - some of her dogs have special needs that make it undesirable for adoption, such as the blind ones.   She makes the dog food from scratch and all these dogs thrive in her care!  I'm in Phoenix now, but she has made a lasting impression on me.

She took this dog, worked with her, and adopted her out to a lady who could continue working with her. In our book, Barb is really in tune with every animal she takes in.  They do not feel the kennel atmosphere, but a homey atmosphere.  Please check her on facebook and donate.

She has taken care of him for 7 years, and he is happy and healthy.  I am so pleased with her powers of rehabilitation I cannot explain it.  She even takes Cesar's methods farther to teach dogs how to get along in a house, and with other dogs.  Also how not to bark and worry about anything but eating and having fun outdoors.
Alberta Bair Theater Corporation	61897		/users/profile/67640	Kmendis	General Member of the Public	5	01/31/2011	I know it sounds clich, but 2011 truly did start off with a bang. Several of them in fact in the form of shootings in Tucson, AZ. As Americans we were all so saddened by these events words were inadequate in capturing our collective feelings of grief. For me however, a kind of miracle occurred. It just so happened that I had been invited to attend a concert at the Alberta Bair Theater just one week later on January 14th. This concert was the magical pairing of Christopher OReiley and Matt Haimovitz.The reason I use the term magical is not just because these two angels of their instruments, the piano and cello, respectively, brought music to the composers music to life in ways that I believe even they never knew was possible but they didnt it without even having met one another until three days prior to their performance together. Their magic was also evidenced in their ability to inhabit the visions of an eclectic group of composers that spanned Bach to Radiohead, and they did it with such perfect precision that the audience was brought to their feet several times. We were ecstatic, enthralled, and amazed. Tears were shed, hands ached from being clapped so much, even the very air seemed sweeter.As a native New Yorker, the Alberta Bair Theater has offered me 15 years of quality enjoyment, relief from stress, and pleasure. Lately, however, the ABT has surpassed itself in providing an escape from some of the harshness of life that only live performance can. It reminds us of what unadulterated human talent and hard work is like in real life and in real time face to face with real people. Thank you ABT, for the joy you bring to Billings and to me.

I have been pleasantly surprised by the quality of the productions and the level of entertainmment the the ABT provides our community. I have attended a Celtic Christmas with Michael Londra, one of the best shows of this kind I have attended. I also attended Lewis Black, one of the premier comedians in entertainment available. The pleasantness of the theatre, and staff enhanced the entertainment experience. Each of these entertainers, interacted well with the audience, personalized the experience and made the effort to ensure that the audience got the value for their money.

Alberta Bair Theater Corporation	60523		/users/profile/65850	kristenpcole	Volunteer	5	01/20/2011	Last summer I interned at the Alberta Bair Theater in the marketing department. As a sophomore in college, this experience benefited me in ways I couldn't have imagined. Because the Alberta Bair is a small organization, I was given responsibilities that wouldn't have been possible at a large company and actually felt like I made a difference. What I also love about the Alberta Bair Theater is that they bring something different to Billings. While Montana has plenty of bars, casinos, and fast food chains, what we really lack is sophisticated entertainment and I think the Alberta Bair does a great job of providing that. The theater makes sure to bring classic Broadway plays to middle-of-nowhere Montana and I think they are doing a great job. However, I do think they need to do a better job of reaching out to a younger generation. That said, in the past few years the executive director has done an excellent job bring more popular acts to the theater (such as country musicians) that appeal to a wider excellence. The theater also does an excellent job incorporating school groups with matinees and theater tours. One of my favorite childhood memories was taking a field trip downtown to see Where the Red Fern Grows. However, at the end of the day what left the biggest impression on me was the people.  They obviously love what they do and I've never met such a friendly, helpful, fun group of people in my entire life. 
Alberta Bair Theater Corporation	60406		/users/profile/65674	Jolson	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/19/2011	The ABT breathes cultural life into Billings.  It actually brings international entertainment to south central Montana. Evey year amazing Broadway plays, classical performers, international dance companies, and major headliners light up the stage.  The theater is also a community partner, providing a venue for symphony, opera, dance, community performers and more. Finally, nothing can match the excitment on the faces of the school children who attend performances at the theater each year. Billings would be missing its cultural heart if the theater were not here.
Greater Yellowstone Coalition	190855		/users/profile/248935	mostlymike	Donor	4	12/16/2013	I was a founder of the GYC, and here writing under a pseudonym. So I have been a member of the GYC since the early 1980s when we established it. It was first the Greater Yellowstone Alliance. A place like the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem) that sprawls into 3 states and many jurisdictions needs an overarching organization.  The GYC has done a good job conserving the environmental and scenic resources of the GYE.  Over time the organization has had its great moments and some that were less. Some staff now have been with them from the start, and are retiring.  When I was on their Board of Directors, I noticed the caution with which they approached things and how well they secured the financial status of the group. They also paid the executive director a lot for an organization like this, but compared, of course, to corporate CEOs even back in the day, it was a token. I do not know about the Board's demeanor today.  I have just scant experience with their Board today.
Greater Yellowstone Coalition	124183		/users/profile/169000	Chris Naumann	Board Member	5	10/02/2012	As a board member who was instrumental in helping the Greater Yellowstone Coalition purchase and renovate the new building, I am extremely pleased with the results in particular the fiscal benefits our headquarters will perpetually yield for our conservation programs. The GYC board and staff began thinking about purchasing a building when the real estate market in Bozeman was spiraling upward.  Our rented offices sold twice during our tenure and correspondingly our rent increased substantially.  Our Board of Directors concluded that owning our offices was a prudent fiduciary move that would provide long-term fiscal stability to the organization.  After 30 years as the leading conservation organization in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, GYC now has a permanent home that speaks to and financially supports our conservation values. Every dollar of money invested into our building project was raised separately from our annual conservation and operational fundraising efforts. At no point during the building project did GYC curtail our programmatic work.  In fact, during the two years of renovation work on the building--which coincided with the brunt of the national economic downturn--GYC maintained or increased its commitment to our wide variety of conservation programs in and around Yellowstone National Park. Immediately upon occupancy of the new building, GYC began saving operational money. Within the next two years, we will realize approximately $75,000 in annual savings--money saved over paying rent and lower energy expenses due to the L.E.E.D. certified building's solar thermal water and PV electric systems. All of the savings gained from the new building will be directly reinvested in our critical conservation work. The new building is not only the organization's permanent home, but it also strengthens GYC's position to continue building for the future of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.

I agreed to and was honored to join the GYC board after recognizing the deep commitment and success of the organization in protecting the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, its natural functioning, and its threatened animals. I also recognized the professionalism of the Board and the high degree to which the Board considers scientific evidence to guide their conservation decisions. GYC seeks cooperation and coordination first, but fights if necessary to protect the ecosystem. It is an excellent organization.

They know what they are doing.  They choose important campaigns and they win.  If GYC hadn't been defending Greater Yellowstone for the last 30 years, the Ecosystem would be a much diminished place.
Greater Yellowstone Coalition	106310	1	/users/profile/143301	UsFromMT	Donor	1	02/12/2012	Greater Yellowstone Coalition has wasted millions of dollars of donor money on building themselves excessively expensive facilities at $278.00 per sq ft (their published figure, see Bozeman Chronicle article) and then leasing a solar system that will further waste donor money.  These kinds of self serving actions from GYC makes it clear their managements direction is not in the best interest of the agenda they sell to their donors.

Afterwards the instructor came up to me and set up a goal program to get Owen involved. After one full month session she had my son HOOKED. Attended this fall session this year. He is still hooked and now going to try the SKI program in the spring. He is so excited to be able to do what other kids do.  I am new to the handicap community here and so encourage families to get involved and support such an amazing program. 
Eagle Mount Billings	177797		/users/profile/234381	KatML26	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/15/2013	I got involved with Eagle Mount Billings in the summer of 2005 as a college intern studying Human Services. I was required to complete 125 hours which I volunteered for Day camp program. Through that experience, I completed my hours that summer but asked to stay on as a volunteer for all of summer day camp. I loved working 1:1 with the participants in the program to provide a educational, fun and safe environment. I also witnessed the Biking and Golf programs that summer. Watching their expressions of joy and excitement for the program to start as well as hitting the golf club or visiting with their friends are invaluable and memories I have of Eagle Mount Billings. I stayed on as staff for two more summers and in fall of 2007, I took on the role of Arts & Crafts Director. I'm currently the director and enjoy planning activities that the participants will enjoy to share their works of art. They love socializing and just having fun with a group of friends. Eagle Mount Billings provides so much more then recreational opportunities. They provide hope, courage, success, joy, laughter, and friendships that last for a lifetime. Volunteer, participate, donate or just attend a program for one time to see how much it means to the participants will really change your attitude in life.

Eagle Mount Billings	175211		/users/profile/231544	Dick11	Client Served	5	10/08/2013	Eagle Mount Billings has given many of the people I serve an opportunity to participate in activities they never could have done without the supports of volunteers.  Two boys in particular come to mind both of them are autistic.  One boy needed respite in the summer while his mother worked and he was for the first time able to access EagleMount Day camp.  He had new and different activities to experience every day.  It was a great experience for him and a very big help to his mother.  The other boy is from out of town and he took part in the day program one day a week while his brother was in town.  Again he didn't have to hang with mom the entire day, had peer involvement and loved his time for just him without the family.  What great opportunities that would not happen without the great staff and planning that goes into every activity that EagleMount plans.  
Eagle Mount Billings	174713		/users/profile/231020	mummaj	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/07/2013	Eight years ago I became the single parent of a very special little angel named Abby!  Abby was six years old and needed a home to call her own.  Her biological parents had tried their hardest to provide for her but were at a point where they could no longer give her the specialized care she required.  You see, Abby, is affected by severe autism and a rather involved seizure disorder.  It took a bit of figuring out in the beginning but soon our little family was running on all cylinders!   Eagle Mount Billings has afforded Abby the opportunity to be who she is...a young woman who wants to enjoy biking, swimming, horseback riding, ski and day camp.  She is not looked at any differently than any other child while she is at Eagle Mount Billings as she has with other programs in the community.  Abby is included in every aspect of the program - for example, while at equestrian not only does she enjoy a 45 minute lesson, she has learned horsemanship skills (grooming, various kinds of tack, etc.), appropriate behavior while around the horses (using an indoor voice, slow movements around the horses, remaining calm, etc.) and an increase in appropriate social skills.   Eagle Mount Billings is much more than just a year-round recreational program for my daughter - it is a program that teaches her life lessons, the importance of friendship, and that it is okay to be who you are even if you see the world differently than others. 
Northern Plains Resource Council	235757		/users/profile/319440	lemire.jeanne	Board Member	5	12/21/2014	Although I have been a member of the Northern Plains Resource Council for over three decades, I have been able to take on some volunteer work for them since I retired three years ago, and last year was invited to join the board as an at-large member.   Since returning to Montana in the late 70's, I have served on a number of boards, ranging from the arts,  the humanities, the media, education, to politics. All these non-profit boards were well-staffed and  attracted like-minded, committed citizens, but never have I served on a board that has been more worth my while.  Both the staff and the members of the board and its various task forces are passionate, pragmatic and effective beyond anything I have ever experienced.  Did I mention utterly selfless?  They do their homework and they follow through.  Everyone contributes and the teamwork is amazing.   I feel my contributions are valued, but I also see great opportunities for learning and for growth, both through the mentoring I have received and through the workshops and training that are on-going. The work we do has been much more than "a feel-good" experience.  It has been challenging, demanding and, sometimes (when we prevail) very rewarding.

As a board member I am privileged to watch the democratic process be alive and well.

Where else could we have such a great platform?
Northern Plains Resource Council	235687		/users/profile/319358	MySGCCReview	Board Member	5	12/19/2014	Billings, Montana is where I graduated from High School.  After military service I came home to Billings and attended EMC.  On one class outing we visited a ranch near a strip mine in southeast Montana.  That outing would influence my career choice and values.  In the 1980s I began supporting the Northern Plains Resource Council (NPRC) and I have tried to maintain my membership since then.  A career and family obligations including college for our children did not leave much free time. Since retiring I have time to do volunteer work. We who choose to live in Montana treasure our states beauty and environmental amenities, and we are stewards of this place we call home.  NPRC and its affiliates serve the public good and for that reason I chose to volunteer with NPRCs Sleeping Giant Citizens Council (SGCC) affiliate.  Since volunteering I have had the opportunity to better understand how NPRC achieves its mission and goals.  NPRC (and affiliates) has a professional staff that responsibly manages its operations and finances. The staffs good work allows members and volunteers to support and pursue those common goals about which we are passionate.  It is a rewarding experience to collaborate with others to steward the land, water and air resources we inherited so that they can be shared with future generations. Michael LeeHelena, MontanaSleeping Giant Citizens Council Board Member

Having moved to Red Lodge expecting clean air and water and wilderness at my door step, protecting these natural resources has been my passion and mission which exactly aligns with NPRC's mission. We are all conservationists by nature, and this non-profit is run with maximum streamlined efficiency.  Montana is a big state and there are many miles our staff and members need to drive to organize citizens for good causes and spending it on the safety of our members has been our main focus.  We are exploring the technology available to conduct meetings and trainings online. Things get done with NPRC and volunteer citizens are the ones who gain from this wonderful association.
Northern Plains Resource Council	151226		/users/profile/201829	Lana Sangmeister	Board Member	5	03/18/2013	As a Montana native, Ive been enjoying Montanas natural beauty and bounty all my life.  As Ive enjoyed all that nature has to offer here, Ive strived to be a good steward by working to preserve the quality of our land, water and air for my children and grandchildren to enjoy, as I have enjoyed.  The organization that best helps me to do this is Northern Plains Resource Council.   Its mission and values are totally in-sync with mine own.   I learned about Northern Plains Resource Council (NPRC) through a local state affiliate, Stillwater Protective Association (SPA).   For over 40 years,  NPRC has been helping Montanans help themselves.  For my local affiliate, it worked tirelessly with us and another affiliate to hammer out a ground breaking Good Neighbor Agreement with Stillwater Mining Company.  This agreement is legally binding and has proven the test of time for over 10 years now in ensuring the quality of our rural environment. I personally have been volunteering my time and energy to this organization for 6 years now and have experienced its highly competent and effective staffs support in helping members achieve results on many fronts, including leading the charge in trying to ensure big coal, gas and oil companies do it right in our backyards, that our state agencies follow and enforce their rules and policies, and that farmers and ranchers get a fair shake whenever Eminent Domain is invoked, to name a few goals. This is also an organization that takes the time to define its mission, set goals and develop on-going 5 year plans.  In one of these plans, it set a goal to own its own building.  Wow, was this ever achieved  talk about walking the talk!  Today we have Home of the Range (HOTR).   To achieve this goal, NPRC purchased an uninsulated, old concrete block grocery store with few windows.  The building was renovated to house energy-efficient, daylit offices and along the way earned an Energy Star Certified and U.S. Green Building Council LEED-NC, v.2/v.2.1Level of Platinum!  What a tremendous accomplishment and one we are all very proud of achieving.   It is important to me to be involved with an organization with integrity, and one that is achieving results and growing its membership.  Northern Plains Resource Council is the real deal! Lana SangmeisterNPRC Board MemberSPA Member
Blue Mountain Clinic Inc	128796		/users/profile/174040	lgwenette	Client Served	5	10/25/2012	We take our children to Blue Mountain Clinic because they are friendly.  They provide high quality health care.  Their fees are appropriate.  But most importantly, they try to create a positive, friendly atmosphere that feels like a true family practice.  The pediatricians we tried in Missoula were too clinical.  At BMC, the staff focuses on the whole child and the whole family.  And they remind us of what we are doing well as parents.  That is pretty awesome.

Plus lots of excellent care from my MD doc (who's actually an OD doc.) It's a great clinic!

Kind,  understanding, accepting and provides very good care to myself and  my family, friends. Very comfortable and easy to schedule appointments. Wonderful employees and a stellar Dr.  on staff!

They have my full support and loyalty -- completely reciprocated by them.

They were closely vet checked to make sure there were no unknown problems to me, spayed and updated on shots.  MBR even talked a gentleman out of trying to sell my youngest on craigslist and turning her over to the rescue instead.  Montana Basset Rescue does the very best at helping any abandoned or homeless hound find a new forever home that is a good fir for them.

We have adopted our last two dogs from them and would definitely do it again. These rescued bassets are so loveable and thrilled to find thier forever homes...truly they make the best pets. To the rescues credit, a thorough check is made on the prospective family, in the hopes of insuring a forever home. They truly do want the best for the animal.

They will never turn away an animal and will go to whatever lengths they must in order to do what is best for the dog and help him/her overcome whatever problems they may have. I have been a client served and now am a volunteer and I am always amazed at how hard Leslie works for the animals to make sure they get whatever they need, be it emotional or medical. This Rescue is truly a god-send. The follow up after adoption is truly amazing to make sure that all is well with both the 4 legged and the two legged in the household and that all are adapting well. Any time anyone has ever asked Leslie for help, she goes above and beyond to make sure all are taken care of.
Basset Rescue Of Montana	162062		/users/profile/215026	Marie R.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/04/2013	Basset Rescue of Montana is serious about taking in abused, abandoned, neglected, or owner surrendered Basset Hounds and or Basset mixes. Basset Rescue of Montana takes ownership of these Basset Hounds that are relinquished from previous owners, animal shelters, humane societies, puppy mills, and animal welfare agencies. Basset Rescue of Montana  provides these Basset Hounds with medical care, food, shelter, and safety in foster homes, until they can find them permanent loving homes.Basset Rescue of Montana evaluates the temperament of each dog that comes into their care.  If any hound displays a temperament that is unacceptable, they will rehabilitate the dog in order to prepare it for a successful adoption.Basset Rescue of Montana seeks prospective adopters by advertising on their webpage; word of mouth; at public events; and on Petfinder at PetFinder.com they screen each prospective adopter to determine their preparedness for adopting a Basset Hound. Once an applicant is approved and matched with an appropriate basset hound, Basset Rescue of Montana transfers ownership of the dog to the approved adopter and provides them with continuing support and education throughout the life of the Basset Hound.Basset Rescue of Montana  also provides education to the general public on the basic care, training, characteristics and traits of their canine companions, in particular those of the Basset Hound Breed. They are a group of honest, dedicated, caring volunteers, none of which receives any monetary support from the adoption of the Basset Hounds they serve. The average cost of caring for the vetting needs of a Basset from inception to adoption is around $350.00 so donations are continually needed to keep the rescue operating. If you want to know your money ... all of it ....is going directly to the charity  this is the non profit you want to donate to.
World Museum of Mining Inc	60753		/users/profile/66155	suemazurek	Board Member	5	01/22/2011	The World Museum of Mining is like taking a walk down a live history lesson.  There is so much to explore and experience.  I am amazed at the hard work and dedication the small staff and volunteers do just so all may experience life in a mining town.  Every inch of it is a journey full of lives and stories waiting to unfold.  It has drawn me in since my childhood.  I am proud to serve on the board and have some part in preserving this most unique Museum.
World Museum of Mining Inc	59822		/users/profile/64845	jerjor	Board Member	5	01/11/2011	I used to go to the World Museum of Mining with my parents and always took relatives along whenever they visited.  I still smile as I recall the experiences and  remember the excitement I felt whenever we took the trip "up the hill".  Therefore when I was asked some years ago if I would be interested in joining the board of directors I was thrilled to be able to help preserve this experince for others and improve on an already fantastic historical treasure.  The museum seems to improve every year and with the addition of the underground tour where you actually get to experience what the miners felt as they went down in the mines the museum is unsurpassed for providing a living walk back in time for all who venture in.  I recommend a trip to the museum for anyone visitng Butte and also for anyone who lives in Butte and hasn't been there lately.  There's always something new to discover.  Also, the museum has more than 14,000 photos in the photo archives that are truly incredible to see. The staff and volunteers that manage this collection are extremely dedicated and will make your visit one you will never forget.

The museum employees and volunteers have always really impressed me with their dedication.  It doesn't matter how cramped or chilly the working conditions are, the crew is always there to get their work completed.  And they're always able to wrangle up some help to fix a leaky roof or otherwise compromised outdoor exhibit.  The level of community enthusiasm for the museum is really inspiring.  I would love to see what this dedicated team could achieve with some better funding.

I was off my feet for two months following surgery and was visited by an RN and a nursing student. The CNA was there to help me shower, shop for my groceries and keep my house clean. I couldn't have managed without the services! Having been on the board since 2001, I know how hard we work to gather funding so that we can provide services on a sliding fee sacal to keep even indigent seniors in their homes. Keeping elders in their homes is far more cost effective than housing them in nursing homes. It provides families peace of mind to know their loved one is safe in familiar surroundings. The staff is of the highest caliber and exhibits professionalism and compassion. The work in preventing elder abuse has received national attention with annual conferences to educate those in the community to potential risks to the elderly. This is an organization well worth supporting!
Big Sky Senior Services, Inc. DBA Senior Helping Hands and Prevention of Elder Abuse	130749		/users/profile/176246	ginch	Board Member	5	10/29/2012	Big Sky Senior Services (BSSS) is the umbrella organization for Senior Helping Hands and Prevention of Elder Abuse. At a recent gathering that several of the Senior Helping Hands clients attended one thing was repeated by each one. "I couldn't be at my home without you". But BSSS does more than help with the daily physical needs of our clients. Two years ago Big Sky Senior Services received a grant to establish a community coalition to bring awareness to the issue of elder abuse. There were over 40 business, agencies and other non-profits that attended that organizational meeting...some from several hundred miles away. From that meeting Partnership for Elder Protection (PEP) was formed and has since  put on two conferences targeting elder abuse awareness that were attended by between 150 and 200 each time. The speakers were nationally known experts, State and local governmental agencies, law enforcement, medical and legal experts. The attendees were social workers, senior service providers and general public. The response was tremendous with people thanking us and asking for more information. The conferences have brought about more awareness and coordinated effort state wide to protect our senior population.  One thing that became apparent was the lack of resources for law enforcement departments across our vast state. Smaller communities are in need of education on the issues and they need tools to  prevent and prosecute these crimes. To that end PEP will be presenting a conference next spring targeting the law enforcement and legal staff of cities and counties across the state. Our goal is to tele-communicate this conference to the larger towns across MT so that law enforcement agencies in all areas will have a way to attend. The following day PEP is expecting to host a half day conference for the general public that will be televised to US Bank locations across the state and open to the general public.  This is one more way we at Big Sky Senior Services strive to protect our senior population and assist them in living safely in their own homes.

They accomplish this by providing direct in-home services such as light housekeeping, personal care services, etc.  Many years ago my grandparents received in-home care from this program, so I know first hand how dedicated their staff is and how important it is to have assistance to augment the care that a family can give.   These services become even more critical if no family live in the same city.   My grandparents were able to remain in their own home longer due the assistance of this great agency.  One other very important fact about this organization is that they serve some full pay clients, but a large majority of people that this organization serves are on the lowest economic levels and cannot afford to pay much for services.  Big Sky Senior Services put their heart and soul into their fundraising efforts.  They deserve recognition and support for the wonderful work they do.

My son has autism. He has behavior issues and requires lots of activity in his life. The wonderful staff at Eagle Mount treat him with caring and respect. He is always on his best behavior with them because they make him feel safe and loved. The activities Eagle Mount provides are of the highest quality. The kids and adults always have smiles and lots of fun when they are there. My son participates in their Day Camp every summer, after school activities, monthly teen nights, and their annual PROM!  I appreciate the way the staff welcomes training and resources to educate themselves about autism.  I can offer only praise for and gratitude to Eagle Mount!
Eagle Mount Great Falls	152550		/users/profile/203519	George Y.	Volunteer	5	04/05/2013	My story with Eagle Mount is a long time of reciving and giving. I first started with Eagle Mount and their adaptive skiing program as a participant because I am a paraplegic. The volunteers were giving everything they had to try and teach me this new and very difficult sport. As I was recieving their teachings I became better and better and the program was growing bigger and bigger. After a few years of recieving I recived my very own mono-ski which I still fly down the slopes today. You see all their giving taught me how to become an advanced skiier. I was no longer in need of their teaching. I went skiing to other resorts and still skied at Showdown (the resort Eagle Mount uses) for a few years when I finially realized I was ready to start my giving. This is when Eagle Mount asked me if I would like to be a volunteer with their program. I was more than excited to work with others to help them to become better skiiers and have a great time. The only problem was I couldn't do much physicall work with the participants, but we were noticing they were not quite a scared of the lifts or going down a mountain when I was by their side so we decided my role with Eagle Mount was to be the "Motivatior", a label I was more than happy to be called. I can not thank Eagle Mount enough for all the giving and recieving that I have had in the last 12 years and I can only hope that many more can expeirence what I did. Thank you,George Young
Eagle Mount Great Falls	63113		/users/profile/69003	mebell	Client Served	5	02/03/2011	Eagle Mount is AMAZING! They have a wheelchair accessible playground that is truly accessible. My daughter has been involved in hippotherapy (horse riding therapy) since she was 4 (she is now 9). Watching her build her core strength and begin to communicate with the horse and the volunteers, is a delight to watch. She and I also took part in a mommy-and-me creative movement class that was so much fun, we never thought about how therapeutic it was. Another one of my daughter's favorite activities is skiing. The volunteers who help with the sit-ski are so friendly and thoughtful. Madi is very comfortable with them, and they are conscientious of our family's desire to ski as a family. This summer, we are looking forward to attending a day campy, where my daughter can take part in different activities, and socialize with other kids like her. My family has become a part of the Eagle Mount family. I can't say enough great things about the organization.

Our daughter has been able to ski downhill, play hockey, bowl, ride horses, and attend a day camp during that summer that would accept her.  Amazing people that run it and volunteer for it.  I would recommend this fantastic place to anyone with special needs!  And our daughter is at an age that she thrives being around other people with similar abilities.

Since 1998 she has helped thousands of cats and dogs find new forever homes. She does her adoptions with a lifetime return policy. She has even found a company to give them Free health insurance for the first 30days of their adoption. She receives no funds from the city or county. Operates solely on donations and has dipped into her own funds more than once to keep all these critteres fed and housed until their permanent home come up. She is definately a NO KILL shelter. Our city shelter will not take animals from the county so all those animals come to Help For Homeless Pets as well as city animals that people are afraid would get put down at the city shelter.

Help For Homeless Pets Inc	96433	1	/users/profile/112314	pmharn	Client Served	4	08/23/2011	I have gotten a few cats from Help for Homeless Pets in Billings, Montana. One is a little sassy black long-haired female named Nelly--as in "Whoa, Nelly!" She was about six months old then, and five years later, she still runs faster than any cat. She's very smart and healthy and bosses me and the other cats around all the time, even though she's tiny. A true diva!!!  IN A CITY THE SIZE OF BILLINGS, HELP FOR HOMELESS PETS IS THE ONLY SHELTER TAKING IN CATS. THE REST OF THE GROUPS ARE JUST KILLING THEM, I HEARD. AND HHP DOESN'T HAVE THE DEEP GOVERNMENT POCKETS THAT SOME OF THE OTHER GROUPS DO. Furthermore, they have regularly scheduled spay and neuter days, and the other groups don't. Spay and neuter is key!!! Los Angeles now has a law requiring spay and neuter of all animals, and the killing is way down! Any newborn dogs and cats come from feral populations, where they are now valued and rescued and neutered. There's one other group in this city that collects oodles of cash and has nothing to show for it--no kennel for people to bring the animals to, nothing. Their director looks beautiful all the time, perfect hair, nice house, perfect life. She's been collecting cash for at least ten years now! Help for Homeless Pets volunteers and employees tend to give their lives to the place, like they're truly on a mission. The place has a lot of problems, but at least they try. The other groups just collect cash and turn the animals away. A lot of the issues with the group are due to the fact that the general population of Billings tends to drink too much, gamble too much, and treat their animals like crap. Cats are especially hated in this town. ONE BILLINGS POLICEMAN EVEN BRAGGED IN A LETTER TO THE LOCAL PAPER HOW HE RAN OVER CATS WHENEVER HE COULD. Shouldn't he have been arrested???

The Playhouse brings culture and the arts to our community, with an emphasis on including local youth. They provide an outlet for creativity that would be greatly missed if it were not available.Along with quality shows for audiences to enjoy, they involve community members doing everything from acting on the stage to painting sets to taking tickets and greeting people during the shows.

Upon retirement, I decided to volunteer at the theater. I worked in the box office, served as house manager, did costumes, keep their financial books,  serve on their board and help where needed.  It has been a great opportunity to work with people of all ages and life styles, to see young kids become accomplished actors, to see adults broaden interests,  and to expand my knowledge and understanding of the theater. Our community is truly blessed to have very talented people willing to share their skills at all levels.

Swan View Coalition Inc	190078		/users/profile/248157	alooknac	Donor	5	12/06/2013	This is a low budget organization that accomplishes a lot. Yes, a large chunk of the budget is the director's salary but at a total of less than $35,000 a year that's a bargain. It's not some fat cat drawing six figures. That's $35,000 total including whatever benefits Keith may or may not receive. Just a middling wage in my opinion. The work of Swan View Coalition is research, education, and involvement in forest planning and sometimes lawsuits. That's what the director does. You won't find a volunteer who could afford to donate 2,000 hours each year and put their neck on the line for this cause like Keith does.  Normally I would not give to a charity, either, that spends most of its money on the director's salary. But in this case, donors are pooling their money to pay for an advocate to preserve our natural places and it's money well spent. And it's obvious from their financial statements that it's money frugally spent. 
Swan View Coalition Inc	99000		/users/profile/117976	hardwork	Donor	5	10/05/2011	I donate every year.

Their staff is incredibly smart, dedicated, hard-working, and passionate.  They are very effective at research, communication, advocacy, and action.  They are well-respected even by the big environmental NGOs who frequently partner with them on specific projects.  Montana's environment faces numerous challenges by the extractive industry and industry-funded front groups; if it weren't for MEIC I'm not sure that there would be much hope at all.  I've been giving to them for many years, and expect that I will continue as long as there is need.

I do this for no other organization. I truly believe in  their goal to further renewable resource energy policies that would replace egregious removal of natural carbon based resources.

They are just what their title suggests: a catalyst in bring people together to help minister the most vulnerable and assist the local church in Ukraine and Africa in carrying out their ministry to widows and orphans.  This is one non-profit that exemplifies the word integrity whether it be in handling their finances or in their relationships with others.  The impact their ministry has had and is having is outstanding. God has blessed their labors because of their desire to glorify Him in whatever they do.   
Catalyst For Kids	10387	5	/users/profile/12269	scroller37	Volunteer	5	09/15/2009	I came to learn about Catalyst for Kids through some friends that were involved. I came to see that the work is being done is based on the call of Jesus to care for the needy ( widows, orphans, poor and those who need salvation in Christ Jesus. I was especially interested in the work done to help mentally and physically handicapped children.I have made two trips to Ukraine to serve and be an encouragement to those who are working hard. I was the one who was encouraged when I could see the results first hand. Many are being blessed by individuals who sacrifice so that others can be helped including those with medical needs. The lord is working in amighty way through those willing to be involved and are obedient to the Lord's calling to love and to serve.
Catalyst For Kids	9271	9	/users/profile/11053	jesus4unme	Board Member	5	08/17/2009	Catalyst for Kids (CFK) has provided an excellent way to reach out to others in need.  100% of what I give goes to where I see the need.  CFK is a catalyst for needs in Ukraine and Africa.  Because everyone involved in the US, is a volunteer, there is very little overhead and so many more needs can be met.  I appreciate knowing specific needs for the less fortunate and how I personally can be involved. Thank you for being obedient to God and his commands of caring for the widows and orphans.
American Prairie Reserve	291486	1	/users/profile/381914	Writer	Donor	5	05/31/2016	I love the vision of American Prairie Reserve, and its new membership program makes me feel like I can truly be a part of building the biggest park in the Lower 48  even at just $10 a year. I'm taking my family up there this summer and staying at Buffalo Camp... can't wait!
American Prairie Reserve	280513		/users/profile/370408	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	2	02/18/2016	I think it is wise to tell others to do thorough homework regarding APR.  If you are a Montanan with ties to the farming/ranching lifestyle or even someone from elsewhere who respects those who raise stock and grow food in Eastern Montana, be sure you know what the goal of APR is. Be sure you understand their methods to achieve their goals and how this will affect the lives of locals, many of whom are 4th or 5th generation farmers and ranchers on their land - land that APR wants.
American Prairie Reserve	142385	4	/users/profile/105526	Ted Harris	Donor	5	11/25/2012	The American Prairie Foundation (aka American Prairie Reserve) is surely one of the most visionary conservation organizations ever. It is acquiring and restoring lands on the eastern Montana Great Plains with a goal of connecting to and adding to the Charles M Russell National Wildlife Refuge and the Upper Missouri River Breaks National Monument, eventually creating a 3.5 million acre natural area, resembling what this region was like in the days of Lewis and Clark. APF is a well run organization. It has a strong list of supporters and scientific advisors. It has encouragement from the World Wildlife Fund and the National Geographic Society.
Animeals	245108		/users/profile/328653	Jamie Aitchison	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/11/2015	AniMeals is a unique organization that supplements the food needs of homeless animals in shelters, living with low-income families, or members of a feral colony. They also provide safe haven for cats waiting for their forever home. NAVS was able to help their important mission by providing a grant for the Honey Fund, which assists in emergency vet care for pets of low income families, homebound and disabled or homeless individuals. 
Animeals	191698		/users/profile/250198	Jrog	Professional with expertise in this field	5	12/27/2013	AniMeals partnered with Animal Services and Assistance Programs (ASAP) and Purina to distribute over 50,000 lbs. of cat food and litter throughout the state.  They called over thirty rescue organizations and worked with several businesses in Missoula to make the event happen.  The semi- truck load of supplies came from a distribution point in Iowa and had a turnaround time of 10 hours.  When they sent out the call that food was coming in, they had rescues driving from as far away as Washington, Idaho and Billings, MT.  Several organizations partnered together to pay for one truck to come the hundreds of miles to pick up food. AniMeals stored and delivered food that was reserved for several shelters who could not make the drive.  The next week AniMeals delivered 8000 lbs. of food to a semi-truck meeting them in Butte, MT to relay the food the last distance to a shelter in southern Idaho. Animals are a huge part of Montanas history and there are rescues and shelters in almost every small town and reservation throughout the state. When they sent out the call that they had mass food to distribute they received replies from over twenty rescues who wanted to be part of the food allocation within hours.  We are so thankful that AniMeals is here for us and what they do in the state of Montana is indispensable!  Keep up the great work!
Animeals	95637	2	/users/profile/110956	Patty Finch	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/13/2011	I am the director of Global Federation of Animal Sanctuaries (GFAS). When the GFAS learned that all the animals of Montana Large Animal Sanctuary and Rescue needed to be placed, due to the failure of the sanctuary, GFAS was happy to step into a leadership role and create teams to place the animals. But after the first people were on site to help, it soon became apparent that we were dealing with a cruelty situation and that the caretakers would need to leave.  Thank goodness for Animeals. Karyn Moltzen saw a need and filled it. She literally moved into the sanctuary, sacrificing (as it turns out) her Thanksgiving and Christmas and New Years. I don't know what we would have done with Karyn and her staff from Animeals. They were there 24/7 caring for the animals in horrendous conditions, and the state of the animals I'm sure will haunt Karyn's dreams for a long time. What she and her team did is very difficult physically and emotionally.  Many nonprofits came together and thanks in large part to Karyn, all the animals were out of the sanctuary into foster or permanent care in just about a month. It was the largest sanctuary evacuation in the history of the US and Animeals was the shining star.
Heroes and Horses	319885		/users/profile/411779	JeremyC5	Client Served	5	12/06/2016	Heroes and Horses gave me the opportunity to take a deep look inside myself and gain a better understanding of who I am since I came home: I am not a charity case. I am not a broken man. I am a Veteran still capable of overcoming the greatest obstacles. The staff of Heroes and Horses did not take me on a Vacation pony ride in the mountains...they challenged me with two very difficult and  unforgettable excursions in the wilderness culminating in a month-long horse training apprenticeship with Val Geissler. Now that I have found purpose I live my life in a more positive way. I look forward to interacting with and helping others. Because of H&H I am in a much better place.

And all too often these warriors are forgotten and emotionally cast aside. Heros and Horses honors these men and women through an experiential program ministering to mind, body, and spirit. This program gives soldiers and airmen who are experiencing the emotional scars of war the ability to return to private life after testing themselves in the rugged Montana mountainous terrain. The course offers extreme Expedition style horse pack trips that teach self-reliance, teamwork, and help veterans move past the struggles men and women face after years of war, internal and external. I am thankful that these navy seals have not only served their country, but they now stand to serve each other in this exemplary program.

There are extensive rooms dedicated to Native American, logging and farming history as well as rotating displays for past and present concerns.  A wonderful 1895 classroom re-enactment experience is invaluable for local 3rd graders. Many opportunities for volunteers and visitors are available for anyone who wishes to understand this beautiful part of Montana.
Northwest Montana Historical Society Inc	98490		/users/profile/116965	Greycheck	Board Member	5	09/28/2011	The Northwest Montana Historical Society is a thriving organization with over 800 members.   They are based in the Museum at Central School,  which is home to the Flathead Valley history museum.  They played a critical role in keeping the building from being torn down and to this day help keep it running in tip top shape.  
Northwest Montana Historical Society Inc	45514	11	/users/profile/46404	museum-at-central-school	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/24/2010	The NMHS got started in the early 1960s as an informal group working to preserve the history of Northwest Montana.  In the mid-1990s they found their calling and marshaled forces to save the four-story stone and brick Central School building from destruction, one of the last and best remaining examples in Montana of Richardsonian Romanesque architecture.   They were successful in getting the City of Kalispell to spend $2.4 million of federal block grant funds to completely renovate and restore the venerable structure in 1998, and proceeded to open it as a history museum in 1999.   The Museum at Central School, now in its second decade, boasts about 800 supporting members, 80 active volunteers, and a paid staff of four.  the Museum features exhibitions on the Indians of the Northwest, Montana pioneer Frank Bird Linderman, the Timber Industry in Northwest Montana, the turn-of-the-century community of Demersville, and a new History of the Flathead Valley exhibition.  There are additional, smaller rotating exhibitions.    The facility now preserves and protects some 20,000 artifacts, photos, records and documents.  They have an active oral history project that has captured more than 200 stories of local residents and pioneers.  A monthly history book club and a historic film club meet with solid support, and a Native Plants Garden enhances the buildings grounds, which also includes a large lawn area with giant shade trees and picnic tables.   Two large 1000 square foot rooms with elegant period decor and thirteen foot high ceilings are available for rent and host upwards of 150 community events each year.  Several thousand local school students learn each year from docent guided tours.     This is one thriving local history museum that is well worth a look.

I have attended two of their events and, at times, been able to volunteer.  I am the one who walks away fulfilled.  The children and adults that come to this organization are cared for, given an opportunity to laugh and grow, heal, in ways I couldn't have imagined until I witnessed it first hand.

They do this all as volunteers, and every dime goes toward meeting performers' expenses to get here.  Many of them donate much of their time to come here, just because they love the place and the Arts Council treats them so well.  Thanks, Arts Council, for all the "culture" you bring to this backwoods community.
Sanders County Arts Council	58981	1	/users/profile/63287	Madame Marie Beau Coup	Client Served	5	12/20/2010	This organization is a great example of underfunded, overworked, yet a wonderful gift to the Sanders County Community as well as the larger Missoula, Kalispell, and northern Idaho area. They somehow manage to bring in nationally and internationally acclaimed musicians and theater groups to this tiny, "frontier" area, mostly due to the personal rapport the organization has developed with the performers. They bring Montana Repertory Theater productions. And they sponsoring an annual three-day Baroque Festival, offering world-class musicians in a tent at a hot springs near the Clark Fork River. Many performers delight in returning year after year, as they enjoy it so much, after their work in New York or Chicago, or Europe for instance. A dollar to this so far all-volunteer group is a great investment.

REACH OUT & CARE WHEELS INC	130991		/users/profile/176520	Kriss	Volunteer	5	10/30/2012	ROC Wheels' main objective is to provide children in need in developing countries with wheel chairs to live their lives to the fullest.  Every child dreams, some children just need a little extra help to obtain their dreams. The wheel chairs ROC Wheels supplies are just the tools these children need in order to dream big, live their lives to the fullest, and share their dreams with the rest of the world.  Additionally, ROC Wheels provides the foundation to help other caring children get involved through YEWTHS ROC!  The YEWTHS ROC program enables local children to help build the wheel chairs for the youths in need.  YEWTH ROC also provides opportunities for children to get involved by making homemade items that help fund the wheel chairs.  The only thing more precious in this world than allowing a child to live out their dream, is allowing children to live out their dreams together.  ROC Wheels provides this opportunity!

This assertion was not disputed by Defendant Animal Foundation of Great Falls. The Animal Foundation is now doing business as the Maclean Animal Adoption Center in Great Falls, Montana.
Animal Foundation Of Great Falls Montana	178287	1	/users/profile/234898	gadabouttrue	Donor	1	10/16/2013	On November 22, 2011, the Montana Supreme Court issued an opinion in Case No. OP 11-0548, Animal Foundation of Great Falls, Robert F.

The Court found the Animal Foundation board in contempt of court for refusing to produce more than 100,000 documents as ordered by the lower court. It's the only time in Montana history that the entire board of a charitable organization has been held in contempt by the state's highest court. The Court wrote: "The breadth and depth of the decisions by the Foundation to defy the clear and direct orders of the district court were without legal or record-supported factual basis."
Billings Food Bank Inc	104681	11	/users/profile/140403	Dayle Hayes	Donor	1	01/26/2012	I'm very disappointed in the lack of transparency of the operation and  finances of the Billings Food Bank. There have refused to share details of their operations with other local agencies and they continually post inaccurate information on their website. As an example, they do NOT provide food to at least six (probably many more) of the agencies listed on their website. Yet, they refuse to remove the names, even after numerous requests.

Even with all of the amazing services it provides, it operates on less than 2% of its budget for salaries and fund raising expenses. It is an amazing model of how a food bank should be run.

Human Resource Development Council Of District Ix Inc	194968	1	/users/profile/254851	Arison	Donor	5	02/28/2014	I began teaching classes for the HRDC Road to Home program in 2007. Being a real estate agent, I knew there was a great need to educate both current and future buyers about the home buying process.  The Road to Home HRDC sponsored program I feel is an integral part of getting to know the ins and outs of home ownership.   I have had the  opportunity to meet with families who never thought they would ever be able to afford a home and I have personally been able to help them achieve their dreams of home ownership. What I like about  HRDC is that they give a hand up and NOT a hand out.  I like the accountability aspect of the HRDC programs.  The staff help people to plan and budget their finances which in turn help them to prepare TO BE SUCCESSFUL home owners.  In order to succeed, the clients need to take steps toward self sufficiency and the classes, pre-assessments and credit counseling prior to home ownership assist with achieving successful homeownership! The last 7 years I've personally seen 50+ people achieve home ownership that never thought they could with the programs and financial backing of HRDC.  This is particularly important in a community like Bozeman where the cost of  living is so high and the goal of being a home owner is bleak for many people.  I've donated my time to a variety of programs and I've always been impressed with how committed and compassionate the staff are to this community, which reinforces my enthusiasm and commitment to work with HRDC.  The staff have passion for what they do and are constantly looking for ways to improve existing and future programs.  They are very forward thinkers!   I KNOW the monetary donations I've made over the years have gone to a wonderful cause and I cannot think of a better organization to donate too.  I can personally see the results of my time and energy within the community and the families who have benefited from the programs at HRDC and their support staff.  Arison Antonucci-BurnsKeller Williams Montana Realty, Broker

Foys To Blacktail Trails Inc	129463		/users/profile/174832	Ted V.	General Member of the Public	5	10/25/2012	Foys to Blacktail Trails is helping to keep recreational opportunities available to the public by purchasing land adjacent to a county horse park.  They have spent countless hours developing a trail system enjoyable to all, from horse trails to mountain bike trails, cross country skiing in the winter, and recently a 'family' trail with wide, gentle inclines that people of all ages and abilities are able to enjoy.  With multiple routes and miles of trails, one can enjoy a hike any time of day without running into a crowd.   I walk the trails at least 3 days a week with my dogs, and use it for exercise for them, wildlife and scenic photographic opportunities, and just a quiet time to clear my head.  With continued donations and support, they can create a corridor of land that families can enjoy without fear of development and blocked access.
Foys To Blacktail Trails Inc	128712	1	/users/profile/173934	TrailHead	Board Member	5	10/25/2012	I first experienced the Foy's to Blacktail Trails several years ago when a friend took me for a walk there.  I was impressed with  how beautiful the forest was, and how it felt wild and even remote, but was only 10 minutes from our city's downtown core.  I knew a little bit about the project--that much of the land we were walking on was private, and that although the public was allowed to use it, it was at risk of sale and development.  But once I saw it first-hand, I began to understand what a huge asset it is to our community. People of all ages and abilities use this land regularly for walking, cycling, horseback riding, and in the winter, cross-country skiing.  The volunteers that comprise Foy's to Blacktail Trails are working extremely hard to ensure that the public will always be able to access this beautiful land. The private land they are working to buy consists of 320 acres upon which they have built and improved a tapestry of trails that's popular with the public. This 320-acre parcel is also the sole gateway to thousands of acres of additional forest that is open to the public.

Indias Hope	286976		/users/profile/377048	Lindsey_F	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	I give to Sarah's Covenant Homes (SCH) because I have personally witnessed the change that SCH makes in the lives of its children, and my life has been changed by those children. SCH rescues orphans with special needs in India from overcrowded and understaffed institutional orphanages, and provides them with love, therapy, education and quality medical care in a family-like environment. SCH strives to give the best care available to the 167 children and young adults who live at its 6 homes. SCH takes children who have been cast aside and abandoned, and helps them feel loved, accepted, and part of a family.I give because Sarah's Covenant Homes saves and changes the lives of previously abandoned orphans with special needs in India. I have met the kids and the staff, and I can promise you, that this organization is absolutely amazing.That's why I give to SCH, and that's why I work for SCH.
Indias Hope	286975		/users/profile/377047	Jennifer-Lucy_T	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	When Destiny Awaits.  Prior to traveling to India we knew that God had placed child sponsorship on our hearts. My husband told me to pray about which child to sponsor at Sarahs Covenant Home's (SCH) and to be open to Gods leading. We know that part of our assignment on earth is to care for orphans and that is what inspires us to give to organizations like Sarah's Covenant Home's India.My first day serving at SCH I was a bit overwhelmed. There are so many children with great needs and they are all so loving. As I served in the various homes I enjoyed bonding with each child. On most days, I was drawn to the Rescue Home to help with their Preschool program. It was awesome to see the children learning basic skills and just being kids. However, on my 4th day there I was drawn to a little girl, whom I call Destiny that was just sitting in a swing. Her condition, keeps her very weak and she is not able to hold up her head due to the fluid around her brain. When I would come by her swing to touch her hand, she would attempt to talk to me. On this day, I decided to just pick her up and hold her. I marveled at how her energy began to slowly pick up as she was held and we talked. I could tell that if she was without any health challenges that she would be just a normal kid with a lot of spunk! On my 5th day there, I decided to go and spend more time with her. It warmed my heart as she reached for me, and I was able to hold and chat with her for most of the day. As she was in my arms, I was led by God to begin praying for her Destiny. The way she arrived to SCH was heartbreaking but God has such a great plan for her life and for her future. For I know the plans I have for you, Declares the Lord, plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future. Jeremiah 29:11The moment I began praying, my eyes welled with tears because I knew that Destiny was the one. This was the child that my husband and I are to sponsor! I was overwhelmed with emotion, peace and gratitude and that served as my confirmation from the Lord. I dont know what the Lord has for us in this but I know that we are being called to help in this capacity.There are so many children within Sarahs Covenant Homes, India that need sponsors.

They are widely respected for their successful track record guided by a focused vision and strategy for accomplishing conservation. 
Jeannette Rankin Peace Resource Center	317398		/users/profile/408557	DukePepper	Volunteer	5	10/31/2016	The Jeannette Rankin Peace Center is truly one of the best community resources in the US. It is a home to many, where dialogue takes place and individuals expand their mindsets. Betsy, the director, is a champion for so many causes and will welcome any and all with open arms and an open heart. This organization should be modeled across the country as an example of what community activism can be. The JRPC gives people hope, solidarity, and inspiration.

PROJECT PHILANTHROPY	102513	21	/users/profile/133887	James007,	Donor	5	12/20/2011	We have been trying to sell our timeshare for about 3 year; by responding to postcards, Websites, and Real Estate Ads but the results were the same, no sell.  Until we hear about donating timeshares on the Clark Howard TV Show it was then that we found a website link to Donate for a Cause.  After contacting them, we could tell that they understood our needs; they provided us with a telephone number, an email address, and the name of a primary contact person, as well as the office number. In addition, we receive a clearly written understandable document explaining what were required and when certain documents are needed from the sellers. Each seller is given an account to access their timeshare status report; its updated each time an activity happens related to it. We have received excellent and professional service from the Resort Closing, Inc, and Donate for a Cause staff; from the start of the sell of our timeshare and throughout the closing process, as well. They were helpful, respectful, and true professional people who know how to sell timeshares; yes I sincerely and highly recommend anyone who are looking to donate their timeshare. Gene Madison,
PROJECT PHILANTHROPY	234807	2	/users/profile/303860	Don V.	Donor	1	12/02/2014	When I requested to the management about what I had in Hawaii just two blocks off off Waikiki, this is the response to my inquiry:  Hello Donald;     I am your Timeshare Specialist.  Unfortunately your Kuhio Banyan Club timeshare does not qualify for the programs we offer.  This is usually due to the current market conditions for your timeshare, or if your resort has policies in place that are too difficult to work with.  If you have any other timeshares you are interested in divesting, please feel free to contact me at the information listed below. Thank you again for your inquiry.     Sincerely,  Dallas PeuseTimeshare Specialist Now, let me ask you this, what do you think?  Hawaii?  RED all the time? no value?  In my opinion, this service is a scam if they can't honor or even discuss why they can't even consider our timeshare.  This guy is a real piece of work.
Craighead Environmental Research Institute	181185	2	/users/profile/237896	Mark106	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/22/2013	Practically everyone with an interest in wild places became familiar with the pioneering work of the Craighead brothers, which focused on Yellowstone's grizzlies in the 1960s and '70s. The result was public influence via specials on National Geographic and a change in wildlife management practices. Subsequent research goes far beyond megafauna to ecosystem studies all across North America. With our natural world in peril more than ever from human activities and climate change, we need the expertise this nonprofit has more than ever.
Craighead Environmental Research Institute	180954		/users/profile/237669	kent.madin	Board Member	5	10/22/2013	The legacy of the Craighead brothers and second generation Craigheads in combining solid science with a sense of adventure and dedication to wildlife and landscape preservation is what attracted me to join the Board of Directors. Craighead doesn't tug at your heart strings with pleas to save charismatic critters... ok.. well.. they do that for Pikas, but they are an obvious exception.  Instead, Craighead builds tools.  They create models and computer programs and books that beneath the hype and politics, bring people from disparate interests together to build consensus and make smart decision on planning and growth so that wildlife and landscape are respected.   It's not flashy but it's the real work that underpins sensible choices.

The Policy Institute	82906		/users/profile/91683	Montana	General Member of the Public	1	03/22/2011	On March 21, 2011 the Bozeman Daily Chronicle had an article on the front page titled, "Farm subsidies to Republicans draw cries of hypocrisy." The article pointed out that 33 state legislators who are mostly Republicans, have received farm subsidies.   To research those who receive farms subsidies, paid for by U.S. Taxpayer, please google or perform an internet search, using the following words:   "EWG FARM SUBSIDY DATABASE" The EWG website provides a user friendly database, where one can inquire by "farm name" or by "name of person" or by "last name and state."     "The Policy Institute" can be located the same way, by using the terms "The Policy Institute Helena" by google or another search engine.  This website is user friendly also. I was able to access the 16 page report by "The Policy Institute" on their website, and print with ease (pdf), referred to in the newspaper article.  I will suggest anyone interested in politics, take a look at the report by "The Policy Institute," and pay special attention to pages 6, 7, and 8 which provide information regarding some Democrat and Republican "legislators" (Senators and Representatives) who have received farm subsidies from 1995-2009.   The article by the newspaper, stated that of 33 legislators who received farm subsidies, 30 were Republicans.     The report provided by "The Policy Institute" did not include farm subsidies received by Democratic Senator Senator R. Jon Tester and his wife Sharla, nor did this report include farm subsidies received by Democrat Governor Brian Schweitzer and his wife Nancy.  The total received by these parties is well over $800,000.00 from the time period 1994-2009.  Each couple receiving over $400,000.00 of tax money to subsidize their farms.   The word "Hypocrisy" is used in both the newspaper article and title by "The Policy Institute."  The word is directed at Republican legislators and senators.   I have to wonder why "The Policy Institute" would issue a report, which claims Republicans as hypocrits when it appears their own report was designed to shield Democrats from the same scathing accusation very creatively. At face value, "The Policy Institute" report does make quite an impact, and is damning to Republican Representatives and Senators in Montana.  Yet, if one takes a closer look, one might wonder if the report was designed to do just that.   Is this fair and balanced information the public seeks, or was this report designed to attack Republicans in a passive aggressive way?  It is time we hold all of our elected officals to the same standards when judging their personal lives.  I believe responsible, fair reporting concerning all Representatives, Senators and the Governor could have been easily compiled. My personal views on subsidies are not black and white.  However, I believe that men and women who are not actively "farming" their farms, trying to make an honest living should not be applying for nor accepting farm subsidies, courtesy the U.S. Taxpayer.  I also have no doubt that many people of both parties are creating businesses out of farmland, while speculating for real estate purposes.   Honest farmers who work their farms, struggle and pray alot.  Rich business people who own farmland, inherited or purchased that make their livelihood's another way, are simply raking in taxpayer money which they did not earn, nor do they deserve.  That is my opinion.

Education Foundation For Billings Public Schools	42996	2	/users/profile/43756	dlhall42	Volunteer	5	06/04/2010	My involvement with the Education Foundation for Billings Public Schools began in 1994.  At that time the 100% volunteer organization didnt even qualify for hand-to-mouth status.  Today, through sound planning and hard work by the dedicated staff (2 part-time & a summer intern) and committed community board, the Education Foundation is a community success story.  Their programs, such as Reading Rocks and Classroom Grants, fill the needs of both students and educators.  This will be my 7th summer as volunteer for Reading Rocks, a reading program designed to help low income students whose reading levels are known to drop during the summer.  I am richly rewarded for giving one lunch hour a week to read to children who welcome not only the reading activity and a book to take home but also the contact with caring members of the community.  (program details at: http://www.efbps.org)  Teachers giving vacation time to be Reading Rocks volunteers is a positive sign for the program.  I have found the Education Foundation to be a responsible, forward-looking and fiscally conservative organization.  As an example, for a number of years the board has funded a quasi endowment in order to provide the organization with long-term, sustainable funding.  The Education Foundation for Billings Public Schools makes a difference for students and teachers in our community.
Montana School For The Deaf And Blind Foundation	162285	1	/users/profile/214622	Billfish	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/09/2013	Montana School for the Deaf and Blind has received accreditation from the National Accreditation Council for Blind and Low Vision Services (NAC).

NAC congratulates Montana School for the Deaf and Blind on its accredited status. 
MONTANA NONPROFIT ASSOCIATION INC	23097	9	/users/profile/24161	Cathy	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/29/2009	MNA is an excellent organization. Their staff is exceptionally talented and their executive director won a national award for being an up and coming leader in the field. In a few short years, this relatively new nonprofit organization is now, per capita, the biggest state nonprofit association in the nation!  MNA has an excellent annual conference in September and provides good member services, but they also are doing more and more in the area of technical assistance, training and advocacy. Their principles and practices document, available at mtnonprofit.org, is excellent and is the result of a year of work on the part of their training director. This organization has an important role to play in improving the professionalism and quality of nonprofits in Montana, many of which operate in remote rural areas with little access to assistance. Montana is a difficult state to serve, but MNA is making the most of their resources.

Rocky Mountain College	106350	4	/users/profile/142406	Margaret Johnson	Donor	1	02/13/2012	I had been a 15 year donor, 5 year volunteer at RMC. I taught school for 18 years, been an entrepenuer, etc. For the past 3 years I studied RMC through public records, RMC publications, interviews, etc. I am outraged that the Board will not follow their own by-laws having been in non-compliance with their term limits, conflicts of interest, and never did a required search for a new president in 2005. They changed their by-laws in 2010 and now there are no term limits! They have engaged in risky investments and lost on credit rate swaps. The IRS 990s show many payoffs to former employees since Pres Mace took over in Oct 2005. He was the one who said he invented the "key card" (not true), calls himself the "Miracle Man" in RMC publications, ended up in jail in Indiana for punching the developer of his townhouse in 2007, recently was in a lawsuit because of abusive behavior to develpment director. Board members have been aware of his anger since Dec 2005 and have even acknowledged his anger problem in the Billings Gazette. Pres mace personally refused to five me even the names of the Board members in 2010! The current names were not available anywhere...secret??? I am sad for the college because the leadership lacks institutional integrity. I am not the only FORMER disgruntled donor....we were in the process of a MAJOR gift!

The local clubs, however, also improve the lives of local women.  The Zonta Club of Billings gives women the opportunity to serve the community by participating in hands-on projects.  Most recently, I participated in a project with the Women's and Family Shelter.  Club members tied blankets with the women in the shelter and helped mentor the women while making blankets for domestic violence victims.  A club member and woman from the shelter work together on two blankets.  One blanket is given to the Billings Police Dept. to give to victims when responding to domestic violence calls.  The other blanket is given to the woman in the shelter.  It has been a fun and rewarding project.

The first one I had already done, yet was told that age constraints made it unlikely that I would be approved.The other 2 I had done most of the routes involved, but the "leader" of the party had NO EXPERIENCE WHATSOEVER.I guess that some members finally started arguements at trailheads with other members who chose to legally carry a firearm in bear country.  The "board of directors" made the decision to ban all firearms, even though members are required to sign a release that "you are sloely responsible for your safety".  This organisation iscrimijnatory in nature and somewhat inbred.
Silver Bow Montessori School Inc	6842	9	/users/profile/8698	rfdiii	Client Served	5	07/20/2009	I have two children enrolled as elementary students at SBM.  It is a fantastic school with individualized lesson plans for each student.  The curriculum is focused but not cookie-cutter -- the instructors recognize that not all kids learn the same way.  It is small and somewhat non-traditional, but the environment promotes active learning both in the class room and through field trips.The elementary school has been on overnight trips to Glacier Park, Yellowstone Park, and Calgary, Alberta where we slept in the Calgary Zoo.  Other expeditions include digging for fossils each year, Fall and Spring camp-outs (overnighting optional), visiting the Museum of the Rockies in Bozeman, and a ski program each winter.The school is very competitive in academic competitions as well, last year taking overall first place in the Montana Tech Science Fair and in the Battle of the Books (6th grade team) as well as several individual honors at the science fair, and competing in the county-wide spelling bee.My youngest was also in the Early Childhood program before entering the elementary program.  This too is a wonderful program with emphasis on teaching kindergartners concepts in counting and phonics, encouraging reading prior to entering first grade.In many respects this is a one-room schoolhouse where the kids all pull together to achieve outstanding academic results.  There is very little pettiness, almost no competition over wardrobe, and the kids all seem to watch out for each other.

My husband passed away and I was left with no welder for our business,  and distraught and thus had to walk away from our business and home while I was 8 months pregnant and also had a one year old. We lost everything, which means we had no money to defend ourselves against all of the creditors. (I also emotionally could not deal with it at the time). Thank GOD, for MLSA and Flint for helping me through this troublesome time so that I could get myself back on my feet and take care of my children. They were very attentive, understanding and most importantly...non-judgmental. (losing everything made me feel worthless). They showed in every way they were there to help. NOW THAT's a TRUE SUPER HERO! Many Blessings to you all!

Project WET has touched millions in this way, in many different languages and cultures, putting education at the forefront of the effort to provide water and sanitation for all.
Payden Memorial Foundation Inc	11578	4	/users/profile/13521	2dogmom	Board Member	5	09/30/2009	The Payden Memorial Foundation was started by personal friends after loosing their son Payden, age 6, to medulloblastoma (brain cancer).  After healing from their loss, they realized a great need for financial resources to help families in Montana with kids battling cancer.  There is no special screening process outside of a 'note from their doctor' with a diagnosis, no financial qualifications.  Upon learning of a family they immediately send a substantial check for whatever expenses are needed and a grocery gift card.  A little later the child and their siblings receive a gift pack of toys and such to occupy their time while travelling or in hospital.  At the holidays, the families receive another check.  All of the fundraising is done only once a year during an annual bicycle ride called 'Blazing Saddles'.  The feedback from families is this organization goes above and beyond what anyone else does, with compassion and understanding that only a family who has experienced their struggle can understand.

Big Horn County Historical Society	32715	1	/users/profile/33534	hardincuster	Donor	5	03/08/2010	Probably the very best county historical museum in Montana.  It showcases the homestead era of 1910 - 1920 but its collections include significant Native American material and historic photgraphs.
Spirit At Play Inc	10715	1	/users/profile/12619	mary1965	Client Served	5	09/22/2009	I am a parent of a child who is attending Spirit at Play Preschool in Missoula Montana.  We looked at about a dozen schools before we enrolled out daughter at SAP. We are very happy with the Teachers,children, families and facility.  Everyone has been great. Parent involvement is encouraged and we are kept informed of day to day happenings at the school. They teach the kids respect for themselves and others and rely on the Love and Logic philosophy.  They have a lot of extra curricular activities such as soccer and gymnastics which is great for the kids to get to try out and see if they want to continue with them outside of school. The school offers an organic lunch program or the kids can bring lunch.  The staff are mainly long term people who are dedicated to the school.  The biggest challenge for me will be the fundraiser where parents are required to sell 10 Christmas wreaths! So far we are very happy with our daughters care and learning environment at Spirit at Play.Mary Marry

TIBETAN CHILDRENS EDUCATION FOUNDATION	102614	2	/users/profile/134451	sa_najera	Donor	5	12/23/2011	Tibetan Children's Education Foundation has sponsorships to assist in the education of Tibetan children living in exile in India. There are also sponsorships for elders who are living in exile in India and are no longer able to work in road repair and other unskilled labor jobs, due to their advanced age. They escaped from Tibet many years ago and because they were living in exile, without a country, there was only  road work available to them. Many of them have no one to care for them and lack the bare necessities of life. My monthly donation goes directly to pay for room and board and education of the children I have been assigned. I am able to communicate with them and send packages. The Grandparents I sponsor do not read or write, but I am assured that my donation goes to help them specifically with life necessities and medical care. I am able to travel to India and visit with all of them personally. I see their pictures in my home each day, and it brings us all closer together. TCEF allows for a personal relationship and that is very important to me. I believe I have been called to help the Tibetan people who are living in exile to preserve their culture and identity. I believe we all have an obligation to speak out about the persecution and atrocities being inflicted on the Tibetans still living in Tibet by the Chinese government.
Garage Theater	29243	7	/users/profile/30273	karen2	Board Member	5	02/19/2010	Garage Theatre presents professional performances of top quality to the community in a comfortable space with lots of free parking.  The plays presented are rarely performed in this area and are often U.S., regional or world premieres.  They are generally challenging, thoughtful pieces that many other performing groups would shy away from.In addition, there is the unique opportunity for audience members to have a conversation with cast and director after every performance.Youth Conservatory productions are of professional quality and the children performing get a top-notch theatre education experience throughout the rehearsal process.
Bob Marshall Wilderness Foundation Inc	92282		/users/profile/105785	Paul Travis	Advisor	5	06/27/2011	The Bob Marshall Wilderness Foundation (BMWF) is one of the oldest and most effective wilderness stewardship nonprofit organizations in the country.  Started in 1996 out of grass-roots concern of the need for trail maintenance and the loss of the trail system due to inadequate USFS budgets within the 1.5 million acre Bob Marshall Wilderness Complex (includes the Bob Marshall, Scapegoat and Great Bear Wilderness areas).  It has evolved into a mainly privately funded partnership organization that works on much needed trail maintenance, restoration of campsites and impacted area's, noxious weed control and mapping, and maintenance of historic structures.  And all of this is done with volunteers from across Montana and the country!   The BMWF is very effective in working directly with the US Forest Service in determining the greatest need and most appropriate use of volunteers on stewardship projects.  The BMWF has experienced wilderness crew leaders that train, supervise and work directly with volunteer crews on each project.  BMWF volunteer work trips are highlighted with pack support to work sites, included meals, and natural history education from crew leaders.  Certainly, as many a BMWF volunteer will tell you, volunteers get as much out of the experience as does the wilderness resource.  The BMWF is a prime example and national model as to how successful a small organization can be on affecting the stewardship and achieving the management goals of a wilderness area.   Much of this success is due to its strong partnerships and commitment from a dedicated staff, board of directors and innumerable volunteers.   This is certainly a small organization that can and has proven itself. Whether or not you've ever set foot in the incomparable Bob Marshall Wilderness Complex, you couldn't do better than to donate to the Bob Marshall Wilderness Foundation.      
Northern Plains Resource Council	64668		/users/profile/70694	Lotrstargirl	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/08/2011	Northern Plains is the only conservation group in Montana that truly works in rural areas on natural resource and ag issues.  Northern Plains has been around for almost 40 years now and it takes a successful well-run organization to last that long.  The people engaged in this organization are far from your typical environmentalists and many are 3 and 4th generation Montanans.  Also, this group is truly grassroots and is entirely member-run.   I highly recommend supporting Northern Plains and have been very satisfied in working with them.

Kitty Keepers	32679	1	/users/profile/33502	quailwings	Professional with expertise in this field	5	03/07/2010	I am the Special Services Officer for Cut Bank Animal Shelter, Cut Bank MT. My husband is the Animal Control Officer. We attended and work the Kitty Keepers' Spay/Neuter Clinics six times a year for low-income families. Kitty Keepers allows us to bring animals from our shelter to the clinics. In the past ten years, they have altered 4062 animals for communities along the upper part of Montana, mainly Hill County.I am also the webmaster of Kitty Keepers website. I have seen the difference that having animal entered into a website can make in the reduction of sanctuary animals. Kitty Keepers has had as many as 250 animals in the sanctuary. They are presently down to 49 animals. The care that Kitty Keepers gives to the animals is superior. No matter what their health is, all cats are treated and loved by the staff at Kitty Keepers. They go into the nursing home with the cats to provide the human touch that all people need regardles of age. They have a school program and teach children the proper way to handle a cat and to give it love. Kitty Keepers is an assest to their community.

Montana Horse Sanctuary	153433	2	/users/profile/204235	HMcAdoo343	Volunteer	5	04/08/2013	I have been a volunteer of the MHS since it's inception in 2004.  I find it inspiring how many horses they have rescued and how many lives have been enriched by adopting horses from the sanctuary.  I know that just in 2012 they helped over 430 horses throughout the state of Montana.  Not only does Jane Heath, Executive Director, work tirelessly in her efforts to rescue the horses and get them into the best forever home, she also provides workshops for horse people throughout the state on topics such as equine nutrition, how to rehabilitate abused horses and Safe and Happy Trails and Horsemanship workshops.   In addition to working with the horses and their owners, Jane Heath has also been very active and continues to develop ever-stronger relationships with sheriffs offices throughout the state, as well as with county attorneys.    I am constantly amazed at the work that the Sanctuary does, as well as the time that Jane Heath has put into the efforts to help the horses.  She is such an inspiration and I'm very proud to work with the sanctuary as a volunteer and by providing donations.

Flathead Spay & Neuter Task Force Inc	234202		/users/profile/298336	ABarbaraP	Volunteer	5	11/21/2014	For decades, I have volunteered for a variety of animal welfare organizations, all of which did wonderful work, but the Flathead Spay & Neuter Task Force does more on their modest budget than any organization I've known.   Every year, more than 3,000 dogs and cats are altered for low-income pet owners, and when needed, some operations are free of charge. No one is ever turned away for lack of money. The Task Force has a large group of very dedicated volunteers, without whom this amazing work could not be accomplished. The Task Force also supplies dog and cat food to people who may need help feeding their animals. Over the last dozen years, since the Task Force was formed, the euthanasia rate at our local animal shelter has gone from 55% to less than 3%. I think that says it all. I have volunteered with the Task Force for many years and I'm deeply proud of the fine work the Task Force does year after year. 
WILD SKIES RAPTOR CENTER	87961		/users/profile/98786	Cindy Jimmerson	Client Served	5	04/29/2011	2 months ago a gorgeous 5 yo female Bald Eagle was struck by a car/truck on the highway adjacent to our canyon home outside Missoula. She sustained a spinal cord injury and was rescued by my family members from drowning in the Blackfoot River in cold weather, she being unable to fly or walk.  Brooke Tanner and others at Wild Skies cared, fed and provided therapy for our eagle and consulted with neurosurgeons to determine her chances of return to the wild.  Many weeks of emotion and effort were invested, unfortunately with a loss at the end.  But we are all happy that they gave her the advantages of science, compassion and devotion to provide her comfort after her injury.  Have to love the folks at Wild Skies!

Ramsey Keller Memorial	237877		/users/profile/322823	Robin Z.	Client Served	5	02/10/2015	The Ramsey Keller Memorial raises funds to pay for funerals of children under the age of one in Montana. I lost my son at 40 weeks gestastion, two days before we were scheduled to be induced. There was no medical reason for his death. You never think about having to pay for a funeral when you are expecting and it's nothing insurance would pay for. That's when The Ramsey Keller Memorial stepped in. We didn't have to skimp on things we wanted because we couldn't afford them. My family continues to support this non-profit to pass on their generosity. Other families shouldn't have to pay for funerals of their children either. Kori, the mother of Ramsey, is a very caring person, she is there when you need her. I still keep in contact with her.
Iqra Fund	251224	2	/users/profile/339141	Adeleb	Donor	5	08/02/2015	Like most of us I don't have a lot of extra money to spend. What I do have, however, goes to this fund. Why? Because it goes to support education for young girls in a country where education for women is not always easy to come by. I spent part of last year teaching in Pakistan. I taught at a women's university where none of the young women took their education for granted. The money I contribute to the Iqra Fund goes to an impoverished area in the north of Pakistan. Little girls who were denied an education are now dreaming of what they can do WITH their education. What I give to this fund really does change lives. It has been a privilege to be part of this. 
Thrive Inc	194133		/users/profile/253632	calimorrison	Volunteer	5	02/11/2014	I have been a CAP mentor since 2001.  CAP matches adults from the community with students in the public schools to meet for one hour a week.  I have had CAP pals who simply needed a friend, others who had severe deficits in reading, others who needed support while going through family changes.  Each and every one of these students brought joy to my life.  At CAP they talk about the 'power of an hour' - and it couldn't be more true.  Two of my CAP pals, who I've kept in contact with are now independent, thriving college students. To think that I may have played even a small role in that humbles me and makes me thankful to CAP to have the opportunity to get to see young people become contributing members of our community. I have also volunteered with the Girls for a Change Conference - what an inspiring day to hear young women who want to make a difference in the world and are starting in their own communities .
The Bozeman Area Community Foundation	205953		/users/profile/219611	SteveH59718	Professional with expertise in this field	4	07/14/2014	The Bozeman Area Community Foundation is evolving into a larger role of assisting non profits in the area by facilitating connections and cooperation among non profit organizations, as well as its traditional role of managing endowment funds established by either non profits themselves or by individual donors.   It was originally founded in 1998 as the Planned Giving Foundation of Montana with an emphasis on technical estate planning for individuals who wished to leave money for local charitable purposes.  As the mission expanded into typical community foundation services, the board changed the name to better indicate the structure. In 2013 the "BACF" entered a new phase as it hired its first foundation manager.   New board members and the new manager are giving a fresh look to the organization via a revamped web site and it is becoming more connected to the community. I'm pleased with the changes and the progress being made.
All Mosta Ranch Montana	37684	3	/users/profile/38388	rockridgekate	Client Served	5	04/30/2010	I first became familiar with All Mosta Ranch Montana AMR when it was located in Plains, Montana.I visited the ranch & became intrigued with the critters & what Kate was doing.  Since I have pasture land & she has lots of critters I offered her the use of the pastures.  Im glad she took me up on that because 1. we became friends 2. Ive been given the privilege of fostering some of her special needs critters.While Kate was living in Plains she received a call about a llama that had been lying by the side of the road in 90 degree heat for a week.  He had broken bones that had started to heal, a twisted spine with crooked legs & as my friend said, he looks like a character out of a Dr Seuss book.  After he had healed & proven that he wanted to live, I begged Kate to let him recuperate @ my place since the land was more level than @ AMR.  She agreed!  I loved to watch Louis as Kate had named him & Sir Louis as I called him because he was so regal & gentle.  With his crooked legs he couldnt move fast so after a while, I was able to turn him loose in my yard.  When he was ready, he would walk back to the gate to go in with his buddies.  Motley, another llama - who came to me with a broken hip that was healing & Snaps, Motleys cria that she surprised us with after she had been here awhile.  I went on-line & read everything I could so I would know what to do with him, but as with anything, there are so many opinions out there that I was almost afraid to do anything with him.  But because Kate had seen me with animals, she encouraged me to do what came naturally.  & now I have a wonderful almost 4 year old who loves to go on hikes with me.  Motleys hip has healed & she loves to go also.  But I have the most fun with them taking them to the parades in Plains & educating people that llamas do NOT spit 24/7.  The first parade all we heard was, Look out.  That llama will spit on you.  Now we seldom hear it & people like watching Snaps interact with the crowd.  He is a goodwill ambassador for llamas!I am so grateful to AMR for allowing the llamas to stay with me when AMR relocated to Marion, MT.  With my physical disabilities (a form of Muscular Dystrophy) it is a blessing to have these llamas who will pack my water, a snack, or whatever so that I can spend some time enjoying Gods creation.AMR also let me foster some chickens when we had an infestation of grasshoppers.The parts I like about AMR are Kates willingness to work with those with special needs - the sometimes forgotten ones.  Her outreach programs for her community.  Her desire to help critters in need - knowing that she cant help them all.  & her desire to find forever homes for those critters.If you are a farm animal lover but do not have the ability to take on the responsibility of one of those critters, consider helping out AMR.  If you have the desire, the fortitude, the area needed for a critter, consider adopting an animal(s) available @ AMR.

St Vincent Healthcare Foundation	116446		/users/profile/158518	bcox	Client Served	1	06/25/2012	I think St Vincents is the only hospital that, while you are still paying on a bill, because you can't pay the full amount or what they WANT you to pay, they turn the bill over to collections.  They won't work with you and if they don't like what you can afford to pay they are very rude and disrespectful.  I do not like St V's any more and do not go to them unless there are no other choices.
Humane Society Of Western Montana	209487		/users/profile/272245	NancyMT	Client Served	5	08/08/2014	Our daughter in college volunteers many hours at the Humane Society. When we were ready for another dog, she found us "Frank" who we adopted. All the staff at the Humane Society are very friendly and caring. They spent time talking to us about Frank's characteristics, and they have a free hotline if we ever have training questions. We were very impressed with the time they took to make sure both Frank and us were a good fit! I have donated in the past and will continue to donate because this group is really making a difference in the lives of lost and abandoned animals.
Bitterroot Valley Education Cooperative	241349		/users/profile/327873	justaparent	Client Served	1	04/18/2015	I was disappointed by this preschool. Having my child in evulation, they would never completely finish his evaluation. They said it would take 2 wks, but 5 weeks later, they were no where near finished. They encouraged drugs and expensive treatment, I would have to pay out of pocket. Even though they said my kid was healthy/normal they said it was mandatory to put him in expensive special ed treatment.

Billings District Council	24911	1	/users/profile/25906	tfmurphy	Former Volunteer	5	12/23/2009	I have known the people at St. Vincent de Paul in Billings for seven years now.  I have always known them to be caring and welcoming to all who come to them in need.  They provide many types of assistance including food, rent and utility assistance, and representative payee services.  They work with all kinds of people, from families and individuals who lose jobs and need to reach out for assistance, to men and women who are chronically homeless due to mental illness.  They folks at SVDP have extraordinary patience and compassion and are known in Billings as the place to go when no one else, even other community service agencies, can help.  St. Vincent de Paul also does a tremendous amount of work with very limited resources.  I once asked an accountant I know who specializes in auditing nonprofits to look over SVDP's public financial statements, and he said that he has only seen a few organizations that produce as much "bang for the buck" as SVDP does.  They operate a thrift store which covers all overhead for the charity office which means that 100% of all donations are distributed directly to those in need.  I have given much time and money to St. Vincent de Paul over the years, always with complete confidence that it is being put to good use.

They have many helpful things in the loan closet like wheelchairs,  canes, crutches,  walkers, and much more. They are in good condition and only ask for a small monetary donation. I have never had a bad experience here and I highly recommend it to anyone who is over 60 or anyone with aging family, friends or relatives.
Betsileo Development	12195	3	/users/profile/14220	betsileodevelopment@yahoo.com	Board Member	2	10/07/2009	I was an immigrant from Madagascar and become an American Citizen 3 years ago (2006). Madagascar is one of the poorest country in the world. When I saw how fortunate is to be an American I thought I need to do something to help those in need. There is no comparison between the definition of "poor American" and "poor" from any under developped country.It took me almost 2 years to set up the organization which is one and half year old now.I am so thankful for those who helped me: the board members and their families, friends and co-workers. We just started to do fundraising. We did bake sale and now we are selling sewing stuff, especially diaper bags  but they could be just bags for women. We do this to provide drinkable water and irrigation in one village in Madagascar.
Alternative Energy Resources Organization	4445	1	/users/profile/6160	MTBRAT	Volunteer	4	05/03/2009	I've been in Helena, MT, since late 1971.  Back then, AERO was formed and began promoting alternative food supplies and home gardening, and alternative energy use rather than the standard products from corporate America.  Since then, they've matured, fought through a long period of both success and failure, as much as I am aware, until today.  Lately, they've promoted Neighborhood Conservation Clubs to which I signed up to be a member and co-leader of one.  Check this group out!
