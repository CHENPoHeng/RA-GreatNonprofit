Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	303744	5	/users/profile/270988	ShiK,	Donor	5	09/12/2016	I have been a fan, a follower, of SOAR since Ambassador Decorah was first brought to them by Bob Anderson after being rescued.  I often check SOAR's Patient pages to see how current rescues are progressing.  The wide variety of birds rescued, treated and rehabbed by SOAR director Kay Neumann, her staff and volunteers is uplifting; but, as a non-profit there is always a need for funds. Vet fees, test equipment, medicine, flight cages, not to mention food, are just a few of expenses in running rehab facility.  I try to do my bit by buying gas cards to pass out to the volunteers who pick up and deliver injured birds to SOAR a few times a year.Besides caring for all the patients at their facility, SOAR trains and provides Ambassador birds and works with other organizations conducting research, and does education outreach.  Earlier this year was heartbreaking when 13 Eagles were brought in for care and only one survived for release this summer.  SOAR's multi-faceted education efforts to make the public aware of the dangers of lead poisoning are so very important...whether presenting to schools, hunting groups, conservation groups  or making information available on  alternatives to lead hunting and fishing to where lead free ammunition can be purchased.Every year SOAR patient intakes increase...every year the need for funds also increases. 
Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	320550		/users/profile/411518	Lynette K.	Donor	5	12/28/2016	In 2007 I started watching the Decorah eagles online daily.  When Ambassador Decorah was saved by SOAR  I was so impressed and started following SOAR on Facebook.  I have always had a love for eagles  since they are a symbol of our country and I am very patriotic.  Eagles always come to my hometown of Council Bluffs, Iowa every year from January to March and you can see them around Lake Manawa and the Missouri River.  I have become a monthly donor which is an honor for me to be able to help such a great organization as SOAR who is located in my home state of Iowa.  Thank you SOAR for everything you do!

Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	104560		/users/profile/140221	iver B.	Donor	5	01/25/2012	SOAR is the "go to" raptor rehab center, even as far away from Dedham as Decorah.  They have consistently accepted injured and sick eagles from the Decorah area on short notice and provided them exceptional care.  As a community member, nominal donor and raptor (and all wildlife) lover, I appreciate their service, dedication and excellence.  Thank you SOAR!  Becky Burland, Decorah, IA

Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	255194	3	/users/profile/270988	ShiK	Donor	5	09/07/2015	I have been following SOAR since Ambassador Decorah was rescued by Bob Anderson of RRP, from a stream unable to fly because of a broken wing, and was turned over to the care of SOAR.  Although Decorah will not be able to fly free, his journey to becoming an educational ambassador is an amazing story.  Besides care and rehabilitation, SOAR also provides Invaluable education on lead free hunting and fishing by raising awareness of dangers lead is to our nation's raptors.  SOAR's patient reports show the depths of their care for our raptors. On a personal note, I have been happy to donate to SOAR, and on my past birthday, my 74th, my family knowing of my love of Eagles and support for SOAR, went to SOAR's Amazon wish list and presented me with a package of gift cards from stores on that list to forward to SOAR.  An amazing gift and a joy for me to send along to SOAR.
Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	208310	3	/users/profile/270988	ShiK	General Member of the Public	5	08/01/2014	For the first time, last year, I was introduced to eaglecams; first the Alcoa cam, then the Berry cam, and then the Decorah cam. Again this year, I followed the eagle families from egg to fledgling, officially becoming one of a growing number of eagelholics!  I was introduced to S.O.A.R when Decorah eaglet D20 was injured, rescued by Bob of RRP and S.O.A.R , and taken to S.O.A.R for treatment.  This facility does an amazing job caring for, rehabbing and finally (hopefully) releasing eagles and other birds, and educating through outreach programs to community.  S.O.A.R also works to educate sportsmen of the dangers lead has on avian populations and also works with power companies to identify and take remedial action on poles that pose risk to all birds.  I am amazed that such a relatively small organization as S.O.A.R , with its dedicated staff and volunteers, could have such a huge impact.  As such, S.O.A.R is indeed worthy of being recognized as a GREAT non-profit.
Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	303715		/users/profile/394885	Writer	Donor	5	09/12/2016	They are constantly willing to help any raptor in need and if space might allow some others ntil can arrange appropriate placement.  I especialy hard they worked to make egle DF4 from Decorah hest sight become an Ambassor eagle.    
Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	303700		/users/profile/206707	Barb P.	General Member of the Public	5	09/12/2016	I think that SOAR does a fabulous  job of rehabbing birds and doing wonderful educational programs that enhance the work that they do. 
Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	155745		/users/profile/206707	Barb P.	Donor	5	04/23/2013	SOAR is a great resource for our state of Iowa.  They are a wonderful and dedicated group who not only work to save injured and orphaned wildlife but are educators as well.  I will continue to donate to this outstanding organization .
Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	303676		/users/profile/394847	Writer	Donor	5	09/12/2016	SOAR has extremely dedicated staff who rescue, care for, rehabilitate, and release (whenever possible) injured raptors.  They also provide educational programs to groups of all ages regarding man-made threats to the avian population and ways that we can co-exist successfully.  Additionally, they work with local schools to provide internships for interested students.  I am a proud donor.
Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	303554		/users/profile/270720	riglet	Donor	5	09/12/2016	They do an excellent job rehabilitating and releasing our feathered friends! They are very much needed in this area!
Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	208034		/users/profile/270720	riglet	Donor	5	07/31/2014	I wasn't aware of this organization until the Raptor Resource Project took one of the Decorah eaglets there with a broken wing and some other problems. As soon as I read what this organization was doing I made a donation. I am very impressed with their dedication and love for these creatures. They are worthy of any and all help they receive.
Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	303466	1	/users/profile/394637	Kachina4	Client Served	5	09/12/2016	Maybe you've heard of the Decorah Eagles. Thousands of fans watched this eagle nest in 2014 as D18, D19 and D20 hatched and fledged from their Iowa nest. D18 and D19 both died from electrocution shortly after fledging and their younger brother, D20, broke a wing but was rescued. Our hearts were broken, but the hope that D20 might survive gave us courage. Thanks to SOAR and their veterinarian, D20 did survive the trauma of presumably being hit by a car and the surgical procedures that saved his wing. D20 was deemed to be unreleasable so SOAR obtained the necessary permit to make him an educational "Ambassador-in-Training." SOAR renamed him "Decorah" and his fans now refer to him as "Mr. Decorah." He's alive, well, happy and expertly cared for and will soon be able to help spread the conservation message for his species. Thousands love and adore this eagle and SOAR for saving his life - and his future. And who knows how many other eagles Mr. Decorah can save through SOAR's educational programs? SOAR is truly a "Great Nonprofit!"
Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	303465		/users/profile/270738	Donita D.	Donor	5	09/12/2016	SOAR provides a valuable service for injured birds, as well as educating the public regarding habitat, lead poisoning, and other avian needs.

Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	303402		/users/profile/270882	dragonfly7	General Member of the Public	5	09/12/2016	I have watched this organization help raptors since they first took in an eagle now known as Decorah. They are very dedicated to the preservation and assistance to injured raptors and to educating the public about the needs of these magnificent birds. I support them through donations by listing them as the agency to get funds from the Amazon Smile program. 
Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	208206		/users/profile/270882	dragonfly7	Donor	5	07/31/2014	The dedication and skill these people show in helping rescue and heal these birds is outstanding.

Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	303383		/users/profile/394545	coaldigger	General Member of the Public	5	09/12/2016	SOAR  was part of our first Gladys Black Day event celebrating "Iowa's  Bird Lady".  The presentation was loved by our visitors.  SOAR  shares great information on the care of injured birds and protection of our natural wildlife habitats.  SOAR  wiLl be at our 2nd annual Gladys Black Day September 17th and the town is looking forward to seeing them again.
Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	303380	1	/users/profile/394543	Judy171	Donor	5	09/12/2016	I have witnessed the work of SOAR for the past three years through my watching of the Decorah Nest (live streamed by Raptor Resource Project - RRP) and the amazing rehab work they did with one of the injured eagles (D 20 aka Decorah) who could not be released. This eagle has been made an Education Ambassador by SOAR and we have been privy to the loving and expert training given to Decorah by the SOAR Director and staff. In this process, I have seen the large number of injured birds that have been successfully treated and released back into the wild. Obviously, these birds do not have insurance and there are no responsible parties to pick up the costs of medicine and food. Most notable is the dedication of this group to being available to all injured birds brought to them. They contribute a much needed positive energy to a society that is sorely in need of folks who support life. I am a proud monthly donor to SOAR and only wish that amount could be more.

He is now an ambassador in training.  I have watched SOAR care for many before him.  It's a wonderful organization that saves avian lives.
Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	256907	2	/users/profile/345306	KathyLekxie	General Member of the Public	5	09/13/2015	From the first time I saw a presentation by Kay Neuman and the folks at SOAR (Saving Our Avian Resources), I was totally hooked by all the good these people do on a daily basis.  They not only rescue, rehabilitate, and release these  beautiful raptors, but they also advocate for them and educate the people, which is equally important to the health of these fine raptors.  Thank you, SOAR, for all that you do!!!

Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	255247	1	/users/profile/343622	merpreb	Donor	5	09/08/2015	I was introduced to SOAR by a friend who was following the Decorah Eagles. I have learned so much in the past 2 years. My husband and I have turned out yard into a paradise for birds, butterflies and bees. I have learned the dangers that raptors face as they learn to live with humans and what to try to fix through Advocacy. SOARS just doesn't advocate it helps people advocate. It is a superior organization that is aiming to help save part of our endangered Earth. Of all organizations they deserve the top award.
Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	255242	1	/users/profile/343617	FreeBird74	Donor	5	09/08/2015	In 2001 I was introduced to an Eagle family through a live video stream.  I began to learn not only about the life of an Eagle but about man made dangers to all raptors.  I then learned of Two organizations heavily and successfully involved in saving them, Saving Our Avian Resources being one.  SOAR has done wonders to protect our beautiful raptors as well as educate the general public and organizations and then work with them to make a difference.  I've been following SOAR for four years and support their cause through donations and bringing awareness to my local agencies.

They work so hard to help our feathered friends. I have learned so much about what it takes to get these birds back to the wild.  What it takes to train a eagle for being an educational bird. They do a wonderful job. They have made me laugh and made me cry. But I still tune in every day to check and see what is going on. Please keep up the work that you do. Thank you Kay for taking time out of your busy schedual to give up dates and educating us on how to help the birds in our part of the country.

What a milestone. The milestone for 2015 will be a record number of raptors and migratory birds admitted. The dedication that Kay and her team of volunteer rescuers and transporters continue to amaze... 
Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	155913	1	/users/profile/141096	redtail29	Volunteer	5	04/24/2013	SOAR - Saving Our Avian Resources continues to grow each year -- both in number of raptor and migratory bird patients, but also in support from those living in Iowa and those connected to us by a common ideal.   Having worked with Kay for over 20 years, her passion for raptor rehabilitation, raptor education, and raptor research continues to inspire the people she meets, encouraging each one to do what they can...  I hope, if you're reading this, that you have or will visit the website (www.soarraptors.org) and the Facebook page and that you will support SOAR in whatever way you can.
Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	105118		/users/profile/141096	redtail29	Volunteer	5	01/31/2012	I have worked with Kay on many projects since we met back in 1992!  There are no employees at SOAR, just a bunch of us volunteers being led by a dedicated, self-less Executive Director. While I share in Kay's passion for raptors, I only have a teeny, tiny bit of the passion, energy, and devotion that she shows to each and every bird that comes to SOAR. I began volunteering for SOAR in 2010 and help with "all things technical" that I can.  Managing the SOAR website is something that I can do from hours away!  Soon

I'm impressed with the care and expertise that they provide for sick and injured raptors. They are also a valuable resource for educating myself and others regarding these fascinating birds. The compassion, dedication and effort they invest is amazing. Outstanding work and when possible a full recovery with a humane release.

Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	209625	3	/users/profile/272379	lanieb	Donor	5	08/08/2014	Even though I live in Colorado, I became aware of SOAR's presence because I was following the Decorah Eagles.  SOAR took in one of our "Decorah three" who had a broken wing, and I've been following their care of the Decorah eaglet through their Facebook updates.  Their care, concern, and expert handling of raptors that need some TLC and extended recuperation and therapy is truly impressive.  I am now aware that besides eagles, they take in all types of birds of prey.  SOAR is also involved in research and education (such as encouraging hunters to be lead-free).  I am so thankful for people who are dedicated  to the welfare of animals.  Kudos to the dedicated staff and many volunteers that provide this admirable service to our raptor friends.

However, when we take into consideration that we as human beings share this planet with an abundance of creatures on land sea and air, and - we haven't been as kind to our co-inhabitants as we should or could be - the activity of SOAR surely makes up for the many transgressions we have been responsible for.SOAR has come to the consciousness of so many ordinary people world-wide very recently who all share one common passion, that of the Decorah Eagle family and through a medium which ten or more years ago, might not have been possible, the internet & a web-cam. We have watched a nest of eagle eggs be deposited in that nest, incubated and eventually, with bated breath, hatch and flourish with the constant attention of their parents, even unknowingly teaching us all a little about what it means to be an attentive and selfless parent  & caregiver.Sadly, one of those young eaglets found himself in peril, he had been found in a stream not far from his natal nest, a bit battered, tired and with a broken wing. "Our" D20 (his reference to literally millions of on-line viewers) was rescued and promptly transferred to the premises of SOAR where he was examined, treated, x-rayed and subsequently had surgery to repair the broken wing - there is simply nothing more sad than to see an eagle or any animal capable of flight with a broken wing! As we receive periodical updates as to his progress including physio-therapy and encouraging words from their carers that he is responding well to treatment, it lifts our spirits and gives us all a little respite from the many troubles which we feel we have either no control over nor can combat individually - in this respect, we can see the best in all of us even if it is through just one eaglet and with the gratitude to SOAR and what it has made possible. Thank you for bringing a little positive outlook to us all! 
Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	209013	1	/users/profile/271771	dianabonjour	Donor	5	08/06/2014	I learned about SOAR's existence due to being an avid Decorah eagle watcher.  When one of the Decorah eaglets was found injured this summer, I, along with thousands of other eagle watchers, learned that SOAR would take the eaglet, treat it and rehabilitate it. Reading about SOAR and following the eaglet's progress and SOAR wonderful care for it and other birds taught me what a wonderful resource SOAR is to save injured birds. I am delighted to have become acquainted with what SOAR does and their dedication to birds in distress.  They are an important resource for birds in distress.

Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	208618	1	/users/profile/271351	Mteresa1	Donor	5	08/05/2014	I learned of SOAR watching the Decorah eagle cam in 2011. I have become a supporter of SOAR because they are a great organization dedicated to save raptors. They not only treat, rehabilitate, and release raptors back into the wild, but they educate on the dangers that these magnificent creatures face, specially with lead poisoning. The dedication of all the volunteers is admirable, they donate their time and expertise driving hundreds of miles to save all raptors in peril. It takes a special kind of people to do this kind of job. Now they are helping one of the Decorah cam eaglets, D20, he is in great hands as well as all the other raptors. I am amazed that SOAR having such limited financial resources, they still manage to do such a great job. All the volunteers, doctors, and workers are the GREATEST!!!
Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	208570	1	/users/profile/271285	ssgtandy1974	General Member of the Public	5	08/04/2014	Became aware of this organization as a Decorah Eagle watcher when one of the Decorah Eaglets (believed to be D20) was admitted on 22 June 2014 with a broken wing. I have followed the care and treatment of this eaglet every day since admittance. SOAR has done a fabulous job and, in my opinion, saved this young eaglet's life. Because of their profoundly professional service to our avian resources, I have decided to become a regular donator to this non-profit. 
Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	208563	2	/users/profile/271278	kayakscout	General Member of the Public	5	08/04/2014	I too am a Decorah Eagle fan. I've been watching and chatting for a couple of years now. When D20 went missing and was subsequently found with injuries I felt helpless. I am so grateful there are people like the folks at S.O.A.R. who know what to do and are available around the clock to help. I had no idea such am organization existed, but an extremely happy that it does. Thank goodness.
Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	303744	5	/users/profile/270988	ShiK,	Donor	5	09/12/2016	I have been a fan, a follower, of SOAR since Ambassador Decorah was first brought to them by Bob Anderson after being rescued.  I often check SOAR's Patient pages to see how current rescues are progressing.  The wide variety of birds rescued, treated and rehabbed by SOAR director Kay Neumann, her staff and volunteers is uplifting; but, as a non-profit there is always a need for funds. Vet fees, test equipment, medicine, flight cages, not to mention food, are just a few of expenses in running rehab facility.  I try to do my bit by buying gas cards to pass out to the volunteers who pick up and deliver injured birds to SOAR a few times a year.Besides caring for all the patients at their facility, SOAR trains and provides Ambassador birds and works with other organizations conducting research, and does education outreach.  Earlier this year was heartbreaking when 13 Eagles were brought in for care and only one survived for release this summer.  SOAR's multi-faceted education efforts to make the public aware of the dangers of lead poisoning are so very important...whether presenting to schools, hunting groups, conservation groups  or making information available on  alternatives to lead hunting and fishing to where lead free ammunition can be purchased.Every year SOAR patient intakes increase...every year the need for funds also increases.

Without them our little Decorah Juvenile (D20) would not be alive today.

Your volunteers are all heroes in my book.

Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	208444	1	/users/profile/271135	Debe S.	Donor	5	08/03/2014	If you are looking for a charitable venue dedicated to preserving the balance of nature through rehabilitation of injured wildlife plus educating us on ways to eliminate destructive human impact to our avian wildlife, SOAR (Saving Our Avian Resources) is an organization where your dollars will make a powerful impact in attaining that goal.  A visible reduction of the majestic wings of raptors patrolling the skies to curtail overpopulation of crop pests is a definite sign there is an act of imbalance in nature and the cause needs to be addressed.   SOAR not only helps injured and helpless raptors found and brought to them, but records & reports on the percentages of natural vs human causes for their injuries.  Through the efforts and education from SOAR, we can address issues that are under our control.

I have been watching the Decorah Eagles for a few years now and know the hard work SOAR has put into helping them.  They truly deserve not only a pat on the back but a lot more recognition.  Where would we be without them?  I shutter to think.  Instead on watching TV I log on to SOAR or watch the eagles.  Please acknowledge how wonderful this group is.
Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	208390	2	/users/profile/271072	Arika W.	Donor	5	08/02/2014	I have been a Raptor Resource Project Decorah, IA Eagle cam watcher this season. I learned about SOAR when, shortly after one of the eaglets fledged, it was rescued from a local stream with a broken wing. The juvenile was transferred to to the SOAR facility by a SOAR volunteer who just happened to be present.  All of a sudden this organization had a "Rock Star" juvenile eagle with thousands from around the world converging on their small group on Facebook. The number of followers increased by over 400% in a matter of days. There were many many questions asked and the new followers were primarily focused on "our" eaglet.  In my opinion the volunteers of SOAR have handled the onslaught with grace and kept their stated goals in mind when dealing with their new found followers concerns. They have taken the opportunity to educate us on the dangers of lead shot for hunting (no new news on the June 22 admit. Why not read about the dangers of lead shot while you are waiting for more news). The volunteers have patiently answered questions, often repeat questions, helping us learn about the challenges of rehabilitation, education raptors, release programs for other rehabilitated raptors, and reintroduction of Osprey to Iowa.  A class organization for sure.
Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	208388	1	/users/profile/271068	Kitty7	General Member of the Public	5	08/02/2014	I have gotten so emotionally involved with the Decorah Eagles and their Eaglets.  So many detrimental events have occurred and if it hadn't been for SOAR stepping in many of them could have been disastrous.   Soar has stepped in and taken over to get these poor birds back into the air.  When I have felt so helpless, there was SOAR to the rescue.
Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	208386	1	/users/profile/271067	kidderbarbara	Volunteer	5	08/02/2014	I became aware of SOAR this year when the Decorah eagle D-20 (likely, D-20, now known as SOAR after this wonderful avian hospital and rehabilitation center) was found with a broken wing and taken there. The veterinarian and his assistant and other personnel are all very skillful and caring.  They also make educational trips to schools with birds that for one reason or another cannot be released into the wild.  Further educational efforts concern hunters, and the advocacy of lead free bullets to save the lives of birds who eat prey that has been shot before being found by the birds.  The staff is caring as well as skillful, and they provide updates on the birds they rescue.  I believe they deserve a five star rating.   I live in Pennsylvania, so could not volunteer for this great resource, but I became well acquainted with their level of skill and care in the updates they posted both about D-20 and other eagles, hawks, etc. for which they cared.
Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	208379	1	/users/profile/271054	Meekosha	General Member of the Public	5	08/02/2014	I learned of SOAR when the Decorah juvie bald eagle was admitted with a broken wing in June 2014.   Since then I have been following this organization and truly amazed at the number of Avians they are able to save and release back into the wild.   I have had the opportunity to listen to Kay from SOAR talk and I got to meet Thora, her educational Bald Eagle.  Even though Thora will never be able to be released into the wild (because of lead poisoning), she is teaching the public much awareness to hunt "lead free" .  I know hunters have listened to her message and thanks to Kay and the people of SOAR, Thora has saved many of our precious Avian Resources.

The wonderful care and	treatment that is given to each patient is outstanding. I personally became aware of their dedication when one of the juvenile eagles from Decorah, Iowa was discovered with a broken wing after a terrible storm this past spring. SOAR representatives drove miles to rescue this eaglet that was severely injured and malnourished. Through their rehabilitation program, the young eagle is well on the road to recovery. Many of SOAR's patients recover successfully and are released back into the wild. If it weren't for this organization many of these majestic creatures would die.

Unfortunately, this year one of the eaglets broke a wing and was taken to SOAR for treatment.  Not only did the wonderful people at SOAR mend the wing and now have the eaglet in "rehab" but they kept all of us who watched this eaglet be born and grow informed as to its condition.  This was a wonderful lesson for my students who live in a large metropolitan area to know that there are people who care about these magnificent creatures so that someday they too might have a chance to see them in the wild for themselves.

I also joined the chat room and with the moderators and various people interested in our raptors found out about SOAR.  They are vital to our eagles in that when in trouble SOAR comes to the rescue.  I live in Florida and am now looking at areas here that are similar to volunteer time.  Wish I lived closer to Decorah and SOAR and they would definitely be on my list. Again thanks for all you do as a nonprofit.

There are so many excellent facilities that work with distressed raptors and other wildlife and I wanted to make donations to each and every one, especially following a public rescue that made its way into the newspapers.  I could make many small contributions or I could make one larger contribution to one organization.  Ive chosen SOAR and heres why.  This facility takes care of birds primarily in the Mississippi flyway.  Maybe one day they will be caring for my Minnesota Bound or my Minnesota DNR eagles.  So Im staying with the local doctor because they are trusted.  My workplace will begin their community fund drive in a few days and Ill be able to have my donations taken directly from my paycheck  after all, I am committed.

Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	208258		/users/profile/270939	ch1nch1n	General Member of the Public	5	08/01/2014	I fell in love with watching the eagles at the nest in my area this winter, from when the eaglets hatched to fledge. While watching this site I found the SOAR site, featuring the Decorah eagle nest. What a lucky break for me. I have learned sooo much about these amazing birds and fell in love with the three eaglets from this nest.  I wake every morning and go immediatley to face book to look for updates. What amazing work Kay and her staff do to save as many birds as they can. I've watched videos of there presentations to the public and I am so sad I am sooo far away. Kay and her staff must  work round the clock to care for all there patients and still have time for presentations around the state. What i have learned that is so important is about lead poisoning from bullets to the birds, especially the eagles. It;s so tragic what it does to these birds. Hunters must pay attention to what they are doing. So many eagles are sickened and die do to lead poisoning. If I was in Iowa, I would definitely help to educate the public, and I would be a helper at the SOAR facility.

I became attached to the  parents and the eaglets.The physical therapist even started to run the livestream in the therapy room. The therapist would challenge me to regain my strength as quickly as the eaglets did. I also enjoy the daily updates they give on all their feathered patients.

Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	208227		/users/profile/270902	Woodsie42	Donor	5	07/31/2014	This  organization is just wonderful.  They save helpless birds and  rehabilitate them  and release them into the wild if applicable.  The people who work here are selfless and dedicated.  
Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	208225		/users/profile/270900	Kathy172	General Member of the Public	5	07/31/2014	They are incredible! The time, people, and resources spent to assist raptors who have been injured, lost, or just need help is fantastic! I wish I lived close enough to help, but we can all help with donations to keep places like this helping wild creatures survive!

Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	208219		/users/profile/270895	Cris N.	Donor	5	07/31/2014	This organization goes out of its way to help and rehab ailing and injured birds. They are especially adept with raptors. Additionally, this group has a fantastic education program. Kay and her staff do a great job of keeping interested people up to date on the care and prognosis of the birds they are working with.
Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	303744	5	/users/profile/270988	ShiK,	Donor	5	09/12/2016	I have been a fan, a follower, of SOAR since Ambassador Decorah was first brought to them by Bob Anderson after being rescued.  I often check SOAR's Patient pages to see how current rescues are progressing.  The wide variety of birds rescued, treated and rehabbed by SOAR director Kay Neumann, her staff and volunteers is uplifting; but, as a non-profit there is always a need for funds. Vet fees, test equipment, medicine, flight cages, not to mention food, are just a few of expenses in running rehab facility.  I try to do my bit by buying gas cards to pass out to the volunteers who pick up and deliver injured birds to SOAR a few times a year.Besides caring for all the patients at their facility, SOAR trains and provides Ambassador birds and works with other organizations conducting research, and does education outreach.  Earlier this year was heartbreaking when 13 Eagles were brought in for care and only one survived for release this summer.  SOAR's multi-faceted education efforts to make the public aware of the dangers of lead poisoning are so very important...whether presenting to schools, hunting groups, conservation groups  or making information available on  alternatives to lead hunting and fishing to where lead free ammunition can be purchased.Every year SOAR patient intakes increase...every year the need for funds also increases.

The staff works above and beyond.  So grateful for the rescue of a Decorah eaglet this season.  I have donated to this outstanding organization and will continue to do so  they are deserving. 
Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	208217		/users/profile/270893	afbigred	General Member of the Public	5	07/31/2014	I've been following the Decorah Eagles since 2011 and have fallen in love with this wild raptor family. This years fledge was anything but normal, but thanks in large part to Kaye and the rest of the wonderful people at SOAR, two of the eaglets have survived to this point. Since becoming aware of SOAR I've also followed many of the other rescue stories and can't believe how dedicated they are to Saving Our Avian Resources.
Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	208213		/users/profile/270889	emorysmom	General Member of the Public	5	07/31/2014	SOAR provides a wonderful, much needed service for sick or  injured  raptors. Kay and her team put in countless hours  saving lives.  The organization has been thrust into the limelight because of the fantastic love and care given to the precious Injured Decorah eaglet. I have gladly donated to them and will continue to do so. 
Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	208212		/users/profile/270888	WingsOfEagles	General Member of the Public	5	07/31/2014	From the moment I saw the Decorah eaglet hatch, then fledge i was moved to tears of joy and hope. But the day it was injured was tragic for tens of thousands of us as we received word of it's critical injury. If it had not been for the compassion and the sacrificial love, finances, gifts of talent and 24/7 devotion of the members at SOAR, this eaglet would have been a needless casualty and a great loss to our wild life system. We all mount up on wings of eagles in unified spirit when we see the sick and least of these so devotedly cared for by this awesome organization. All you need do is read the entries of thankful thousands to know that they put their finances where there hearts are. Thankyou SOAR FOR KEEPING ME SOARINGIN SPIRIT AS I CHEER ON THOSE WHO WILL ONE DAY FLY HIGHER AND HEALTHIER BECAUSE OF YOUR COMPASSION AND DEDICATION.

I have been amazed at the commitment level to,these beautiful raptors.  This organization goes the distance to not only keep members informed about the progress of the raptors in their care but to educate us along the way.  I look forward to,their daily updates and have learned so much about the avian world.  I am currently in the northeast portion of our country(Maine) but at times feel as though I am on site watching these beautiful raptors because of Soars ability to keep us informed.  Their staff and volunteers are so committed to saving the lives of the birds in their care.  I can't begin to express how much respect I have for them.  They are remarkable, talented people.
Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	208209		/users/profile/270885	shuff1	Donor	5	07/31/2014	This is a great organization that has served all flighted animals with humane and magnificent care.  Kay and her volunteers have educated to many people about lead poisoning and other environmental challenges that face our precious wild life.  They need these funds more than I can say to feed, house and rehabilitate the birds that come into their care.  Their record for recovery and rehabilitation is amazing.  They are such experts and have such a wonderful organization.  These people do it right. They give each patient all of the chances in the world to survive as a wild creature and if that is not possible they give those a chance to live life and be ambossoders for out our wildlife.  Kay has done so much and she deserves this award to help her effort to save birds.  She is amazing and so dedicated.

This is where SOAR came into the picture.  They have been phenomenal from the minute they were contacted to help.  They immediately took possession of the little eagle and have taken great care of him from making sure he is getting the right nutrients to surgery to recovery, all the while, posting updates for us.  Just knowing they are taking care of all the animals they do is such a relief for all of us that are passionate about wildlife.  These animals don't even know how fortunate they are!!
Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	208207		/users/profile/270883	Ellen52	General Member of the Public	5	07/31/2014	Wow, where to begin ... I've been an avid fan of the Raptor Resource Project, following the Decorah Eagles for years. So this year the Decorah eaglets have had an especially difficult time and SOAR has taken one in with a broken wing. So now I'm following the progress of the eaglet and all the other birds they have rescued. SOAR is an amazing organization, educating people of all ages, releasing rehabilitated endangered raptors back into the wild where they belong, giving us hope that future generations will be able to watch in awe the Eagles, Hawks, Osprey, etc. and learn from them. Learn how precious they are and how important it is to save them and their environment. I appreciate SOAR so much. They are under staffed and over worked and their compassion is evident with every update and photo, sharing progress and x rays and introducing us to the amazing surgeons and medical staff and the joy of releasing a bird safe and healthy back to it's natural habitat.
Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	208201		/users/profile/270877	Kevin93	General Member of the Public	5	07/31/2014	S.O.A.R. is an exceptional organization for our avian friends, they do a great work in the bird community by saving injured birds and performing rehabilitation and often releasing birds back to the wild. I am especially thankful for recent rescue of several birds of prey including our National symbol the Bald Eagles, which they currently have at least two they are saving that are this years hatchlings. Our avian community is a very important part of our wildlife resources here in America.

They have built a wonderful network of volunteers in their area, and complete amazing work with few resources.  Their educational programs are a wealth of information to people of all ages, and most importantly, demonstrate the importance and joy of caring for the creatures around us.

They care for injured birds and if possible they return them to the wild, how amazing is that. For SOAR to be recognized would awesome and a gift would be so wisely used. I wish to ask that they be recognized and the work they have done for  the Decorah eagle, Mr. Soar, brings tears of joy and thanks. Saving our precious American symbol is something I push for everyday and Kay doing her ultimate best shows the wonderful folks in this world. Thanks and my vote is a 5+

Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	208157		/users/profile/270835	Tracey17	General Member of the Public	5	07/31/2014	I learned about SOAR when the Decorah Eaglet was rescued from a creek with a broken wing. I began watching the Eagle nest cam at Berry College in GA. When B3 fledged - I needed my eagle fix and found the Decorah nest cam. OMG - 3 babies in one nest!!  I was captivated and became very attached to them - especially the smallest one. I knew in my heart it was too early for the little guy to leave the nest - but there he went anyway - bold, brave and proud. I was devastated to hear that he was injured but very relieved to know that he is in such good hands at SOAR. I check the SOAR patient updates daily and love the pictures they post. I am so very impressed by the level of genuine care and concern that all of the staff have for the critters they care for. Not only do they treat their illness and injury, but they educate the public about the different critters. I would have never known how beautiful a red tailed hawk is if SOAR had not posted pictures of one in their care. Today I learned about baby kestrels they just rescued from a fallen branch in a storm - little tiny baby birds who are not even feathered yet, they are still fluffy fuzz balls! So cute - I had never heard of a kestrel until today. I would not have independently sought out information about different birds without SOAR and I appreciate all that they do to care for the critters who are in need. In my opinion, SOAR is the best non-profit in the world!!

Thanks to SOAR, many have been rescued and rehabbed in order to be released back into the wild.  With no other funds than from donors, SOAR has managed an amazing success rate!  their educational programs are the best.  Without SOAR and other rehab facilities like them, our raptor population would diminish.  Without the educational work they do, children of all ages and adults would not understand the need to safe our raptors for future generations.  it is an exceptional organization!!

I became acquainted with this organization when they became so instrumental in helping with the rescue and recovery of one of our beloved Decorah eagle babies. But in reading their posts and articles available on the Internet they are dedicated to the rescue and recovery of many, many other raptors, young and adult who are hurt or sick. Their work is dedicated and constant. They work tirelessly for hours and hours every single day to help restore these beautiful creatures to the wild where they belong.  They've developed a network of other volunteers to help with transport and medical care when needed. They're excellent at keeping those of us who follow the website updated on the progress and status of those in their care for which we are very thankful.

Since then I have checked out S.O.A.R.'s website and have read numerous stories of their good deeds.  I applaud all of their hard work and dedication to all of the birds that they care for.

Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	208105	1	/users/profile/270785	mariport	General Member of the Public	5	07/31/2014	I'm another fan of the Decorah Bald Eagle family, since 2011, and also of Raptor Resource Project since that time.  IF I hadn't found an unusual feather on the ground (and took a photo of it with my cellphone), next to some large, empty egg shells, on some land up in the north GA mountains I wouldn't have found the Decorah Eagle-cam.  In searching for an ID for the feather, I found the RRP link.  I was hooked on E1 from the moment he hatched.  I'm still hooked.  A few months after I saw that feather I had the privilege of seeing a juvenile Bald Eagle about 12-feet from the window over my kitchen sink.  He was sitting on a dead Dogwood limb at the corner of the deck.  (I've seen a lot of hawks in my backyard during the 26 years I've lived there but none of them compared to the giant-sized raptor who was calmly sitting there looking back at me!) Although I was mesmerized I inched slowly to the right to grab my digital camera and when I inched my way back to try and get a photo he was gone.  But even now I can close my eyes and see him.  It's my wish that every American get to see a beautiful, healthy Bald Eagle during their lifetime.  People at SOAR are doing their part toward making that happen!  Are you?  Donate $$$ today!

I have deep admiration for the professional way they treat their "patients" and for the tireless effort that they exhibit in rescuing all types of raptors.  It seems that they are always available to pick them up and lend a hand where needed.  They have excellent facilities to care for these magnificient creatures and always seem to have room for one more.  From what I have observed, their success with rehabilitation and return to the wild is remarkable.

Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	208090		/users/profile/270773	dfdenglish	Donor	5	07/31/2014	This year is my first experience with tragedy at eagle's nests and have found this organization to be one that steps up and is there to give aid to these creatures unconditionally. The care and concern they show for these birds is outstanding as well as the information shared with the outside community on preservation and protection. They go above and beyond what one would expect. To come on a daily basis to check-in on the patients and see their progress - not always pleasant, but it's LIFE up close and personal. Keep up the good work!
Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	208089	1	/users/profile/270772	Oma S.	Donor	5	07/31/2014	I am an eagleholic!! I watched Mom and Dad Decorah; build their nest, Mom lay each of her three eggs; Mom and Dad take turns incubating their future eaglets for a long time, thru snow, rain and ice; watched with joy as each eaglet "pipped" its way out of the shell. I watched everyday for over 5 months. Unfortunately, our eaglets did not fledge well and one was seriously injured; along came SOAR to the rescue. Our youngest eaglet is in their care for a long term and Kay and her staff are giving our little one tender loving care. SOAR is also sending updates and photos of our wounded eaglet so we can keep up with him. I am so grateful to Bob Anderson of RRP for finding our "baby" and for Kay/SOAR for their incredible loving care. Thanks to both RRP and SOAR.

I often check SOAR's Patient pages to see how current rescues are progressing.  The wide variety of birds rescued, treated and rehabbed by SOAR director Kay Neumann, her staff and volunteers is uplifting; but, as a non-profit there is always a need for funds. Vet fees, test equipment, medicine, flight cages, not to mention food, are just a few of expenses in running rehab facility.  I try to do my bit by buying gas cards to pass out to the volunteers who pick up and deliver injured birds to SOAR a few times a year.Besides caring for all the patients at their facility, SOAR trains and provides Ambassador birds and works with other organizations conducting research, and does education outreach.  Earlier this year was heartbreaking when 13 Eagles were brought in for care and only one survived for release this summer.  SOAR's multi-faceted education efforts to make the public aware of the dangers of lead poisoning are so very important...whether presenting to schools, hunting groups, conservation groups  or making information available on  alternatives to lead hunting and fishing to where lead free ammunition can be purchased.Every year SOAR patient intakes increase...every year the need for funds also increases. 
Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	208087		/users/profile/270770	Susan322	General Member of the Public	5	07/31/2014	As a long time Decorah Eagle nest watcher, I have learned more and more about the ups and downs of the lives of these magestic birds.  This year's almost tragedy was turned to hopefulness by the incredible efforts of SOAR.   Not only 'our' bird was assisted but on a daily basis many new patients are brought in for their excellent professional care.   SOAR is 'high touch' in keeping us Decorah eagle fans informed of progress and that is also greatly appreciated.  They are an incredible resource for our nation.   
Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	208084		/users/profile/270767	Donna161	General Member of the Public	5	07/31/2014	The people at SOAR are a phenomenal caring, time giving group of people helping those avians that need it.   These birds are amazing creatures and living with the issues of the modern world and be somewhat dangerous, deadly and trying.    There also ought to be some advantages to it also.  This non - profit group is one of the BEST advantages.   They rescue, nurse, feed and make the public aware of the wonderful birds around us.   THEY DESERVE  10 STARS for their love and dedication to the birds they are helping.   They also take care of people like myself by giving us wonderful updates to their activities and giving us opportunities to make the environment a better place for these magnificent animals. YEAH TO SOAR - SAVING OUR AVIAN RESOURCES------------ AND THEY ARE!!!!!!!!!!

Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	208079		/users/profile/270761	susan60050	General Member of the Public	5	07/31/2014	Watched Decorah Eagles from eggs to fledge when one of our eaglets was found injured.  SOAR came to the rescue and helped this eaglet.  I learned by following the young eaglet all the work and energy they use to save our birds.  
Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	208078		/users/profile/270759	Sandy72	General Member of the Public	5	07/31/2014	I came upon the Raptor Resource Project on Facebook.  I was given an awesome opportunity to watch and learn about Decorah Eagles.  I watched the parents raise the juvies and when they fledged, D 20 was found with a broken wing.  They called SOAR to help with the juvie.  They shared his injuries with us and the care and love the eaglet was receiving was incredible.  I did not know they (SOAR) existed, but thru this, I have learned much about eagles, falcons, and their goals for these wonderful beautiful birds they care for and help return them to their natural surroundings. Thanks is not enough to give, but loving is more.  That is what SOAR offers. Love, experience, knowledge.

I was amazed at the thoroughness and extent of their work with our eaglet and with all their other many patients, and also at the outreach and education programs they maintain.  Each patient is individual and important to them, and, inevitably, to anyone who is exposed to their programs.  Through their programs people are not only made aware of the obstacles birds in the wild face--both from nature but largely from man--but also of the value of each life.  In spite of limited manpower, they go above and beyond to do all they can for their patients--and for us who get involved with them.

The people who work there spend their lives dedicated to this cause. They are all truly wonderful stewards of society and help keep our birds of prey alive with wonderful people working to keep our future birds of prey population alive. They also promote great educational programs for the public.  Wonderful people;  great cause!!!

Being that one of the fledglings is now in their care, I have become much more aware of the amazing and wonderful work they do.  I am also a volunteer with the NH Audubon Society and have been working with their eagle and raptor projects for a number of years now, so SOAR means a great deal to me, knowing that these magnificent birds can be cared for so well, and hopefully released to the wild again.  Thank you for all you do!!

I have been following them since. They do so much for our raptor families and it is good to know they are out there watching over such magnificent creatures. I can only imagine the countless hours they put in to care for them.  No dime is spared with them.....they do everything in their power to make sure these birds take flight once again. Thank you SOAR for taking care of "Four" and all the other amazing raptors!!

Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	208063		/users/profile/270750	gojeffie	Donor	5	07/31/2014	I first became aware of SOAR through the Raptor Resource Project. My eyes were really opened to the many injured birds needing help (many because of humans).  SOAR is a great source for information concerning many birds. When patients are admitted, they explain the reason for their admission and leave updates on their condition. The birds final outcome, both good or bad are also reported (some are released back to the wild & some do not make it). I am amazed at the amount of birds that are successfully released (many with pictures & videos)! They give these birds every chance possible to recover and fly free. Birds not able to be released are used in educating the public about these raptors and the many problems facing them in the wild. They explain what the public can do to help prevent these birds sicknesses and injuries. I am in awe of what these people do for our raptors. I recommend SOAR if you are looking for a great non-profit to support!
Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	208062		/users/profile/270748	carewolf10	General Member of the Public	5	07/31/2014	If SOAR only cured the animals that come to their door they would be doing an incredible job. But they do far more. They educate also. This is a wonderful organization and they deserve all the support we can get them. I didn't know much about the problem of lead until i learned about it from SOAR. They are not only helping the injured-they are educating us all and perhaps a few less will be disabled or killed by lead poisoning. Thank You SOAR for ALL that you do.

Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	208057		/users/profile/270733	c123xyz	Donor	5	07/31/2014	Along with many other eagle watchers, I became aware of SOAR when they took in an injured eaglet from Decorah, Iowa.  The care given to the eaglet was excellent including surgery to repair his broken wing.  They also provide updates and education to the many concerned Decorah eagle fans with patience, grace and humor.  Now, we all need to realize that this famous eaglet is by no means their only patient.  SOAR rescues and rehabilitates raptors from throughout western Iowa.  Unfortunately, they are very busy with sick and injured birds. When not tending to patients, SOAR is also working to reintroduce osprey to Iowa.  They provide education to the public using educational ambassadors - birds who were too badly injured to be released back to the wild.  They work to get the word out on how people can help reduce bird injuries and deaths through things such as switching to non-lead shot and tackle (to prevent lead poisoning which kills many eagles) and making windows and power poles less dangerous to birds.  I learned about most of these issues/efforts through SOAR's excellent website.

I have only one adjective to describe this group of selfless, intelligent, uber-caring individuals  and it is "WOW." I am amazed by this organization and all the good they do for our avian friends and those who love them through their educational outreach. I only hope that they always receive more than adequate financial help to continue their work. The world would be a much sadder place for all, human and animal, without this group of dedicated staff members and volunteers.

We have followed the life journey of the Decorah eagles and when one of the juvenile eagles suffered a broken wing, SOAR was there every step of the way to care for this special bird. They have kept us very informed of the eagle's recovery process through posts and pictures. What an outstanding learning experience for my class. We have also been able to learn about the other birds cared for through this nonprofit and the educational programs they provide. We have learned so much through the expertise and kindness of this group. They have made a lifetime impact on all of us.

Especially thankful for their assistance with all who have been affected this year because of the weather, gnats and such with the eagles.
Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	208039		/users/profile/238614	Fenrian	Donor	5	07/31/2014	I've known about SOAR for several years now, and admire their work greatly.  Eagles and other raptors have gotten a lot of public awareness lately because of the webcams that many organizations have installed at nests.  However, in most cases, these organizations use these cameras for public relations to aid their fundraising, and do not actually perform any service that in any way aids the creatures being viewed.SOAR is the antithesis of that.  They have no web cam.  They have no fan clubs on Facebook.  They just do their work at rehabilitating injured or lead-poisoned raptors, and only are able to fund-raise by going out and educating at small events when they have one or more of their patients to release back into the wild as a "draw".  While webcams bring adulation to the point of deification to those who operate them, Kay Neumann, Linette Bernard, Terrie Miller Hoefer, and the small, but dedicated team that works, without compensation, with them have never sought personal recognition.  They just do the job, and when they do publicize what they do, make it about the accomplishments---and the failures---and not about those who are doing such.
Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	189652		/users/profile/238614	Fenrian	Donor	5	12/01/2013	Ok, I'm not exactly unbiased here.  But, as a person who almost never gives to "causes", I'm proud to have done a tiny bit on this organization's behalf.  The work they do for their patients, and in educating the public has already been spoken of here by others with far more eloquence than I possess.

Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	208016		/users/profile/270704	bjames461	Donor	5	07/31/2014	I recently became aware of Soar, when one of our Decorah eaglets was found injured with a broken wing and other injuries.  They just happened to be there at the time and took the eaglet to their facility and have provided surgery and excellent care of her.  They are excellent in providing updates on all Avian's that come into their care.  This year has been especially bad due to all the gnats and weather.  They also are a teaching facility for all to understand what they do and the process of rehabilitating the ones that they can and then return them to their natural enviroments.  I have donated to their cause and hope many more will do the same.  With the influx of patients this year they are surely in need of our support.

I read more about them and what they were doing.  I believed enough in what they were doing to begin sending them a monthly donation to help out.  I know that it is not a large operation and they can use money.  They also are active in doing education by giving programs using their educational birds.    Now people from all over the world have heard about SOAR since they received one of the famous eaglets from Decorah.  The poor thing has a broken wing and we all feel better knowing that he is in kind, loving hands.      One of their goals is also to let the world know about lead poisoning and the consequences of it.

The fact that they also educate the public on issues such as the hazards of lead in the environment and the importance of raptors in helping to keep nature in balance makes them noble ambassadors. And their dedication to conservation and research makes them heroes. They speak up for the magnificent birds whose voices most people ignore or cannot seem to hear. I give to SOAR because I trust that Kay and her team will use my money to make a positive difference. They love what they do, and they are passionate about every aspect of their work. Being a bird lover, I am so very grateful for their dedication. Last year I attended one of SOAR's seasonal raptor releases, and in the drawing I was chosen to release one of the rehabilitated birds, a male juvenile kestrel. I was thrilled to see this handsome fellow up close, but when he escaped my gloved hands and took to the sky, I was so excited to see him able to return to the wild, where he belongs. That was an experience I will never forget. It made a difference in my life, and it was life changing for that kestrel. Because of Kay and SOAR, he and many other raptors are flying free once again. Thank you, Kay and all the other tireless SOAR staff and volunteers!

Became very interested in SOAR as they took one of our eagles with a broken wing and other injuries and are caring for her.  SOAR in Iowa is a wonderful, nonprofit organization who loving cares for many injured animals, birds.  They work very hard to return them to the wild while keeping them without causing these creatures to become dependent on humans for their existence.   The Vet, Kay, and all the dedicated volunteers at SOAR in Iowa, are very special indeed!!   Bless them for all they do.   
Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	208005		/users/profile/270694	Annie5371	General Member of the Public	5	07/31/2014	This organization is amazing. They first came to my attention when one of this year hatch of Decorah Bald Eagles broke his wing and he went to SOAR. They are taking wonderful care of him.  You can read about their organization at their website www.soar.org.  They are very caring and put the birds first. 
Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	208000		/users/profile/270691	Patty39	Donor	5	07/31/2014	I became aware of SOAR after one of the Decorah Eagles went down and was taken to SOAR for help and recovery.  I have watched their website and have become very familiar with the work that they do through their website.  The time, patience and dedication of these folks is umatchable (they are right up there with Raptor Resources).  I think its extemely important that we have nonproft groups such as SOAR in saving some of our most protect birds.  Without them there would be a greater loss to those protected birds and because of their dediction, and assistance with other organizations that work with our raptors, we may be able to take these raptors off our endangered lists.  
Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	207998		/users/profile/270689	Sabine S.	Donor	5	07/31/2014	I have been watching SOAR closely from Germany since watching the Decorah eagles. I cannot believe how well organised and selflessly SOAR takes care of all raptors big or small. Their network of volunteers is unbelievable. SOAR is a top rate non-profit organisation that holds word over and above the duty of call. Another 5 star service provided by SOAR is the fact that they diligently report on all their patients, which I am sure entails burning the midnight oil a lot of nights, what with all the patient care required during the day.

Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	207996		/users/profile/270687	Faith K.	General Member of the Public	5	07/31/2014	I first learned of SOAR after watching the Decorah Eagles in Iowa for the past 3 years.  They have a nest cam & you can watch the eggs being laid, incubated, and eventually hatch and the eaglets being fed and nurtured by their devoted parents.  It's like you're a part of the eagle family!  This year was a terrible year in Iowa - snow storms, wind storms, rain storms, and the eagles suffered through it all.  After the first two eagles fledged, the third was pretty much alone in the nest (he/she was about 1 week later than the other 2) & the parents were busy with the fledglings as well as watching the nestling & keeping it fed.  Personally, I think he/she got lonely with no one on the nest & fledged too early.  The "baby" was found on a sandbar in the middle of a creek & SOAR came to the rescue, finding that the eaglet had a broken wing.  It was our little D20 as it was called in the beginning.  All of us eagle watchers were glued to our computers for updates on "our" baby and were pleasantly surprised by this wonderful organization of people who care so much for injured avians.  They lovingly cared for the juvie, with X-rays, surgery, tender care, fresh food and most of all, love!  I couldn't have picked a better place if it had been my own child that had been injured.  They are caring for the eaglet (and many other injured avians) & keep all of us watchers posted as to their progress.  And amazingly so, all of these people are volunteers!  They deserve 5 stars and hope everyone reading this will go to their Facebook page and see all the good they are doing!

I often check SOAR's Patient pages to see how current rescues are progressing.  The wide variety of birds rescued, treated and rehabbed by SOAR director Kay Neumann, her staff and volunteers is uplifting; but, as a non-profit there is always a need for funds. Vet fees, test equipment, medicine, flight cages, not to mention food, are just a few of expenses in running rehab facility.  I try to do my bit by buying gas cards to pass out to the volunteers who pick up and deliver injured birds to SOAR a few times a year.Besides caring for all the patients at their facility, SOAR trains and provides Ambassador birds and works with other organizations conducting research, and does education outreach.  Earlier this year was heartbreaking when 13 Eagles were brought in for care and only one survived for release this summer.  SOAR's multi-faceted education efforts to make the public aware of the dangers of lead poisoning are so very important...whether presenting to schools, hunting groups, conservation groups  or making information available on  alternatives to lead hunting and fishing to where lead free ammunition can be purchased.Every year SOAR patient intakes increase...every year the need for funds also increases. 
Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	207995		/users/profile/270686	Talkoh	General Member of the Public	5	07/31/2014	The spring storms and an influx of gnats resulted in a great number of injuries to many birds including one of the famed decorah juvenile eagles. SOAR has been in overdrive tending to the influx of avian patients. Not only is their care and dedication top notch, they also take the time to post pictures and updates of some of the birds' progress.  The avian patients at SOAR are lucky to be in such good hands.

Teaching our next generation what they are all about in hopes that it will be a better place for them tomorrow.  Helping each and every one that comes to their facility with compassion and great dedication. It truly warms the Heart, they give 200%( maybe more ) to the rescue rehabilitation and release to all. Making sure that they are here on this earth for a long time.

Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	207976		/users/profile/270670	dixiedorena	General Member of the Public	5	07/31/2014	Like many people, I discovered SOAR by accident in July 2014 when they took in one of the Decorah eaglets. The Decorah eagles have been an internet phenomenon for the past several years, allowing hundreds of thousands of people around the world to watch an active eagle nest while the young birds hatch, grow, and fledge. This summer, one of the young eagles left the nest too early and was discovered in a nearby stream with a broken wing. The on-site volunteers (Raptor Resource Project) rescued the bird and handed him off to SOAR, thereby introducing 100,000+ followers to this amazing bird rescue facility.       In our ignorance, we thought our injured eaglet would be the center of attention at SOAR until the magnitude of their work became clear. SOAR routinely has 1-2 dozen raptors (mostly osprey, eagles, and hawks) that they are nursing back to health. These birds get expert care and medical attention with the goal of releasing them back into the wild. That alone is a heroic effort.      But in addition to rehabilitation, SOAR has an active education program teaching people about these remarkable birds. They also are engaged in a campaign to remove lead from ammunition since many birds become ill from lead poisoning. One of their special projects is a partnership with the Iowa Department of Natural Resources and other raptor rescue groups to reintroduce osprey nesting in the region.      They do this amazing work out of a nondescript building in rural Iowa where they have a surgery, intensive care rooms, and flight pens where birds can strengthen their wings before release. They work closely with federal and state agencies and other non-profits. The seamless way in which 'our' injured eaglet was passed off to SOAR is a testament to the collaborative ways these raptor protection agencies work together.       Like many other fans of the Decorah eagles, I was amazed to learn of the expert medical and rehabilitation care that hundreds of raptors receive at SOAR. This phenomenal agency flies under the radar, filing a critical niche in raptor rescue that many bird fans have never considered. They are heroes.

Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	207969		/users/profile/270665	roserugby	General Member of the Public	5	07/31/2014	SAOR does outstanding work helping injured Birds of Pray recover from life threatening injuries. I have read many stories where their volunteers will go out in all kinds of weather at all times of the day to rescue injured birds. The most incredible thing is that they are able to do their work will serious cash flow challenges as many of the bird in their care require long term rehabilitation with lots of costly visits to the Vet. My view is the best non profits are the ones that help others (humans or animals) unconditionally and SOAR fits this bill.

Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	207934		/users/profile/270632	Kelly132	General Member of the Public	5	07/31/2014	I became familiar with SOAR over the last couple years while watching the Decorah Eagles.  I began seeing them referenced in stories of our eaglets that had been injured and other raptor's who had been injured, poisoned by lead, plagued by parasites etc.  This year when they took in one of the Decorah eaglets with a broken wing I have been following more closely.  The work these folks do is wonderful...Their knowledge of the patients in their care is exemplary!  Many of the raptor's taken in are successfully released back in to the wild.    I think they are great!  Wish I lived closer because I would love to be a volunteer and help them out!

General Member of the Public	5	07/31/2014	I have just recently become aware of S.O.A.R., because I watch the Decorah Eagles nest and one of this years eaglets was injured (a broken wing).  I know little about what it takes to care for these injured animals and get them ready to be released back in to the wild-which is where they belong! SOAR does a great job and can always use financial resources, so if you are looking for a way to help an injured raptor, this is a great place to donate! 
Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	207931		/users/profile/270628	Joyce41	Donor	5	07/31/2014	I had been following a Facebook website concerning the eagles in Decorah, Iowa.  I learned about SOAR when they became involved in treating one of the eaglets who had broken its wing.  I have been so impressed with the work being done through SOAR, and I have become one of their biggest fans.   I became a donor after learning about them in this way.

Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	189658		/users/profile/247570	Mizpharmer	Volunteer	5	12/01/2013	I have become one of SOAR's biggest fans and supporters, initially because my husband had introduced me to their amazing work and spirit towards raptors and wildlife.  Since then, I had the privilege to meet the inspirational and tireless folks who organize and sustain this wonderful organization. I quickly found out how much they do- not just rescue and save raptors, but they EDUCATE and advocate! I had the ultimate honor of attending a public educational session with Thora and Bella and screech owls that were re-released back into the wild after SOAR had rehabbed them from injury. I look forward to begin a volunteer for this organization for many years  to come and to bring their messages and teachings to our corner of the country. Thank you and bless you, the wonderful folks at SOAR! 
Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	189651		/users/profile/247565	MAL13	Donor	5	12/01/2013	I admire SOAR from Connecticut.  I have followed their works and deeds and find them outstanding.  To see people so dedicated and hardworking for the avian population is heartwarming.  The life re-given to avian species and especially raptors is a gift to the environment, and to all of us.  Thank you SOAR!
Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	189561		/users/profile/247453	brandonw	General Member of the Public	5	11/29/2013	SOAR is a wonderful non-profit organization that helps the avian population. Their employees and volunteers are dedicated and passionate human beings. Kay Neumann has done an outstanding job in the rehabilitation of countless raptors. Kay has provided the public with education and has been a voice for a population that cannot speak.
Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	189557		/users/profile/247444	Terrie H.	Volunteer	5	11/29/2013	I find this review very hard to write. The reason I find it difficult is because I am afraid that my words won't convey the importance of SOAR's work and the quality and dedication of that work.  SOAR is Kay. Kay is a wildlife biologist. Kay is a falconer. Kay is an environmental educator and Kay is a wildlife rehabilitator. Kay spends her days tirelessly rescuing and treating sick and injured birds. She recycled a building that was donated by the city of Manning, Iowa and had it torn down and rebuilt saving money and saving the building from ending up in a landfill. Kay treats and cares for every bird. She rescues them, diagnoses them, and takes them to the vet for x-rays and further diagnoses. Every day she medicates and feeds every patient and every education ambassador. She cleans the pens and flight cage. Birds poo a lot!  Kay also has a husband and two children. She takes care of them too and they also help her out with the birds. Her children are turning into really neat adults. They have obviously learned from their parents.  But even with the tasks of SOAR, and raising a family Kay helped with the re-introduction of Osprey into Iowa. She has traveled with the Iowa DNR to collect young osprey and brought them back to Iowa making sure all are healthy before they are placed in their nest boxes. They have been banded and observed, cared for and released. Because of her help and expertise the re-introductions have continued. Kay cares very deeply for every animal and she doesn't just treat a bird but learns every bird. Because of her knowledge and expertise she was able to discover why SOAR was and is treating lead poisoned Bald Eagles. Kay realized that Bald Eagles with lead poisoning spiked right at the beginning of deer hunting season. With her dedication to research as well as her ability to increase the value of the research by organizing all Iowa rehabilitators to test Bald Eagles it was soon shown that lead fragments from hunting deer in Iowa was most likely the cause. Ever since; SOAR has been educating hunters, hunter education instructors, and the general public about this danger to Eagles and to humans.   I am in awe of her intelligence, her dedication and her ability to get an amazing amount of work done. I have had the pleasure of knowing Kay since 1990 and have been a volunteer for SOAR for almost ten years. I have helped hold a bird while she draws blood, force feeds and medicates. I have transported birds and helped with the osprey re-introduction. I have had the wonderful opportunity of helping to educate others which as an environmental educator is my love, and I have even cleaned cages! Kay's selflessness, hard work, and dedication inspires SOAR volunteers like myself and as a result being a volunteer for SOAR is very rewarding. SOAR is truely a non-profit in every sense of the word. SOAR is dedication and expertise.I struggle to hit the "submit" button because my writing ability is unfortunately not a skill I can claim as something I do well. I would have to continue writing for quite a while to totally cover all that SOAR is and does.  Fortunately we have a web site that our fabulous volunteer Linette keeps pretty up to date and a visit there will help you get some idea of the work that is done by SOAR. Check out the work SOAR does at www.soarraptors.org!
Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	169456		/users/profile/224546	Victor  Webber	Volunteer	5	09/12/2013	I have volunteered for SOAR and Kay Neumann since 2007. I have been involved with the reintroduction of Osprey back into central Iowa, and after 7years there have been some sightings but none better than this year. This Spring an Osprey was seen at Whiterock Conservancy, Coon Rapids, and then I saw one in August at Swan Lake Carroll Co., flying and eating with the young ones. It's been a long  process but worth it. That's the dedication SOAR and Kay have, as with the rescue and rehabilitation of injured and poisoned raptors, mostly Bald Eagles with lead poisoning in the winter months,  which brings us to SOAR and Kay's  biggest uphill battle, getting LEAD out of hunting and fishing. Every event she is at she is very passionate about the issue and will not quit until legislature steps up and "BITES THE BULLET" like they did with other LEAD issues. Kay is very dedicated to her commitment to care and repair of any damaged Raptor. The biggest thrill is when there is a Raptor release event like the one Sept 1st when 5 Raptors were released back into the wild. 2 American Kestrels, 2 Red-Tail Hawks and  a Young Bald Eagle. What an event.Victor Webber.
Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	303744	5	/users/profile/270988	ShiK,	Donor	5	09/12/2016	I have been a fan, a follower, of SOAR since Ambassador Decorah was first brought to them by Bob Anderson after being rescued.  I often check SOAR's Patient pages to see how current rescues are progressing.  The wide variety of birds rescued, treated and rehabbed by SOAR director Kay Neumann, her staff and volunteers is uplifting; but, as a non-profit there is always a need for funds. Vet fees, test equipment, medicine, flight cages, not to mention food, are just a few of expenses in running rehab facility.  I try to do my bit by buying gas cards to pass out to the volunteers who pick up and deliver injured birds to SOAR a few times a year.Besides caring for all the patients at their facility, SOAR trains and provides Ambassador birds and works with other organizations conducting research, and does education outreach.  Earlier this year was heartbreaking when 13 Eagles were brought in for care and only one survived for release this summer.  SOAR's multi-faceted education efforts to make the public aware of the dangers of lead poisoning are so very important...whether presenting to schools, hunting groups, conservation groups  or making information available on  alternatives to lead hunting and fishing to where lead free ammunition can be purchased.Every year SOAR patient intakes increase...every year the need for funds also increases. 
Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	169443		/users/profile/224531	Megan54	Volunteer	5	09/12/2013	I was fortunate enough to grow up in the Carroll County area and as a child and into my high school years I saw Kay and various bird ambassadors at programs. Little did I know that when I returned to the area after college to become an associate naturalist with Carroll County Conservation I would once again be in touch with this great organization and eventually working there myself! In 2011-2012 I worked as an intern for SOAR. I was able to find my life passion of helping raptors and became very involved in the non-toxic/non-lead ammunition movement. Kay will always be a lifelong friend and mentor as I now work with raptors at my current job in Minnesota and plan on acquiring my own education birds in the future. Without SOAR many raptors would become victims to lead poisoning, not returned to the wild to fly free and people of west central Iowa would not be informed of the good they do for the ecosystem and how they can help them!

Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	155810		/users/profile/206765	Sherri W.	General Member of the Public	5	04/23/2013	Two years ago I did not even know SOAR existed.  After the Decorah eagles went viral, I became more interested in birds of prey.  My sister met Kay and eventually we ended up at Kay's home and SOAR's home for a tour.  Kay could not have been more kind and patient.  She explained how the process works from intake to release or education bird.  Her work is endless and she is such a dedicated person.  We had a family day (The Great Outdoors) last year in May and Kay brought two birds over for it.  The children, especially, and the parents were fascinated with them and she brought a new awareness of raptors to the entire group.  I'm not sure how she handles the workload, but her energy and attitude are contagious and her face shines with pride when she has a "baby" ready for release.  I am sure that she struggles to make ends meet, but she never gives up.  I am truly honored to know her and I am in awe of her tireless work.

The work Kay does with SOAR is amazing.  Her dedication to the cause far exceeds just getting the wildlife back to health, but she also lobbies and fights for their well being out on the wild.  Dedicating your life to this kind work takes a lot of patience, as well as a lot of personal time, energy, and funds.  Wildlife depends on people like Kay and places like SOAR to fight for their rights and give them a voice.  Thank you SOAR for all you do!

The bird releases, seminars, and education sessions I have attended draw many individuals and families.  You can see the inspiration for adults and the awe in the faces of the kids when they are learning and releasing.  SOAR also does a lot of necessary public education on environmentalism, conservation and the dangers of lead poisoning. 
Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	104089		/users/profile/139507	nanimal	Donor	5	01/21/2012	I learned about SOAR though my involvement with the Raptor Resource Project Decorah Eagles Nest cam.   When forum members and readers heard about an injured juvenile eagle named DJ, I became aware of SOAR.  As I now follow their story on their website, I continue to be amazed by the compassionate rehabilitation services they provide to raptors as well as the education they provide to the general public.  Im particularly gratified to see SOAR as leaders in the campaign again lead in ammunition and fishing tackle. Its clear to me that SOAR is fortunate to have an exceptional director in Kay Neumann, whose compassion and expertise was evident in all of the communications within the Raptor Resource forum.  With dwindling habitat and protections threatened for all wildlife, we need SOAR now more than ever!

Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	103984		/users/profile/139308	NaturalistHenry	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/20/2012	I am a naturalist for one of the counties in Iowa. I am a professional- although not really expert, but am learning. Being a government facility, we have the privilege of housing rehabilitated raptors for use in environmental education programs. All our raptors have come from SOAR. Her passion and ease of working with her has made our experience phenomenal. Kay Neumann is very down to earth and is always willing to educate and help in our effort to care for these birds. She follows up with wanting photos from our facility to make sure they are doing well and are housed in an appropriate environment. She truly cares about animals and even talks me into taking more than one bird of a kind at a time so they have "friends." She is very diligent in making me understand the bird's injury and limitations so I can provide the best care for them. She is genuine and honest and I admire her dedication to her work and look forward to working with her fr years to come.
Saving Our Avian Resources S O A R	103967		/users/profile/139283	cosbyboy1	General Member of the Public	5	01/20/2012	SOAR is one of Iowa's best kept secrets.   They do so much for the environment and the raptor population in this state that I am amazed they are not on the front page every week.   Kay Neumann's diligence and dedication are from the heart, but the care and treatment her facility offers are state of the art.   And she drives all over the state to transport sick and injured raptors.   If only lead poisoning were not a factor, SOAR would have much less to do.   The heartbreak and disappointment when recovery is impossible would stop most of us, but Kay and her team hang in there, keep on going and I don't know how they do it.   With a combination of good science, devotion, a little luck and some donations, this group of rehabbers has brought attention to careless, unnecessary infliction of injury on birds of prey in Iowa.   Her shoestring non-profit budget could always use a boost, I am sure.   I donate a little as is possible, but do so confidently knowing that there is no waste and that all funds go to the cause, not to frills.    SOAR is truly a gem of an organization.   Thank you Kay and Linette and your families and friends, the volunteers and the community of raptor enthusiasts that helps them do their work.

They kept us updated almost everyday in some way on the progress of DJ.  We were provided pictures, personal e-mails, updates on the forum and most of all, kept the tone of the treatment of this juvie encouraging.  There is no doubt that SOAR really cares for their "patients".  They say a picture is worth a thousand words, but if you saw the picture of Kay when she handed over the juvie to the man's son to be released, the look of love and passion on her face was worth more than words or money.  It brought tears to my eyes.  Thank you SOAR for being there for our wildlife.

As an educator I have brought classes to tour Kay's Raptor Hospital, and had her present in outdoor areas, at times when she has a hawk or an owl to release.  The impact she has on students in my classes as well as other Iowa citizens is beyond measure.

The professionalism, combined with the care shown for the animals, is evident by the demand for programs.  SOAR's dedication to education is obvious to anyone who has the fortune of crossing paths with this group.  Whether it's from experiencing a program with live birds, reading an educational flyer, scouring an interpretational sign somewhere around that state that SOAR was a part of, or through an encounter via local or state-wide media, SOAR's mission, dedication, and passion are undeniable.   This tiny little Mighty Mouse of a nonprofit deserves recognition, as well as the opportunity to fulfill its gigantic potential to grow.  Should that happen, SOAR will only continue to change the hearts and minds of thousands of people for the betterment of our entire planet.

SOAR now seems to be recognized as the "go-to" place for rehabilitation of raptors found injured in Iowa, and even in neighboring states.  The chelation therapy they are able to perform to reduce lead levels has saved the life of many birds.  In addition to the actual physical services they perform on these birds, I deeply appreciate their efforts in bringing about public awareness of the lead-poisoning that is now posing a threat to raptor populations.

Does not work with many Iowa Rescues to save lives. Mislabeling animals for excuses to kill them.Too much nepotism with Tom, Josh and Carol Colvin all on the payroll directly or indirectly.Not transparent with the public. Adopting an animal from any facility does not make them a loving, compassionate place. Transparency and allowing what goes on behind closed doors with high save numbers and working with all to protect and save animals is what makes a 4 star place as there are no 5 stars facility as no one is perfect.

The staff, volunteers, & foster families are some of the most caring & hard working people around. People seem to have heard that the ARL of Iowa won't turn an animal in need away, other shelter can't say that. No matter how packed the facility becomes (& how many foster homes they continue to look for  now & in the future) they continue to struggle & continue to overcome the challenges of major overcrowding.  I am deeply grateful for the policy of the ARL  which is TO NEVER PUT DOWN AN ADOPTABLE ANIMAL.  Cats especially have remained in their care for over a year because they have not been adopted out yet, in no way, shape or form makes them any less valuable of a special animal in need of a chance for them & the ARL will continue to do their best to keep that animal in a home like surrounding until such time that the lucky day comes that the animal finds it's "furever" home & there is a place for everyone!!

We stopped at the ARL one Sunday to "just look" and ended up with our cat. She was a year old, mistreated by her previous owners and in need of a forever family. An ARL person took us to a small room to "test out"some cats. They were all great, but this little one was special. She was so ugly and skinny and needy that we could not resist her. That same person came back and then told us the cat was also deaf. That sealed our deal!  The people at ARL were so good with us. They helped us understand kitty and her deafness. They gave us helpful hints to work with kitty. As we completed the adoption process, everyone was so kind and we could tell that they really did love their work and their animal clients!Since the adoption we have donated monthly and have purchased food for them a couple times. We so appreciate what they did for us and for all the animals that need help. Bless them!

Volunteers were quick to answer questions about the animals and quickly got us into a bonding room to meet with the cat that we ended up adopting.  They told us everything they knew about her, which isn't much since she was a stray.  The ARL even had a promotion going on that every striped cat had an adoption fee of $25, and our sweet girl had stripes.  The staff took us through the whole adoption process as our cat got one last look over by the vet.  We got a whole folder of information about good vets in the area to do a free first checkup and other information about the cat.  My family thanks the ARL for helping us find our feline friend!  We've had Minerva for a little over a year and couldn't be happier.  She's blossomed into a lap cat who loves people and greets everyone at the door.  The ARL does great things for the state of Iowa and I hope they continue for many years to come.

It was a very difficult decision for us to let him go, but we knew he would be at peace. But when we looked at ways to memorialize him, we found everything to be VERY expensive, until we found out that the ARL of Iowa would cremate him and return his ashes to us at a very affordable rate. We were thrilled. And they were so sensitive and caring throughout the process, as well as sending us a lovely letter letting us know that they understood our grief and when we were ready, a chance to meet a new friend through another adoption. So after we grieved the loss of our dear Winston, we went to the ARL of Iowa and met our new dog, Chip. We've had support from the ARL throughout the process of getting to know our new dog too. A great organization that deserves recognition for the work they do to keep people and their pets together, forever.

We have been so incredibly lucky to have found 3 furever friends there. Our first was Smokey, we adopted him at 1 1/2 yrs old and had him all the way up till he was 14. The second one we got was Cuddles and she lived up to her name. We had her for 13 years (we lost her 5 years after Smokey) and when it came time to make the hard choice to help her out of her misery we took her back to the ARL. They were AMAZING! The compassion they showed to not only us but her also was like no other! When I was finally ready to find a new furever friend I KNEW exactly where I would go, and that is how we came to have Lily in our family. They are so great in making sure that their pets are a good fit, not only with the people but with the other fur babies in the home! I can't imagine looking for a new friend anywhere else but the ARL of Iowa!!!
Animal Rescue League of Iowa, Inc.	129134		/users/profile/174482	Jessica77	Client Served	5	10/25/2012	Twice over the last 22 years my husband and I have adopted dogs from the ARL. The first was a German Shepherd mix named Smokey. We already had a Cocker Spaniel and the two of them hit it off right from the start. They were inseperable until the day that the Cocker Spaniel was called to the rainbow Bridge. We noticed almost immediatly that Smokey seemed sad. He didn't play, he barely even ate. We spoke with the nice people at the ARL to get ideas on what we could do for him and when nothing seemed to work we decided to see if we could find him a new friend. We knew that we would not go anywhere but the ARL and even though we were in search of a smaller breed we came home with a Great Dane mix named Cuddles. I never in a million years would have thought that I was going to have that sized fur baby but one look into her eyes and it was love at first sight. In 2003 Smokey went to the rainbow bridge and having such a wonderful dog in Cuddles helped us all get through the grief. We lost Cuddles this year and although we still are not ready to adopt another we know that when we are ready there won't be anywhere else that we will look. We will head right out to the ARL and find another fur baby looking for a forever home and we know that the perfect baby will be there.

When I adopted my dog I felt that they really took the time to make sure we were a good fit for her. That made me feel comfortable donating to them, and I hope they continue that still. We check ARL all the time for what dogs are up for adoption, and though we aren't ready for a new dog quite yet, they are a great resource for us to determine what kind of dog will be best.

While looking for my cats, they were helpful, cared for future cat as if it were their own, which I believe is where their mind sets are, each animal in their selter is one of their personal family members. After finding the perfect cat they did a medical evaluation, which was thorough and when it came time to take my furry friend to my personal vet, there were no surprises. This is when I decided to start volunteering. As a volunteer, they gave us proper training which enabled us to give a five star experience for other potental adoptive families. Volunteering at the ARL of Iowa is one of the best experiences of my life. The look on new parents to new furbabies is one of the best looks, feelings in the world.

Animal Rescue League of Iowa, Inc.	224984	3	/users/profile/288756	ARL-Warning	General Member of the Public	1	10/22/2014	While visiting Des Moines from out of state, I left my dog in his mobile kennel while I attempted to have breakfast at a local diner. His safe and secure place while traveling is the canopy covered bed of my truck which has large sliding windows on three sides for adequate ventilation, and plenty of fresh water in a spill proof container--and although it was early July, there was a breeze and the sky was completely overcast. I am a very responsible pet owner and determined that he was at no risk of heat stress. Moreover, his mobile kennel complies with the definition of "adequate shelter" in Des Moines muni code Section 18.1. However, someone complained and an arrogant, young ARL officer lied about the temp in the truck and was generally very hostile and assertive. After I told her I planned to file a complaint with her supervisor, she called DMPD and had me arrested for disorderly conduct. The next day when I attempted to file my complaint against her, I was arrested again for animal abuse even though I had obeyed her order to remove my dog from his safe place and abandon him in a frightening restaurant basement that had not been checked for rodent poisons or other potentially lethal hazards.  Moral of the story: ARL does not accept complaints against their employees. If you try to complain be prepared to be falsely charged and arrested--these people are very vindictive and well connected. (The ARL director is married to the ARL board chair, and his son is the animal control officer supervisor!)
Animal Rescue League of Iowa, Inc.	191662	2	/users/profile/250156	Brenda52	General Member of the Public	1	12/26/2013	The ARL has always been the best when rescuing animals, great program to help spay and neutering, program to supply food and leases for low income, training programs to help people learn how to take care of and train their pets.   The beautiful birds that they recently acquired is a different story!  Cannot believe they are requiring $20 to fill out a application....to see if you can adopt?   The ARL must of called and got the price sheet at the pet stores because ARL prices are about the same.   They also have not researched all of the Parrot Rescues which are bursting at the seams because people buy birds and do not educate themselves.   The real problem is there are not many parrot rescues in Iowa.   I question why did the ARL choose to sell these birds at pet store prices and the only reason I can figure out is to generate money for that shiny new building!

We take in approximately 19,000 animals a year. And that is not only dogs and cats but everything from alligators to injured wildlife. We never turn a needy animal away and then make every effort to find it a forever home or a sanctuary for it to be cured. We also go into our community to help needy families keep their pets by offering micro-chipping, vaccines and spay and neutering. Which leads less homeless animals, by keeping them in their homes and preventing unwanted litters. We have a very small paid staff and a very large volunteer staff of almost 2,000 people and almost 87% of our donations goes to animal care. I'm not sure how are staff and volunteers get it all accomplished but we do because of our love for the animal.

From the design of the building, all the way to it's marketing practices, I really admire the ARL!
Animal Rescue League of Iowa, Inc.	129685		/users/profile/175077	Terri13	Client Served	5	10/26/2012	My family and I adopted our dog, Tazzy, four years ago and he has been such a great dog! We were so impressed with the adoption process, the staff and the volunteers. They are very caring and thorough, and Tazzy was extremely healthy, and had received excellent health care before adoption. As a result of the adoption, my daughter and I have gotten involved as volunteers, and the company my husband and I own have become donors. It's our pleasure to be able to support such a wonderful, compassionate and well-run organization. I truly believe that our animals bring us immeasurable love and well-being - the ARL is definitely providing life-giving support to the animals they help, and at the same time giving all of us who adopt such a gift of happiness!
Animal Rescue League of Iowa, Inc.	129470		/users/profile/174838	Sylvia S.	Volunteer	5	10/25/2012	When I retired, friends asked me "Well what are you going to do with all that spare time"..I answered, "Volunteer at the ARL".  I volunteer in several different areas of the ARL, I'm a donor, and I adopted a puppy mill doggie.  Because I work in these different areas, I see things that many don't.  I see the care, love, patience that is given to every animal, medical needs being met, groomer making them pretty as well clean and comfortable, the kennels being scrubbed and cleaned early in the morning every day, volunteers spending time with those waiting for their furever home.  Let's not forget about the spay and neuter clinics, the help lines to the Behavior Coordinator, the low cost training available to all.  I've worked for major corporations in several states and I don't think I've ever been a part of an organization as well ran as the ARL.  Are you a volunteer, a Care Tech, a Med Tech, do you work the Adoption Desk?   No matter what your "job" is, you are made to feel that you are an important part of the team.  I'm very proud to be a part of the ARL team and in my opinion the ARL deserves to be the #1 on the Top-Rated  Non Profit List,

Although we adopted Yadi from somewhere else, one of the wonderful trainers at the ARL helped us work with Yadi on some behavior issues (both his and ours:). The actions of an organization's staff say a lot about the organization, itself. I have only positive things to say about both Mick, our trainer, and the ARL.

The very next day, my husband and I went to the Animal Rescue League to bring home a new friend.  We fell in love with Peanut and brought her home.  Peanut was to be my dog.  Peanut had other ideas.  My husband did not understand the bond that I had with my Shepherd.  Peanut taught my husband the unconditional love that a dog has for their family. Peanut was abused before we got her.  My husband and I have taught her how to trust and love humans again and Peanut has taught my husband the joy that a Best Friend can give.  Since Peanut adopted my husband, I needed a Best Friend as well.  We now have adopted Nani and we can't imagine our lives without them.

My pets have brought me such comfort, joy and love that I can't imagine my life without any of my special friends.  I highly recommend that anyone looking for a pet go to the Animal Rescue League and check out the wide variety of animals available.

Animal Rescue League of Iowa, Inc.	129278		/users/profile/174648	Laura83	General Member of the Public	5	10/25/2012	I've completely bonded to ARL and consider the organization a major asset of the Des Moines metro: My husband & I have been volunteers in years past (and surely will again as the busy-ness of life ebbs & flows): there were diverse opportunities suitable to each of us - where else could I photograph family pets for Christmas ornaments?... We've enjoyed community events like Dog Day at the ballpark and  the annual auction (started going just the two of us & had so much fun we built up to buying a table & bringing friends). We are pleased to support ARL's work financially as much as possible.   From the broader perspective, there is no end to the good they do in central Iowa. From their social networking, to spread information, to community education (like the dog grooming class I took this year), ARL permeates everything "pet" in this area. Their participation in last year's rescue of abused inmates of a puppy mill put them on my personal "hero" list. And taking over the City of Des Moines' "animal control" function is a big plus for the community also. But ARL is a personal asset as well. We've adopted four pets from them. All healthy, clean critters whose dynamic personalities add humor and dimension to our lives.

The growth of this organization over those years has been astounding.

I have also adopted all my pets from the ARL - starting way back in 1983.  
Animal Rescue League of Iowa, Inc.	129240		/users/profile/174608	Snicker	Volunteer	5	10/25/2012	The Animal Rescue League (ARL) of Iowa has so many programs - two that I am involved in are the Shelter Cat Program and Knittin' for Kittens.  I foster cats for the Shelter Cat Program which is designed to get the longer residents cats and those that are not doing well in the shelter into a home environment while they are waiting for their forever homes.  The ARL continues to promote these foster cats for adoption and they have a Facebook page for the foster network, a periodic newsletter for foster families, and on-going emails to check in on how the cats are doing.  They really make foster families feel appreciated in helping them to find homes for even more animals.  The Knittin'for Kittens program allows people to knit or crochet kitty mats the cats have in their cages while waiting for adoption and that can accompany him/her to their new home so they will have a scent they are familiar with.

I have toured the facility several times and have found it to be exceptionally clean and the animals are healthy and well-cared for.  Every member of the staff is knowledgeable, experienced and extremely dedicated.  They all do whatever is necessary for the well-being of the animals.  Many of the staff also provide foster care in their homes for animals that may need a break from facility dwelling.   I also must mention the wonderful team of volunteers who cheerfully pitch in and provide all manners of care for these animals.  When I mentioned the volunteers to the staff members, they wholeheartedly credit the volunteers with much of the success of this organization.  I receive great satisfaction from knowing that my donation contributes to the successful outcome of many pet adoptions.

We have adopted several Schnauzers over the years from them.  In fact, we are on a list to call if they receive any Schnauzers or mixes.  We lovingly refer to our dogs (kids) as "used or recycled" pets.  Truth be known, they are the best, most loving pets we could have chosen.  We donate both financially and personally with our time to the ARL.  We LOVE the Annual Auction!!  We highly recommend visiting and helping out at the league.  And if you're in the market for a pet, the ARL is the BEST place to begin!!  Happy "Tails"!!!  Maddie & Jackson, V & G

Mick spent an hour with us and Jack evaluating his behavior, asking many questions, explaining Jack's behavior, and finally sending us home with a plan for behavior training. He followed-up via e-mail with additional reading material and offered to assist if at any time we needed him again. We went home confident that we had the tools to help Jack and they have worked! We're not all the way there, but we are on our way thanks to Mick and the ARL. We couldn't have been more impressed with our experience and were happy to donate to support their programs.

I took him to the ARL to find our new baby. We found a 1 year old all black cat and he was perfect. 4 months later our Ninja has gained weight and has come into his personality. He always cracks us up, because he is not a normal cat, he can't balance on stuff or walk across anything with out falling off, he plays with the kids and just rolls off the couch or foot rest. He is the perfect addition to our family. Oh and he has a huge bay window that he loves to watch the birds and other stray cats out of.  We NEVER would of had him if the ARL wasn't around. I've told all my friends to adopt from them and help save a life and show them that humans do lobe them and need them.  I would and will adopt from them again. Thank you ARL for our baby he's amazing and loves his life.

Besides caring for hundreds of stray and surrendered pets that come through their doors each week, they provide many services to families and pets after adoption. Training programs, behavoiral issue assistance, pet supplies available on-site, and organizing pet-friendly events are just a few of the the benefits they offer our community.  ARL works hard to address the causes of pet overpopulation and homelessness with educational programs, free or reduced spay/neuter programs, and microchipping services.  As a volunteer, donor, proud Mom (of five fur kids and one human), and future ARL adopter, I highly recommend the Animal Rescue League of Iowa!

Animal Rescue League of Iowa, Inc.	129049		/users/profile/174376	MCBrady	Donor	5	10/25/2012	After an extremely rough year of my life, a therapist suggested I adopt a pet.  I grew up with dogs and cats when I was young, and decided to check out the local shelters to find the right one.  I ended up choosing to adopt form the ARL because I could tell from the moment I walked in the staff truly cared for the animals and took care of them.  I adopted my dog last year, she had some issues because she had been previously abandoned, and the staff was helpful in explaining her conditions and giving me suggestions on how to correctly care for her and work through her issues.  After hearing Corkie (my dog's) story, and meeting her in a 'hug room' I knew she was the right one for me.  We both had issues to work through, and it was finally time we had someone to work with us and love us through the hard times.  Today both my dog  and I are better than ever and loving life.  I wouldn't have found my best friend who has helped me through one of the worst times in my life without the ARL. She is truly part of the family.  As a recent college graduate money is tight, but I decided to become a donor because the ARL is an amazing place that deserves our support.  Without them, many animals would never have a chance.  I'm thankful every morning for the wonderful people at the ARL who introduced me to my 'fur-child!'

Getting a kitten that is updated on shots, has been spayed/neutered and treated for worms/fleas all for what relatively little fee they charge is just amazing! They work very hard to communicate with the public and have wonderful programs for difficult to adopt critters such as Pit Bulls and black cats!

The Heart Connection	80054	1	/users/profile/87411	Jill Alonzo	Client Served	4	02/28/2011	My son, Ian, was diagnosed with leukemia at the end of last May.  It was the most devastating thing that has ever happened to me in my life.   I was so overwhelmed with emotion, and trying to deal with all the changes that became part of my life, and Cancer Connection helped with this.  They provided a wonderful manual at the beginning of my son's diagnosis that helped me to better understand what he was going through, and helped me to find some coping strategies.  Thing went along fine for several months, and then this winter I had an emotional relapse.  I started to feel upset about my son's diagnosis again, even though things were still going well.  I didn't understand this, and my confusion made me feel even worse.  Cancer Connection was there for me again.  They connected me with another mom who had a daughter with leukemia.  We were able to meet and talk, and it helped me tremendously.   Additionally, there is always someone from Cancer Connection at the oncology clinic to help the kids in the waiting area with crafts, games, etc.  My son enjoys working with these volunteers and I'm thankful that they are willing to share their time to make our visit at the clinic (not my son's favorite place) a little more pleasant.  Life changes in so many ways when your child is diagnosd with cancer.  There are the obvious changes like hospital and clinic visits, and lost of medical bills, but there are also a lot of challenges that people don't think about as readily, such as the continual emotional roller coaster and strain to parents, dealing with side effects, and trying to help your child feel positive about an awful situation.  Cancer Connection helps to fill the gap for these concerns.

Our oldest son was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor when he was 5 years old.  Less then a year after his surgery and radiation treatments (still in a wheel chair and with great reservations of letting him go for a week) we took him to the Heart Connection Summer Oncology Camp.  It was the thrill of his summer and he continued to go every summer until he "graduated".  Now he attends the "weekend" retreats for the older kids who are cancer survivors.  He also volunteered a summer working in the arts and crafts. His younger sister and brother also attended the sibling camps.  All three thoroughly loved the fun they cherished during those weeks at the summer camps.  They never missed attending a camp.   It was their summer highlight.  They made new friends who they may know for their lifetime.  Our daughter is returning as a volunteer and hopes to use her RN experience and volunteer at the health lodge during the camp.   The fond memories the camp gives these children is unsurpassed and unforgettable!  The Heart Connection Children's Cancer Connection programs makes a difference in a child's eyes and provides them with love to see some of the rainbows in life!

I volunteered at sibling camp this past summer and the organization provides such a family like atmosphere for not only the children at camp but the staff as well.  The siblings were able to spend a week in the spotlight!  The camp also has so many traditions that I felt like it might be overwhelming for a new camper, but everyone there is so open to welcoming new members into this CCC "family".  
The Heart Connection	69237		/users/profile/75661	ultimatecyclone	Volunteer	5	02/16/2011	Volunteering with Children's Cancer Connection is an emotionally rewarding experience. The children and families taught me more about life than one can possibly hope to learn on their own. They teach perseverance, acceptance, honesty, compassion, and respect, among many other things. Working with the camp programs was the highlight of my years as a counselor. Watching the children grow throughout the week of camp was an incredibly experience that I will take with me throughout life. My time with Children's Cancer Programs has confirmed my future career goal of working in pediatric oncology nursing. Heartfelt thanks to the children, families, and staff of CCC for making everyone's lives a little better.
The Heart Connection	68528		/users/profile/74868	vnielson	Client Served	5	02/15/2011	My older sister was diagnosed with a brain tumor when she was 11 years old, I was 8 and our brother was 5. We heard about the Heart Connection through the Blank Children's Hospital in Des Moines. In the summer of 1998 my sister went to camp for the first time in June. She came back with nothing but good things to say about it so my brother and I attended sibling week in July that same summer. From my very first day at camp I have made lifelong friends every time I go. These friends have always been my biggest support and most stable things in my life; especially after my sister passed away at age 15 in December 2000.  I must admit during my teenage years I got into quite a bit of trouble at home and the summer right before my senior year my parents told me I couldn't go to camp; that was the end of life as I knew it. I expressed to my parents how important it was that I went, camp was my therapy in life and without I would have gone crazy and ended up in a bad place. After talking with my parents they decided to let me go, they could tell over the previous 8 years of being a camper how much camp meant to me and my brother.  After I graduated high school I came back to camp as a volunteer, first on the kitchen staff (during the floods of 2008), then as a counselor, and last year on the Directors Team. Throughout the years I also have part-took in Stand Up to Cancer, the Annual Ski Trip, Walk to the Beat, and many other fundraisers. I know how important the Children's Cancer Connection is to me and how much it has helped me cope in life, so I try to give back to the organization as much as possible so other people just like me can get the love and support they need to make it through the battle against cancer.

The Heart Connection	67850		/users/profile/74161	Judy	General Member of the Public	5	02/14/2011	My grandson, Darick, has been attending the camp since he was 5 years old.  He had leukemia and his mother (my daughter) started him in this camp as soon as she felt that he could handle it because of the great reputation.  This was the best decision as Darick waits all year to attend a week where he can be with kids and counselors like himself and they can just be kids having fun.  No one looks twice if they are on an IV or they are bald because they have all experienced this and through the camp they have learned compassion and life understanding of each other. When Darick returns from camp he tells us what he has done, but also how he feels about death and life.  This is something that he doesn't share any other time and he has grown into such a caring young man. I have a feeling that he will want to be a counselor to help other young boys. We can't say enough about the professionalism of this camp and how important this camp is for all of the kids who attend.

Camp provided him with skills he needed to be around others and work through his disabilities and give him some sense of normalcy.

Although he is a cancer survivor he has lasting effects from the chemotherapy treatment.  He has been attending summer camp via children's cancer connection since he was 5 years old.  This camp provides one of the best (if not THE best) experience for him.  He loves the camp, the counselors, his fellow campers and feels like it is a second home.  He has the opportunity to talk with and interact with other kids who also have lasting effects due to cancer treatment.  Heart Connection cancer camp allows him to see that he is not alone and gives him the opportunity to open up and connect with others at a very private emotional level.  As he gets older he has become more sensative to his situation and how the world sees him.  When at camp he is just one of the kids.  Camp is a soft place to land and fires him up and makes it possible for him to continue to face his daily challenges.  I just can't say enough about Children's Cancer Connection, the organization and the services they provide.  Without camp we would be crushed!!!!!  This organization is the absolute best!!!!!!!!

Not only is it one of my absolute favorite places on Earth, but it is a wonderful program that has shown me that there is some good that can come out of such an ugly disease. I plan on volunteering for Heart Connection as much as possible in the future and would advise anyone else to get involved in any way they can.  I was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia at the age of 5 and the nurses at the University of Iowa Children's Hospital informed my family of this unique camp. After the first year, I was hooked. Heart Connection and Children's Cancer Connection gave me hope, courage, and strength when I needed it most. It also gave me friendships that will last a lifetime.

Children's Cancer Connection is there for the entire family through the entire journey.  It's hard to explain the sense of community I feel every summer when I go to camp, even when words aren't spoken about the heartaches these kids must face there is an undersanding among them and a bond I cannot explain.

It meant so much to them that they sent a note and they are excited to attend again this year to see their camp friends.

They are an indespensible resource for children and families dealing with childhood cancer.  It's hard enough for kids to go through the rigors of cancer treatment and feel "different" from all their friends.  Their summer camp allows these kids to act like normal kids for a week and have the true summer camp expereicne without other kids staring at their lack of hair, their wheelchair, braces, crutches, etc.  My son has attended camp numerous times with braces and crutches and has had an amazing time and will be continuing as an adult counselor.  They also provide support group services for families including on for the survivors who have beomce adults, addressing the possible after affects of their treatments and helping them move forward.  It's not just a charity that sends kids to camp, they look for needs in every aspect of dealing with childhood cancer and try to fill them.

They offer a camp and a safe haven like no other. It helps the campers afflicted with cancer and perhaps humilations in their everyday lives, a place to feel welcomed and part of a group of friends that they know they truley belong with. I know first hand this is true, in school I never had any friends, I was very shy and was picked on. But at camp I was able to open up and talk to people. I've made life long friends because of it. And because I volenteet I can give back not only what I recieved in friendship but in guidance from many of the volenteers I've met as a camper. I love this camp and look forward to seeing new faces and all of the campers I've grown to know and fromed bonds with. Childhood cancer is unquiqe in an almost decieving way/ Because the desease takes so much from us and leaves us batterned an worn. Many of us have life long side effects. I can speak first hand having a learning disability. But I feel I am lucky, some of my camper friends have difficulty walking. But we have that bond we are survivors of childhood cancer and it's a mutual understanding that no of us whould trade for the world . The Heart Connection has given us a wonderful and rare opportunity to conect with people like us. And to teach those who might not otherwise understand what it means to have or have had childhood cancer.

My kids have attended for 6 years now and their camp counselors and camp friends have been a tremendous influence in their lives.  There is something incredibly special about being around others who know what you're going through.  I don't think it always takes words, but rather just the presence of someone who understands, and that seems to be what makes the difference at The Heart Connection Camp.  Everyone just understands without having to explain anything.  Thank you Heart Connection for providing so many beautiful years of survival for my entire family.

The best part is seeing how easy it is for the children to bond knowing that they all share something in common.  The Heart Connection does so many great things for children with cancer and their families.  They also focus a lot of their efforts on siblings of children affected by cancer because most times they get left out.  Because of Heart Connection there are countless friendships between families, cancer wariors, and siblings; these are the friendships that keep hope alive.
The Heart Connection	8282	15	/users/profile/10057	ThisCampRocks	Volunteer	5	07/31/2009	I've been volunteering for The Heart Connection for a few years and I want to let everyone know how inspiration the organization is. To see the children at summer camp that can relate to one another because of their illness is powerful. This organzation brings together a number of different people who work to help make the lives of families and children that are affected with childhood cancer a little easier. This organization wouldn't be possile without the giving donors, helpful staff and supportive volunteers. Overall, It's a great organization to be associated with.
The Heart Connection	8279	8	/users/profile/10056	iHeartTHC	Volunteer	5	07/31/2009	The Heart Connection has a wonderful and friendly staff that is unbeatable.  The programs and services are top-quality and are truly making a difference in our community!

This organization makes a difference in the lives of the people that it touches. Through the many events that I've volunteered at for The Heart Connection, I can see how hard the staff, volunteers and supporters work for this organzation.
The Heart Connection	8258	8	/users/profile/10037	lovecampsongs	Volunteer	5	07/31/2009	The weeks I have spent volunteering at Camp Heart Connection have been amazing!  To see Oncology Campers who have been so sick during the year thriving outdoors and to see Sibling Campers who are often in the shadows during the year get attention showered on them makes my year.  Camp Heart Connection changes lives of both the kids and the staff.

The times that we spent together at Family Camps over the years were invaluable in many ways. We had fun and could actually relax in the unique company of families and staff who knew all about our struggles.
The Heart Connection	8248	12	/users/profile/10028	shellerbeck	Volunteer	5	07/31/2009	I was introduced to the Heart Connection when my 3 yr. old son, Derek, was diagnosed with brain cancer November 2007.   The staff provided a treatment book to help us keep track of all of the procedures, appointments, doctors, and medicines he would need for the next 16 months.   Later the Heart Connection further help our family by allowing our daughter 6 yr old Jenna to go to camp with other siblings with the same experiences as her.   She realized she was not alone and it allowed her to escape from the realities of cancer and enjoy being a child.  She is anxiously awaiting camp this year and has already said she wants to be a counselor when the time comes. In addition, the Heart Connection has helped us with the creation of ClupHOPE, an organization fo parents caring for children in any stage of diagnosis, treatment, recovery, or rememberance.   Families can meet and discuss the struggles they are facing with caring individuals who understand the problems,The warmth and caring offered by the Heart Connection is unsurpassed.    Heart Connection events are a highlight on the calendar and always something to look forward to in the month.  It is a respite from the stress and worries that treatment brings.    It is an environment of trust, respect, fun, and love.
The Heart Connection	8226	4	/users/profile/10009	Shari Craven	Client Served	5	07/31/2009	The Heart Connection has been a lifesaver for our family.  We first found out about it when our son Brandon (13) was in his second year of treatment for brain cancer.  Brandon went to oncology camp and Courtney (11) and Jordan (8) went to sibling camp.  Brandon passed away at Christmas that year (1996) and the loss was devestating for our family.  The kids continued to attend sibling camp.  It was such a wonderfully loving atmosphere with them and they were able to spend time with other kids who understood exactly what they were experiencing.  Eventually Taylor who was three at the time of Brandon's death started going to camp as well.  Courtney is 24, Jordan, 21 and Taylor turned 16 this month and he is currently awaiting another week at camp.  There's not enough words to express the love and support my children receive at camp and how that love carries over from year to year.  They can't wait to go back.  Courtney and Jordan go along to take Taylor so they can touch base with old friends.  The Heart Connection is truly a wonderful resource and I'm so thankful for the opportunity for my children to be a part of it.
The Heart Connection	8211	4	/users/profile/9995	Sue Storm	Client Served	5	07/31/2009	We love the Heart Connection Summer Camp program! My son Jim was diagnosed with leukemia when he was 5 1/2 and he started going to camp when he was 7. He is now 14 and still loves camp! It is a safe place, for kids to connect with other kids, who are going through the same thing...dealing with cancer. The kids don't stare at you when you have a bald head, a port sticking out of your chest, or you are missing a limb. My son hopes to one day be a camp counselor, and help other kids who are fighting the battle with cancer, to enjoy the summer camp experience in a safe environment. Thanks Heart Connection Camp staff for all you do!
The Heart Connection	8204	4	/users/profile/9988	TheRocketeer	Volunteer	5	07/31/2009	I have been volunteering with The Heart Connection for over a year now and am very impressed with how they operate. Their cause is noble and their effect can be seen directly impacting the children and families that they serve. This is a very "hands on" organization and is well known in the community for the work that they do. I always feel that my time is appreciated and necessary to support their cause. Knowing that something I did helped make a sick child smile is just an amazing feeling.
The Heart Connection	8188	4	/users/profile/9974	goddess	Client Served	5	07/31/2009	I can't remember a time that heart connection wasn't part of our lives. My son was diagnosed 15 years ago, and although he is now all grown up, Heart connection is still there,  supporting our family. My daughter still goes to camp every year and attends as many of the events as she can. When she can no longer be a camper, she intends to become a counselor. She has developed long term friendships at camp that are important to her. Heart connection has helped my children become people who care about others, and I will always be greatful.
The Heart Connection	8164	4	/users/profile/9953	tyescas	Client Served	5	07/31/2009	The Heart Connection is an awesome program for our family.  We are able to join with other people around the state to share our joys and trials and get support from people who understand us very well.  The summer camps allow my boys to get away from the stress of daily cancer fighting and be free to enjoy themselves.  We really love the year round gatherings and look forward to each get away.
The Heart Connection	8151	7	/users/profile/9934	michelle	Client Served	5	07/31/2009	The Heart Connection is an amazing organization that shows kids who are fighting cancer that they are not alone.  This group of wonderful volunteers brings these kids and their families together through many different types of activities throughout the year and lets us ALL have fun!  They show the kids who are fighting day after day to be normal, that they can be normal.  They can go to camp for a whole week and do all of the things other kids are doing during for the summer and still be safe.  They have qualified counselors and staff available to make sure these kids are well taken care of and have the time of their lives!!!  My 9 year old daughter, who was diagnosed with cancer at the age of 4, finally went to camp this summer and came back a whole new girl.  She realized that with all she has been through, she can't wait to be able to help kids with cancer just like the people with Heart Connection have done for her.  And as much as they have done for her, they have also done as much for us as a family.  We try to participate in the different activities that are offered to us through the Heart Connection, like family camp or a day at Adventureland Amusement Park, just so we can reach out to other people who are going through some of the same things we have been through.  We understand and can relate.  The Heart Connection has given us all a lot to be thankful for, especially them!!
The Heart Connection	8094	4	/users/profile/9902	Connie	Client Served	5	07/31/2009	There is no organization like the Heart Connection Children's Cancer Programs.  A cancer diagnosis brings the world to a halt.  And then it starts to spin.  Doctors, procedures, hair loss, nausea, waiting for test results and dealing with insurance.  But the outside world really doesn't halt.  Simple things like going to work, making dinner, getting kids to school keep going.  You try to hang on, you try to let go.  You try to breath, you try not to drown.  And you try to keep the other kids' world running, along with the marriage.And through all of that, there is this incredible organization, the Heart Connection.  They invite the entire family to the most fun activities imaginable, they feed us, they put us around other families in the same boat, and they do it all for free.  They provided some of the rare "fun" times that we couldn't manage in the midst of juggling it all.And then there is camp.  A week for oncology kids with doctors and nurses and volunteers who come back year after year.  The fragile child is handed off into the most capable hands that even we overprotective parents feel safe.  Feeding tubes, ports, wheelchairs, they  deal with it all and turn no one away.And then they go even further.  A week for the siblings.  The overlooked ones who we struggled just to keep fed and clothed and going to school.  The ones who wonder why they can't go to the hospital and get all that attention too.  They go away for a magical week each year, with those wonderful volunteers who have watched them grow over the years, who have become a second family.  And they smile and wave goodbye, independent and safe for a week of pure spoiling.  The stuff I couldn't do.And even 12 years post cancer, they still invite us to their activities.  We still go to family camp and summer camp.  And it brings back all that we went through and all that we survived and gratitude for it all.  At this point in my child's recovery, I still go to these activities to stay clear, to remember what is important in life, and how fortunate we are.I love this organization with all of my heart.  so much so that I even open my wallet to them, which is not something I do often as a single parent of three.  My goal each year is to give them more than last year.  They just gave to us, they continue to keep giving to us, with open arms and undaunting smiles.  May you never face childhood cancer, but if you do, move to Des Moines, Iowa.  This organization is worth it.
The Heart Connection	8075	4	/users/profile/9886	spetro	Client Served	5	07/31/2009	This organization is so close to my heart. The Heart Connection has offered support to me and my family when my daughter was diagnosed with cancer at 5 months old. This organization has connected us with other families who have also been impacted by this terrifying disease. The Heart Connection offers continuous opportunities for children diagnosed with cancer and their families to have fun and smile during and after treatment. We are forever grateful to The Heart Connection!

The Heart Connection	7964	2	/users/profile/9790	ptimm	Volunteer	5	07/30/2009	Our entire family has been involved with The Heart Connection Children's Cancer Programs since it's beginning.  We have had campers at both the oncology and sibling camps.  Our campers have served as staff and counselors.  Our extended family has volunteered for 10 years at oncology camp and it is absolutely, the most rewarding thing I have done in my life.  Camp and events provide so much to so many, fulfilling the NEEDS of whatever the camper/family is coping with.  Every family member is effectived by this horrible disease and THCCCP addresses those issues.  Camp staff is amazing and the campers are everyone's top priority.  We have volunteered at events outside of camp, done fund-raising in our hometown and volunteered in the office.  ALL have been wonderful experiences that make you feel good about helping these families.
The Heart Connection	7947	2	/users/profile/9777	Jane Caswell	Volunteer	5	07/30/2009	I have had the pleasure of working with the Heart Connection since it's inception many years ago.  My original role was as a staff nurse for our onoclogy camp.  To watch a child with cancer go swimming, horse-back riding, climbing "the wall", dancing with a new best friend or love is just amazing!! For many of them, it's the first venture back to "normal" life.  Later I have become both a financial supporter, and more importantly an advocate for making sure that all of our families know about the wonderful programs that The Heart Connection provides for them.  We receive a wonderful treatment notebook that we simply fill in with the appropriate pages for each child's care plan that I hand out to families at the time of diagnosis.  Our parents love having everything in one organized space.  Some of our kids actually look forward to painful procedures because they get a new bead for their necklace through the Beads for Bravery program that the Heart Connection funds and supports.  I've had the pleasure of attending several family camps as a leader for parental group sessions wherein not only the child with cancer, but the entire family get to experience the camp expericence and weekend of fun.  The siblings of our children with cancer look forward to attending camp year after year.  They are made to feel very special for a whole week and the focus of attention is on the sib rather than the ill child.  New programs looking at support groups for the parents and sibs in the commumity, looking at issues of long-term survivorship, and just providing special experiences for our children with cancer are in the beginning phase.  The most wonderful thing about the Heart Connection is that they provide all these services to our families at NO COST.  Many of them are very financially strapped to make ends meet with all the extra expenses of bills not paid by insurance, extra travel and child care expenses, loss of income from one of the parents needing to quit working to care for the ill child, etc.
The Heart Connection	7944	2	/users/profile/9774	ttimm	Volunteer	5	07/30/2009	I started with The Heart Connection first as a Sibling Camper more than 20 years ago.  What a wonderful experience it was to spend time with other kids that understood what it was like to go through the experience.  The Heart Connection provides that support to the entire family and that is what makes them such a great organziation.
The Heart Connection	7926	2	/users/profile/9760	conradal	Volunteer	5	07/30/2009	This is an amazing program I have had the pleasure of being involved with for over 20 years. As a sibling, I found a community who understood what my family was going through and other children who knew what it was like to be lost amidst the chaos of cancer treatment. Little did I know that 20 years later, many of my fellow campers would still be close and dear friends.That is the wonderful part of the Heart Connection; it is not only an organization that helps during the crisis phases of cancer. It is a community that remains in contact and will see you through not only treatment, remission, treatment, or (sadly) loss - but also graduations, marriages, children and more.
The Heart Connection	7925	2	/users/profile/9759	stina26	Volunteer	5	07/30/2009	Last year was my first year volunteering at Heart Connection camp.  The experience was unbelievable: a whole week of sharing stories, meeting friends, and limitless fun.  Camp truly gives children and families affected by cancer the opportunity to step outside the confines of illness for a while and just live.

They look past the child that is sick and help them to get on with life and make the little moments and accomplishments seems huge.  It's the little day in and day out things they do for the familes that let's them know they are not alone in this fight.  They have people who are pulling for them all the way.

This organization is filled with angels helping and supporting families of children with cancer.  They sponsor camps for siblings, patients, and families to get some time away from their cancer fight to be kids and have fun.  They work tirelessly and selflessly to raise funds to support families and children in any way they can.  I am inspired to help and do more by all of the angels involved in this organization.  They are only limited by funding.  They establish close relationships with families and help them keep going in a tough battle!!  Truly amazing!!

They have been there for me through my whole cancer journey from my second diagnosis and have started programming to help me as an adult survivor of cancer.  I have had the ability to be a recipient of their programs and be a program leader as a volunteer to help others.  I have gained so much from being a counselor for the Heart Connection and it is an honor to serve the children who are fighting cancer now.  I can serve as an example to them they can grow up to fulfill their dreams and become something great!

The planning that took place by the staff to ensure he had a wonderful, safe time one last time gave us all memories to treasure for a lifetime.

I have helped volunteer for some events that they have been apart of and I can tell anyone that no group of people cares more about these kids then the staff at the Heart Connection.  They put forth their full effort and contribute so much of their time, even on their days off.  This small group of people has made such an impact on the communities in Iowa.  I know that they don't have the major budgets that some organizations like them have but to me it is quite obvious that they use what they have the best and most efficient way possible.  They put on camps for the kids and their siblings while also making special trips to the hospitals for rounds of chemo and radiation.  With each trip they bare a gift for the children to show their strength and endurance in what will surely be one of the toughest times in their lives.  While volunteering it was amazing to see the childrens faces when any member of the Heart Connections amazing staff entered the room.  The feelings of mutual respect and accomplishment were felt together and it definately showed.  I can only hope that if someday my child is faced with this type of trial that the Heart Connection is there to help us along the way as they have been for so many others.  Thank you to all of you at the Heart Connection for all of your love and support for our future generations.  I hope you know the impact your making in their lives.

This organization goes above and beyond many other similar organizations in that they not only have programs for the child who has/had cancer, but also the child's siblings and parents as well. The organization's programs from the beloved summer camp to ClubHope to family events allow the oncology kids and their families to be introduced to others who can relate to their experiences and provide a support system for eachother as they face the ups and downs of the battle against cancer. Their programs remind the families and children that they aren't the only ones who have faced the challenges of cancer and that they don't have to face it alone. It is a shame that their aren't more organizations like the Heart Connection throughout the United States.
The Heart Connection	7040	6	/users/profile/8911	bernie	General Member of the Public	5	07/22/2009	I became aware of Heart Connection through one of the young people that was volunteering for the organization. Her enthusiasm about the organization and programs stimulated my interest and desire to learn more about the organization. I invited the organization to make a presentation to a club of which I am a member. The presentor gave an excellent program, explaining what the organization is doing, what the needs are and how others can become supporive of the organization and its programs. The club members were very pleased and were gratefull for the informaion given and were moved by the presentor's enthusiasm and dedication to the organization's goals.

The Heart Connection is the bright spot in a very hard time in many children's lives. The Heart Connection focuses on not just the cancer fighter, but the siblings and parents too.  Programs are in place to support the needs of the entire family throughout and after their cancer fight. I have made numerous friends who continue to be very special to me through the survivorship program.  I also volunteer for this wonderful organization every chance I get.
The Heart Connection	6970	6	/users/profile/8840	ltilley	Client Served	5	07/22/2009	The Heart Connection is an amazing camp that has helped me so much in my life. I live to go to this camp in the summer mostly because i don't have to worry about anything while i'm there. Everyone there knows what it's like and will talk to you about anything. Going to camp is a time to get away from friends, family, and most importantly doctors. The things we do at camp is amazing! we get to do everything and more that you would usually do at a normal summer camp. Not only are the campers great friends but the staff is amazing and are some of my great friends now. I have been going to this camp for 10 years and am also going back as a staff member now that I am to old to be a camper. I love this camp so much and I don't think i could imagine life without the Heart Connection.

This organization is a family, once a member, always a member with services that not only serve my daughter, but also her siblings and other family members.  Camp is someting that she looks forward to every year, along with the many activities that are offered throughout the year involving families and friends that can only understnad you.  I can't say enough, The Heart Connection is there any time when needed for support, advice and just plain fun and is definitly a part of our extended family.

The Heart Connection	6837	2	/users/profile/8693	THCVolunteer	Volunteer	5	07/20/2009	The Heart Connection Childrens Cancer Programs is truly a non-profit organization that changes the lives of children and their families that are affected by cancer. The numerous programs, outings, support and overall assistance that the organization provides truly makes a difference. Ive nothing but amazing stories and memories of my time working with The Heart Connection and Id recommend to anyone becoming associated with this organization, whether by volunteering, enjoying their programming or by becoming a Heart Connection family. To see the smiles and hear laughter of children who have been through much more than anyone could imagine, is the best medicine for the families and children that this organization touches.
The Heart Connection	6834	2	/users/profile/8690	Bridget Breitbach	Volunteer	5	07/20/2009	I was a counselor at Sibling Camp for the Heart Connection and I can honestly say I have never been part of such an amazing organization in my life.  The people running this non-profit are some of the best in the world.  They genuinely care for the kids and families who take part in their programs and dedicate their careers to helping these families make their battle with cancer a little easier.

The Heart Connection	6720	3	/users/profile/8577	Dani	Client Served	5	07/17/2009	The Heart Connection Camp is a place that is impossible to describe its meaning and magnitude. The organization works so hard all year long to touch hundreds of children's and families' lives in and out of Iowa. I've attended the Oncology Camp since I was five and have been there for 14 summers, and I am still in awe of the experiences I've had. It's a week where kids with any type of cancer, regardless of the stage of their treatment, can go and be kids. They don't have to worry about being gawked at because they have no hair or they have only one leg. These kids get to have a week all to them, and just be a normal kid. The staff works incredibly hard to get every kid to participate in everything possible. I've seen a girl in a wheelchair do the zipline, and kids with prosthetic legs ride a horse. These kids can choose to ignore the fact that they have cancer, or they can bond with those around them who know what's going on. I've seen a group of young girls talk about their ports and what they named them. It's an incredible week, that for many of these kids, is one of the best weeks out of their year. It's a loving atmosphere where kids can talk with others who can truly say "I understand."
The Heart Connection	6699	3	/users/profile/8556	Benton	Volunteer	5	07/16/2009	I have been apart of this organization sense 1989 and I make it a point to be there every year because it means so much to me.  At camp I have made friendships that I couldnt make anywhere else.  I had brain surgery back in December of 08 and one of my camp buddies sat by me for two days while I was sleeping and only able to days in and out.  The people you meet leave their prints on your heart wether they are age five or eighteen, everyone will have an impact.
The Heart Connection	6692	4	/users/profile/8549	cenglish222	Volunteer	5	07/16/2009	The Heart Connection has been a part of my life now for almost 20 years. When I was younger and sick the organization was there for me and my family and has continued to stay connected. Thanks to the Heart Connection I've now been provided with adult cancer survivor opportunities that have helped me educate myself on staying healthy long after going into remission.
The Heart Connection	6689	6	/users/profile/8546	Abe Kline	Client Served	5	07/16/2009	Amazing. There is no other way to put it. this camp helped me and my brothers cope with my little brother getting treated for a malignant brain tumor. Ever since 2001 my older brothers and I have attended this camp and my younger brother has gone to the camp for survivors. We all plan to come back as counselors.
The Heart Connection	6687	5	/users/profile/8543	Jordan Ehlert	Volunteer	5	07/16/2009	I have been volunteering for The Heart Connection for about 3 months and have absolutely loved my there.  They provide awesome support for children with cancer and their families and they really are there to assist in every way.  During camp, I could see how much it really meant to the kids and the great time they have with others. Camp is where the kids can be themselves and where they can be comfortable around others. The Heart Connection has an awesome network of volunteers that are always willing to help out at programs and especially during camp. The staff of the organization are great, always having new ideas and are never afraid to take on a new challenge. I will definitely continue my attention and time to this organization in the future!
The Heart Connection	6657	5	/users/profile/8509	lynks_v	Volunteer	5	07/15/2009	I volunteered for the Heart Connection because they are an organization that really cares about the kids that deal with cancer every day all year long. They raise money, do camps, run events, sports, shows and much more. I hope to be able to do much more throughout the year to show my support for the Heart Connection.

Iowa Friends of Companion Animals	294397		/users/profile/385137	Becky103,	Donor	5	06/30/2016	I was one of the many people who was unaware of the existence of puppy mills until I started to see information posted on Facebook by the Iowa Friends of Companion Animals.  My heart hurts for the dogs and puppies in these horrible places, and I support the work done by this amazing group to bring their plight to people's attention.  "Man's Best Friend" needs our help, and I feel that the best hope of changing the laws in favor of the dogs is by supporting Iowa Friends of Companion Animals.
Iowa Friends of Companion Animals	304400		/users/profile/395563	annecharlotte	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/14/2016	Mary Lahay has organized and inspired an amazing network of dedicated volunteers to inform citizens and legislators in Iowa of the outrageous mistreatment of dogs held in puppy mills.  She and volunteers have gone through FDA records to identify the worst offenders and have gotten many mills shut down.  They have organized lobby days and they are changing laws governing mills.  In an agricultural state like Iowa, where dogs in mills are treated as livestock, this is no small task.  There is still much to do.  Mary and the many volunteers for Iowa Friends of Companion Animals have worked tirelessly to help these abused dogs.  
Iowa Friends of Companion Animals	304091		/users/profile/395260	Lauris O.	Advisor	4	09/13/2016	I have donated a few times and have seen first-hand my money put into action to further their mission to improve both the current enforcement of federal and state laws regarding large-scale commercial pet breeding operations and the laws themselves. They are excellent in tracking inspection and enforcement actions then following up with government agencies when breeders do not take remedial action. They are also consistent and assertive with their public relations campaigns.
Iowa Friends of Companion Animals	304011		/users/profile/395173	leeannwlk	Volunteer	5	09/13/2016	Iowa Friends of Companion Animals is working diligently to change laws for the 15,000+ puppy mill dogs being tortured in USDA licensed commercial dog breeding facilities in Iowa.  Iowa is number 2 in the nation for these types of facilities.  These dogs are being denied veterinary care and are being bred to death.....cycle after cycle.  They live in conditions with no heat in the winter and no air in the summer. They are producing sick puppies and selling them to the unsuspecting public.  Mary Lahay and her team are working tirelessly to educate the legislators in the state of IA and the public in order to get these laws changed.  Iowa is the only state in the USA that has no state oversight for these facilities.  Only Mississippi has worse Animal Welfare laws than the state of Iowa.   The only way to end this misery is to change laws and enforce them and Mary Lahay and her team are working tirelessly to get legislators to do that.
Iowa Friends of Companion Animals	303740		/users/profile/394910	Writer	Donor	4	09/12/2016	The people involved in this nonprofit are doing a great job trying to bring awareness to the public about the plight of the thousands of breeding dogs being kept in deplorable conditions in Iowa's puppy mills.   This is a national problem as puppies from these mills are sold throughout the United States, many with genetic defects or who are sick.   IFCA is working hard to get the laws in Iowa changed to help protect these dogs, but in an agricultural State, such as Iowa, this is a challenge, one they appear to be up for.

Many volunteers work tirelessly lobbying, walking in parades, writing to lawmakers, appealing to lawmakers, setting up booths and learning centers at events, fundraising, ect. All to help those poor dogs that are languishing in Iowa's horrid puppy mills. I have helped them, in the past, and will continue to do so, in the future.  Sincerely, Adrienne Smith  Jefferson

We are number two in the country which is shameful  this organization is trying to I'm not wise to help with their suffering .   They're involved in a lot of activities such as the puppy mill walk which just happened.    They are going to be at the pet expo to provide information to people that don't realize what's going on.  There's also a lobby day in February were members of the group go down showing their support and talking with her legislatures is an ongoing process they have groups of over the state trying to educate people about what's going on .

Not long ago, I attended an informational meeting held by Iowa Friends. It was following that meeting that I decided my rescue work was important, but still there needed to be greater change. IFCA is dedicated to changing legislation to provide enforced protections for our voiceless and beloved companions. To me, Iowa Friends is like the "little engine that could" - this organization is not giving up. Through optimism and hardwork they continue the march for humane and responsible treatment of companion animals.

I loved how this dear lady, saw a need and instead of just thinking it was a sad situation, she actually started a movement to help animals-primarily dogs!!!  A lot of people see a problem, but few are willing to put the time and effort into fixing it like Iowa Friends has.  I enjoy helping with their work to spread word that there are dogs in need and there are positive ways in which to help them.  The organization provides a lot of valuable information that is beneficial when talking to others who are interested in joining.  They are willing to answer questions.  They have cool merchandise to purchase.  Their events are fun!!  I love working with Iowa Friends of Companion Animals!!

Mary LaHay and all volunteers with Iowa Friends of  Companion Animals are so amazing and NEEDED! There is such a need to educate Iowans on the issues with puppy mills and how one does their homework to ensure you are working with a responsible breeder. One of the many things I appreciate about this group is it is fact based. Data is so important and this group does it's homework. The numbers tell the story and why change is needed. This can be such an emotional area, and I hope we never lose that piece of it, but in the data is critical to show the need for change. 
Iowa Friends of Companion Animals	262079	3	/users/profile/350744	ShelterVet	Professional with expertise in this field	1	10/07/2015	I wish these people lobby for regulations and humane treatment for the poor dogs that are trucked in and out of the state. Or better yet use the money the raise to actually help the shelters, instead of "lobbying" for a change in laws rather than lobbying for the enforcement of the laws in place already.

Iowa Friends is their voice, 24-7...these dogs are lucky to have IaFriends advocating for them and for "Better Laws For Those With Paws."
Iowa Friends of Companion Animals	216189	5	/users/profile/279651	FridaB	Volunteer	5	09/21/2014	Until Iowa Friends was established, I had absolutely no idea that Iowa had such a disheartening puppy mill problem...and I was born and raised in this state. Iowa Friends has brought the very dark topic of puppy mills into the light and into the minds of legislators, the media and Iowans across the state. Now, thanks to Iowa Friends' wonderful work, more Iowans than ever are getting the message - and laws are changing, puppy mills are closing and dogs are being protected. There is much work left to do, but with continued support, Iowa Friends will continue to make a huge positive impact on this very disturbing and infrequently-discussed problem.

Mary LaHay has and continues to fight for legislation to clean up Iowa puppy mills.  Iowa Friends of Companion Animals encourages 1.

To report issues you may witness to law enforcement.

Iowa Friends of Companion Animals	140692	4	/users/profile/186900	Maggie27	General Member of the Public	5	11/16/2012	This organization is a first class operation. They work tirelessly to improve the quality of animal welfare regulation in the state of Iowa, as they relate to puppy mills. Education of the public is essential to the well-being of companion animals and ending suffering in Iowa puppy mills. This group is making it happen. I recommend that anyone who is even a remote pet lover find a way to get involved with or follow this group!
Iowa Friends of Companion Animals	260960	3	/users/profile/349553	Peg_8	General Member of the Public	5	10/01/2015	I am the proud owner of a former puppy mill pug. He actually came from the  hell known as Pratt puppy mill. He has overcome many obstacles but has many hurdles left. He may never shed the fear of men, overhead objects , hats, boots rain, and hunger. He may never be completely house trained. He may never do a lot of things a normal, healthy, well adjusted dog will but he will always be loved. It is sad and sickening to see what the human race will do for money. I thank God that there is an organization such as Iowa Friends of Companion Animals to fight for, protest for, lobby for, and educate about these voiceless precious creatures. Thank you Mary   
Iowa Friends of Companion Animals	260956	3	/users/profile/276924	westiemum	General Member of the Public	5	10/01/2015	Kudos to Mary who got the ball rolling and has never given up even when it seems that she is banging her head against a brick wall.  It will happen, then thousands of mistreated companion animals will know how it feels to be loved, cared for and finally free to walk on grass and cuddle in a warm bed.  Go IFCA, you rock.
Iowa Friends of Companion Animals	213724	4	/users/profile/276924	westiemum	Donor	5	09/05/2014	As the adopter of a ex puppy mill dog I know first hand some of the residual effects, both physical and emotional that these dogs can and do suffer from.  This group is doing a stellar job educating the public about puppy mills and what to do when looking to add a puppy to your life.  They have also been instrumental in getting some of the laws in Iowa, concerning the care of dogs in puppy mills, tightened up.  They know there is more to do but have a tough row to hoe here in an agricultural state.  They have made great strides but need all the help they can get to carry on their great work on behalf of these poor, abused animals.
Iowa Friends of Companion Animals	260934	5	/users/profile/349526	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	10/01/2015	Finally an organization helping thousands to stand up for Companion animals. They take the headache out of trying to stay on top of things! So proud to be a grassroots member!
Iowa Friends of Companion Animals	260906	3	/users/profile/349498	Writer	Donor	5	10/01/2015	This is Iowa's flagship organization for reducing, maybe even eliminating, Iowa's large, well financed and absolutely inhumane puppy mill business.  Puppy mills, small and large, are  making money off of squalor and cruelty.  Breeding dogs deserve better.  Iowa Friends of Companion Animals is on their side.
Iowa Friends of Companion Animals	260905	2	/users/profile/174363	Tammy26	Volunteer	5	10/01/2015	I foster for the ARL and I picked this wonderful organization because of how each animals needs are addressed.  As a foster I have worked with puppies, dogs, cats. Cindy Gerke you are an exceptional foster coordinator.   The team at the ARL gives so much to make this rescue stand out and shine.

A great deal of thought and effort has gone into their web site. Always positive and practical in their efforts to help dogs who are suffering. 
Iowa Friends of Companion Animals	294397		/users/profile/385137	Becky103,	Donor	5	06/30/2016	I was one of the many people who was unaware of the existence of puppy mills until I started to see information posted on Facebook by the Iowa Friends of Companion Animals.  My heart hurts for the dogs and puppies in these horrible places, and I support the work done by this amazing group to bring their plight to people's attention.  "Man's Best Friend" needs our help, and I feel that the best hope of changing the laws in favor of the dogs is by supporting Iowa Friends of Companion Animals.
Iowa Friends of Companion Animals	260856	3	/users/profile/349448	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	10/01/2015	It's all about raising awareness of puppy mills! Working with government to being about bills to change this horrendous behavior. 
Iowa Friends of Companion Animals	250784	4	/users/profile/338675	ScruffysMom	Volunteer	5	07/31/2015	Mary, who founded this organization and has worked tirelessly for the dogs for over five years, has taken on the issue of puppy mills in Iowa with a determination I've never seen before in a non-profit leader. She created Iowa Friends after discovering on her own what damage irresponsible breeders can do to the dogs in their "care." Mary did her research, and when she first went to the state legislature, she wowed them with the facts. Since that first successful couple of years, the pushback from the Iowa Breeders Assn., Farm Bureau (yep!) and Big Ag has increased enormously. Fortunately, the numbers of animal/dog lovers who have discovered Iowa Friends has increased exponentially. It's hard to change laws. It's hard for a relatively small, unfunded organization to fight huge lobbying interests. It's disappointing that our legislators are more afraid of losing donations from Big Ag and farmers than they are in helping the poor dogs languishing in cages across Iowa. Oh, and the lies those breeders tell the legislators! We have a state full of Pinocchios! To Mary and all of the volunteers and board members of Iowa Friends of Companion Animals: Keep up the GREAT WORK! The dogs are counting on you all!
Iowa Friends of Companion Animals	216436	1	/users/profile/238028	nharvey	Volunteer	5	09/22/2014	This is a great organization that works to make life better by changing laws for dogs living a life of horror in puppy mills.

Iowa Friends of Companion Animals	215963	2	/users/profile/279410	mellwanger	Board Member	5	09/19/2014	I joined the board of this organization because of its precise goal of improving the welfare of dogs held in commercial breeding facilities.  More humane laws, better oversight and stiffer penalties for animal welfare violations are much needed and long overdue.  No one would condone as "humane" the well-documented conditions under which many of these dogs spend their entire lives, existing solely to turn a profit for their owners.  Now is the time for change.  We are their voice.
Iowa Friends of Companion Animals	215716	1	/users/profile/279158	Peggy41	General Member of the Public	5	09/19/2014	This is a wonderful Organization for the State of Iowa.  Iowa has a lot of Puppy Mills so there is always a need to try to change laws. Mary LaHay and Iowa Friends of Companion Animals work tirelessly for all of us. I have worked with rescues for years and adopted many of the dogs that have been saved from Puppy Mills. God Bless them for working so hard and never giving up. 
Iowa Friends of Companion Animals	215681	1	/users/profile/279118	AmyBlessing	General Member of the Public	5	09/18/2014	Iowa Friends of Companion Animals does a great job in educating the public about how truly awful puppy mills are and what it means to purchase a puppy mill dog.   Their newsletters, Facebook updates, action alerts, and organized events to end inhumane treatment and breeding of dogs reach so many people.  Puppy mills are so prevalent in Iowa;  however, it seems that, slowly but surely, the tide is turning against them.  Yeah Iowa Friends of Companion Animals!
Iowa Friends of Companion Animals	215658		/users/profile/279094	Becky71	General Member of the Public	5	09/18/2014	I have great respect and appreciation for the tireless work that Iowa Friends of Companion Animals and Mary LaHay are doing to educate us about the dirty business of puppy mills in Iowa and for bringing to light the deplorable conditions that these dogs have to exist in. May we all join in to help right this wrong and help to end the suffering of these animals.
Iowa Friends of Companion Animals	215648		/users/profile/279083	Cassiefluke	Volunteer	5	09/18/2014	I stumbled upon this page and am so happy I did. I had no idea Iowa is second worse in the nation for  puppy mills. This non-profit fights for the dogs and puppies who are stuck in these tiny cages with no voice. Mary is a passionate person who constantly is using her time to educate Iowans and to raise awareness on the puppy mill issue. She is even taking the next step to get legislation passed that will help protect Iowa's dogs and hopefully one day will get rid of these mills. 
Iowa Friends of Companion Animals	215621		/users/profile/279056	Connie44	General Member of the Public	5	09/18/2014	Without this Puppymills would be not as understood as they are.

Please help get the word out it takes a village to an end such suffering.

Iowa Friends of Companion Animals	159813		/users/profile/211876	Piebird	Board Member	5	06/06/2013	Upon learning that Iowa is second in the nation in the number of established puppy mills, I was drawn to help serve this organization and its mission.   In just a couple short years IFCA and IVCA have seen great results towards better legislation and education on puppy mills in Iowa.   We still have a journey ahead of us as there are still far too many dogs living in horrible conditions, but are definitely gaining momentum with the help of great volunteers and donors!  
Iowa Friends of Companion Animals	159686		/users/profile/211857	taramd	General Member of the Public	5	06/05/2013	Great work this organization does!! They are the voice of the animals in Iowa, and do a great job of educating the public to the horrors these animals are living in.

Iowa Friends of Companion Animals	159661		/users/profile/211831	catlore	General Member of the Public	5	06/05/2013	This group serves the state of Iowa by providing education regarding the horrors of puppy mills and advocacy for the dogs trapped in this travesty. Mary has to see things that most of us only read about. She is tireless in her work and has worked to change legislation to better protect puppy mills in the second largest puppy mill state.

Her concern and caring for the animals trapped within the confines of Iowa Puppy Mills has given me hope.   With her leadership and strength, I envision much needed changes to be made to better the lives for many many humans and animals. 
Iowa Friends of Companion Animals	140996	1	/users/profile/186904	RandaChoun1975	General Member of the Public	1	11/18/2012	After coming being referred to this page by another group, I was excited to meet people that were as passionate as I am about animal welfare. However, after watching their posts closely, I realized that this group isn't truthful. They posted a photo of two very sick looking dogs that were trapped in a puppy mill and they asked all of us to donate and help these dogs. Upon being pressed about the dogs, the organization had to admit that these dogs had been euthanized years before. Lying for donations is just as bad as those that breed for profit. Then, as some sort of community outreach, the organization invited all of their fans out to a restaurant and offered free beer and appetizers. When I asked who was funding the free stuff, my comment was immediately deleted. I don't agree with allowing donations to go for alcohol and food. And they never answered my other question... What is the difference between Iowa Friends and Iowa Voters? The "not for profit" money is going to fund the legislative fund. There are a lot of things that aren't being told with this group. 
Iowa Friends of Companion Animals	140917		/users/profile/187133	denise donald	Donor	5	11/17/2012	I met Mary several years ago and learned of her passion to help Iowa's puppy mill dogs.  She has worked miracles on her own and now has the help and admiration of many people.  It is true that a "squeaky wheel" can get things done.  There is still much to be accomplished  but those very important first steps have been taken and Iowa Friends for Companion Animals is doing all it can to educate people and law makers of the suffering and lack of oversight these these dogs have to put up with.  
Iowa Friends of Companion Animals	140832		/users/profile/187053	citrineforme	Volunteer	5	11/17/2012	A well organized group that has been working hard towards their goals for several years.

Iowa Friends of Companion Animals	140750		/users/profile/186960	Cats14	General Member of the Public	4	11/17/2012	The nonprofit does great great work against the cruelty in Iowa puppy mills.  But since it is Iowa Friends of Companion Animals, I would like to see them also do something for the suffering/death of cats, as cats are companion animals also.  There is a great lack of low cost spay and neuter services in most rural towns of Iowa; resulting in many homeless animals that are put to death or suffer as strays because there are not enough homes and very few "no kill" shelters (some rural towns have no shelters at all).  
Iowa Friends of Companion Animals	140747		/users/profile/186957	hookinson	General Member of the Public	5	11/17/2012	This is organization provides very timely and unbiased information to the public regarding animal cruelty and puppy mills.   Keep up the great work that you do!
Iowa Friends of Companion Animals	140738		/users/profile/186947	Rachel64	General Member of the Public	5	11/16/2012	This organization does a terrific job of informing the public of animal cruelty where it exists and without bias. Their information is always accurate and from reliable sources. They do a great job of advocating for the animals without losing their cool and are in general, a strong and credible voice for the animals in the state of Iowa. 
Iowa Friends of Companion Animals	140719		/users/profile/186926	Scott46	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/16/2012	This organization works tirelessly to protect animals from harm. We run a rescue which is honorable but what Mary is doing is so much more. She is working towards prevention! This organization continues to inform the public of the horrors of puppy mills. I hope that one day they will prove to law makers that puppy mills have no place in Iowa. Scott Shehan co-founder Lusco Farms Rescue, Malvern, Iowa

I felt the phone ring endlessly, it was finally answered after ringing almost 20 odd times. Birat was extremely patient and listened to me, we had a long conversation, and I felt a sigh of relief. He assured me that it was the real deal and that I would have to consult the doctor first for the right combination of medication. I ordered as instructed by email and it was promptly responded by Melissa. I received my medication on the 7th day after placing my order, as said it arrived by USPS. I am now Hep C free, but I will follow up with the doc too in a few months. Thank you soul of healing, sunny pharma, Birat and Melissa, your entire team has been a blessing in my life.

Before, I took them, I made a deal with my dad that I would get them tested to make sure it was the real thing.  Of course, I knew it was but the pleasure of showing off to my skeptical dad was priceless.  If you have doubt please get your medicine tested like I did.  It will make all those that are skeptical fall in line with what you believe.  I never doubted one instance that Soul of Healing or Sunny Pharma was fake in anyway.  They go out of their way to make sure we get the medicine.  No other non profit or for profit company does that now.  Not one single company.  Look forward to telling you I'm clear in the next 8 weeks.  Yes, I feel so much better after being on the medicine for the past month.  My energy level has increased considerably.

We received our meds at the end of February. Everything went like clockwork.  3 months has come and  gone.  My husband and I tested and got our results today, we're both clear.   We were in tears at the doctor's office.  Just last year I lost my brother to this horrible disease and his insurance denied him over and over.  Then the insurance company here in Louisiana said we can't do anything now, he's too sick to receive the meds.  That made my blood boil, that's why we decided to take a chance and order the meds.  We're glad we did, its made a big difference in our lives.  We feel atleast 20 years younger now.   Thank you Melissa and Dr. Sue Rodgers Clinic

I want to apologize to Melissa, Jennifer, Birat and Krishna for putting you through the ringers before I ordered generic Harvoni.  For our family, $2412 dollars is something we didn't have laying around.  After a couple of weeks we gathered enough and was able to make a Wells fargo deposit.  Recalling to that day, I was not anxious and very worried about getting medicine from outside the US.  Although, I had received calls from previous patients, your staff, I still didn't have peace of mind.  The worst part was knowing in advance we would have to wait 3 weeks to get the medicine.  I must have called and emailed your patient advocates atleast 50 times to make sure the medicine will be arriving with the volunteers.  Again, sorry for my over skepticism and lack of trust with the company.  My daughter is now healthy thanks to your company.  We had been worried sick about her well being but as she started taking her medication, she was improving week by week, almost day by day.  Its really a miracle.  Thank you for all you have put up with and delivering what you have promised.

That's how I contracted hepc but I'm in too good of shape to get the treatment according to my insurance.  I'm reading one horror story after another about insurance hcv treatment denials because the damn medicine is too expensive.   My family doctor for over 40 years recommend that I visit soulofhealing.org and look in to their program of getting treatment from India.  I clicked on the link to harvonipriceinindia.com website and called their number and got through to Birat.  He listened to my story and wanted to make sure that there would be some type of support while undergoing treatment.  I reassured him that my doctor recommended the site and he will monitor me.  I felt so good after talking to Birat, I ordered generic Harvoni right away and received the meds in less than a week by USPS.

LAMB Arts Regional Theatre was instrumental in my development as a young artist. The school fostered my love of theatre and challenged me, offering excellent preparation for my college auditions while giving me professional guidance. The Wooley's were the first teachers in my life to show me that a professional career in the arts was possible. Additionally, they continue to provide an enormous amount of value to the community around them: artistically enriching the lives of patrons, students, as well as artists in Sioux City with tons of talent that needs to be shared. Coming in contact with LAMB was, by far, the most valuable moment of my career. It gave me a solid foundation, investing me with the passion and skillset to keep growing.

LAMB continues to raise the bar on artistically produced plays and musicals that rival any seen at professional playhouses in major cities. They couple most plays in the season with a "Projects of Hope" night; an opportunity for other area non-profits to use the night's production income as a means to fundraise for their own organization.  From infants to adults, LAMB provides a welcoming "home away from home" and a creative environment to learn and grow.

The opportunity available to young people through Lamb is extraordinary.  They can't wait to attend and perform with the superlative direction of Russ and Diana Wooley and their exemplary staff and volunteers.  Vital life lessons of hard work, discipline and responsibility has resulted in gains in self confidence and pride being demonstrated by our grandchildren.   Watching thirty plus kids and young adults clean the theater after the last performance was outstanding.  What a team and how well they represent Lamb.  Lamb is a community art cultural gem!

Our teenage daughter was looking for an outlet for her acting and singing that was not to be found anywhere else in Sioux City...Lamb filled that so perfectly it is hard to find words to express our gratitude. Our daughter had the raw talent but Lamb gave her focus and incentive to be so much better. The owners and staff are above talented themselves, are encouraging and know what they are doing to help children through adults lead a creative life. They GET these children and adults who need to create through music and acting and then provide a wonderful environment for them to share their gifts with Sioux City and the surrounding area. Our daughter has been given an amazing gift to be able to perform at Lamb and we cannot recommend it highly enough! This school has given her the education that could normally only be found in major cities. And we have it RIGHT HERE!

During my 15 years of taking numerous classes at Lamb I have learned so much about the art of theatre. However, just  learning about theatre couldn't even compare to everything else that Lamb has helped me become who I am today. You learn life lessons that can't be taught by sitting in a classroom, loyalty, trust, communication, and friendship. No matter where you are from you will be welcomed with open arms into any class. It has taught me how to express myself and use my own words and thoughts to explain my feelings. The people I have met and the friendships I have made will last a lifetime. It's amazing, but being in different schools, I may never have met my best friends had it not been for Lamb. Most importantly, Lamb has always treated me as an equal. Children can't grow and learn if they are always told "No" and "Don't do that", instead they grow by being given an opportunity to show others who they are and not have to worry about others opinions. Lamb Arts LTD will always be part of who I am and will always hold a special place in my heart.

Writing not as a board member, but as a mom of a young man who has been involved at LAMB Arts Regional Theatre from early childhood, I cannot fully express what a high quality organization this is. Our oldest son received years of top level training at LAMB in every aspect of theatre arts, and also completed a yearlong internship with for high school credit a few years back. LAMB staff is dedicated to inspiring all ages to grow beyond what they ever imagined they could  as both actors and great human beings.  We know that the confidence our son exudes, and the leadership and academic honors he tends to receive in college are a direct result of his involvement at LAMB Arts over the years. I am a mental health therapist by trade, and I honestly believe any parent looking for supportive involvement for their child should put LAMB Arts at the top of their list and not wait to make that call.

They have learned so much and have gained many skills, such as confidence and self esteem. Most recently the Lamb Arts Theatre produced the musical Les Miserables'. This was a wonderful opportunity for our family.  Our whole family of 4 was involved in this production.  Our son (18) was the character Enjoras, our daughter (13) did tech work running lights, my husband and I were in the ensemble and played many different characters. This was the first time that my husband and I had been on the stage at the Lamb Arts Theatre. This was a positive, and fun experience for our family. We made many new friends and we grew as actors and musicians. I highly recommend Lamb Arts Ltd. to families to participate in. The quality of shows is amazing. we have never seen a "bad" show at the Lamb.   We love the skills that our children learn from taking classes and working with the highly qualified staff. Skills such as working hard, being punctual, being team players and self respect.  The staff are encouraging and caring and the atmosphere of this theatre is that of family.  We now consider  ourselves as part of the Lamb Arts family. Thanks Lamb Arts Ltd., for all of the wonderful memories you gave us and for an opportunity for our family to have this chance to perform together with many wonderful actors.

Lamb Arts LTD-LAMB  Arts Regional Theatre/School	155034		/users/profile/205887	Lacey F.	Client Served	5	04/16/2013	The arts.  At first glance, one may assume that Lamb Arts Regional Theatre/School is a place for parents to send their children for lessons in the arts, and a place for all to enjoy participation in the arts.  This assumption would not be incorrect.  However, it would miss the massive amount of benefits and chain reactions that this entity has caused and provided in their community.  Not to be too dramatic, (but come on...I am of the the theatre), they essentially save young people.   Once upon a time, there was a little girl.  She was spunky, intelligent, and loved to sing Madonna songs at an inappropriate age.  She came from a single parent home from a poor side of town. You can fill in the rest of what could have happened to her.  She had an angel of a mother who sought out arenas where this little spark would light fires and channel her energy and talents in a positive way.  She found LAMB.  Over the next 12 years,  the directors/owners/and mentors at LAMB guided, taught, and helped this little girl mature into a young lady.  Through music, theatre, and dance, the people of LAMB teach young people to calibrate and follow their inner, moral compass.  They help individuals find their OWN way.  Especially in adolescence, many of us can go astray due to our risk-seeking behaviors, and our magnetic pull towards taboos.   A lot of us have that fire inside.  How do we use it?  Through fiction, role-play, improvisation, emotional searches, and a slew of other exercises, LAMB allows young people the ability to explore  and engage the taboos in a safe environment.  They build confidence.  They help create goals.  They guide people to be their best.  They guided that little girl to become me.  The arts and creative thinking are keys to survival in our ever-changing world.  I mean that.   Nowadays, most of us change careers several times and must have the ability to think on our feet..adapt.  Those that cannot become stuck.  LAMB trains young people to have that ability. Not all of us that grew up with LAMB followed the artistic path for our livelihood, but I guarantee it helped all of us in whatever livelihood we have chosen.  Music and theatre improve test scores and the ability to learn new languages, including math and science.  I have no doubt that my experiences at LAMB have accentuated my aptitude for languages and science which I have used in my career.  We are conditioned through our school systems to socialize with mass amounts of peers that are the same age.  Is that normal when we go out in the real world?  No.  It is normal to relate with ALL ages, which is what one gets while attending LAMB.  Positive effects with socialization, academics, and behavior are things LAMB is responsible for in this community.  I have been involved with the LAMB theatre for over 20 years, and I cannot sing their praises enough.

But an arts group that also instills in their kids (teens participating as well as witnessing) a sense of what make a good civil society is a true value.  Shows like Columbinous, or Anne Franke and Me aren't just great theatrical performances - but life lessons.  And not just for the students.  As a parent I've watched the transformation of my daughter (an actor) not just in her craft, but as a citizen and a caring member of the community.  Sioux City has been in the news spotlight because of the bullying in our schools, and the production of Columbinus couldn't have happened at a better time.  The outreach to the schools, the eye-opening nature to parents, the opportunity to dialogue among students and teachers.  Organizations like Lamb Arts Ltd play an important role in our community.  If they weren't doing it - I don't know who would.

Lamb Arts LTD-LAMB  Arts Regional Theatre/School	112774		/users/profile/153496	Grace H.	Client Served	5	05/23/2012	I spent a number of summers at Lamb Ewe-niversity.  I am now a marketing coordinator for a technology company in Omaha, NE.  There are a couple of things that I credit with the cultivation of my people skills.  The first one is pageants.  The second one is Lamb.  Russ and Diana Wooley have created a wonderful program that helps kids come out of their shells, learn how to perform, and make new friends.  I am a huge fan of them and their theatre.
Lamb Arts LTD-LAMB  Arts Regional Theatre/School	112752		/users/profile/153458	Rick15	Volunteer	5	05/23/2012	I see the work they do with all of the youth that they have walk through their doors and how it helps the children to become more confident in their lives.  Personally, the opportunities they have given me as an actor have made me a better and more rounded individual.
Lamb Arts LTD-LAMB  Arts Regional Theatre/School	9651	10	/users/profile/11465	AndriaL	Former Volunteer	5	08/27/2009	I remember when my kids started KinderMusik--it was brand new.  What a great program!!  They loved it and learned so much!  My son even got scarves, egg shakers etc. for a birthday gift...I look back at the old home videos and it makes me smile.  I was really looking forward to my kids being able to continue and grow into all the programs Lamb has to offer, but my husband's job got tranferred and we had to move.  Honestly, Lamb is still one of the things I miss most.  Take advantage of all the wonderful things Lamb has to offer--sometimes we take things for granted and you don't realize til they (or you) are gone what great opportunities you had!
Lamb Arts LTD-LAMB  Arts Regional Theatre/School	9452	7	/users/profile/11264	Dannymarandola	Former staff	5	08/22/2009	I would have to say I feel blessed I ever met the Wooley's! I would not be in the place I am as a performer if it wasn't for them. The memories I will always carry with me from my time there is what motivates me to be a performer! To use all the wonderful things I have learned and motivate the youth to see something on stage and say, "I want to do that." When I get off the stage and I am told by a little kid that they want to be like me when they grow up it makes me more proud than any monetary achievement I may encounter!I am in one year about to embark on a European performing career! After I was excepted into the International Performing Arts Institute with 15 other college students from across the United States, I was lucky enough to be put in front of the biggest casting director in Germany and much of Europe! I will,in one year, be studying at the Joop Van Den Ende Academy in Hamburg, Germany and I believe I truly could not have done it without being welcomed into the performing world by the Wooleys, Donny Short, and the other wonderful teachers at Lamb Productions!Thank You For Everything,Danny Marandola
Lamb Arts LTD-LAMB  Arts Regional Theatre/School	9417	9	/users/profile/11226	a1dancer	Former staff	5	08/21/2009	I have been involved with Lamb Arts since I was five years old. As a student, Lamb taught me life lessons that helped me grow as a performer and a person. For the last four years I received the privilege to be a dance teacher at the Lamb school. Through this I got to bring the encouragement and see children just like I was grow into wonderful human beings. Through the arts and theater, Lamb teaches you to take risks in life and reach for your dreams. It encourages you to have fun and shows you how hard work can pay off. This organization is bringing and continues to bring life into the next generation.

Through their experience at Lamb, I have seen their confidence and creativity grow allowing several doors to open for them in school as well as the community.  Lamb has provided them with a professional environment for the arts and this fall, two children will be taking voice lessons and the other will be attending Mr Wooley's drama class for high schoolers.  We now schedule our vacations around the Summer Ewe sessions.  We are hooked on Lamb!

Dogs Forever	265944	1	/users/profile/354694	htracy1386	Volunteer	5	10/20/2015	I love Dogs Forever. It is a no kill shelter.  When they take a dog in, they are committed to that dog until it is adopted, no matter how long it takes.  I also love their seniors for seniors program.  If a senior citizen adopts a senior dog, they are not charged for the adoption.  This is a great way to pair up a person and a dog that might need each more than they know.  All of the volunteers really care and it shows in their commitment to the dogs.  Whether they are walking, feeding, cleaning kennels, helping at open houses, doing a home visit, processing paperwork, washing and drying towels and blankets, picking up poop or just playing with the dogs, it is always done out of love.  The team work is incredible too.  If someone has to miss a shift for whatever reason, there is always someone else there to step in and help them out.  Donations are always appreciated.  It costs lots of money to keep a non profit shelter open.  Rent, maintenance, utilities, dog food, vet bills, toys, treats, and office equipment all adds up.  We thank you for any donation that anyone can make...and the dogs appreciate it also.
Dogs Forever	265877	1	/users/profile/354624	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/20/2015	An amazing shelter. All of the volunteers truly care about each and every pup at the shelter.

She was found on a bike path in CR earlier this summer and Critter Crusaders first intervened. She then went into foster care through Dogs Forever. I was very impressed with how thorough the adoption process was-this organization truly wants to make sure that the placements are the right fit and they do want their animals to have a forever home. We love our little Suki very much and our family would like to thank all those who volunteer their time at Dogs Forever-you are truly life savers.  Bravo!The Davis Family

He completes our family and we knew it was meant to be as soon as we saw him online at Dogs Forever.  BENNY has a sensitive stomach. We met w Michele and BENNY and we fell in love w Benny.  Michele made sure we would be a good family for him and we understood his sensitive stomach concerns that kept other families from adopting him. Michele fostered Benny while he was sick and before he found a forever home.  I am so impressed by the volunteers, all they do for the animals- personal time, resources and making sure the animals are put into a loving home.  Benny is thriving and it was meant to be.  We are thankful for Benny and all of the volunteers at Dogs Forever:). 
Dogs Forever	265225	1	/users/profile/353976	Writer	Client Served	5	10/19/2015	I contacted this shelter in July, asking about a specific dog.  Michele responded and gave me all of the information on that dog (the good, the bad, and the ugly), and then went above and beyond to tell me about a pup that she was fostering, who she thought may be a good fit for our family.  Although I was looking for an adult dog I decided to come to CR and meet both dogs.  It didn't take long to realize that 6-month-old Emmett was going to be the perfect addition to my family, and a great playmate for my 4 and 2 year old boys.  I was very impressed with the adoption process, as it was very thorough; you could tell the staff really care about these dogs and wanted to ensure they went to the right home.  I have recommended this shelter to others since, and will continue to do so.  Thank you Michele and Dogs Forever for helping fill the hole that was left when our previous dogs passed; our family feels complete again! :-)

Dogs Forever	232850	1	/users/profile/296458	thisislifewiths	Volunteer	5	11/04/2014	Volunteering with Dogs Forever is one of the main reasons I've stuck around Cedar Rapids for as long as I have. This isn't just your average non profit, it's a family.  The dogs we care for aren't just another shelter dog to us, their family, each and every one of them. This nonprofit truly is rooted in love, and care. The care that I see on the volunteer end of things for each pup that comes into our shelter is impeccable, it's an amount of care/love that truly testifies to Dogs Forever being a family. If you haven't come in to visit the shelter and check out our pups, I truly encourage you to do so during our open hours on Saturday. From the caring people, wonderful dogs, and amazing mission, this nonprofit is one I will always support and be proud to be a part of.

What a blessing she has been to our family (two other adopted boys, my wife and I) - and what a blessing Dogs Forever was for her ... and us ... and everyone they have ever helped. If it wasn't for Dogs Forever, there was a good chance Isabelle might have ended up in a shelter that eventually euthanizes. I cannot even begin to imagine that! She is a ball of fire and so much fun. She deserved every chance to find a home where she would be taken care of and loved. Dogs Forever made that happen! To think that, had she ended up someplace else, she might not have even made it to us makes me sick to my stomach. Thankfully, Dogs Forever was there for Isabelle and she was given another chance to be the amazing sweet girl she is. If you can help Dogs Forever in this quest to SAVE THE LIVES of other sweet pooches like Isabelle... PLEASE DO SO! Thank you for your time ...
Dogs Forever	229343	3	/users/profile/292995	erin.buckingham	Client Served	5	10/29/2014	Dogs Forever is wonderful.  We have adopted all of our dogs from shelters or from rescues, so we have dealt with many different organizations.  We needed to find a new companion for our dog, Bailey, after his brother, Hutch,  died in May 2012.  We wanted a local rescue organization that is able to foster their dogs, because they are able to provide the most information about their dogs to prospective adopters.  We found Shelby online from Dogs Forever's website, and met her one warm Saturday afternoon at their wonderful facility.  After driving around and talking, we realized that we wanted to welcome her to our family.  Nancy had already told us that we were the first ones that day who had expressed interest in Shelby, so we went back to Dogs Forever and filled out the paperwork and Shelby was ours! We have been very impressed with Dogs Forever from day one.  We have even donated some dog supplies to them, so that they could continue helping other dogs.  Thank you, Dogs Forever!

I am also on the Board of another non-profit group that assists animals in our community with medical needs and facilitates rescue -  we have sent countless dogs to Dogs Forever.  They are always willing to step up & help us out, and they provide loving foster homes as well as take dogs into their small shelter.

Dogs Forever	229223	2	/users/profile/292876	Moonfire04	Client Served	5	10/29/2014	We first checked out Dogs Forever late fall of 2013 after having scoped out a couple of other rescues looking for an adoptable dog. The staff and volunteers at Dogs Forever were kind, informative, and so obviously in love with each dog in their care. They have a giant bulletin board with pictures and stories of each dog, whether they were being housed on-site at the rescue facility or in foster homes. The kennels are kept very clean, and the dogs are provided toys, treats, walks and playtime, and they are all happy and healthy.When it came to the adoption process, the staff looked out for the best interest of their dogs, waiting for the most suitable forever families to come along that would meet the physical, mental, and environmental needs of each dog, ensuring that they would be happy and well cared for and be able to transition into their new lives and families with as little stress as possible. We ended up adopting a sweet, senior lab mix named Maggie who was the perfect fit for us, with a perfectly wonderful disposition and plenty of love and fun to offer.The thing about this organization that stands out the most for me, aside from my great experience with them, is that they never give up on their fur kids. They love and care for them no matter how long it takes to get them adopted, and the joy thestaff expresses when they adopt these dogs out is a huge indicator of them loving what they do and of the passion they possess in this sometimes challenging and emotional line of work.  I recommend Dogs Forever first any time someone asks where a good place to adopt is, and I am so thankful they do what they do! Thank you, Dogs Forever!

I have assisted with many of the fund raisers organized by the shelter which raise much needed  funds for the maintenance and well being of the homeless dogs that reside there.  It is truly an extremely gratifying experience to help such a deserving organization.   If you live in the Cedar Rapids area and have extra time to devote to a wonderful cause, we are always in need of volunteers and foster homes to care for the animals in need of a temporary place to stay on their way to finding their forever family and home.

They went out of their way to work with us as we were  a 1 1/2 hour drive away.  We visited and met our dog there and were highly impressed with the compassion and dedication these people had for all the little furry friends there.  While we were there, one of the dogs was coming back from an outing with a volunteer.  The fact that they try to get these dogs out for fresh air, walks, and play left a big impression on us.  When we decided to adopt Annie, her foster mom drove her out to us and made sure she was all settled in.   They take all necessary precautions to make sure these animals are going to a safe and good forever home, and that is highly important in today's world.

Each step from fostering, application and final adoption reinforced the dedication they have to these wonderful animals. They treat every dog with kindness and respect, and we were well taken care of as clients as well. When one of our foster dogs required special medical care, we had all the support we needed.  We also had an instance to find care for a stray dog. They knew just the right steps to handle both the legal and medical angles to follow. It resulted in the stray getting the care she needed and finally being reunited with her owner. We have referred many more families to Dogs Forever since then. Fantastic organization, thanks for doing what you do!

While their finances are limited and based solely on private donations, they still make room to find one more dog, one more home. The fact that they made a decision to help senior dogs who have limited opportunities to survive at a kill shelter is an important factor for us. It's important to see someone love those old faces until the very end of their lives in their new, forever homes. All dogs in need are taken in but my heart is for those older guys who still have a lot of life left to offer a forever owner.  We donate as much as possible and would love to see DF get a bigger space to do bigger work. For now, we are grateful for their service to humanity and those beautiful souls that are saved.

All dogs are taken but my heart is for those older guys who still have a lot of life left to offer.

Thank you forever, Dogs Forever!

And it's in the warm glow of their unconditional love and joy that we appreciate the tireless efforts of Dogs Forever every single day.  
Dogs Forever	137280	2	/users/profile/183250	erikams	Client Served	5	11/12/2012	Dogs Forever really cares about the homes they end up in and the people they end up with. Most shelters that I've ever interacted with seem to care to an extent about the homes their pets end up in, but Dogs Forever goes beyond that with in-home visits by a volunteer to make sure the home is suitable and safe for the dog, as well as having adopters sign an agreement with several statements, one being that if adopter wishes to give up the dog again, they shall be surrendered to Dogs Forever. This proves to me that they really do care about the dog's well-being and do not want them to end up in a kill shelter or irresponsible hands. My husband and I adopted a young male black lab mix to add to our family from Dogs Forever, and we're so glad we did! He brings  a lot of entertainment and laughter into our lives and it feels good to have opened up space for another dog at risk of being euthanized. Thank you!
Dogs Forever	133874	2	/users/profile/179635	Melissa104	Volunteer	5	11/05/2012	Dogs Forever is an amazing and wonderful organization that I am proud to say that I volunteer for!!  I am more than happy to go to the shelter as often as I possibly can every week to take care of our dogs and to spend some time with our rescue dogs that I consider an extension of my own pack and I actually miss the dogs that we care for and feel bad if I can't get to see them at least 3 times a week.  Dogs Forever is 100% volunteer run and donation based and the only way we can stay afloat is if we have plenty of both to keep rescuing those in need.  I'm so excited to see Dogs Forever taking off and doing such an amazing job as the only No Kill Shelter in Cedar Rapids!!
Dogs Forever	131856	2	/users/profile/177448	MPR18	Volunteer	5	10/31/2012	Coming from a background of 30+ years with a 'municipal' animal shelter, I can appreciate the principal of Dogs Forever more than most. The dogs in our care are the castaways; some with medical problems, some just overweight, some neglected, some are seniors. But all of them are unwanted by either the shelter or family that brought them to Dogs Forever. Volunteers care for these dogs 3 times a day. They are given daily walks, the best medical treatment, quality food, toys, treats and an abundance of TLC. Most of the volunteers have extensive backgrounds in animal rescue and animal health and all are on the same page when it comes to the care of the dogs. Some of the 'residents' experience kindness for the first time and to witness this and be a part of it is more rewarding than words can say. These are the lucky dogs of our community. They want for nothing other than to find that special person/family to call their own and there is no 'time limit.' To be part of their journey is humbling to say the least.

I found Dogs Forever quite by accident. My experience with them was very pleasant.

They are straight forward and caring--Thank you all at Dogs Forever
Dogs Forever	125399	2	/users/profile/170581	Diana R P	Donor	5	10/15/2012	Dogs Forever is a place that runs on both heart and business acumen.  The director is tireless in her mission to save and find forever homes for these dogs and rescues ones that would otherwise be killed at a local shelter.  The volunteers are amazing in how and what they do to take care of the dogs until they are adopted.  I truly appreciate the special efforts to save and place senior dogs with mature citizens.  As a donor and a past volunteer, I highly recommend this place of love, caring for dogs and people.  Its run on a shoe-string with great results.

Dogs Forever	124758	2	/users/profile/169764	DogRunner	Volunteer	5	10/08/2012	My most recent involvement as a Dogs Forever volunteer has been with Max, a Malamute/Afghan mix.  He is 2 years old and full of youthful energy.  To keep him from going stir crazy while in a kennel at Safe Place (Dogs Forever's no-kill shelter) I volunteered to run with him daily.  His long legs and torso make him an excellent runner.  If only I was 30 years younger, I might have a chance of being able to run as long and as fast as he'd like to go!  My hope is that there might be other dog-loving runners who would be willing to run with Max.  He won't be 2 forever.  His energy level will decrease as he ages.  But for the time being, a daily jog/run/fast-paced walk is the ticket to Max's happiness and well-being.   Finally, while this review is more about Max than Dogs Forever, he's just one of many deserving dogs in the organization's care.  The DF motto says it best: "A better life for our best friends"
Dogs Forever	124681	2	/users/profile/169647	cambria2315	Volunteer	5	10/06/2012	I love that Dogs Forever advocates our Senior Furry Friends, "old" dogs make wonderful companion, just as the young whipper snappers do!  The also stick up for the misunderstood  the pit bull, these dogs are very important to my heart and deserves a fighting chance, just like the rest of them.  I chose to volunteer with this organization over the others because the efforts they're making with this breed.  
Dogs Forever	124608	1	/users/profile/169525	mactika	Volunteer	3	10/05/2012	It is all about the dogs.  Through a variety of circumstances these dogs have ended up in the care of Dogs Forever as they do not have families or in some cases had families that couldn't continue their care.  Every dog that comes here get as much love as we can give and the medical attention many desperately need.  Knowing they get to stay until their forever home is found is beyond words, no reason to push for placement just to keep them "safe".    - Until they all have a home.

I no longer have to search through difficult websites via the government. I can see votes by all members of congress and  legislature while also effectively sizing up my own local candidates. I don't know of any other means to have this sort of information so readily at my fingertips. 
Project Vote Smart	313127		/users/profile/404499	Narvin	General Member of the Public	5	10/21/2016	I was referred to the votesmart.org some time ago and it has become the 'bible' for my understanding the issues, researching  articles and speeches, and finally which representative best represents my views.  Great site, very easy to use, and the only one I can find that provides facts in a non-partisan way.

Our mass media is not telling us how our representatives voted and on what.  30 years ago, I learned of the bipartisan Votesmart.org and started to support them after learning what they had/have to offer.  Call 1888 VOTE-SMART to ask an intern your candidate question: their interns have been spending countless hours researching... You can also quickly find the answers you seek at VoteSmart.org's web site, where not only are 17 representative bills detailed with the Y/N votes indicated for your reps, but also 0-100% focus group ratings.  Answer 13 simple questions in "VoteEasy" to watch the candidates that agree with you come forward or recede with representative percentages.  Donate $10 and they will send you their biannual Voter's Self-Defense Manual rag listing the whole country's info. Check out their **** rating at the philanthropic accountability web site,  CharityNavigator.org and donate, go intern yourself, tell ten people today.  Voting is not a Democracy Sport.

There are Conservatives and Liberals everywhere that believe in us and believe that the facts ARE important. It keeps me from feeling defeated by the current political climate and is a constant reminder of why I choose to contribute to the organization.

People ages 18 to 87 come and work together at our beautiful Montana ranch  for the common goal to strengthen democracy.

Project Vote Smart	123920	1	/users/profile/168680	Karen94	General Member of the Public	4	09/30/2012	I am thankful to see this non-partisan non-profit addressing a critical national need. There is a deep-seated perception that the public is apathetic when it comes to engaging with civic issues and participating in elections. And some people ARE apathetic. But the lack of voter participation is a complex issue with many causes. Project Vote Smart squarely addresses two of them: (1) Project Vote Smart doesn't pick sides--we're all tired of politicians gerrymandering not only their districts and the election process itself, but also, gerrymandering the public into clumsy black-and-white choices about party affiliation. Like many, I'm more interested in the quality of the candidate. (2) Project Vote Smart presents clear information--I've been an information designer for 20 years--technical manuals, websites, grant proposals--and know how difficult it can be to present complex information simply. People are busy, so what may seem like apathy may simply be confusion and a lack of interest in trying to figure it out themselves.
Project Vote Smart	123911	1	/users/profile/168667	knrose	Volunteer	5	09/30/2012	I feel priviledged to be able to give two weeks of my time working with the greatest group of young people to create an accurate, non-partisan database that is offered to all people who can access the web or call an 800 number. This database allows each person to determine what positions their candidate holds on 12 issues and, if that positiion agrees with their own. To build such a resource for all incumbents AND candidates  at the federal and state  level is a labor intensive effort. Volunteers are an important contributor. Their creation is available FREE to all who seek such knowledge. And this Republic cannot survive without educated politically involved citizens.  It is the most patriotic mission imaginable.

Its website, votesmart.org, will tell you everything you ever wanted to know, and more, about the candidates who are asking for your vote.  It will tell you how they've voted in the past, what interest groups endorse them, and who contributes to their campaigns.  For anyone who wants the facts, not the spin, votesmart.org is the destination of choice.  Their award-winning "Vote Easy" feature is a design triumph and raises the bar for user-friendliness.  As a volunteer, I worked on updating, checking and double-checking data that's entered on the website.
Project Vote Smart	123869	1	/users/profile/168611	skschuck	Volunteer	5	09/29/2012	Volunteer AND donor. I first encountered PVS in about 2002 while living in Asheville NC. A May, 2004, move to Bellingham WA provided an opportunity to visit the MT ranch. After meeting the people, volunteers and paid staff alike, and helping with some work for a day, I was hooked. I returned that autumn for a 2-week member internship and each year since. The trip from the Seattle area is pleasant, and there are many attractions within driving distance for weekend enlightenment. Far more impressive is the dedication of the staff and interns to PVS' important work, particularly since the Supreme Court's "property is speech" decision. Unfortunately, while many people fund candidates' access to the media, too few support PVS' efforts to bring truth and perspective to their claims. Being retired, I do what little I can for PVS and snd will continue to do so.
Project Vote Smart	123859		/users/profile/168601	TomofGHEC	Donor	5	09/29/2012	What a wonderful source of information, and it gets better every year.  I have donated annually and several years back volunteered for a week in their Montana headquarters.  During my visit I had a chance to see in person how carefully they record, accuracy check, and analyze the mountains of data they collect. PVS allows us voters to go way beyond the slogans, false and misleading statements of the candidates, and truly determine how well they represent our views and values.  PVS should be the core resource for every voter at election time.  Tom

Project Vote Smart	123811		/users/profile/168543	eman4277	General Member of the Public	5	09/28/2012	Anybody who puts any serious amount of thought behind politics should be completely jaded by the political system. It is ruled by two parties that seem to be more worried about getting elected than actually helping the people. The media is extremely biased and it's very difficult to separate fact from fiction. For months, I kept thinking that there has to be an unbiased source of information that will help me base my vote on who supports my views or ideals. Not who is the most popular, or who puts out the most attack ads. Eventually, after googling for this unbiased website, I stumbled onto Vote Smart. Vote Smart is absolutely everything I have been looking for. It presents just the facts, and nothing more. It is nonprofit, there's no advertising, and it's unbiased. Nobody should be allowed to vote this November without first learning exactly what and who they are voting for on Vote Smart. The media wants to you to believe that everything is black or white, democrat or republican, liberal or conservative. Don't buy that. Do the research and learn the facts. The value of Vote Smart to this country is indescribable. They are an organization that needs your support. The United States needs informed voters this November. Vote Smart is not going to single-handedly completely revolutionize our political system, but every little step helps. With more support and awareness, I strongly believe they can make a big difference. They have already made a difference in my life.

The Political Courage Test, in particular, should be something that every American demands their Representatives and Senators complete.

We were impressed with the dedication of staff and volunteers to fairness, accuracy and thoroughness, as well as their kindness and appreciation of each participant.  That spirit continued even after the sad deaths of a staff member and  a volunteer.  After the day's work, horseback riding, canoeing, fishing for bull trout, reading in the Goldwater/Proxmire Library, hiking and just enjoying the beauty of the mountains or watching the flock of wild turkeys was refreshing.

Project Vote Smart	123398		/users/profile/168047	Laura Mills	Donor	5	09/26/2012	This organization is doing a vital job that no other (to my knowledge) is doing, that is they are working to inform voters.  They are completely non-partisan, their only objective being to help voters find out what they need to know in order to choose their representative leaders wisely.  In order to choose someone who represents you, you must know what a person really thinks, which can be reflected best by actions, rather than stump speeches.  So Project Vote Smart came along to give us all we need in terms of voting records, non-campaign speech and  answers to "pin you down" questionnaires which don't take platitudes for an answer.  They do not care how you vote, but rather that you have the information you need in order to pick the people who will truly represent you.

Project Vote Smart	123352		/users/profile/167995	marilyn stefano	Donor	5	09/26/2012	I've supported Project Vote Smart for many years, & have found them - founders & volunteer staff -  to be incredibly dedicated to what they do, & so helpful in sharing their vast knowledge with anyone who's smart enough to call them for information.  They do such a valuable job in helping educate voters on their congresspeople's voting records, & they are a national treasure!  Please support them so they can continue their very important work.

It is an indispensible tool.  the Founding Fathers would be proud.  Elections should NOT be popularity contests.  Votes should be made based on a candidates actual voting re cord. Vote Smart makes this possible.Yay, Votesmart!!
Project Vote Smart	123321		/users/profile/167959	Steve N.	General Member of the Public	5	09/26/2012	Project Vote Smart fills a critical component of a viable democracy, namely, unbiased information on candidates and where they stand on issues of the day so that voters can be properly informed to responsibly choose candidates.  Their communication skills are second-to-none, and they are unbelievably transparent.  The Founders and staff have undeniably revitalized the democracy of the United States.  
Project Vote Smart	123315		/users/profile/167951	idontcare	Donor	5	09/26/2012	I am very strongly non-partisan and it is stupid difficult to find non-biased information on politicians. Votesmart fills this void and goes above and beyond the call of duty with their Courage Test and the Vote Easy research tool.

Project Vote Smart	120519	1	/users/profile/163918	Margene B.	Donor	5	08/13/2012	While the numbers seem to tell you that Project Vote Smart isn't using your money for their stated goals, I believe they are working on a shoe-string budget and the public is getting a LOT for their money.  Their product is a unbiased chart showing how your elected officials have voted on topics of interest.  They show the facts, not soundbites that the media provides you.  Take a look at the small salaries the leaders of this organization gets paid.  They are not raking in millions; they are making information available with volunteers and people who believe that our voting process needs information to work.  SUPPORT THESE FOLKS doing a public service function!

Hooves & Paws Rescue of the Heartland	218758	2	/users/profile/282348	4theloveoffur	General Member of the Public	2	10/01/2014	We called and emailed in response to a post on Facebook about a dog needing a home.  The home visit went well and so we were shocked when we were denied the ability to foster and/or adopt this animal.  We were denied because one of us  belongs to an animal coalition and there is a conflict of interest between Hooves and Paws and another member of the coalition.  We feel that this is very unfortunate as we are able and willing to provide a loving home for this animal.  Yes we are very upset, but feel that this is factual and that it should be known.  
Hooves & Paws Rescue of the Heartland	204229	7	/users/profile/242835	Bateach	Volunteer	5	06/27/2014	This group reaches out to help so many animals in need. They will travel to pick up animals and will assist police by moving animals from bad conditions. The time, caring methods, finding foster homes and forever homes , and they do NOT kill animals.  They are a safe Haven" FOR ANIMALS !

They help so many, and work to help as many animals as they get asked to help. It does this well, and is one of a kind in the heartland! They give 120% into what they do!
Hooves & Paws Rescue of the Heartland	204226	6	/users/profile/266249	Annie34	Volunteer	5	06/27/2014	I am a volunteer for Hooves & Paws Rescue of the Heartland.  Not only have I learned SO much about the work of rescue, I see daily with my own eyes the hard work, sweat, blood, & tears that go into this rescue.  Even working full time jobs, they manage to rescue, vet, feed, water, nurture, rehabilitate,  medicate, vaccinate, haul hay, buy expensive special foods when needed for individual animals with special dietary needs, clean out stalls, pastures, shelters,  review & home-check potential & existing foster homes, adoptive homes,  gas for the vehicles, trucks, trailers needed, fencing, cleaning water troughs, repairs, as you can tell, there is really no end to the love that goes into this rescue, which is also honest & true.  I have been blessed to work with them when I can, & have earned their trust, which is also another factor of rescue, you have to have "trustworthy" volunteers & people, otherwise, the rescued would be at risk of having abuse or neglect happen while under their care.  God bless Billy & Genea Stoops, & their rescue!!  :)
Hooves & Paws Rescue of the Heartland	204172	8	/users/profile/242155	SpaceMtGirl	Client Served	5	06/27/2014	Genea took one look at a picture I posted of a bloodhound puppy in KY with a broken leg and she said right away she would take her. I kept in contact with Genea to follow Blossom's progress. She would send me pictures and updates. She knew that Blossom would be perfect for my family but I was dealing with my dogs arthritis and liver problems. No one else seemed to be the right fit for Blossom so she waited for me. Finally we were able to get her and now she is a cherished family member who is laying on our bed right now. If it had not been for Genea taking a chance on a little girl from KY she probably would have died. Genea & Bill help every animal they can. I don't know how they do it but I am sure glad they do. 
Hooves & Paws Rescue of the Heartland	185197	3	/users/profile/242155	SpaceMtGirl	Client Served	5	10/30/2013	My first experience with Hooves and Paws was in June 2008 when I sent out a cross-post for a bloodhound on death row in KY. Genea said she would take Blossom and I was so happy that she let me follow her progress. She was very picky about what home Blossom should go to. She decided that I would be the best person to have Blossom as a family member but I live in NH. She kept Blossom with her until I was able to get her. My husband drove from NH to Iowa to get Blossom. If it were not for Hooves and Paws Blossom would be dead. Blossom is a wonderful addition to our family and sleeps with my children. Genea does such good things for all sorts of animals. They don't even sleep much because they are so busy helping the animals. They don't care if an animal is sick - they don't want to see any animal hurt or killed. They are a wonderful rescue.
Hooves & Paws Rescue of the Heartland	204156	5	/users/profile/266177	Doosolberg	Donor	5	06/27/2014	Hooves and Paws Rescue of the Heartland is respected by volunteers, donors, law enforcement, and other rescue organizations.

Hooves & Paws Rescue of the Heartland	197597	5	/users/profile/258309	hobbes0513	Volunteer	5	04/14/2014	I offered help to foster a horse that had been a rescue/neglect case. This horse had her spine sticking up out of her back, hip bones exposed and had lice. She was in need of some TLC. Genea accepted our offer to foster her and had the mare brought to our house where we had the vet and ferrier waiting. The mare was treated and started on a meal plan that would help her slowly gain the right weight and muscle.If NOT for Hooves and Paws - without Genea, this mare would not have been rescued, would not have made the recovery she has - the mare would have would have starved to death.
Hooves & Paws Rescue of the Heartland	194377	11	/users/profile/253995	JoleneW	Board Member	5	02/16/2014	Due to the recent review made on 02/16/14 by a person who signed in as lovepaints regarding Hooves & Paws Rescue of the Heartland I would like to respond as a Board Member. Due to the fact that we do work with Law Enforcement on animal abuse and neglect cases  people who abuse and neglect their animals become very angry once their animals are removed and will discredit and blame those who did the removal.  There was a recent removal of Horses that were not being cared for in the proper manner and Hooves & Paws Rescue of the Heartland was asked to remove the Horses by Law Enforcement. This negative post showed up after this removal.  This is not unusual for this to happen by those who feel they are not in the wrong and we understand this behavior.  However, Hooves & Paws Rescue of the Heartland removes abused & neglected animals on a regular basis and we expected it would just be a matter of time before something like this to surface.  We welcome the person who wrote the negative post to contact our Attorney or Law Enforcement who ordered the removal if you they have any further issues to discuss.  
Hooves & Paws Rescue of the Heartland	194369	2	/users/profile/253979	lovepaints	General Member of the Public	1	02/16/2014	This organization loves to smear and attack other rescue groups. I have never observed such vitriol and hatred as this woman spews. Her attacks on others far out weighs any good she does.  It has been reported that she has facilitated in shipping horses to slaughter, advising people to starve horses so law enforcement can take them in a ownership dispute.

Hooves & Paws Rescue of the Heartland	191864	5	/users/profile/250434	JerryP	Professional with expertise in this field	5	12/31/2013	After going to visit Genea & Bill at Hooves & Paws Rescue of the Heartland in Glenwood Iowa, meeting their animals in person and walking their facility I have to say "I was so impressed".  They are honest & hard working people. Both work full time jobs as professionals outside the home and also run the only "No Kill" Rescue & Shelter in Mills County, Iowa for Horses, Donkeys, Mules, Dogs & Puppies.  They are a top notch "No Kill" Rescue & Shelter" in every respect. Genea & Bill shared with me the story of each animal at their facility, how they arrived and how they are progressing. They also provide educational seminars regarding the proper care of animals in general. But they specialize in Horses, Donkeys, Mules, Dogs & Puppies. I seen many before and after photos of their rescued animals.  Wow!!! They work with some of the highest neglect cases I have ever seen. And they never give up on an animal in need.  I wrote them a much deserved donation check before leaving their facility and I urge everyone to follow their work and support them and their efforts. They are wonderful husband & wife team who truly care and help make a huge difference in the lives of so many animals in need.
Hooves & Paws Rescue of the Heartland	187376	6	/users/profile/244377	Ada M.	Volunteer	5	11/01/2013	Hooves and Paws Rescue of the Heartland is one of the BEST rescues! I have had the pleasure to see firsthand how they go above and beyond the definitions of a rescue. Genea and her husband, Billy works tirelessly and endlessly and devout their entire lives to saving many animals. The love for all animals is seen in how they take care of the animals that end up in their care or foster homes flourish and so many lives have been saved. I've seen the miracles this rescue has accomplished, when other people give up, they are right there to take them in. I nominate Hooves and Paws Rescue of the Heartland not only for these attributes, but also for the hard work, education and dedication they give to the community.  I love this rescue!
Hooves & Paws Rescue of the Heartland	187349	6	/users/profile/244349	Nicole81	Client Served	5	11/01/2013	Absolutely wonderful organization.  I have adopted two pets from them, their support and advice is valuable.  I still have both of my pets and adore them.  When I was challenged with one, they offered excellent advice to get us through a rough situation.  They work together to make sure animals in a bad situation are rescued and moved into a positive situation.  Their work is of the utmost important and vital to the animals in Glenwood as well as to reaching beyond their local area.

Jessie's family was moving and they couldn't take him.  Billy and Genea gave Jessie a loving home for several years until his passing. Billy and Genea were with Jessie when he passed.  I knew the day when we arrived with Jessie that he was at a good place and loved the work they were doing.  They are dedicated and tireless rescuers.

Hooves & Paws Rescue of the Heartland	183139	4	/users/profile/240049	Golddust48	Volunteer	5	10/28/2013	Hooves and Paws of the Heartland Rescue is a NO KILL shelter and rescue.  I have had the opportunity to see what they do and how they operate.  Genea and Bill put the animals first above all else.  They are assesible to anyone and everyone by phone, email and etc to help and to answer all of your questions any time of the day or night.  I know, because I have had to call them for help.  I don't know of any other rescue that provides so many services as they do.  Please go to their website and find out more.

A couple years ago Hooves & Paws helped rescue a beautiful horse named Jake that was being abused by his owner. Jake has now been with us oh at least 4 years now. But if it wasn't for Hooves and Paws that horse would be dead I'm sure of it. They do wonderful work and it's run by a wonderful group of people who would do anything to save an animal. Thank you Hooves and Paws. 
Hooves & Paws Rescue of the Heartland	182946	3	/users/profile/239837	bgsilvergirl	Client Served	5	10/28/2013	We had a neighbor who owned property near ours. This young owner fell into drugs and worse. He left his horse alone and to die in the field. My husband and I would sneak onto the property and take him hay and water hoping to sustain him until help would come; waiting for the local authorities to do something - but they never did. Even after several calls they never stepped foot on the property that we were aware of. Fearing this poor horse would die and there was nothing we could do was pure hell for us. This agony went on for 3 years. Finally my husband ran onto the name of Hooves & Paws and contacted them. They drove 80 miles to us and went to work doing what they do best, helping helpless, defenseless animals get free from pain and a hell that they most certainly do NOT deserve. Bill and Genea aren't just wonderful people, they're angels. I cannot say enough about them. If I had a million dollars to give it would be theirs so they could build their dream and continue doing what most of couldn't or wouldn't.

Hooves & Paws Rescue of the Heartland	181860	2	/users/profile/238612	coyotek	Volunteer	5	10/24/2013	I think Hooves and Paws do an amazing job with their rescue animals.  They have the heart and soul of a champion when it comes to rescuing animals.  They have been threatened, vandalized and still they never stop help animals who have no voice of their own.  I have worked with other rescues and none of them work harder than Genea and Billy do.  They are fantastic!!! The proof is in the results of their happy and healthy animals that came to them in such poor shape, its just insane.  Take a look at Zeus, he couldn't walk do to the abuse but now, he can.  The best of the best!!!

Hooves & Paws Rescue of the Heartland	181084	8	/users/profile/237792	Leslie Whitehair	Client Served	5	10/22/2013	Someone approached my husband at work because they knew we had an acreage with horses and there were 120 mustangs that were in peril, and a rescue in Iowa was offering to wave adoption fees to anyone who could take one.  Oh, and  could you help with the rescue?  I was intrigued, so I called Genea Stoops at Hooves and Paws.  My life has never been the same.  A friend and I went to the farm where the horses were neglected.  I cried when I got out of the truck.  Horses were everywhere, all different ages, all the mares w/foal, the stallions running in several herds, not separated from mares.  Young fillies and stud colts were running around, some injured, all starving, with bloated little tummies and hips protruding.  There was no water in sight, except a frozen creekbed, and there was a fresh round bale out that we were told was put out there because they(the hoarders) knew we were coming.  We used human fences with all the volunteers there that day, to round up horses into a huge round pen.  We loaded 15 that day, all wild eyed w/ fear(30 + were resued in allMany mares who have now had their foals! ).  The young black stud colt that I brought home, would be one of the neatest experiences that I have ever lived, and am still living.  Separated from the other horses for 3 weeks, my husband and I watched lice fall off him by the thousands when treated, and cleaned up piles full of worms and bot larvae, resulting from the wormings.  He would now get to keep his groceries!  It didn't take long for him to trust us, but there were a few close calls with some very quick back hooves, and I did get bitten in the face for getting to close! (My fault... he had never had human touch and I was trying to kiss his nose! ) Today, he is being trained by me and a trainer I hired to teach both of us!  He is two, and a far cry from the scared baby that was carried on the trailer two years ago on St. Patricks Day... Oh. His name is Dublin.  Since then, I keep in close contact with Hooves and Paws, helping both monetarily and time-wise when I can.  The things that Genea and Bill at Hooves and Paws do to stand up for animals that have no voice of their own is truly tireless, heartwarming,  and amazing.  "Like" their Facebook page to keep abreast of the work they do!  The rescues, the new donkey refuge, the communication of foster animals available and followup that they do is nothing short of amazing.  Genea and Bill are truly animal Samaritans and have my utmost respect!

I got to meet them a year ago and have to say they have a Heart of Gold . They have helped so many animals . I got to meet some of their rescued babies . Genea was very kind to take time out of her day to walk me around and explain their rescue to me. They are called upon by many and if they are full they always make sure to somehow find a way to still help those without a voice of their own.

Hooves & Paws Rescue of the Heartland	179906	2	/users/profile/236554	Mom1212	Board Member	5	10/19/2013	I have been a Board Member for Hooves & Paws Rescue of the Heartland since the day they opened their doors. They far exceed any and all expectations of Animal Rescues & Shelters.They are above all honest, kind, caring & giving. There are so many Horses, Donkeys, Mules, Dogs & Puppies that have come through the gates of Hooves & Paws Rescue of the Heartland that have had no one to love them, no hope left and have given up on life.  Bill & Genea Stoops take them through a process of healing both inside & out.  This takes time, money and patience. They have transformed animals that others said could not be saved into amazing beautiful adoptable pets.  Over 500 Horses, Donkey, Mules, Dogs & Puppies have had their lives saved that may otherwise have been lost without Hooves & Paws Rescue of the Heartland. They are truly a "Place To Heal" and save those with "No Voice of Their Own".

Lusco Farms Rescue	272885	1	/users/profile/266086	Angi U.	General Member of the Public	5	11/25/2015	I saw Alf on Lusco Farms Facebook page and had to have him.  We met him and loved him.  Also loved Stewie but could only take one.  Stewie is now the mascot for Lusco Farms.  Lusco Farms was very patient with us as Alf is our only donkey.   They answered all our questions even after the adoption!! 
Lusco Farms Rescue	204061		/users/profile/266086	Angi U.	Client Served	5	06/26/2014	I adopted Alf, a large donkey.  Lura and Scott were very helpful and remain supportive. I can contact them with any questions that I have. The rescue is clean and they take great care of the donks. They have a lot of love in there hearts! Great place to adopt from!!  I would highly recommend Lusco Farms Rescue! 
Lusco Farms Rescue	272881		/users/profile/258904	Richelle B.	Client Served	5	11/25/2015	I first learned of Lusco Farms Rescue in the winter of 2013.  I did not realize that there were donkey rescues!!!  I fell in love with two donkeys and began contacting them regarding these two boys.  I eventually adopted them in the spring of 2014 and then adopted two girls in the fall of 2014.  Lusco Farms Rescue is very caring  and passionate about the care of the donkeys they rescue.  They work many hours and will travel great distances for a donkey in need.  They will take in any donkey in need of assistance; regardless of the time and money that it takes to rehabilitate the animal.  Each donkey they take in, becomes a part of their family and the rescue is their temporary home until they become adopted and find their forever home.  They screen potential adopters to ensure that each animal adopted will have a suitable home.  This is a great, caring rescue that I highly recommend to anyone looking to adopt.  Some of the best people you will ever meet!!!
Lusco Farms Rescue	198212		/users/profile/258904	Richelle B.	General Member of the Public	5	04/17/2014	I just want to let everyone know what a great organization that Lusco Farms Rescue is and I should know..I adopted two donkeys from them!  It was November/December 2013 when I decided that I wanted to adopt a donkey.  After researching them and realizing that they bond with one another, I decided to adopt two. I found Lusco Farms Rescue and began communicating with them via email as they had two little ones that were a bonded pair, that I was interested in.  I emailed them numerous times and they always emailed me back.  I asked questions...they answered.  In late January my husband and I had the chance to go to Malvern and meet  Scott and Lura and see the donkeys.  Scott and Lura were very willing and able to answer questions, let us spend time with the donkeys and tell us about some of the rescues.  We fell in love with the donkeys and knew we wanted to give them a home.  Problem...middle of winter, we have no fence, no shelter set up for them!!  We explained this to Scott and Lura and they didn't think that was a problem.  We were told that they would continue caring for the donkeys until we were ready for them to come home!!!  We adopted our babies; Nick and Max that day.  They were delivered to us on April 5th personally by Scott, Lura, and Josh.  They took the time to show us how to give immunizations/dewormer, explained the immunizations that they have had, ferrier work done and then took the time to look at our setup for Nick and Max and give recommendations etc.I honestly know that if I have questions/concerns that I can contact them and that they will offer advice.Lusco Farms Rescue is an awesome rescue and I am so happy that I found them. Please, if you're thinking about getting a donkey or two, contact Lusco Farms Resuce!!!  If you can't adopt but are able to donate; this is a non-profit that is very deserving!!

Lusco Farms Rescue	221717	2	/users/profile/235664	Jon_14	Donor	5	10/10/2014	I have becomes friends with this group over the past several years and have been impressed with their dedication to all animals in general. Their care for and concern for the mules and donkeys is incredible. They drive hundreds of miles to rescue and place their animals.  Most rescues only cover animals in a small area, but Lusco Farms covers multiple states. They are the only rescue of their kind in this area.
Lusco Farms Rescue	179035	2	/users/profile/235664	Jon_14	Volunteer	5	10/17/2013	My wife and I have gotten involved with this rescue group after having mostly worked with cats and dogs. These people are so dedicated to the donkeys and mules. There are few people that would devote the time and energy that these people do. Until meeting this rescue group, I had no idea there was such a need for them.
Lusco Farms Rescue	221640	1	/users/profile/285326	Sharon128	General Member of the Public	5	10/10/2014	First of all,  I am a long-time owner of quarter horses...showing, breeding and training them.  But due to my  advancing in age and arthritis,  it became more difficult for me to ride and raise, and train the 1000 lb. horses,  so I and my herd went into retirement.  Then my herd dwindled to 3 horses.  I have a 7 horse-stall insulated, heated barn, indoor and outdoor arenas,  and 20 acres of pasture.   Then, I came across the Lusco Rescue on the internet.  The donkeys (especially the minis) were a sign from heaven.  I read all I could about the donkeys,  on the internet and finally called Lusco.    They were very friendly and talked to me about donkeys in general, and their rescue.   I fell in love! I was going to make an appointment to see the Lusco Rescue,  when a friend of mine informed me that they knew of a mini donkey headed to slaughter if not sold....I immediately contacted the donkey owner,  and offered a home for their 2 yr. old jack.  And,  they ended up selling me the mini for $25.00. He was thin,  not gelded, and had no shots nor wormed.  I picked him up,  and then called Lusco for any and all info on how to properly raise this donkey.....Because of their help, experience,  and encouragement,   (even though I didn't get a rescue from them),  my "Boomer"  has been gelded, wormed,  and had his shots...plus I  halter broke him, had a series of farrier work done on him...he is now a happy, healthy and thriving little guy.   I hate to think what would have happened to him if I had not seen and talked to this wonderful rescue. Lusco Rescue is one of the most loving, caring, and dedicated rescues out there....because of them,  I found  and fell in love with the donkeys....if not for them,  my little  "Boomer" would not be with us today....I thank them from the bottom of my heart....oh,  and "Boomer"  thanks them too...:).
Lusco Farms Rescue	221579	1	/users/profile/235807	LuLu54	Donor	5	10/10/2014	This is a wonderful and much needed rescue. I became involved with the rescue when attending one of their fundraisers....since then they have come along way to get the word out there that there is a need for donkey rescue! I have visited their rescue and the animals have a wonderful life while in their care. Lu and Scott take great care to who they allow to adopt the donkeys and make sure it will be a good fit and that the animal will have a wonderful forever home. I will continue to support this rescue as much as I can and attend their fundraisers!!!Keep up the great work Lu and Scott and team!!LuAnn Kahle 
Lusco Farms Rescue	179185	2	/users/profile/235807	LuLu54	Donor	5	10/17/2013	Wow where do I begin...the first time I got to meet Scott, Lu and the "Lusco Team", was at a fundraiser at Wild Buffalo Wings restaurant at Council Bluffs. Wow once you ask them about their rescue...you will get an ear full! I never thought that there was that many donkey, mules and ponies that needed homes! They work hard to get the animals that come to them, back to a healthy state and find them the right homes, so they can live out the rest of their days in a loving and caring environment . They also go above and beyond to help other rescues of the same nature.I went and visited their rescue this summer and took some friends with me....we had a wonderful time and the donkeys, mules and horses where all loved and cared for! The animals came to us to get a pat, and boy, did they love you when Lu got the bag of carrots!!! lolMy husband and I try to attend the fundraisers that they have. We where at their poker run...(evening events.) Great time and it was all for the animals!!!  :) We are happy that they part of the Southwest Iowa Coalition too!!!
Lusco Farms Rescue	221552	2	/users/profile/285239	cags05ap	Client Served	5	10/10/2014	Do not know where to begin...My husband and I grew up in town and were  never around equine. A year and a half ago we bought a home on 3 acres and the previous owner left his neglected mule there. We all fell head over heels for him and we learned quickly (as best as we could anyways!) and made sure he was loved and healthy again! Fast forward to August 2014 and due to unfortunate circumstances we are losing our home which is devastating in itself but had to find a home that was worthy of beautiful Joker. We never felt comfortable with anyone who wanted him, so being the research junkie I am I came across Lusco Farms. Contacted them told them our situation and they came and got him. I knew we made the right choice when the first thing Scott did was go up and hug my friend Joker (just like I did everyday!) and introduced himself to him! Wow! His wife Lura was so very kind and thoughtful too! Watching him leave was and is still very hard on us, mostly me as I was very close with him but we know it was the right thing to do.  At least I know he is safe and loved. I honestly cannot even find words to express what they have done for us. I wish I could tell everyone how wonderful, selfless and compassionate these people/rescue are!!
Lusco Farms Rescue	221467	1	/users/profile/237903	Jennifer277	Client Served	5	10/09/2014	I can't say enough great things about this rescue and what they do for the animals, and for the adopters.  A year and a half ago I adopted two wonderful donkeys from Lusco Farms, and through the whole searching, adopting, and post adoption period they have been wonderful.  Their genuine concern and love for these beautiful animals shines through all that they do.
Lusco Farms Rescue	181193	1	/users/profile/237903	Jennifer277	Client Served	5	10/22/2013	My husband decided he wanted a miniature donkey, so I began looking at rescue sites.  Lusco Farms was the first one I saw, and contacted, and the first to email me back...like two hours later.  We ended up adopting two donkeys, Guido and Brady, and we couldn't have been happier throughout the whole process.  I was impressed with their adoption process- you could tell they genuinely cared about these wonderful creatures receiving good homes...and I was very pleased with their requirement that they be returned to the rescue if a situation ever arises where we are unable to care for them anymore.  Both Lura and Scott have been available to answer any questions we've had, and done so quickly.  It is evident that they have a huge heart for these animals.  Any donkey that is lucky enough to come in to their rescue, is guaranteed a good life from that point on.  I highly recommend them.  My donkeys have made my life so much more enjoyable, and definitely more interesting!

They do everything possible to help out the donkeys in need even if it means having to put family plans off for a bit. I've volunteered for them since they started the rescue and I absolutely love it. It has taught me so about the false facts about donkeys.

They will always hold a special place in our hearts. Thank You Lusco Team for all that you do for the animals,(big or small)
Lusco Farms Rescue	204924	1	/users/profile/266991	Kerry13	Donor	5	07/01/2014	Donkeys have long gotten a bad wrap for being kind of silly to look at, having a funny voice that doesn't resemble anything like that of a horse and more than anything for being stubborn. For all those reasons, they are often neglected & even worse, discarded into horrible situations. While it is true that they can be stubborn, there is good reason- it's because they are wicked smart. For example, before asking a donkey to cross a stream, you better make sure there isn't an easier way to get around the water because they are too smart to tricked into getting wet if they don't have to. It's not that they don't want to please, it's just that they don't want to be made to do anything that they don't have to do the hard way. Once humans figure that out, making friends with donkeys is easy & fun to include friendships that last for years & years. This organization has done wonders for not only saving, protecting & fostering donkeys but also promoting them as the great animals that they are!!

Lusco Farms Rescue	181199	1	/users/profile/237908	Kate63	Client Served	5	10/22/2013	We feel so lucky to have adopted a donkey from Lusco Farms.   Last winter we suddenly needed a companion for our horse.  We had never even seen a standard donkey up close, but we loved them when we visited Lusco.  The staff made sure we had all the information we needed, and they even hauled our donkey to our door.  They clearly were invested in her; they stayed as our horse met and accepted the donkey.   We got consistent support and advice as we cared for our donkey and then moved donkey and horse to a boarding barn.  From there, we better established ourselves at home for horses, and we took on a boarder.  We no longer needed Donkey. Lusco Farms came and got her from us, graciously thanking us for caring for her as long as we did.  They were able to adopt her out to someone else.  Everybody wins!  What a great charity!!

She passed a year ago this time and adopted a second jenny to be with Honobee. An unforeseen situation caused us to surrender both donkeys back to Lusco farms but we have kept our relationship with Lusco farms to the point we plan to foster donkeys for them over the summer months only to help take weight off their herd. We have donated hay to the equine as well and support their fundraisers. They do a fantastic job with their rescue by taking a misunderstood equine by the public and educating them to find forever homes.

Lusco Farms Rescue	179427	2	/users/profile/236074	SKM89	General Member of the Public	5	10/18/2013	While I am a member of the public, I also have firsthand knowledge of this terrific group through the Southwest Iowa Animal Coalition.  This group works tirelessly to not only rescue and provide the care these animals need, but also to adopt them out. They can be seen regularly at area adoption events, bringing the donkeys along for the public to see, and to educate the public about donkey rescue.  Many of the donks that are rescued have been neglected, Lusco Farms takes them in, provides the food, attention and vet care they need until they can be rehomed. If this isn't dedication, I don't know what is.

What a wonderful rescue organization this is....totally dedicated to finding safe, new homes for donkeys in need.  It was clear to us from our first visit that Lusco Farms provides a much needed service in an area that lacks other animals in need.  We received top-notch support and guidance through the adoption process and the rescue continues to be available to us whenever we have questions about donkey care....they also love to hear updates on how our new "donkey kids" are doing!

Every weekend, and often during the week they can be found responding to someone with unwanted donkeys, or building new places for the animals they take in.  They can frequently be found spending  their weekends educating people on the responsibility of animal care and ownership.  They diligently pursue ways of making their farm a place for those animals in need of loving care.  It's obvious they love what they do when you talk with them.  Their enthusiasm is contagious.  I adopted 3 of their donkeys.  They spent their Sunday driving over 300 miles to deliver them to me, and then spent time explaining the care and feeding of them.

I'm constantly amazed at how far the Shehans will go to rescue donkeys, they do much more than other rescue groups would do to bring donkeys in and to get them adopted.  We are going through a cross-country move and Lusco Farms is helping us out with some of our livestock and I know my donkeys are in the best possible place until I can get them moved because they are staying at Lusco Farms.  I would be so worried if I had someone else taking care of them but with Lusco Farms I know they are getting the specific care and understanding that donkeys need.

It is so great to see these animal get another chance and to know that someone will help them.  Until they find their new forever home Lusco will take care of them and love them.

At our grand opening I was approached by Scott Sheehan, who spoke to me about Lusco Farms Donkey Rescue.  I had never heard of 'donkey rescue' before and was immediately moved by his love and concern for these tender animals.  As such, I directed our store to partner in any way we could to provide Lusco with marketing, cash, and building community awareness.  Lusco brings some of their animals out for petting, so our customers and public can see the work and progress of the donkeys. We look forward to maintaining our sponsoring partner status with Lusco Farms, and invite anyone with "Heart" for donkeys to join in.   Bruce Eide,Loess Hills Harley-DavidsonPacific Junction, Iowa

I called Scott at Lusco Farms to see about bringing some of the people I serve to see his miniature donkeys.  We pulled the bus right up to the barn.  Our people, many in wheelchairs, got out and they brought their donkeys to us.  They worked with each individual to get them comfortable with the animals.  The donkeys often rested their heads on the laps of the people in the wheelchairs.  It was a great experience and I would recommend them to anyone for pet therapy, for adoption, etc. Kudos to Lusco Farms!

We are located in Pittsburgh, PA. Mindi, the founder, has been a huge source of support for us in this new chapter. The amount of time and research that they put into the state maps of puppy mills is huge, but it gets people's attention. They protest every weekend in every kind of weather, and their efforts have helped to reduce the demand for mill dogs in pet stores. Their efforts have inspired so many to get involved with the cause, and, with them, we hope to reach more.

MIndi Callison referred me to Hearts United for Animals in Auburn NE and we adopted a beautiful, loving Cocker Spaniel that we have had for 2 years.  My husband, Craig, and I volunteered at one of the protests in front of Dyvigs Pet Store in Ames, Iowa in 2015.  We found out first hand what a dedicated organization Bailing Out Benji is.  They are so compassionate and involved into educating the public to the horrors of puppy mills.  In such a short time, they have grown the brand and the mission of spreading the word and now have outreach organizations in several other states besides Iowa.There needs to be 100 more Bailing Out Benji's and 1,000 more Mindi Callisons!!Becky BrownSioux Falls, SD

I was so impressed by Mindi's story, her determination and her drive to put and end to the cruel industry of large scale dog breeding. Several months later, I had absolutely no hesitation when presented with the opportunity to help bring Bailing Out Benji to Texas. I knew there were puppy mills in Texas, yet I had not anticipated the extent of this horrible industry in our state. As a volunteer for Bailing Out Benji Texas, I am able to educate fellow Texans about the presence of puppy mills in our state, backed with facts and data from reputable sources. I am proud to be a part of this wonderful organization that is dedicated to end the suffering of so many precious lives.

Many people have been educated across the globe and as a result have adopted at their local shelter/s and or breed specific rescues!It takes a village! We must ALL do our part to end animal cruelty in and out of Puppy Mills. If you want change, be the change! Get out and help protest, educated, contact your legislatures and fight the good fight like BOB has . Keep up the fantastic job Bailing Out Benji!

Bailing Out Benji	284158	3	/users/profile/374194	Writer	Client Served	5	03/31/2016	I have always been an animal lover. I volunteered at a vet as a teenager, had many pets as a child and got my first dog in my early twenties. I wasn't allowed one as a child because I was allergic, but I didn't care and toughed it out anyways to  have a beloved dog. I got a dachshund because I had wanted one for years. I found a breeder and picked her up at 8 weeks old. As much as I loved animals, I had no clue about rescue or the horrors that so many dogs endure due to puppy mills. I discovered rescue a few years later and adopted my second dog from a dachshund rescue and was feeling good about saving a life. Still, I had no idea what a puppy mill was. I was just browsing Facebook one day about 4 or 5 years ago, and one of the dachshund pages I follow showed a link to an article about puppy mills written by Bailing out Benji. I was horrified, cried tears and felt enraged that this horrific suffering was going on and so many people either don't know about it or are the people who are perpetuating it. From that moment on, I have been active about educating the people I know about puppy mills, as well as doing my part to be sure not to support those who support mills in any way. I'm educating my daughters now, and I can guarantee my girls would never "buy" a pet. Bailing out Benji is  a great wealth of information teaching so many about the perils of puppy mills and pet store puppies, but even more Bailing out Benji is  also a group of dedicated activists making a difference.

I personally networked with them to help close a cruel roadside zoo that was not properly caring for their animals, their research and information was key in educating our community to save the animals in that zoo. I also worked with them on other projects and could not have achieved the successes I did in educating others if it weren't for the information and resources provided by Bailing Out Benji. They are passionate about animals and dedicated to education and sharing information to help in the fight against the cruel practices of dog breeding and animal neglect.  This organization gives their all and when that isn't enough they dig down deep and give some more. The animals are very lucky to have an organization like B.O.B. on their side.

Bailing Out Benji	284060	1	/users/profile/374092	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	03/30/2016	Bailing Out Benji is a phenomenal non-profit that prides itself in awareness and being an advocate for those puppy mill dogs that do not have a voice on their own.  Being a foster and adoption site for several different rescues over the past 4 years, one of the most common things I hear is I never knew what a puppy mill was. Their stories always go something like this; I purchased my from an ad in the paper or online. They told me I didnt have to drive to them they would meet me a gas station and pick the puppy for me. Or let me come to their property but we will bring out a few for you to look at and not let us inside or see the parents. With continued education done by Bailing Out Benji the community will continue to learn how we in Iowa are living in the 2nd biggest puppy mill state in the Nation. We need a group out fighting for these dogs and getting the word spread. For instance these 10 Yorkies that were all turned over by a puppy mill breeder. These dogs had never touched or felt grass, lived in wire cages. All the dogs had never had any vet care, teeth rotting and hanging out of their mouths. One of the dogs did not even have an eyeball, just an open eye. Even though Bailing Out Benji is a nonprofit and solely relies on donations to keep up the education. Bailing Out Benji worked very hard starting and helping a fundraiser to raise over the $8,000 that was racked up in vet costs to get these poor ones treated.

We feel that we are part of the organization.  True friendships and bonds have been made with everyone we've  had the opportunity to serve or volunteer with. When we volunteer with Amanda the Panda we always feel that in someway shape or form we are making a difference. This organization is very well run with only a staff of 3. Every time we volunteer we never feel frustrated or that our time wasn't used to wisely.  It is not uncommon to be greeted with a hug.  The best feeling is to be recognized and given a hug by a client that recognizes you away from Amanda the Panda
Amanda Cares Inc	113944		/users/profile/155044	AmDaniels	Volunteer	3	06/06/2012	I have enjoyed all the time that I have spent with Amanda the Panda. I went into my volunteer experience wanting to help others who have had a death in their family because I knew the impact that death had on the lives of others. During the time I spent with Amanda the Panda I began to open up and share my own story and feelings about the death of my loved one. The death of my loved one was not something I had every talked about, and at first I didn't talk about it. I learned through the various activities that I had participated in that my experience allowed others to be open and honest about how they felt as well. During one activity there was a child that did not want to share about their emotions during the loss of their loved ones, and when I shared that I was angry at the time that child was able to open up. The remaining sessions we spent together the child was more open and willing to share. The friendships you make with the staff, volunteers, and families impacted by Amanda the Panda are amazing. The staff at Amanda the Panda go above and beyond every day to make all the people they meet feel welcomed and special.

I know this because I have heard numerous volunteers say it and I had thought the same.  After being involved with support groups and weekend camps, I saw up close and personal what the power of grief counseling can do for those who suffer with the loss of a loved one.  The toll that death takes on everyone is different, but resources offered by Amanda the Panda can have life changing affects in individuals and their families.

Amanda Cares Inc	64497		/users/profile/70515	Chris J.	Board Member	5	02/07/2011	About three years ago a friend, who used Amanda the Panda's (ATP) services when she was a child, knew of my experience volunteering for a summer camp for chronically ill children and said I should get involved with ATP.  I have since had the opportunity to participate and support numerous events and engage families who have experienced the death of someone close to them.  Our services are designed to support the needs of everyone in the family/household (like we say, we are here for those from ages 6-96) and provides hope and healing for those most impacted by the loss. I have enjoyed every aspect of my volunteer experience and continually gain motivation from the amazing volunteers/staff to the family members we serve.  My experiences range from helping with the remodeling of the office, to wrapping and delivering Cheer Boxes during the holiday, to serving as a Camp Amanda counselor.  The power of our mission excites me daily and I know that with the right people, right motivation and right resources we can/will achieve great things and continue to provide amazing services to support hundreds of families who are going through a healing process.  We are thankful for all our supporters, donors and volunteers, and hope you will check out our web-site to find out more about what we do in the community.

The prior Executive Director (and founder) had a huge passion for what she did, running Amanda the Panda for approximately 25 years.  The current Executive Director (Charlie) has as much passion as the prior.  Charlie is a cheerful and bubbly person who listens and is compassionate for the families who have lost a loved one.  The other staff are exciting individuals with a simlar passion for what they do also.  Death is one of the hardest things for people to live with and knowing others are grieving and listening helps the individuals work through the loss.  They realize their feelings are not abnormal.  Amanda the Panda assists with allowing the families to grieve openly, knowing there will not be any ridicule, and support groups allow the families to talk and live their life, sharing their experiences.  Each person grieves their own way and Amanda the Panda helps them with the process.

All of Amanda the Panda's services are provided at no cost to the families. When bereavement support is available, grieving children are 20 times less likely to develop behavior disorders, 10 times less likely to develop substance abuse issues, and 5 times less likely to commit suicide. This vital grief support makes a lasting and life altering positive impact on the children and families of Iowa, allowing more children to return to the mainstream of their lives with the coping tools they need.

Amanda Cares Inc	113479		/users/profile/154419	Christie C.	General Member of the Public	5	06/01/2012	I have known two families who were served by Amanda the Panda following a death in their families.  The support and thoughtful gift boxes at Christmas time made a huge difference in their lives and helped make what was sure to be a tough holiday much more meaningful. Amanda the Panda is such a unique organization because it serves people in need emotionally during a time of grief.  What is so inspirational is that it really does help people - both children and adults -  grieve well and to have an outlet for sharing their feelings and emotions with others who understand what they are going through.     
Amanda Cares Inc	113409		/users/profile/154331	willow_bauer	Volunteer	5	05/31/2012	This is a great non-profit that works hard to help children and families through their process of grief.  It seems like every time I tell someone I volunteer for Amanda the Panda, they tell me how the organization has helped them or someone they know.  The loss of a loved one is a difficult experience to deal with on your own, and Amanda the Panda has perfected their process of helping people cope.

Amanda Cares Inc	86517		/users/profile/96846	AmandaWebber	Board Member	5	04/20/2011	During an Amanda the Panda orientation a woman was present to share her familys story of grief when losing her husband. She was so very passionate and thankful for the support and generosity. It was truly an unfiltered sight of expression and gratitude.  The Executive Director is so zealous about this organization, it is hard not to want to be a part of it. She continues to keep Mrs. Zimmermans vision insight and expresses the same emotion for Amanda the Panda as if it was the very first day of Amandas unveiling. Members of this board are stern and faithful, they watch over this organization just as if it was one of our children receiving grief support.   Camp Amanda provides emotional outreach and a place to collaborate with others cooping with loss. This camp opens our kids lives to endless support throughout a weekend long retreat, allowing them to express, heal and have fun. 
Amanda Cares Inc	79826		/users/profile/87173	Heidi	General Member of the Public	5	02/28/2011	I would like to Thank Amanda Panda for giving me the strength to get through the holidays knowing that what I was feeling was normal. I became aware of this organization from a co worker who had lost her mother and she told me about the gifts and how much she has received support from Amanda Panda. From there I was unsure about it because I too lost my mother but my son was a infant and could not benefit from the services, also it was not local to my home. It wasnt until I went to the Iowa Donor Network Hope for the Holidays that I became more aware of the organization. First my son was 2 and has such a connection to my mother, who passed away suddenly, when he was 2 months old.  His knowledge of her presence and also of HEAven is truely amazing. Most people do not beleive that kids see things and beleive things that us as adults feel we cant. HAving him in my life has made me believe everyday my mother is with me always and a guardian angel. When we arrived at the event Amanda the Panda came over and he fell head over heels with her and sleeps with the BEar that she gave him at the event every night, He says she knows grandma and that is why he has that, becasuse we are special to have loved ones in heaven.. He now has a love for stuffed animals and sleeps with dozens of them becasue of that. He knows that his own grandma gave him one when he was a baby so the understanding of it fit in perfect to Amanda Pandas donation. HE just loved sitting at a table with her and other volunteers playing.. As for me sitting in the event, felt a new found sense of help. Not only what I was going through as a daughter losing a mother, but also to know that there are places for if the unthinkable ever happened to me, and that is that myt son will find comfort in others who have lost as well. I have been on a lonely path of no one understanding and other who have not been through the loss thinking I was crazy. It wasnt until my husband also heard from others they felt the same, abandonment, lonliness, frustrations but also to know they are with us!  Charlie gave such a empowering speech that I replay it everyday in my head of, ITS OK, but I also count my blessings everyday and am so Thankful that children who lost loved ones can go somewhere to find that sense of life and togetherness. I wish my son who is only 2 could have that as well. I fear the day he forgets about the bond or quits talking about my mother. We speak of her everyday and to see the video of the kids without their parents was a true eye opener to live each day like it is your last, and to treasure every moment you can!! Thank you!

Amanda Cares Inc	70266		/users/profile/76803	mjgonzales	Donor	5	02/17/2011	Amanda the Panda organization is amazing. My daughter and I attended the Grief Camp and Support Group to help us deal with a tremendous loss. The staff was exceptionally attentive to our needs and helped us navigate the grief process in way where we both came out whole. Amanda the Panda is now on my annual giving list. The staff is budget conscious, the organization has a great network of community support, and clients value Amanda's volunteers. A worthy cause indeed!
Amanda Cares Inc	69778		/users/profile/76263	ltlangl	Client Served	5	02/17/2011	I lost my dad the day before thanksgiving 2010.  Numerous friends told me about Amand the Panda for my self and my 6 and 8 year old sons.  From the moment I walked in the door at the first support group meeting and was greeted with a hug I knew that is where we were supposed to be and it was going to be a part of my life from that day forward.  When the boys and I are done going through the program I know in my heart that is where I am supposed to be to help other people that are going through the same thing I am feeling now.  Amanda the Panda is one of the most AMAZING things I have ever been a part of and can't wait to continue this journey.
Amanda Cares Inc	68697		/users/profile/75062	mwenthe500	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/15/2011	Amanda the Panda has been known throughout the Des Moines, Iowa area just by the mention of the name.  They are a wonderful organization in our community that helps young and old alike to deal with grief.  As a Funeral Director in this community for over 30 years, Amanda holds a special place in my heart for all those they have have helped.  The boy whose father died, and he needed help understanding why.  The little girl whose Daddy died in Iraq just couldn't understand what war meant and why her Daddy had to go and not come home.  The Dad who lost his wife and was left to raise four children alone.  Amanda reached out to all these people, and showed them first of all understanding, then friendship.  They figured out how they could best help them, and then did it.  What a gift of service Amanda the Panda has..they are just magnificent.  God Bless them all for what they do!!
Amanda Cares Inc	68008		/users/profile/74320	HendersonGirls	Volunteer	5	02/14/2011	My husband passed away in September 2004 from stomach cancer when he was just 39.  He left behind 4 children ranging in age from teenagers to toddlers.   From the time he was diagnosed until when he died was just 7 months.   During that time - so many friends and family were there to help us, but after his death - everyone had to get back to their lives... and it became very quiet.  Not many people knew what to say or what they could do to help - and frankly - neither did I.    Then, along came Amanda the Panda!  They offered some unique holiday support that simply became a life line for us during that first Christmas season.  Then, we were able to attend camp, family outings, etc...   Amanda the Panda is a unique organization that comes in just when everyone else steps out.  They understand.  They offer support.  And, they help you to find your way to a new "normal".    Soon after being a "client" - I began volunteering at camp.  More recently, I have helped facilitate support groups.   Being able to help others who have experienced significant loss not only provides support to them, but helps me to grow and heal as well.    There just isn't any other organization who can do what Amanda the Panda offers.   It almost becomes the "club" you never wanted to join, but you are thankful beyond words that it exists and is always "accepting new members."  Simply put - these are services that are life-changing for all involved!

Amanda Cares Inc	67798		/users/profile/74106	jlhartl	Client Served	5	02/14/2011	My daughter and I attended camp after my husband (her father) passed away.  The camp was a great experience for her, and it has had a lasting impact on her.  She still talks about it a year later (which is pretty special for an 8-year-old!).  Not only did the camp help her, but I was supprised at how much the adult camp helped me.  I was very comforted when I realized that even though everyone around our circle got there because of different circumstances, the emotions and thoughts that we were dealing with were surprisingly similar.  I would recommend this organization to anyone who has had a loved one pass away.  They are awesome!
Amanda Cares Inc	67637		/users/profile/73918	Megan	Volunteer	5	02/13/2011	I have been a volunteer with Amanda the Panda for almost 5 years now and it is an organization that changes lives.  I realized how important it is to have a group like this in your community.  I have a 9 year old daughter and cannot imagine losing her...god forbid something tragic should ever happen to myself or my family it is a blessing to know there is Amanda the Panda.  We all will experience a death in our lives at one point and we all must find a way to live a new normal after that death.  Amanda the Panda shows you and helps you to cope and how to find your new normal and to celebrate the loved one you lost.
Amanda Cares Inc	67608		/users/profile/73889	radar999	Donor	5	02/13/2011	Nearly 25 years ago, my husband lost a dear friend in a duck hunting accident.  Jim Ketelson was alone one very cold November morning, and no one knows exactly how his accident happened.  His car and boat were found near his hunting site, however, Jim's body was not recovered for another four months.  Jim left behind a wife and two young daughters.  We stayed in close contact with Jim's widow, Kathe, and could only imagine the challenge to explain this accident to young girls - eight and five years old -- the same age that our girls were at that time, too.  What I'll always remember is Kathe telling us about this wonderful camp that was available to children in Iowa who had lost a parent.  Kathe's children were elated when their dad's body was found in February, several months after his accident.  In a young child's mind, they would wonder if 'dad just walked away.'  So, to find his body, and then experience healing while attending a camp - designed to help them with their feelings, was life altering for this young family.  My husband and I have decided that Amanda the Panda is an extremely worthwhile organization and we proudly give donations to this program each year.  I only wish there was a similar program available to families in South Dakota.   Linda Dunleavy3701 E. Freda CircleSioux Falls, SD 57103

Amanda Cares Inc	67348		/users/profile/73607	ATP Intern	Volunteer	4	02/12/2011	Death was always a topic I never wanted to talk about. To be honest, it was something that scared me a bit because as someone who is left behind to grieve... it really hurts. Amanda the Panda is an organization that walks you through the pain step by step. The staff and all the volunteers take the time to help you get back up, hold your hand and let you know that you will make it! You can do it! The camps provide an atmosphere of friendship, encouragement and love in a time when you feel down and could really use it. Their support groups are staffed with an amazing group of dedicated volunteers that work with you in your most trying times. I have seen the staff go out of their way to meet the needs of the support group and camp participants. The Amanda the Panda crew though few in number is strong and powerful in will and heart and can accomplish anything they set out to do because they truly care about those they serve. I feel truly blessed to have volunteered my time for such an outstanding organization. 
Amanda Cares Inc	67191		/users/profile/73434	Grateful Widow	Client Served	5	02/11/2011	I had never heard of Amanda the Panda when my 40 year old husband passed away 9 years ago.  I was suddenly a widow raising 3 children.  My family benefited in many ways from this organization.  I attending the parent support group.  It was a safe place for me to talk about my grief and make friends with others that were grieving.  My daughter attended the children's support group.  We both attended camp and family events through out the year.  My daughter looks back at those experiences with fond memories.  My daughter felt comfort spending time with other children who had experienced the death of a close family member.  She once said, "they are like us."  My daughter also appreciated being able to talk to a doctor about my husband's death.  He was able to explain things that she hadn't felt comfortable asking me.  Celebrating the first Christmas without my husband was especially difficult, but the care package gave us something to look forward to each day in December.  My children still remember some of the special gifts they received in that care box.  I received my first Amaryllis bulb in that box and have continued to plant a bulb each winter since then.  Just like that dead bulb bloomed, Amanda the Panda helped me get through the depth of my grief to bloom again.

Amanda Cares Inc	64382		/users/profile/70393	VISTA	Volunteer	5	02/07/2011	As a year long full time AmeriCorps volunteer for Amanda the Panda from 2009-2010, I got an inside look at this wonderful organization.  Amanda the Panda really does fulfill its mission to bring hope and healing to grieving families.  The people who are touched by Amanda the Panda stay in touch, often becoming volunteers to help show the grieving that it can get better.  Sometimes, years later, we get letters from people who came to camp as kids.  One woman expressed how going to camp as a teenager after her father's death helped her reconcile with her husband's death, years later.  It was evident in the many handwritten, emailed, and personally delivered thank yous and we couldn't have done it without yous that, every year, many lives are changed for the better, thanks to Amanda the Panda.

We contacted them  after our cat, Stuben passed away at 16 years old. We were devastated, but knew our home needed another companion.The representative told us all about their special needs cats, but we were looking for something else. They didn't have anything that fit our needs. They could have just let us go walk away and search elsewhere but they didn't. They recommended another organization and even contacted that organization notifying them what we were looking for.We feel so blessed to have adopted Gabby. Thank you to all the people at Raccoon Valley for making that happen...they really DO put animals first.

Even though we did not adopt from this organization, they offered to help us keep our beloved Charlie by coming to our home and working with us so that we could keep him.We are so grateful for all the time and effort they gave us and are proud to report that Charlie and his humans are now better educated and doing fine together!

Raccoon Valley Animal Sanctuary & Rescue	288977	2	/users/profile/379181	Writer	Client Served	5	05/06/2016	In 2005 I walked into the shelter with a broken heart. I had just lost our beloved Lady after 13 years and I wanted to donate her bed and other items to the shelter. I was not interested in loving again. A kind woman accepted my donation, and listened while I stumbled to find the words of how heartbroken I was. She asked me to wait a minute while she got my receipt.She left the room. When she returned, she had a dog by her side. She asked if I would hold her leash while she completed the receipt. I reluctantly agreed.The little dog leaped onto my lap and just stared at me. It's soulful eyes went right to my heart, and I kept looking away only to be drawn back into her stare as if she was saying...I know you hurt, but I really can help heal your heart if you'll let me.I sat with her for about 30 minutes, and then asked the woman what her story was. Her reply: "She's waiting for you to fill out adoption papers." I said, "no no...what's her story? Why is she here."? She replied, "She's lonely and needs a home." That was enough for me.That was 11 years ago. Sunny is still with me today. Thank you for "just knowing".

Miu, a special needs kitty, was one of our favorites that ended up staying with us until her death from cancer at the age of 10.  RVAS was there to support us and Miu.  We also adopted Watson, another kitty, who has been with us for 11 years now.  When you adopt from them they're there for you for the life of that animal.  They stand behind their adoptions and that's what makes them the best.

They make sure the match is right for everyone so it's forever.  They also provide support to the adopters and the animals they adopt for the life of that animal.  They find solutions and make you part of that solution.   They also provide help that keeps dogs & cats in the home which leaves more room in shelters for those that are in immediate need.  I'll always support them.
Raccoon Valley Animal Sanctuary & Rescue	288285	2	/users/profile/378503	Writer	Volunteer	5	05/04/2016	I've been a volunteer for animals for several years and while I have had mostly positive experiences with most of the organizations I've been involved with, Raccoon Valley has been my favorite by far. They are so much more than an animal rescue. They bring much needed education to the community regarding all aspects of animal welfare, from neglect, abuse, legislation and of course the warm fuzzy stories of adoption. And they are heads above any organization I've ever been a part of when it comes to helping their peers. I have been a part of transporting animals, supplies to other organizations as well as, helped with tabling events promoting not ONLY their animals, but other organizations who needs a little extra "push" and exposure to get their organizations/animals noticed. And not to continue the glowing review, but the people are some of the kindest and most dedicated people I know. Love these guys and the work they do!

I recommend this organization for all questions and concerns related to the human-animal bond.

Raccoon Valley Animal Sanctuary & Rescue	247622	6	/users/profile/330676	V-Van-V	Client Served	5	07/06/2015	Four years ago my brother called and asked if I was ready for another cat, since my most senior cat had passed a couple of years earlier.  After seeing a picture of a beautiful DLH cat with the most beautiful china-blue eyes, I knew she was coming home with me.  The problem:  I had another senior cat at home who was still missing her late snuggle-buddy.  To the rescue was RVAS, who armed me with baby gates (for introducing the girls) and bolstered my patience.  It was  along road, but eventually they were able to share their human.  Without RVAS, I probably would have given up on the process long before I got to the end of the tunnel.  Since the elder of these two has since passed, I'm starting to consider adopting another cat, and I know RVAS will be there to support me in the process of introductions and integration, once again.  
Raccoon Valley Animal Sanctuary & Rescue	247304	6	/users/profile/334822	Watson6961	Client Served	5	07/02/2015	RVAS helped us find a cat with a personality that matched me and my family's.  He sits on my lap every morning while I eat breakfast, he sleeps next to me at night and we watch the Cubs together.  We had originally overlooked him because he was 'older' and I wanted a kitten.  They asked me to "just meet him" and sure enough it was an immediate connection. He grabbed my Cubs hat off my head and tried to walk away with it so, I knew right there he was a Cub's fan.  How could we not adopt him?   He's got a huge personality and is a clown one minute and cute and cuddly the next. He's been part of our family for 10 years now and he's not going anywhere!

Waypoint Services for Women Children and Families	139885	1	/users/profile/186034	Kylynne K.	Client Served	5	11/15/2012	Waypoint does so much for families in and around the area; from women and children's services to Christmas gift giveaways to the community food bank, Waypoint's contributions to our community are appreciated. We use their school age services, and I feel that Jaina, the instructor at our site, genuinely cares about my children.
Waypoint Services for Women Children and Families	139399		/users/profile/185514	reckerdm	General Member of the Public	5	11/14/2012	My aunt was in a domestic abuse situation in Minnesota.  Her and her 3 children, 2 of which have special needs, came to Waypoint (as she is from the eastern Iowa area).  Waypoint helped her get settled into a safe place to "start over" and get out of harm's way.  It is a blessing to have such a resource in the community to help people like this. 
Waypoint Services for Women Children and Families	135479		/users/profile/181340	Teresa Flack	Volunteer	4	11/08/2012	I have been volunteering at Waypoint for the last six years and have found everyone we work with at Waypoint to be outgoing and positive role models for everyone that uses their services.  We read to the pre-schoolers five times a year and interact with the teachers and children on our visits.  The classes are always well-structured and the children have fun learning many skills and also are prepared to enter the school system.

They are very respectful of the clients they serve and are friendly and helpful to the volunteers.  I enjoy volunteering there very much and hope to for many years to come!
Waypoint Services for Women Children and Families	133822		/users/profile/179578	keenollc	Board Member	5	11/05/2012	I have volunteered for Waypoint for more than 25 years as a donor and member of the Board of Director's and Board of Trustees. I have seen changes in volunteers, leadership and staff but the thing that has always remained the same is Waypoints' passion to fulfill the mission of serving women and their families during times of crisis. 25 years ago we were focused mostly on fitness. We now provide quality day care with a sliding fee scale, a homeless shelter for women and their children and advocate for victims of domestic violence as well as many ancillary services. I am proud and honored to be associated with such a wonderful organization for over a quarter of a century.

Waypoint Services for Women Children and Families	133499	1	/users/profile/179230	Mindy Sorg	Volunteer	5	11/05/2012	I served on this board for 6 years and have remained a huge advocate and supporter because of my experience as a board member.  This organization genuinely engages it's board members to understand the impact that this organization has on the community as well as the women and children that it serves.  We met the women in crisis and heard their stories.  We hung out with the children in the shelters while assisting them at making hand made Mothers day cards.  We were also invited/encouraged to go through the Advocacy training for the Assault Shelter.  This is a 40 hour training experience that lead to one of the most eye-opening experiences of my life.  I will never forget my first day of volunteering in the shelter and hearing the desperate cry of a mother on the phone as she learned about losing care of her children.  As hard as it was to hear this, I knew that she had a support system around her within Waypoint that would lend her guidance and keep her safe.  I often think of that woman and wonder what would she have done if Waypoint was not there for her...........
Waypoint Services for Women Children and Families	133379		/users/profile/179090	SKDaggett	Volunteer	5	11/04/2012	As a former board member and current volunteer, I can think of no other not-for-profit that does so much for the women, children and families in need in our community.  Waypoint stretches its limited resources to help those impacted by domestic violence, sexual assault, homelessness or near homelessness AND subsidized child care. Most of all, the organization does this with unbound passion and professionalism.
Waypoint Services for Women Children and Families	133353		/users/profile/179064	lmrcaring	Volunteer	5	11/04/2012	As a board member for Waypoint, i want to share what a difference this organization has made in our community . Waypoint provides a safe, confidential, non-judgmental place for women, children and families. They provide free and confidential services for those most vulnerable that includes individuals and families of all ages, socio-economic levels, cultures and genders who are:  Homeless Living in Poverty Victims of Domestic Violence Victims of Sexual Assault Friends and Families of Victims There is no greater understanding demonstrated by the staff of this organization. They are the ultimate professionals and offer compassion and care for all they touch. I wish to express my appreciation and support for this team and the work that they do without any need for recognition, only a desire to provide support and love. Thank you

Waypoint Services for Women Children and Families	133050		/users/profile/178749	KimberlyT	Volunteer	4	11/03/2012	The work this organization does is unbelievable.  I ALWAYS support them through their May Day Basket program and the holiday toy drive for the kids.  They support my business and therefore I do the same.

The staff consistently showed the highest level of service, dedication, compassion and love for all of the clients they served.  They touched, and enhanced, the lives of so many.  During an open house tour of the transitional residential facility a little girl proudly showed me "her home" and "her bed", undoubtedly the nicest and safest place she had lived in quite awhile.  The staff continually looks for ways to leverage resources to provide the maximum amount of service possible within their financial constraints and realities.  Kudos to Liz and all of her staff! 
Waypoint Services for Women Children and Families	132855		/users/profile/178531	Elizabeth76	Volunteer	5	11/02/2012	I served on the board for 5 years before moving away from Iowa.  I was amazed at the great work they did for the community. The testimonies from those served brought to light that no one is exempt from needing help from time to time.  They provided shelter for abused women and families, and a helping hand to get women back on their feet.  I left before the flood that devastated the area but once again, hard work and commitment enabled this organization to rally and resume helping those still reeling from the floods.  They are truly a treasure to the community.  
Waypoint Services for Women Children and Families	132854		/users/profile/178530	whachey	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/02/2012	I started my career in business and education at Waypoint as an intern in their marketing department.  I was impressed then and I remain impressed now, after 6 years working in a few different companies, how well this organization is ran.  From the top down it always seems to me that Waypoint has a clear focus and utilizes an outstandingly successful "umbrella" business model that uses their for-profit daycare centers to operate their non-profit women and children centers.  I am proud to say that I was a daycare kid in their summer program as a youth and that I was able to help them while also starting my career there.   I am now a high school teacher in downtown Houston, TX with 85% of the population being "at risk" in one way or another, Houston needs an organization like Waypoint in a bad way!  Cedar Rapids is lucky to have them.   -Wylie Hachey 
Waypoint Services for Women Children and Families	132846		/users/profile/178522	Christine53	Board Member	5	11/02/2012	As both a board member and parent of two young children in Waypoint's daycare program, I am impressed every day with the level of commitment and dedication that Waypoint's staff--top to bottom--has. We know our children are in great hands every day and are continuously impressed with the childcare staff's loyalty and genuine concern for our children's wellbeing. As a board member, I had many opportunities to observe the senior executive team in action. It is clear that Waypoint's staff is constantly focused on providing excellent service to its clients and our community. We are lucky to have this organization providing critical services in our community.
Waypoint Services for Women Children and Families	132844		/users/profile/178520	Cathy39	Donor	5	11/02/2012	I always think of Waypoint first when I have useful items to donate such as diapers, backpacks, school supplies or toys.  Several groups I belong to support Waypoint as well...it's such a crucial service to our community.
Waypoint Services for Women Children and Families	132834		/users/profile/178510	Amy_59	Client Served	5	11/02/2012	Waypoint was a god-send for me 4 years ago when I was in need of childcare for my youngest daughter. I really didn't want to pay a lot of money to send my child to an in- home daycare that I wasn't sure of. Someone suggested Waypoint Uptown Kids. Oh. My. Gosh. From the minute I walked in there with her, I knew this is where I wanted my daughter to be. Chris, her lead teacher in the Blue Room along with Ginny and Carla (who would become her lead teacher in Purple) were wonderful. When Carla moved to Purple Room to be a lead teacher, she took me aside and explained that she was moving and wanted me to know for Katy's sake. They comforted her when she went through the separtion that first week, got down on the floor and played, did crafts, and were so helpful with any concerns I had. Each room that my daughter transitioned to was the same. Helpful, caring and incredibly knowledgeable staff. Even though she is now in 1st grade, my daughter always wants to go visit and see Miss Kim, or see Diane at the front desk. Whenever anyone asks me where to go for child care, Waypoint Uptown Kids is the first answer out of my mouth. No hesitations. 
Waypoint Services for Women Children and Families	132611		/users/profile/178260	Vanessa8	Board Member	5	11/02/2012	My first experience with Waypoint was as a volunteer for the "Waypoint Wonderland Gift Gala" back in 2006. I can still remember how meaningful it was for me as a mid-20 something, with a good job and lots of family support to spend all afternoon wrapping gifts and talking with women who were so grateful that they were going to be able to provide gifts for their children during the holidays. Waypoint Services provides a critical safety net for women and families who have fallen on tough times, been the victims of domestic violence or who just need a little extra support. Now six years later, I'm proud to be volunteering for my fourth year as a Waypoint Wonderland volunteer and just finishing up my first year on the board of directors. When my mom moved to iowa in 2009, she became a program assistant at Waypoint's shelter and through her experiences, I've gotten to know even more about the organization and the key role that it plays in giving women a chance to provide for their families and exit unhealthy relationships. It is truly a life-changing place!
Waypoint Services for Women Children and Families	132428		/users/profile/178065	Lynn Ciha	Board Member	5	11/01/2012	I have had the privilege of serving on the Waypoint board of directors for almost six years. One of the key reasons I wanted to be involved with this organization centered around their Domestic Violence and Sexual Assualt programs.  I was born to a victim of date rape so many years ago that the term "date rape" had not yet been coined.  Thankfully my birth mother chose to carry me full term and I was adopted three days later.  I will never be able to thank her enough for giving me life, nor will I ever be able to fully understand what she went through emotionally and physically in the aftermath of such an ugly event.  When I learned about Waypoint's DV/SA efforts and initiatives, I knew I wanted to help in whatever way I could. Waypoint has DV/SA advocates on staff and several trained volunteers who offer support to crime victims by providing 24-hour critical services and ongoing support and guidance to those who are survivors of domestic and dating violence, sexual assault, rape, incest and adolescent sexual abuse.  Here are some statistics from 2011 that validate the phenomenal work Waypoint Services does in our community:  Served 1,772 new victims of violence Local and toll free crisis lines:  3,399 calls Facilitate weekly support groups and childrens support groups to 407 participants One-on-one counseling by appointment or walk-in:  727 participants Legal advocacy - 101 participants Criminal justice advocacy - 58 participants Medical advocacy with victims at area hospitals  124 served Waypoint truly gives women in our community hope when they feel there is none ... a place to stay and be safe when they don't know where else to turn ... and the tools they need to begin a fresh start.
Waypoint Services for Women Children and Families	132285		/users/profile/177909	Amy Stevens	Board Member	5	11/01/2012	As a volunteer and board member of Waypoint, I can assure you that I've consistently witnessed the positive impact this organization has on the community. The mission of helping women, children and families is acted out every day by associates that genuinely care about the clients they serve. The child care program is the largest in the community and provides child care services on a sliding scale when affordabiity is an issue. Throughout the county and now, the state, Waypoint has taken a lead role in homelessness and housing services through administering grants, using case management  vs. sheltering, and partnering with other homeless shelters to share our best practicies. The domestic violence and sexual assault services, also using a case management approach, continue to lead the state's initiatives despite state program cuts. The ingenuity of the directors of each of these programs is demonstrated every time the programs face any fiscal challenges.  My famiy and I will always be devoted to Waypoint's mission. 
Waypoint Services for Women Children and Families	132275		/users/profile/177898	kcooling	Board Member	5	11/01/2012	Waypoint Services provides a critical service to our community.

Raptor Resource Project	319229		/users/profile/270935	glogdog	Volunteer	5	11/20/2016	I started watching the Decorah Eagle cam in 2011 and became a volunteer for them in 2012.  Why?  Because the eagle cam showed me the wonders of nature up close and personal, amazing me every step of the way and taught me that together, people can share, learn, and make a difference in this world, both environmentally and to each other.   I was not aware of issues like lead poisoning in raptors caused by lead ammunition and lead fishing tackle, not aware of death by electrocution from power lines and death from car collisions.  Part of RRP's mission is to "help foster the next generation of preservationists" and they are doing just that.  There are many classrooms across the U.S. and the world watching the eagle cam now.  With over 341 million views since 2011 on Ustream, the eagle cam is the most watched wildlife education camera in the world.  It helps to remind all of us that we must be stewards of our environment which will help perpetuate wildlife.  Additionally, because of the efforts of Raptor Resource Project's original director, Bob Anderson, the Peregrine Falcon made a comeback to the Central United States and the Mississippi River cliffs.  Some of the Decorah Eagles offspring, through tracking devices, have been and are currently part of a longitudinal study of raptors post-dispersal which will help us to learn of breeding and feeding grounds and the necessity to preserve these areas.  Last seasons acceptance of a man-made starter nest might possibly lead the way for increasing populations of birds where needed.  RRP has made a difference in so many ways to both the world and the people that watch their cameras.  I would hope that this review will inspire others to donate and participate in, this worthwhile organization.
Raptor Resource Project	208255	2	/users/profile/270935	glogdog	Donor	5	08/01/2014	Bob Anderson has been helping to keep falcons, eagles, kestrels, various types of raptors alive for many years.  Because of the Decorah Eagle Cam, I have gained a better understanding and education of bald eagles which has led me to learn about other raptors as well.  It has increased my awareness of the delicate balance between humans and wildlife and how we all must be stewards on earth. 
Raptor Resource Project	312868		/users/profile/394543	Judy171	Donor	5	10/21/2016	I discovered the Raptor Resource Project (RRP) in 2013 through their live streaming of the Decorah eagle nest and the incredible gentle lessons taught regarding the way of the eagle. I feel like I have had a new world open for me with regard to the patience and perseverance of both the eagles and the incredible folks from RRP.  RRP teaches us viewers so much and in so many ways. Some is through the remarkable blogs written on the RRP research but most are though the incredible community guided by RRP that has arisen as we have shared both the miracles and sorrows of life as an eagle in the modern world. When I first experienced the late Bob Anderson, I immediately realized that he was the real deal. That his dedication and love for the raptors was a total rarity in our society. RRP contributes an incredible source of positive energy to our weary planet in each of its activities. There aren't too many people or organizations that I would say this about. A deep bow of appreciation to all the folks carrying on Bob's legacy and vision. I am proud to be a small part of this community and to make a monthly donation to its activities.
Raptor Resource Project	310971	4	/users/profile/402312	Pagent D.	Volunteer	5	10/15/2016	I have been a volunteer with and a donor to this organization since 2011.  Their commitment to education is phenomenal.  Within the past five years RRP lost two key board members: Rob McIntyre, the Board President and, in 2015, Bob Anderson, the founder of Raptor Resource Project.  The organization strengthened after each loss and continues the legacy and mission of RRP.  They are terrific stewards of raptors.  Their website at raptorresource.org and their Facebook page at Raptor Resource Project are full of information.  This is the organization with the cameras on the world famous Decorah Bald Eagles.  Additionally this organization's commitment to the peregrine falcon is something to behold.  They have several eagle cams, many falcon cams and kestrels cams.  You will find a camera and a nest that will delight and enthrall you!!
Raptor Resource Project	286273	1	/users/profile/376366	pnw357	Donor	5	04/20/2016	If you love raptors or just the preservation of wildlife, this is a terrific organization to support. RRP has incredibly dedicated staff and volunteers who work tirelessly to protect these beautiful birds and to give the public an intimate peek at raptor life via the wonderful nest cams. I'm hooked on the Decorah Eagles! :)
Raptor Resource Project	208621	3	/users/profile/271351	Mteresa1	Donor	5	08/05/2014	The Raptor Resource Project, most commonly known as RRP, is responsible for the Decorah Eagle cam. The cam has had such an impact all over the world. It has brought a nest of a pair of bald eagles into so many homes; it has educated and inspired so many lives. But, the Decorah cam is just a small part of all the work RRP does. RRP monitors more than 50 nests of owls, bald eagles, red tail hawks, kestrels, peregrine falcons, vultures, etc. Because of RRP the population of peregrine falcons is on the rise. Now they have another very important project, to save the Philippine eagle, a national bird that is in peril of extinction if something is not done soon. Knowing the dedication of RRP, they will be successful. It's amazing how some organizations like RRP, with so little resources can do so much. Bob Anderson and all the volunteers are dedicating their lives for such great cause, to save raptors and they are great at it!!
Raptor Resource Project	208465	2	/users/profile/271160	Pam19	Volunteer	5	08/03/2014	Raptor Resource Project monitors at least 53 nest sites that include falcons, kestrels, eagles, owls, and a turkey vulture.  Their objective is the preservation of raptors.  In helping to educate millions through the live streaming of nest cameras, they are bringing awareness to the general public.  I believe their work in bringing the Peregrine Falcon back to the cliffs of the Mississippi River is unprecedented.  This is a small but mighty organization.
Raptor Resource Project	208451	2	/users/profile/271145	Marsha14	General Member of the Public	5	08/03/2014	I had always thought eagles were majestic birds, but I knew little about raptors in general. Since finding RRP on Facebook, then viewing the nestcams, I have gained an education unlike I would have imagined. The connection with the raptors, as well as the staff and volunteers, has become very personal and genuine for me and thousands of others. It is impressive to watch their response to the concerns of so many people as they care for and promote the raptor population. This is truly human-kind at it's best. I look forward to following the adventures of the Decorah eagles daily, and welcome the information RRP shares about the plight of raptors everywhere.
Raptor Resource Project	208450	2	/users/profile/271144	ThinkingWoman	Volunteer	5	08/03/2014	I found this eagle camera in 2011 when RRP switched to Ustream.  The picture and sound quality were so advanced in comparison to other eagle sites it blew me away.  The chat room was focused on sharing information about eagles with civility and helping each other understand what we were seeing. RRP has as one of it's primary goals educating students about all raptors.  The word students encompasses all ages from 2 year olds who sit on grandma/granpa's laps and learn at the most rudimentary level to 93 year olds who gather in community rooms to complete their life long journey of watching nature, now on screen rather than hiking through woods.  I know this is life changing for all; it certainly has changed my life for the better and not just from the knowledge gained about the natural, wild world but in making me a better person. RRP also has a goal of raptors first.  Their initial thought in doing anything is how can we gain information in the least intrusive way possible.  They also have the well being of the eagles, falcons, and turkey vultures they monitor in the forefront of their thoughts at all times. Just as eagles are frugal (value for expenditure), RRP has proven time and time again that donations are used in the wisest ways possible.    
Raptor Resource Project	208346	2	/users/profile/270822	Lynn75	General Member of the Public	5	08/01/2014	This is a very dedicated group that is led by a passionate director. They are focused on educating the public on raptors and also saving these beautiful creatures. I discovered RRP by accident this past spring. I've followed them every day since, especially watching the 2014 Deborah eagles. Despite some of the heartbreaking events that occur, they keep going with the utmost professionalism and enthusiasm. They're wonderful, never giving up on their mission, no matter what the challenge. 
Raptor Resource Project	208238	4	/users/profile/270912	DorotheaS	Donor	5	08/01/2014	I researched about Bob Anderson and Raptor Resource Project for quite some time before I decided to spend my time watching their cams and my money donating.

Raptor Resource Project	208203	2	/users/profile/270750	gojeffie	Donor	5	07/31/2014	I started watching the Decorah Eagle Cam this year and have now become an Eagleholic! I then started watching some of their other bird cams. From there I started checking out their Facebook page everyday for updates and still make it my first thing to do when logging into my computer. All of the people connected with RRP do an amazing job at educating the public concerning many raptors. The bird cams (especially the Decorah Eagle Cam) are awesome! I am constantly passing on the information learned from RRP to my friends and family. Every day my family gets 'Eagle Updates', whether they want them or not. All of the RRP personnel are volunteers & devote an unbelievable amount of their time to helping our raptors through banding, placing transmitters for tracking on some birds, and both collecting information for furthering education as well as spreading this information for education of the general public. RRP is an amazing site with totally awesome volunteers!

Raptor Resource Project	208156	3	/users/profile/270831	dee-ab	Donor	5	07/31/2014	Everything I know about eagles I learned from watching the Decorah eagle cam.  I have been watching since 2011 and have made donations through the link on ustream.  RRP is the only organization where I have seen them close donations for the year because they had met their goal.  Bob Anderson's passion for raptors is evident when you hear him speak.  I'm thankful for all he does for raptors!
Raptor Resource Project	208121	3	/users/profile/270741	silver22	General Member of the Public	5	07/31/2014	This is the most remarkable site.  They help the entire world learn about the eagles and the wonderful raptors they are. I have learned so much about these beautiful birds and letting everyone in the world view this site adds to the enrichment of our world and the people in it. The young students who visit this site will forever be changed.  Their world and knowledge of these birds will carry them on for the rest of their lives.  THANK YOU!!
Raptor Resource Project	208101	3	/users/profile/270649	oldcrone	Donor	5	07/31/2014	Bob Anderson has created an amazing organization that became famous four years ago when they began broadcasting live 24/7 from the Decorah Eagle nest.  They have educated the world with their coverage of these bald eagles and their support of other live camera sites.  More importantly they have worked to reintroduce raptors to habitats where they had disappeared due to ignorance and pesticides. 
Raptor Resource Project	208080	2	/users/profile/270757	realcool5	General Member of the Public	5	07/31/2014	Outstanding organization.  The feed on ustream with the Decorah eagles has educated so many people about the eagles. Their work helping the falcons is top notch.

Raptor Resource Project	205204		/users/profile/267323	zoeybean	Donor	1	07/05/2014	2011 they lied about what they were doing they said they were not banding the eaglets, they get mad and ban you from their site if you ask questions,    2014 Why is someone allowed to put a transmitter on an eaglet the day after it has fallen from its nest? it can't or won't fly, and has been chased down and captured two separate times after the harness was attached. why are they allowed to harass this bird? If eagles are protected why is this allowed.. I know there are studies but shouldn't the well fare of the subject be protected? The eaglet has 2 siblings that fell from the tree as well one is at a rehab center recovering from surgery and the other is on the ground, and now has a harness transmitter as well. Aren't there guidelines to follow or rules when transmitting a protected bird?... this bird was stressed before it was captured. When is enough, enough? now it is said they are doing it to see were the siblings go. but do not back this up.. is there a study I am not aware of? because rrp has their lips sealed... and they are calling it educational but delete questions or ban you instead of answering your questions.
Raptor Resource Project	181865	2	/users/profile/238614	Fenrian	Volunteer	1	10/24/2013	While this organization has done some good work, most notably with peregrine falcons, it has now turned into more of a "show-biz" operation.  I was involved in the Decorah Eagles Webcam in 2011, and was very disappointed to find out that the organization is using the cam as strictly a fund-raising vehicle, and while claiming to be educational, contributes nothing to the spread of knowledge about eagles.  As nearly as I can tell, most of the money taken in is being spent on upgrading web cams, and not on anything beneficial to raptors, or even to the dissemination of knowledge about them.  
Raptor Resource Project	162534	3	/users/profile/215740	Ruth29	Donor	5	07/12/2013	I have been following Raptor Resource Center for 3 years now and have been involved in the fund raiser that we had after one of the Decorah Eagles was electrocuted last year. Bob Anderson ( The founder) and others in the organization have been SO open and helpful as we looked for ways to help ensure that future generations of Raptors in the Decorah area were safe. Bob worked with the local High School in designing Avian Safe Perches and worked with the local power company in deciding which poles were the most important to have them installed. Bob always makes himself available for groups of folks who are coming to Decorah...he met with a group of us in July for dinner and he is a most humble and intelligent man!!! You can tell how he loves his Raptors, just from the look on his face when he talks about them!!! I can tell you that the work he is doing is very important...for the safety and reproduction success of all of our raptors. God Bless you Bob Anderson and Raptor Resource Project. 
Raptor Resource Project	117154	2	/users/profile/159352	justbeing	General Member of the Public	1	06/28/2012	Subject: decorah eagles  Eagles represent FREEDOM and I am dismayed that the Raptor Resource Project in Decorah, Iowa, is putting such a cumbersome contraption on the eaglets just so they can track them.   What gives them the right to impose their will on these birds???  Furthermore, I think it is criminal for them not to have a more advanced, smaller, less intrusive way to track them, if it's so important.  Given the contraption that is on them, they cannot bury their heads in their feathers with that big, bulky backpack on their backs. I have read their propaganda and their excuses for doing this to the raptors and I see NO good reason or outcome to 'track' them.     There are many of us, who disagree with placing such a cumbersome tracking device on the eagle babies, and I would like to know what gives your organization the right to interfere with the free will and lives of any raptor?

Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has. I have never been directly connected to the foundation or its founder but have been abundantly blessed with the information provided in the website. We were shown the website by friends in Switzerland, we in turn have shared the information to friends & family who have likewise taken a step towards a better lifestyle. The work done in the schools in India is also commendable...teaching children and giving them the tools for a better future is so much better than providing material needs.Wishing the foundation all the bestGeorge , Switzerland
Sakthi Foundation Inc	183555		/users/profile/240467	KalThy	General Member of the Public	5	10/28/2013	I came to know about Sakthi foundation from my very close friends when I started to have frequent headaches and eye pain. I had been to several doctors and tried several medications but nothing really seemed to work . It was then that my friends found out from Sakthi foundation about natural remedies which included doing suryanamaskarams everyday, applying sesame seed oil everyday before taking a bath and applying sesame seed oil over the eyelids to alleviate the eye pain. I followed this advice and was amazed to see how quickly and effectively it worked! I really THANK SAKTHI FOUNDATION for giving me such simple, practical and effective advice. I later on went and explored several of the topics that are covered on the website and found the knowledge to be extremely relevant to our day to day life and explained in very simple terms. Sakthi Foundation is doing a WONDERFUL job by making the effort to let the general public know about simple solutions to common problems, as well as tips on living a healthier life. It is TRULY a great nonprofit organization and I wish that more and more people will benefit from its work and make their lives so much healthier and joyful!

The guidance have helped me enormously . I would like to describe in brief one incident. One day I had a severe swelling and pain in my ankle to the extent that I was limping. It would happen every time I have more protein and sometimes even if I dont. So I decided to get my blood tested to know what exactly is present during such a painful condition. I tried to seek an appointment from  the doctor but I could get it only after 2 days as it happened to be a weekend. I contacted  sakthi foundation and was asked to do an oil cleansing. Monday morning when I got up I had no pain no swelling and the blood test report was all normal. So I decided to experiment to confirm the test by eating excess protein and once again the test was successful. It was amazing.

And Uni5 is making differences in our life and for many others we know ever since.Uni5 is supporting poor kids in India with their education through Uni5 schools and Uni5 principles. Uni5 education helps children by focusing on pattern based education and promoting Montessori methods enabling them with quick and easy learning, self-connectivity and creates a good platform for them in their very early stages of life.Uni5 site is rich with a lot of health\educational\cultural\spiritual information and tips. The new audio and video section is very helpful especially for people who prefer the audio\visual method to learn and understand new things.After getting introduced to Uni5, it was very helpful for us to adapt to a more natural and healthy living for myself and family. It helped me a lot personally and my wife, our kid and our brothers kid. We shared this information with a lot of our friends who was benefited a lot especially on pregnancy and post pregnancy care and their children's overall development during the baby\infant\toddler stages.Uni5 also helped us tremendously on our cultural and spiritual aspects - helped understanding many spiritual concepts, meaning of different festivals and rituals and to know many healthy practices and principles. -Pradeesh

But I believe the greatest help one individual or society, fortunate enough to be bestowed is the right Knowledge / Awareness / Education.  And I think this is what Shakthi Foundation has been doing all these years.  Apart from many other social services - Shakthi foundation's efforts in giving children right Knowledge and working towards building a brighter society  truly AWESOME.  Shakthi foundation also provides us with wealthy information, via its group of websites, presented in a unique way that bridges ancient wisdom and our current understanding of Science.  It helped me a lot as an individual and more importantly as a Parent.  I truly believe Shankthi Foundation has been doing a remarkable service in every best possible way with the resources available at its disposal.    My heartily congratulations to  Shakthi Team and wish all the VERY BEST!

Later I amalgamated our company with so many such other services offered by them like sponsoring montessori school for poor, providing education allowances for needy, medical help for identified sick people and buying new materials for new schools. Their service is at the core level of changing the society. now a days common sense is missing in the society and all the efforts taken by sakthi foundation is bringing back that common sense of "how to lead an happy life" is well programmed for delivery back to the society without any communal differences. I wish their services must reach globally in many countries through their school and public care at a quick span of time.

Sakthi Foundation Inc	178759		/users/profile/235384	Mannubhai	General Member of the Public	5	10/17/2013	I know of Sakthifoundation since atleast the last 12 years. A wonderful organization that propounds the cause of purification of the body mind intellect (BMI) trio through the method of "panchabhootha healing". This technique, as I have understood, involves the systematic use of the 5 basic elements - namely, water, earth, air, fire and space - to heal injuries caused to BMI. Purification of the BMI is important because it facilitates merger of the self into a state of "blissful awareness" which in turn unifies it with the "universal conciousness" or the "Brahman". The significance of this process lies in the fact that such unification of the BMI-awareness-consciousness creates peace and harmony in the world as it promotes the feeling of "oneness" and "univeral brotherhood" among human beings. It is my understanding that the above foundation also carries out charity work, by educating poor children in India.  I rate Sakthifoundation high as a non-profit organization and wish them all the very best. Manoj Kumar, Navi Mumbai, India

Family Inc	202018		/users/profile/263642	smilesformiles	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/06/2014	I got to see first hand how the I Smile program helps children. I went to observe at one of the elementary schools that they were providing services(sealants, oral hygiene instructions, and dental screenings) for that day. The elementary kids were excited, the Dental Hygiene students who were providing the services were excited. It is amazing in today's world how many children do not have access to dental care. Granted this was limited care, but it was a start. Through the screenings if the child needed more dental care, letters and follow up calls were provided. This is an awesome much needed program. Every school from early elementary to high school should have this program. 
Family Inc	201846		/users/profile/263400	Health.Coordinator	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/04/2014	For nearly the last 6 years I have watched our preschool children and now more recently birth to age 3clients benefit from the I-Smile dental home project.  I want to think that the work of the dental hygienists will continue many more years.  What do they do?  Provide valuable services for children and families relating to dental health and oral care.  They come into our classrooms assessing childrens risks for tooth decay and provide protection in the form of varnish applications until a visit to the dentist can be scheduled.  Often this is the first time children receive any type of dental care and the staff returns to our classrooms to repeat services for children at risk preventing the need for expensive dental treatments in the Emergency Room or hospital.  Even with limited funding when out of pocket dental costs make it difficult for families to complete necessary treatment they assist families in obtaining care.  With the goal of prevention they educate about oral habits, inform parents about proper care of teeth and gums, and provide dietary counseling.  The staff is a valuable component of our Health Services Advisory Committee.  They recruit dentists to serve our families so they have an ongoing source of regular dental care as well.

Handicap Village dba Opportunity Village	57362		/users/profile/60568	parkerdocs	Donor	5	11/18/2010	This is an amazing place that began with a Christ-driven vision to provide a place for people with handicaps to recieve care with dignity and compassion.  Opp Village serves "the least of these" as Jesus commanded us to do and does so with excellence in every way!  With many personal ties to Opp Vill, I had the opportunity to work there over a summer in college and still maintain relationships with some of the clients there.  What a wonderful place that has been a blessing to me and continues to be to so many others!  I am now honored to support them!
Handicap Village dba Opportunity Village	56858		/users/profile/59581	Passport Media	General Member of the Public	5	11/12/2010	I have worked with Opportunity Village on a few video projects and used their client services on several projects.  The video projects were designed to capture what a typical day is like for clients that could be posted on the web and viewed by parents, potential residents, and others.  Working with the staff of OP was wonderful and videotaping the residents was a heart-warming experience.  Although a little "skeptical" at first, most warmed up to the camera and a few even became "Movie Stars"!  The care and giving the staff provides is truely amazing.We have also used the Client Services for assembly of projects including an RV Safety Training packet.  At first I was skeptical because even missing one manual from the kit would create a lengthy correspondence as well as shipping missing components and could jeapordize the project.  After assembling over 3,000 kits, not one manual was missed!  We have used them for several other projects and all have been performed professionally and exact to the task.  Opportunity Village is staffed with not only the best professionals this industry could obtain, but also the best members of a community as they become part of activities and events throughout the course of the year.  They are an embedded part of what makes this a great community.   Thanks to the entire staff!

Handicap Village dba Opportunity Village	56160		/users/profile/58476	Barry	Donor	5	11/01/2010	When I was growing up there was a Widow who lived next door to to us who had a son with mental illness.  During the summer months she would put him outside on a chair and he would do nothing but twist and turn a little belt he held in his hands. I had to baby  sit (or adult sit as he was a young man) and even in the house he would do very little but twist that belt. As time passed, the Mother could not care for Willard any longer and she  placed him at Opportunity Village. I did not see him for a couple of years and then one day, when I was at the Village on business, I saw Willard and could not believe the transformation. The man who could do nothing but twist that belt was helping in the Kitchen.   After that it seemed like everytime I saw him he was doing more and seemed so proud. This man now had a real life. I do not believe you can ask more of an organization than that. They are miracle workers.

Opportunity Village has given Sandra a new life plus a new home.  They provide so much for her for example Swimming, baseball games, boat rides, fairs, bowling, movies, learned to play bells.I am so proud of her and Opportunity Village has given this all to her. The staff and other clients are like family to her.  
Handicap Village dba Opportunity Village	56005		/users/profile/58280	Carol F.	Client Served	5	10/30/2010	Opportunity Village is such an AMAZING place with AMAZING people!!!:)My sister, Mary, moved into Opportunity Village in the Fall of 1985; during which I went off to college too. It was called "Handicap Village" then, but Mary called it "Handicap College", because that is where you go when you finish high school, she is just adorable:) Everyone was going through adjustments, but Opportunity Village so eased the transition for Mary and our family. She has an extraordinary life there. It is so much better than if she would have stayed home with my parents or even with one of her siblings, because she has her own life and is given experiences that she would have missed other wise. I know it makes my mom sad at times when Mary says she is ready to go home, but I know it gives all of us peace knowing that Mary has this spectacular home with such an incredible family that loves her at Opportunity Village. Our family feels so blessed by Opportunity Village.
Handicap Village dba Opportunity Village	55427		/users/profile/57557	Kahunadawn	Donor	5	10/26/2010	Opportunity Village is what we've searched for in every state we've resided in throughout my daughter's life.  Since the day she was diagnosed we knew we had to find a place that would provide her with caring, dignity and purpose in her adult years.  It's been a 20 year search.From California, Illinois, Florida, New York, to Iowa we have searched for this place.   Now in a tiny community in the northern part of Iowa we found Opportunity Village.  My daughter attends daily and paticipates in the varioius employment areas, craft areas, volunteer opportunities, and social networking the Village offers her. Her life is full of laughter, friends, and most importantly opportunity.  We have watched as this organization continues to support large numbers of disabled people throughout the community with constant budget cuts from state and federal funding.  They actively search for revenue streams while continuing to organize fund raisers and community outreach to supplement the shrinking dollars.  The Village is dedicated to the services it provides each and every client.  While implementing cost saving measures their remaining goal is it to continue to serve their clients at the same level of care they are known for throughout the surrounding communities. While continuing to battle the budget crunches it remains a haven of kindness, caring, and a belief in every person's ability to contribute.  Our child has found her place in a community of friends who have her best interests at heart.  Opportunity Village continues their service to disabled individuals with "privacy, dignity, and purpose" and most importantly with caring.

Lauren has a condition called San Felipo Syndrome. Mental retardation and increased loss of physical abilities. The staff at Opportunity Village treat her with love, dignity, respect and honor. Annual reviews are followed up on throughout the year to be certain the objectives and goals are being accomplished as well as communicated to any new members of the care team. Physical therapy along with community experiences keep her active and alert. We are very thankful to have such a wonderful facility and group of heros to see her through the challenges she faces daily.

This is an organization with exceptional leaders dedicated to serving the people recieving services. Dignity, respect, love, and faith are some of the behaviors displayed daily.  There is great support by the community, families, staff and generally anyone who comes into contact with Opportunity Village. I am fortunate someone took time to introduce me to this organization as I have personally benefited through the experience.

I enjoyed the treatment of clients, volunteers and staff.  Everyone's pride and humanity are top shelf.I have ridden in the Annual Fundraiser Walk.   The Festival of Trees is an Annual Event drawing people nationally to be a part of some beautiful trees, marvelous food and mostly a comraderie that has people coming together for a group of people who could be helpless and isolated.  Instead the Opportunity Village helps a population of adults become productive, positive enriching people.

We have been Volunteers and have served on Boards and Committees associated with the Village.   We started as our daughter had  Down's Syndrome and attended the Village Work Activity cCenter for over 20 years.  She died almost 3 years ago and was ginven the opportunity to live her life to the fullest.     The staff at the Village are a very dedicated to the Clients they serve but with out Volunteers it would be almost impossible to operate effectively as the costs of salaries would be much higher.   The volunteers have the opportunity mingle with the clients and appreciate the various services offered  as there are mulitple handicapped that are served at the village and at half-way house where somw of the clients have been able to live on their own with some supervision.  The opportunit to serve could be on the Board of Directors, The Village Store, in some of the Cottages or in many othe ways.  I  strongly recomend taking the opportunit to serve as you will find it to be very gratifying.
Handicap Village dba Opportunity Village	55355		/users/profile/57449	mcory	Volunteer	5	10/25/2010	This agency has great and dedicated staff members. They are very committed to the mission of the Village and are not only loyal and capable, but they continue to do more work for their clients and their programs, with less available funding.The Village is an important part of our community and their clients are seen all over town with staff members who accompany them to do shopping and recreational activities.The Village hosts an annual Christmas Tree decorating contest and a Breakfast with Santa that is a huge tradition for the community.... residents flock to this event and look forward to it every year.

I receive an immediate acknowledgment of my gift with a handwritten note so I know my gift is appreciated.  The newsletters and other mailings help me see how my gift is used and give me confidence in the organization.  Seeing how this agency has impacted lives is heartwarming.  Not only has the Village changed lives for people with disabilities, it has changed the lives of many who live in North Iowa.

This beautiful sign was so colorful and attractive that it caused investigation.  Wow!  What a surprise.  Admission was free.  What a wonderful way to give back to families and the public.  Not a dull moment was ever encountered.  Programming was very educational and entertaining for all ages.  It was fantastic for children.  The colors of all the costumes were beautiful and them  music was great.  What a tremendous way for Des Moines, Iowa to capitalize on tourism.  This event is a real winner for Des Moines, surrounding areas, and all of Iowa; in fact for all of U.S.A.  Everyone should help to keep this event going and growing!  How?  The word of mouth is very powerful!  OH!  What a wonderful day and evening.  Thank you.  We will be back next year.
White Eagle 7th Generation Multicultural Pow Wow Incorporated	143215	3	/users/profile/189651	Fern L.	Volunteer	4	11/27/2012	I have been performing at the White Eagle Pow Wow weekend for the last 4 or 5 years.  I really believe in the mission of the organization of healing through the expression of our cultural heritages.  The atmosphere of the weekend is about sharing and feeds my creative soul.  My family and I hope to share our talents and heritages with the Pow Wow family for years to come.  We enjoy traveling from out of state to bring our North Sea cultural heritage to the people of Iowa and getting in touch with our American Indian heritage while we are there.  Being able to perform at the Pow Wow helps motivate my family to learn and improve in the performance of  the music and dance of our ancestors.   I feel the Pow Wow has the potential to foster cultural growth throughout the region.  
White Eagle 7th Generation Multicultural Pow Wow Incorporated	142423	3	/users/profile/188892	mover	Volunteer	5	11/25/2012	I am a dance faculty at Iowa State University.  My blended special needs group with non challeged dancers were performing next to a native American Village where Ralph and his crew were inspiring youth as well as anyone who gathered at the Iowa State Fair.  He heard me speaking about inclusion of all peoples and the power of dance to transform.  He asked if I would bring dancers to his event later in August.  We have attended the PowWow I believe for a decade.  I am grateful for the work the Ralph has done in the public schools as well as other outdoor venues that we have performed at again in tandom.  His "tribe" of gathered volunteers are kind, respectful, and welcoming to all performers.  The group never fails to embrace the world.  Even when we are rained out it is considered a blessing and as always the fun continues all in good humor.  Modeling one of the greatest assets for the individual coping with difficulty with humor.  I am honored to be a small contributor to such a worthy goal as this group encompasses.

We were food vendors. Being a food vendor limited us to being able to participate in the event itself,but we did get to watch a lot of the performers.It was heartfelt watching all the cultures come together, to become one, and seeing all the warmth and love that was generated in the sacred ground. It is such a spectacular spiritual event that no one should miss.The Pow Wow is a part of my Life, and I am so Thankful to be a part of it.This Pow Wow has built many bonding relationships for me.. I have tried to help out as much as I can as a volunteer,vendor,donor, and whatever else is needed.If you have never been to The White Eagle Multicultural Pow Wow make the last weekend of August 2013 at Hawkeye Antique Acres your place to be. 
White Eagle 7th Generation Multicultural Pow Wow Incorporated	142276	2	/users/profile/188728	Malaika	General Member of the Public	5	11/24/2012	I have had the honor of performing at the White Eagle Multicultural Pow Wow for the past 3 yrs.  It's wonderful being part of an event that truly embraces all cultures and what they represent. In those years, I have learned SO MUCH and each year I cherish and look forward to learning more, as well as sharing my art form of Bellydance. Another widely misunderstood form.  This past August, it had been raining during the day, and by the time my troupe's performance time came around, it was questionable if we were going to be able to perform. With the amazing love and guidance of the Pow Wow's organizers, we wanted to perform anyway. We danced on the ground instead of the stage to make sure no one slipped, and we felt so free performing that way. Even the mud created from the rain couldn't deter us. We were there to share in this wonderful experience of learning and sharing, and would never miss it for anything. I look forward to performing in 2013!!!!

White Eagle 7th Generation Multicultural Pow Wow Incorporated	141036	2	/users/profile/187263	LadyKae	Volunteer	5	11/18/2012	I am delighted to add my review and recommendation for Iowa's own unique White Eagle Multicultural Pow Wow. Twelve years ago, I became one of the original volunteers and charter members working with the Moisa family to build this event for the State of Iowa.  Since then the organization of volunteers has been growing and multiplying annually to support and uphold this powerfully important event.This event has for its purpose the education and appreciation between people of all races and cultural backgrounds.  It has as its essence to bring down walls of misunderstanding and bias between those groups.  The effort begins for this Pow Wow event with Native American cultural influences, but then extends to the many races and ethnic backgrounds that share living spaces on our Earth home. The language used to guide the decisions of those building this event and directing its activities, has continually been to provide for "the mending of the Sacred Hoop of Life." This mending of life includes the appreciation and caring for all of the two-leggeds, four-leggeds, swimming and flying creatures of our planet home. The three day event in the month of August every year is and always has been free to the public.  The funds needed for creating and producing this event have come from many local businesses, in-kind donations, fund raisers,  plus individual donations. At no time has any volunteer , committee member, or charter member been offered or received a salary.  The hundreds of volunteers arrive with time and energy and hearts ready to continue the vision that began in the mind and heart of Ralph Moisa III.  This young man, the son of the Moisa family, who at the age of 19, gave his life to attempt to rescue a Red Tailed Hawk from some city power lines.  He had already dedicated his life to the development of better understanding between all races and creatures.  Countless and tireless hours have been spent setting up this venue/event each year and orchestrating the many multicultural events for three days, and teaching those who attend, about ways to feel connected to each other and to the Universe, which in turn has provided so much for all of us.  This event, being unique to Iowa and also to the whole of the United States, has drawn visitors and participants from all over Iowa, around the Midwestern States, across the U.S., and also from Canada.  It has continued to grow and expand each year, which speaks to the ever-present need within all realms of life to reach out to learn and understand one another to a greater and greater degree.  This event lessens our feelings of isolation and promotes  knowledge that we are one people, in one Universe, who ultimately all belong together in sharing our world.  We have drawn up to 12,000 visitors and volunteers annually from various Native American Nations, and countless attendees from many countries and continents,  All of this growth has been happening due to endless house of work and time donated from hundreds of volunteers working wit the Moisa family and the Multicultural Pow Wow Committees.  I am proud to realize that this unique event was dreamed of, and then ultimately born, in our State of Iowa, a state uniquely named for the Nation of the Ioway Native Americans who cared for our lands hundreds of years prior to our statehood.  I am proud to know the Moisa family and the family of dedicated volunteers who believe in this outstanding event and who work annually to forward the dreams o the young man, Ralph Moisa III.  This caring and forward thinking young man was given the Native American name "White Eagle" from his Nation at the occasion of his funeral service.  His life's dream has now become, and will continue to become the dream of multitudes of families and volunteres because of our annual event called the "White Eagle Multicultural Pow Wow".
White Eagle 7th Generation Multicultural Pow Wow Incorporated	140940	2	/users/profile/187161	jodym	Volunteer	5	11/17/2012	The White eagle multi cultural pow wow has been part of my life since 2000 .Celebrating the mending of the sacred hoop which is the realization that everything is connected.  Not only we as peoples of different races,  but all of the things around us as well .   when the wheel is broken we destroy the plant life that gives us the oxygyne that  we need to survive.  when we destroy natural habitat we lose the creatures that are also a needed part of our survival. each has an important part in the survival of the others.  The first time I attended the pow wow was by invatation of a friend. my plan was to enjoy the entertainment and just be a part of the crowd. after a while I noticed that many of the trash containers were much in need of attention. At once a feeling came over me that it was some how up to me to handle this situation, Which I did for the remainder of the weekend.  during this time I came into contact with some of the most remarkable people I had ever met. all seemed very greatful of the task i had adopted we talked as though we had some how known each other for years. I did this for several years until the same friend invited me to one of the white eagle board meetings. I accepted the invatation  and was taken on in the merchandising comittee and have served ever since.  I can't imagine a year going by missing the pow wow though it is much work all through out the year the event always leaves me feeling some how iv'e done a small part in mending the sacred hoop.
White Eagle 7th Generation Multicultural Pow Wow Incorporated	140652	3	/users/profile/186853	Mary12497	Volunteer	5	11/16/2012	The White Eagle Annual 7th Generation Multicultural Pow-Wow is an honorable organization that is doing much to advance understanding among races and cultures. It is a gathering initiated by Ralph and Carol Moisa in loving memory of their son, White EagleRalph III, who died while attempting to free a Red Tail Hawk from some power lines, and who also took-to-heart the Native belief that each race has a role and a responsibility in mending the Sacred Hoop.   As a Caucasian American aware of our U. S. history and the governments role in breaking numerous treaties made with Americas Native Peoples, it is a privilege and it feels a whole lot like grace to be invited to participate in the mending of the Sacred Hoop.  I believe each of us carries within us the unfinished work of our ancestors past. Through the White Eagle Annual 7th Generation Multi-cultural Pow-Wow, each of us is blessed with the gift and the opportunity to participate in the dance that heals our communitys today and celebrates in our childrens, childrens tomorrow.   You can be a living part of tomorrows history; come to honor one anothers culture in celebration, come help to mend the Sacred Hoop.  
White Eagle 7th Generation Multicultural Pow Wow Incorporated	122200	3	/users/profile/166387	Gradmafern	Volunteer	5	09/11/2012	 The White Eagle Multicultural Pow Wow is an awe inspiring experience with a continuous program from Friday evening through Sunday afternoon performed in colorful regalia by Midwests four races:  Red, Yellow, Black and White.  The pow wow is hosted by Native American's whose dreams are to mend the sacred hoop of life with a better understanding of all cultures through drumming, music, dance and story.  The grand entry led by the honor guard, entertainers, and hosts of Indians from several nations is truly an emotional, heart rendering experience.  Very educational, informative and entertaining fun filled three days of camaraderie amongst the volunteers, entertainers, photographers, and participants of all races.  The White Eagle Multicultural Pow Wow was a dream of Ralph Moisa, III, a.k.a. White Eagle'.  Sadly Ralphie lost his life in 1995 during an heroic attempt to rescue a red tailed hawk trapped on a high voltage power line.  Amongt Raphies possessions were notes detailing his visions of a multicultural pow wow to bring families of all races together, to bring down the walls of misunderstanding, to share a little of all heritages, and to make the United States a better place to live.  In 2000, Ralphies parents established this one of a kind pow wow in his honor and memory.  The Pow Wow is admission free.  Donations are graciously accepted.  Grounds parking is charged.  This is an annual event held on the forth full weekend in August at Hawkeye Antique Acres, rural Waukee, Iowa just off Interstate 80, , Exit 117, 6 miles West of the West Des Moines Junction of I-35/I-80.  I recommend this enchanting weekend to persons of all ages 3 to 103, a truly unforgettable experience.  The ethnic foods and crafts were much appreciated and enjoyed by all.  Camping with electricity is available on the grounds, or you can spend a night in a tipi (teepee) at the 'White Eagle' Bed and Breakfast on either Friday or Saturday night during the pow wow weekend--experience the life of an early American Indian. Donations and Volunteers are in high demand.  Give from the heart to assure that this wonderful event may continue for many years to come.  Visit www.whiteeaglepow-wow.org's photo galleries to enjoy the array of entertainers ranging from Darcy and Her Wolves, S.O.A.R. Hawk Talk (the 2011 release of a rehabilitated red tailed hawk),  Japanese Drummers, Aloha Dancers, Aztec Dancers, Lerwig Family Band, Isiserettes Drill Team, Los Ninos del Tepeyac dancers, etc.  I encourage everyone to schedule a visit to this wonderful pow wow like no other, not just in Iowa, but across the United States and Canada.  Truly an enriching experiencenever to be forgotten.  A great family tradition filled with memories galore..

This is the worst shelter as far as actual services provided. The food served at breakfast and lunch will give you diabetes, if it doesn't poison you. Case managers have for the most part no knowledge of services available to help people. The management get large salerys, when it is supposed to be a non profit. Theft of V.A. funds to the tune of several million dollars, the loss of the C.R.R.C. program for instance. Even if a "client" hasn't used their services in 10 years they will be considered a client forever.

CISS also offers a weekly medical clinic, HIV screenings and counseling services, substance abuse and mental health evaluations, legal aid and GED exam preparation. The organization is focused on providing a host of resources to help clients achieve independent living such as case management, counseling, life skills instruction. In the past year, CISS has successfully placed 152 individuals were transitioned into stabilized housing. Their commitment to our community goes beyond their own walls.

I have limited time to volunteer, so its important to me that I work with an organization that is well-run and truly dedicated to its mission. CISS is both. Its staff works hard with their clients to help them become independent, and they work tirelessly to provide as many services as possible. 
Central Iowa Shelter & Services	57826	1	/users/profile/61254	wschmitt	Volunteer	5	11/24/2010	I began volunteering at Central Iowa Shelter and Services in September 2010 and was immediately impressed with how well the organization is run and how welcoming and helpful the staff are.Another thing that impresses me about the shelter is how well connected it is to the community. Several restaurants and bakeries regularly supply their extra food to the shelter, many civic and religions organizations volunteer to make and serve the evening meals, and there is a steady stream of donated items given to the shelter.The clients i have met seem very appreciative of the services provided and the opportunity to have their basic needs met while getting back on their feet.The shelter seems to always be running at full capacity so I look forward to when the new building is completed so they can expand the services that are offered. 
Central Iowa Shelter & Services	57370		/users/profile/60578	kelleysmile	Volunteer	5	11/18/2010	I came to know about Central Iowa Shelter & Services when I worked for the local festival and events group. At the conclusion of one of our Festivals, we donated several items (food and t-shirts) that remained from our volunteer program. Today, I'm a proud member of the volunteer PR team and also donate clothing and other items for the residents on a regular basis. I am constantly learning about the wonderful things CISS is doing to help those in need and take pride in knowing that I am a (very) small part of that. The staff and volunteers who contribute to CISS' successes are a bright spot in our community.  
Central Iowa Shelter & Services	57090		/users/profile/59953	JenniferC	Volunteer	5	11/16/2010	Central Iowa Shelter & Services has an amazing set of services to offer and our community is proud to have CISS.  I participate on the PR Committee, who provides a quarterly newsletter to donors and volunteers to keep them updated on progress, share the unique stories of the people who utilize the services at CISS, and extend gratitude to those who donate time or money to the shelter.  Whether you have utilized the services yourself, volunteer, or donate, CISS stands out with an honorable reputation.
Central Iowa Shelter & Services	56983		/users/profile/59772	KimG	Volunteer	5	11/15/2010	I have been a volunteer at CISS for over a year now.  I check clients into the shelter and see the people firsthand who are trying to put their lives back together.  After living in Chicago for 20 years and recently moving back to Des Moines, I was incredibly impressed with the staff and services but saddened by the out of date facility.  I believe the shelter needs the new facility to accomodate the growing problem of homelessness in our city.  The team of professionals and volunteers who provide the meals are terrific and very dedicated.  Without these amazing people, the shelter would not be able to survive.
Central Iowa Shelter & Services	56871		/users/profile/59600	adamhammes	Volunteer	5	11/12/2010	CISS is amazing.  The have a food rescue network all over town... they have a garden and are expanding... they have a nutritious 2-week menu designed by ISU dieticians they share with volunteer groups... they partner with other shelters (youth, etc.) in the area... they offer professional development and job placement assistance for the needy... and they just CARE...Keep up the great work !!!
Central Iowa Shelter & Services	56833		/users/profile/59550	mcmcdermott	Board Member	5	11/12/2010	Central Iowa Shelter & Services plays a crucial role in getting homeless adults off the street and on the path toward self-sufficiency.  It is a careful steward of public and private funds, and annually serves with a limited budget thousands of people through leveraging a strong volunteer force and careful expenditures.   The shelter is in the process of constructing a new building, which will enable better service to more individuals in the years ahead.
Central Iowa Shelter & Services	56812		/users/profile/59523	cmoffatt	Volunteer	5	11/12/2010	It is my absolute pleasure to write this review for Central Iowa Shelter Services.  Our shelter has gone above and beyond to serve those in need.  Through blizzards, floods and record heat the shelter reached its max capacity yet the staff continued to welcome those in need and treat them as family.  CISS recognizes the individuals they serve and treat them with respect and offer programs to help them stand on their own.  Last year they graduated their first GED student through a new program they offered.  The Executive Director, Tony Timm, has fought a long and hard battle to gain ground for a new shelter and was successful this year.  The new facility will be an amazing thing for this community and offer even more services (medical, dental, classrooms) to serve those in need.  CISS serves has served 67,984 meals, 81,895 through their community kitchen and has provides 33,992 nights of shelter this year.  They welcome every male and female with open arms.  We are truly blessed to have such a great shelter in our community that is helping build a better future for all.
Central Iowa Shelter & Services	56810		/users/profile/59520	Judy	Board Member	5	11/12/2010	I'm an original Board Member of this wonderful and caring Shelter for over 100 men and women each night at no charge, who would otherwise be out on the harsh streets of Des Moines.  I've seen the Shelter continue to expand, not only in it's basic programming, but in its vision for a round- the -clock care and housing for chronic homeless.  The Board through the years has been unbelievably committed and visionary, sharing their passion with others in our Community to make it a household word of ultimate caring for those of the least of us.  In addition to housing homeless, the Shelter provides 2 meals each day, a clinic sponsored by a local hospital, computer/GED classes, transportation to and from jobs for clients, and serves as the Community Kitchen in Des Moines Metro area, sending out over 450 meals each day to different meal sites  for families, individuals and children at no charge.
Central Iowa Shelter & Services	56585		/users/profile/59179	Jen P.	Volunteer	5	11/09/2010	I volunteer for Monday evening check-in at the Central Iowa Shelter.  I have the privilege of working with the committed staff and helping clients get registered to stay in a bed at the shelter overnight.  The shelter serves 3 meals a day, provides caseworkers to help clients move forward, has computer lab access for job searching and resume writing, and brings in Legal Aid, Primary Health Care, and GED services.  CISS provides for the immediate needs of homeless men and women in Polk County who desperately need the help.

Being outdoors is very  therapeutic to me. I just started hunting within the last few years so, being able to learn from others and enjoying the camaraderie of being around other veterans was great. It definitely helped me clear my head and put me in a better place mentally when I was done. 
English River Outfitters Resort	280222		/users/profile/370068	Writer	Client Served	4	02/15/2016	To all,This is an outstanding organization and I had a great, relaxing, therapeutic experience. Chuck and his team made the trip seamless and fun. ERO did a great job organizing and communicating with everyone involved.  I felt at home right away and the accommodations were great.   Plus, the team of volunteers that helped us out made me feel safe and respected at all times.  I hope I can get another chance to  participate in the future. Not to Mention the hunting is outstanding. 
English River Outfitters Resort	279296		/users/profile/369370	Writer	Client Served	5	02/08/2016	I attended the first Iowa Shotgun season Veteran's Hunt.  I thought the entire experience was excellent and well run, despite the fact that this was their first time doing it.  The volunteer staff was very accommodating and did their best to learn from and deal with issues along the way.  Trying to put together a hunt with a diverse group of people who do not know each other when they arrive, while understanding the issues each of us bring to the event, is very difficult--but they did an outstanding job of it.  While I managed to get a small deer, the totality of this experience is not a result of filling my tag.  The important part was meeting guys who had some of the same issues I did and hearing their stories.  The important part was meeting guys who had much more difficulty than I did in fighting with the VA about their service and getting the treatment they were promised, and understanding how the stuff we hear on the news affects individual vets on a personal level.I highly recommend attending this event--I have volunteered to help staff the next one--because it is a worthwhile experience.  The volunteer crew ERO put together was excellent.  The support and generosity of the Solon American Legion was overwhelming.  This was a valuable experience for me, and I'll never forget it.
English River Outfitters Resort	278969		/users/profile/368989	Writer	Client Served	5	02/03/2016	I was invited to a Shotgun Deer hunt with ERO this last year and I must say, this is a top notch Organization.  We" Veterans" were treated like royalty and Chuck and the Volunteers were as accomidating.  I have never been on an out of State hunt before and not only was it about the hunt but able to meet some great people and like minded Veterans.  Life long friends.  I hope I get another opportunity to hunt and visit ERO in the future and I hope if you are a Veteran, you do too.  Thank you Chuck and everyone associated with ERO for everything.

English River Outfitters Resort	278507	1	/users/profile/368462	Writer	Client Served	5	01/31/2016	I have had other hunts with veterans organizations and I am completely blown away by the staff at ERO. They were very helpful in every aspect of the hunt. This years deer hunt, I not only found new brothers but was a hunt I will always remember. I always have a huge smile when I talk about this years hunt. Chuck and the guys have a top notch organization with the emphasis on serving the veterans. I did not hear one person complain while I was there. I will definitely be back for other hunts! Thank you to ERO and Chuck for making this years deer season an amazing one!

English River Outfitters Resort	99779	1	/users/profile/120857	jkerr0399	Client Served	5	10/26/2011	I have been an outdoorsman my whole life, but this opportunity gave me new perspective on the outdoors.  For me it was too easy to think the woods would be there when I was ready to go enjoy it.  Being invited on this hunt got me out and I quickly realized I had been taking the outdoors for granted.  Just like tomorrow, nothing is guaranteed.  You have to go enjoy it and experience it right now.  Someday should be a bad word and used with extreme caution.  After my experience in Iraq I learned that tomorrow is not a sure thing.  Since coming home from overseas I started to think getting out hunting and enjoying nature was too cold, or work.  I forgot about the solitude and rewards.  There are a lot of great causes out there, but by now almost every American family has be affected by the Global War on Terrorism in one way or another.  If someone had one hour to give, or one dollar, this would be the spot.  I would not have had the experience and re-charging I did without others help.  Helping the next veteran will be my new mission.         
English River Outfitters Resort	99728	1	/users/profile/120656	IowaVet	Client Served	4	10/25/2011	"Designed by Veterans for Veterans," aren't just words. I was fortunate enough to spend a weekend at English River Outfitters in October of 2011 and the experience was very transforming.  I had never deer hunted or used a bow but the proprietor, Chuck Geertz, had already arranged for pro-staffers and other life-long hunters to be on site to assist our group of Veterans which made the hunt all the more enjoyable because of the invaluable information we received. More importantly than the hunt, were the conversations we had at the lodge, around the campfire and while traveling to and from the blinds and deer stands. We all are Iraqi Veterans and that weekend offered us the opportunity to relax, unwind and enjoy the company of our brothers. As for the facility itself, the word that keeps dominating my mind is "Visionary." Chuck knows exactly what he is doing and what direction the resort is heading. In this most rustic setting, his hospitality created the atmosphere of a top-notch bed and breakfast. As the resort progresses, he will be able to serve Veterans in an even greater capacity. You can take the Veteran out of English River Outfitters, but you can't take English River Outfitters out of the Veteran.
English River Outfitters Resort	58714	1	/users/profile/62746	crsbriggs	Board Member	5	12/12/2010	My family's lives were changed for in April 2005 when my husband and the father of our two children was severely injured in Iraq.  He suffered a severe Traumatic Brain Injury, lost his right eye,  his left side of his body is paralyzed and suffers from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.  With Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) being the "signature and Invisible" wound of this current war time veterans and their families need a place to heal, learn and transition back into civilian world.  English River Outfitters provides just that.  My husband is able to go hunting with other veterans who is in the same situation.  Our family is able to camp with other families and relax knowing that we won't be judged or looked upon as completely crazy.  Being around others who have traveled down the same road is so important.

FMC stands as a symbol to the generoristy and commitment of the community to ensure care for everyone.  On behalf of the Board of Health and Johnson County Public Health, THANK YOU to all the staff, volunteers and supporters.

We need to keep them around a VERY long time... especially with this economy and healthcare system! Keep up the good work!
Iowa City Free Medical Clinic	93662		/users/profile/107879	volunteeratfmc	Volunteer	5	07/09/2011	The Iowa City FMC is the premier health services site for uninsured or under-insured patients in Johnson County.  Patients are treated with dignity and respect, and examiners work with patients to develop treatment plans.  As a volunteer, I know my time is always put to good use, from explaining medical documents to patients, to interpreting for non-English speaking patients during a visit, to helping patients schedule follow-up appointments.  The ICFMC staff makes the clinic a fun and welcoming place to volunteer, and I always look forward to being there!

Iowa City Free Medical Clinic	91849		/users/profile/105186	Jenn B	Board Member	5	06/23/2011	The ICFMC offers health and dental services to those who would otherwise go without.  Services range from testing and health screening to cronic illness' such as hypertension and diabetes.  No one is turned away.  Until health care becomes a right instead of a privilege, the ICFMC will continue to take care of those that do not have the means to take care of themselves.  A great organization and wonderful staff!

As a new member to the Board of Directors, each month I learn of a "service story" that details quality medical care given to a patient, the benefits to the patient and the reduction of costs to the medical community via diverted utilization of the emergency room for care.  The staff and Co-Directors truly care about the well being of all people.

The staff working the clinic are extremely welcoming to all patients.  Patient privacy is respected by workers and volunteers alike.  Patients are told honestly what they can expect from the clinic (treatment, care, help finding insurance).  The clinic offers a variety of services for both acute and chronic health problems.  Different services (ex. dermatology, physical therapy) are available at certain times throughout the month.

I was able to see the best in people through the students, physicians, staff and other volunteers who did not just donate their time, but their hearts. I think the Free Medical Clinic is a great example of an organization truly catering to a basic need where people aren't taking advantage of any system but are simply looking for help when they are sick.

The logo caught my curiosity, the message got me interested, and the people I've met will keep me as involved as I'm allowed to be.  I've only had the pleasure of volunteering with Recycled Fish for one event, but will definitely be looking forward to more opportunities as they present themselves.
Recycled Fish	35964	4	/users/profile/36755	rkruzer	Volunteer	5	04/16/2010	I attended a college that was known for it's enviromental practices.  30 years later, I found Recycled Fish and returned to my enviromental roots.  We were studying Loon mortality in college, and it was found that part of it was due to them ingesting lead weights, due to fishing.  At Recycled Fish, they promote the use of alternative non-toxic weights, as well as recycling, energy conservation, sustainable fishing, catch and release, and being a steward to our land and water resources.  The list goes on, but I am a proud member of this organization.
Recycled Fish	35451	4	/users/profile/36280	deckers-outdoor	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/11/2010	I stumbled across the link to Recycled Fish after signing up on Angler's Legacy.  I thoroughly checked the organization out and was instantly impressed by the list of their corporate partners. I believe the list contained around eighty-five different companies that support Recycled Fishs cause to promote a lifestyle of stewardship while both on and off the water. This list of partner companies was not limited to just the fishing industry, in fact, it includes everything from household to gardening  products, pet food to plumbing needs, sporting goods to water filters and the list goes on and on.   At first glance one would assume that this Lifestyle of Stewardship pertains only to anglers, but in reality this message pertains to every person on the planet. We all need clean water and without it nothing can survive, so we all must take the appropriate steps to conserve our natural resources, whether we fish or not. This statement holds true for the all socio-economic classes and every nation. The principles behind  the cause are clearly demonstrated in the Weekly Stewardship Tips  as these tips promote , enlighten, and encourage the wise use of natural resources and conservation efforts,. These tips also have very real applications for use in everyday living as well as for businesses and industries. They do not require a major life change; just a rethinking about how we use products and the actions we take everyday.    Some of the tips Recycled Fish publishes will actually help people save money as people begin to incorporate this Lifestyle of  Stewardship into their every living .  I joined Recycled Fish in October 2008 and in 2009 I signed up as a volunteer which lead to the opportunity to travel the nation spreading the word and encouraging others to take the Stewardship Pledge  to conserve our natural resources, protect the environment  through simple yet effective methods, and promote our fisheries. I have the pleasure of  traveling from Michigan to Alabama and from Georgia to Texas to sport shows, ice fishing events, and major fishing tournament to spread the cause. Recycled Fish is also involved in many children focused groups in efforts to educate them of the splendor of the outdoors and what they can do as the inheritors of  the world to promote a healthier planet as well as the future of sport fishing.  I personally recommend, endorse, and encourage everyone to join Recycled Fish because their principles are not just for the sportsman at heart; they are applicable for maintaining ecological balance, wise use  of natural resources without destroying the ecological balance of our fisheries.
Recycled Fish	34813	7	/users/profile/35675	tom12	Volunteer	5	04/06/2010	Recycled Fish crossed my path while researching organizations where I could volunteer and make a difference. What a great find it was. Teeg (executive director)really impressed me with his unbridled passion for the "causes" while operating with absolute integrity.Recycled Fish has some outstanding programs aimed at giving kids the opportunitiy to enjoy the sport of fishing while educating them on how to be good stewards both on and off the water. Everyone at Recycled Fish truly believes that "our lifestyle runs downstream". My son has caught on as well. Without me prompting him, he will pick up litter and discarded fishing line at our fishing site.  Recycled Fish has many great projects in the works and is positioned to reach a huge audience and with proper funding, could have a tremendous impact on our fisheries and our lifestyle.
Recycled Fish	34784	7	/users/profile/35643	jeremy3	Volunteer	5	04/06/2010	Recycled Fish is an organization that promotes a lifestyle of stewardship to a very broad audience, regardless of the fact that the typical target audience is anglers.  Utilizing simple ideas like, "not dumping our used oil behind the garage", to using low flow shower heads.I think the organizations strengths lie in the fact that the message is something that is really easy to follow, as well, it's some of the most simple things we can do to make a tremendous collective difference.I think, as has been acknowledged, that sometimes things seem bottle-necked; only because the growth of the cause, and the growth of the organization.  It's too much for one person to handle without a lot greater delegated support network.

Recycled Fish	34752	7	/users/profile/35617	sam6	Board Member	5	04/06/2010	I stumbled upon Recycled Fish a few years ago amidst my dissertation research on grassroots fisheries conservation. I was immediately inspired by their message and impressed by their work. Unlike other fishing based conservation/stewardship groups, Recycled Fish calls attention to all aspects of our lifestyle. Recycled Fish sends weekly "stewardship tips," that educate anglers about everything from composting, to shopping locally, to changing light-bulbs. In other words, the message is that everything we do, impacts our fisheries. This struck me as unique. Moreover, I was impressed by Recycled Fish because they preached stewardship to one specific group, like other fishing-based conservation organizations do. They preach a universal message of stewardship to all anglers, because the more anglers we have fighting for our waters the better off we will be in the long run.  The message is broad and the audience is all encompassing. Recycled Fish is young in the grand scheme of things, but their vision is mature and forward thinking. We need more visionaries like Recycled Fish
Recycled Fish	34745	2	/users/profile/35611	cyrus	Donor	5	04/05/2010	Recycled Fish promotes awareness of the environment, and provides guidance about being a good steward of our natural resources.  The organization teaches and informs without being strident, without promoting a political point of view, and by example.  This organization is worthy of notice, and of funding.
Recycled Fish	34743	4	/users/profile/35608	kg0hqcoxnet	Volunteer	5	04/05/2010	This is a great organization.  For the vast majority of members it's absolutely free.  For those that wish additional information the Stewardship Tips delivered by e-mail are very informative, and cause one to think about their daily lifestyle.  An of course there are many, many opportunities to be a volunteer which could include some fishing time.
Recycled Fish	34739	5	/users/profile/35605	crash	General Member of the Public	5	04/05/2010	I host a radio outdoor program and without the great information provided by Recycled Fish, I wouldn't be able to inform my listeners in an intelligent manner. Teeg and his group have been at the forefront of water quality promotion, proper stewardship on water and one that is close to my heart, the support of youth fishing. The group understands that, while sure it's about us, being the current generation keeping an eye on things, but we are actually doing it for the benefit of those follow us. They have inspired me in make positive choices as well from simple things like cutting back on printing of emails, recycling and the products have put on my yard that may effect water quality. I am proud of the job they do and promote Recycled Fish whenever I can. Sincerely Crash DavisHost of Your ULTIMATE Outdoors WWW.KFAB.COM
Recycled Fish	34733	1	/users/profile/35600	teeg	Board Member	5	04/05/2010	I couldn't be more proud or excited about the way that Recycled Fish has grown in the past 7 years. It's gone from being my personal vision to something that is so much bigger than myself.Over 11,000 people from all 50 States and over 20 countries have taken our "Sportsman's Stewardship Pledge" and joined the cause.We've developed programs which are effectively engaging, educating and equipping anglers on how to live the "lifestyle of stewardship" both on and off the water.But most of all, there are now about 4 dozen volunteers who help move the cause forward. Recycled Fish has grown into something far bigger than me, and it's the result of many people who are passionate about healthy waters.Next steps for us will be growing capacity - we need some full time staff in order to have the kind of impact that is needed. To get there, greater financial flow is necessary, which requires developing those funding streams.This is our current challenge, but one that I know we can meet with the help of God who has no doubt had a hand in everything good we've accomplished so far.

Because it is a small and independent non-profit organization, each and every staff member, volunteer, board member, donor, supporter, and client is important.  I think that sometimes people feel like healthcare issues are so huge that they can't possibly make a difference, but you can make a real difference at the Emma Goldman Clinic.

Emma Goldman Clinic	91613	1	/users/profile/104883	Karen Kubby	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/22/2011	The Emma Goldman Clinic is one of 14 feminist non-profit reproductive health care clinics providing abortion care in the USA.  It is a model for health care services provision, educational programming, training of volunteers and health care professionals, and in non-profit management. The clinic is always changing to keep up with current trends, support groups of people who have little access to health care services, and collaborates with other area agencies. What is not to like about the Emma Goldman Clinic?

I appreciated that the staff were willing to spend time with me teaching me about my body.  On the Board, we have been working on providing good wages and health care to our employees while keeping services affordable.  Emma also tries to help women reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies so we have to rely on donations to make ends meet.   I really appreciate that the counselors have as the goal helping the woman make the best decision for her even if that means we refer her to an adoption agency or a group that will help provide her with infant supplies.

Emma Goldman Clinic	91489		/users/profile/104687	heartfeltSW13	Client Served	5	06/21/2011	Five years ago in July, I had to have a second trimester abortion.  I was living in Florida at the time, and the clinic there was awful.  Every horror imaginable existed in this clinic, from the impersonal staff, to the crowded hot muggy waiting room, to the terrifyingly cold and mean doctor.  I recovered in Florida for about a week, and then moved back to Eastern Iowa / Quad Cities area.  I was instructed to have a follow up appointment in 3 weeks time, and in my searching online and with the help of friends around the country, I thankfully ended up calling the Emma Goldman Clinic.  I had my appointment, and proceeded to be a client of theirs for the next 3 years, only leaving because I went back to school for my PhD in Social Work and was unable to have care covered through my insurance.  I shutter to think how I might view my experience in Florida had it not been for the caring, supportive, respectful, validating experience (from the minute I walked in the door, to the care I was given in the examination room, to the resources I was offered as I checked out) I was given at the Emma Goldman Clinic.

Emma Goldman Clinic	90944		/users/profile/103889	gret	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/15/2011	Emma Goldman has been a leader in the quest for reproductive rights for women for decades.  Having seen generations of women realize the potential for self determination both as clients and staff, I can assure you that this organization has a crucial role in this process.  As a training ground for future health providers, hundreds of physicians have benefited from the expertise of the clinical director and assurance has been made that the quality of medical care available to women is of the highest caliber. This mid-west treasure has the strong support of the community and is most deserving of any additional support you can provide.  As a health care provider, an educator, a training ground and a positive experience for its customer, the clinic will continue to excel in its mission.

Go Light Our World	262499	2	/users/profile/351172	dawnie504	Board Member	5	10/08/2015	We met Bryan and Marcia in December 2005.  They organized and led the first C&MA relief worker team to New Orleans after hurricane Katrina.  They worked tirelessly to gut homes, fix roofs, move trash and most importantly minister and uplift people.  Since that first trip they have returned many times to do physical labor, teach, minister and bring hope to a hurting city.  My husband pastors the small church that hosted and housed their team.  Over the years we have become fast friends and we watched and prayed as the Lord has tested them and pushed them out of their comfort zone.  In every instance their amazing faith in Christ has been a marvel to observe and an inspiration in our lives.  This couple loves the Lord and is always ready to walk where He leads.  We watched their love and faith grow as they ministered with us and were not at all surprised when the Lord put it on their heats to start GLOW and they accepted the challenge.  We are so excited to be a part of what is happening with GLOW and we are proud and privileged to call them sister and brother.  They truly do care about the spiritual well being of all they seek to help.  
Go Light Our World	262393	2	/users/profile/351064	Peque	Board Member	5	10/08/2015	We met the Thayers during their first visit to Cochabamba, Bolivia over three years ago. The connection was immediate due to their genuineness in both their faith and commitment. These past three years they have helped the Josiah Ministry at our church. This ministry serves a good hearty meal a week and provides showers to more than 40 children and about fifteen mothers, who live in extreme poverty and earn their living as peddlers or shoeshines. It also provides school support and, most importantly, it shares the love of Christ to them. Recently, GLOW donated money to buy over 50 children and adult Bibles. We cannot describe what it meant for them having at last the Word of God in their hands. Without GLOW, we could not have been able to provide food, school materials, Bibles and attention to these children and their families. They truly live under their motto.

I am impressed by this grass roots non-profit where Bryan and Marcia Thayer, using only their network of  connections and their own resources, have established a meaningful ministry - a lesson to all of us that large funds, while nice, are not required to make a significant impact.    From the United States to Scotland to Bulgaria to Bolivia, Go Light Our World touches the humblest people to shine the light of Jesus' love in tangible ways.   It doesn't take a rocket scientist to understand our interconnectedness across this planet, and how nurturing and improving lives, one life at a time, should be a matter of utmost importance to us all. 
C & WS Rustic Hollow Shelter Inc	316975	3	/users/profile/408166	Jeff Alexander	Client Served	5	10/30/2016	Sweet Rex. That was the name I gave to a male homeless cat I'd just trapped in a very dangerous situation at the Albuquerque International Airport.  Rex was named in honor of a friend having some medical issues, and was also the husband of an unstoppable TNR advocate.  The "Sweet" part of his name came from Rex's caregivers at C & W Rustic Hollow Shelter once they met this fine, lovable gentleman.  Just minutes after he was trapped, he was meowing to be released, never to utter a hiss of fear or stress.  He was just good natured,  'Sweet.' As an animal advocate with a home already too full of lovable felines, I relinquished Rex to the local Animal Humane branch  . . .  he passed all the tests of sociability . . . only to test positive for FeLV . . . they were going to euthanize him!  Horrified at the news, I convinced them I would responsibly find Rex a home, or at least a rescue organization where he would be safe. That's when Sweet Rex's luck began to change.  A superb rescue group in it's own right in Corrales, NM, stepped up and agreed to sponsor and help Sweet Rex find a home.  Meanwhile, I was frantically searching privately for a forever home, even placing a newspaper ad with his picture.  The responses to that ad were alarming and it became clear Sweet Rex's plight was desperate.  But hope was never lost.  The director of the Corrales rescue group knew of a shelter, almost 1,200 miles away, in Nashua, Iowa, that just might have a spot for Sweet Rex.  Shortly after the request, we got the 'sweet' news . . . news that C & W Rustic Hollow Shelter would make room & welcome Mr. Sweet Rex into their fold, for the rest of his wonderful life.  My heart nearly burst with relief & joy! But how were we to get Sweet Rex to Nashua?  It's at least a 2-day drive each way from Albuquerque to Nashua.  How about a round-trip pass for a human passenger escort on an airline that accepted felines in the cabin?   And yes, that very pass was donated by an animal lover upon learning of Sweet Rex's need.  I just happened to work for that very same airline at the time and was able to easily persuade the gate agent to waive the reservation fee so Sweet Rex could board free of charge! And so off they went.  Sweet Rex and his escort.  Sweet Rex didn't know that his escort on this journey, in his professional life, was an aide to a sitting US Senator, and the husband of the director of the Corrales rescue.  But this trip was part of the escort's private life, and this was Rex's chance at his new life!  It was in August, 2012. Sweet Rex's story is also the story of C & W Rustic Hollow Shelter.  I love what the word 'shelter' connotes.  It gives hope to the infirmed, the wayward, and the homeless & their advocates, that there is a welcoming place to call home, no questions asked, forever! Sweet Rex crossed over the Rainbow Bridge in April, 2014.   In an email notifying me that Sweet Rex had passed, Co-founders Carmen Linda Conklin & Wanda L. Orric wrote, "He fought the good fight, but the feline leukemia is something they cannot fight once it has a stronghold and is active in their bone marrow. Sweetest kitty ever. He is so missed. Always tears in our FeLV room when a kitty leaves, but Cristina (Swinton), his caregiver said, it's still the quality of life they have here, not the quantity. It is so true. They don't know they have this awful disease that could take them any time. They just live and are content and happy and loved. So sad today. Wanted to let you know right away. Carmen and Wanda" In my most humble opinion,  C & W Rustic Hollow Shelter 'IS' unequivocally the 'DEFINITION' of a 'GREAT NONPROFIT!'  The shelter constantly seeks ways to fundraise for all the necessary items essential in maintaining and sustaining a shelter.  I'll never quite comprehend the day to day pressures involved in caring for an ever-growing number of wayward & homeless, medically & socially compromised cats.  It's a selfless staff with many volunteers that make a great team, along with their passion, commitment, compassion, dedication & love for their clients, that makes C & W Rustic Hollow Shelter one of the VERY BEST!!!  I will forever be thankful to them for the care & love gracefully afforded to just one amazing cat, . . . SWEET REX!!! Sincerely,Jeff Alexander

Our rescue is extremely finicky; we did the research, we visited several sanctuaries before placing these precious ones at RH. Rustic Hollow won our admiration and our support for their over-the-top care of each and every kitty there. Staff develop real relationships with the kitties in their charge, and treat them almost as their own. Medical care is high-quality and on-site; there is even an in-house clinic, and they host a low cost spayathon there every month that is a godsend for shelters in central Iowa, serving as many as 75 cats on those days.Cats roam free in homelike houses. They get along with each other because anything that could cause competition is eliminated. There is even a guest room for visitors!I cannot praise Rustic Hollow highly enough. They do a beautiful job. (Photos of the kitties I've personally placed at Rustic Hollow, left to right: Holly Nolle, Jeannette Isabella, and Purrsia.)
C & WS Rustic Hollow Shelter Inc	303812	3	/users/profile/394977	Catsgalore	Client Served	5	09/13/2016	Rustic Hollow has over the years continued to "be there" for a dear friend of mine when she was in need.  She was a foster home for our little non-profit cat rescue in Wisconsin & she opened her doors & her heart to abandoned or stray cats & kitten, working daily to socialize them for adoption.  However, her landlord took issue with the number of cats in the home he rented to her & told her that several of the cats must go.   After much research & heartache, we decided on Rustic Hollow for these cats, both of whom were FIV+.This past year, the house she rented changed hands & the new landlord terminated her lease.  At this time she had 3 much-loved cats, all her own.  After much searching of available places to rent, she reluctantly had to agree to an apartment that allowed only 2 cats.  So Rustic Hollow was again called upon to help, which they did.This cat had been doing well until at the shelter until several months ago when she contracted pneumona & was near death for several days.  Her recovery was long & arduous & Carmen & Wanda, who founded & run Rustic Hollow, took this cat into their own home in order to care for her around the clock.   They were there for  her continually, seeing to all her needs & lavishing her with love & constant care.   This kitty did recover altho she continues to be frail, but she never did go back to her quarters in the shelter. Carmen & Wanda have kept her in their home as one of their own cats so they can continue to care for her & see that she is well & happy.   Carmen & Wanda are not young women & taking cats like this one into their own home to live as their own is a burden that they assume with love & tremendous compassion.It is Carmen & Wanda who have from the beginning opened the doors of Rustic Hollow to cats who can no longer stay in their current homes for any number of reasons.  They operate on a shoestring but the health & well being of the cats are never compromised.  Their staff is imbued with the same compassion & dedicatiion to the cats that characterizes Carmen & Wanda.  Surely these women & their Rustic Hollow Shelter are most worthy of recognition for being an outstanding home for cats in need.

C & WS Rustic Hollow Shelter Inc	289068	2	/users/profile/379280	Writer	Client Served	5	05/08/2016	I first encountered Rustic Hallow Shelter  in December 2015,  after I was advised our local shelter had no resources to assist.  I am employed by a  law enforcement agency and had come across a subject that had in excess of 40 felines.  I was devastated, frustrated and upset at the lack of any available help.  I was given Rustic Hallow's number and hesitated due to it begin forty five minutes out of my jurisdiction.  What an amazing experience I had.  I wasn't even sure that Rustic Hallow could assist, but several months, phone calls and arrangements later, I can truly say if it wasn't for Rustic Hallow, most of the felines would have been euthanized.  Carmen not only "adopted" several cats, but found homes for kittens, found a foster home for several adult male felines and arranged to have many neutered at no expense to law enforcement or the subject.  I am so thankful for Carmen and everyone involved with Rustic Hallow.  I know I owe so much to Rustic Hallow for all that was done from pure advise to the connections they have and used to help me.  To this day, I have yet to meet Carmen or visit Rustic Hallow, but it is an absolute on my to do list.  Thank you for having such a caring heart and safe place!

This cage free, no kill sanctuary for special needs felines is just amazing.  Carmen, Wanda, their staff and many volunteers care for cats with medical & physical needs, seniors, cats that are feline leukemia+ and FIV+ and many others.  In addition to daily and medical care, they socialize the cats, hold spay & neuter clinics, do fundraising events and I know for sure this is only a small portion of what they do .  When they take an animal in, they are committed to that animal for life.  They have accepted 2 special needs cats from our shelter in Emporia, KS and I drove them to Iowa on both occasions.  I have seen first hand how wonderful this sanctuary is and the love and care given to these felines who all deserve that 2nd chance they would not otherwise have received.  I can't thank C & W's Rustic Hollow enough for what they do. They are awesome!

Hats off to OPAF for continuing all its sports and social activities. 
The Orthotic & Prosthetic Assistance Fund, Inc.	54902		/users/profile/56853	Wendy B.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/20/2010	OPAF has jointly sponsored an event with me.  The organization publicized the event, coordinated the volunteers, arranged logistics, and ran the events.  All the participants were thrilled with the tennis clinic.  The professional running the tennis clinic was enthusiastic, knowledgeable and a great motivator.  We had people with various disabilities, some who had never played tennis before and some who play regularly.  Everyone had a good time and wanted it to become an annual event!
The Orthotic & Prosthetic Assistance Fund, Inc.	54897		/users/profile/56848	Tami	Client Served	4	10/20/2010	The OPAF has the vision of what its purpose is to the limbloss community.  This organizaion allows those individuals, who have the desire to pursue many different types of physical activities, the opportunity to learn and be taught how to move forward in different sports related activites.  I have personally participated in the First Volley Tennis clinics and was impressed with the level of teaching I was able to benefit from.  I am a BKA and had an absolutely positive experience and look forward to the opportunity I can have when they come to my area.  The only drawback is that it is only once a year.  I would love to see the OPAF have the opportunity to offer their programs more often in my area.
Animal Lifeline of Iowa, Inc.	107799		/users/profile/43879	parkerceline	Donor	5	03/10/2012	I have adopted, volunteered and been a donor for Animal Lifeline of Iowa... a no-kill animal shelter that support orphaned, abandoned, pregnant, handicapped or animals that have health issues.  This is an amazing organization that stretches every dollar they receive and does a tremendous job working to secure donors and support through discounted or volunteered services or products.  They are kind, amazing group that takes amazing care of dogs and cats in need.  I would highly recommend them as an worthy organization for donor or volunteer support.  JE
Animal Lifeline of Iowa, Inc.	43104	11	/users/profile/43879	parkerceline	Volunteer	5	06/06/2010	Animal Lifeline of Iowa is one of the most caring animal facilities I have ever known.  It is a special needs no kill shelter which is dedicated to giving animals a chance for a happy life when other shelters might not because of the expense or time required to repair their injuries, give them the veterinarian care they have been denied and take care of the orphaned, pregnant and  nursing cats and dogs that live here until they find their new forever homes.  The dedicated, professional and loving staff have inspired a multitude of volunteers who share ALI's  mission of making these animals ready for a new life of love.  With no government funding, Central Iowa's no-kill shelter for special needs animals relies on the generosity of donors, patrons of its Thrift Shop and fundraisers which include a dogwash (june 19th 10-2) and Its Paws and Claws Annual Dinner/auction this October 16th at the Des Moines Downtown Marriott.  The animals and Iowa is lucky Animal Lifeline successfully cares and makes whole animals that spread countless joy and love to families across Iowa.  I have adopted many animals from ALI that have given me countless joy and love and my experience with them is absolutley fabulous and I would whole heartedly recommend anyone look to Animal Lifeline for an animal, a chance to volunteer and to contribute.
Animal Lifeline of Iowa, Inc.	47770	6	/users/profile/48532	tchnrun	Volunteer	5	07/05/2010	Animal Lifeline is an amazing place where all animals are loved, cared for, appreciated and accepted the way they are. The staff is friendly and knows all of the animals very well. My daughter and I have volunteered at this special needs no-kill shelter for several years and have always had an excellent experience. They provided us with very specific training and guidelines which were very helpful. It is very well organized and very clean. Our job is to socialize with the cats. We play with each cat, pet it and give it lots of love and attention. This is especially true in the isolation room where only one cat can be out at a time due to health issues. It is quite impressive to see how the animals progress over time. The staff is very patient and does all that it can to help the animals.  What a comfort to know that when an animal finds its way to Animal Lifeline, that it will be given the best life possible and every chance to survive and thrive whether it takes days, weeks or years. Animal Lifeline is certainly an exemplary shelter in our eyes.
Animal Lifeline of Iowa, Inc.	47754	4	/users/profile/48509	eking	Former Volunteer	5	07/05/2010	I went to Animal Lifeline because of a co-worker.  Outside her cubicle, she posted from the Des Moines Register current listings of adoptable animals.  She worked at the shelter.  Her job was to take care of the cats and she spoke very highly about the way the cats were cared for.  After our yellow tabby Chester passed away we went to ALI to get another yellow tabby.  When we walked into the cat room looking for a yellow tabby, a tuxedo cat kept sticking her paw out to touch me.  The care taker said Ive never seen her do that; she must want to meet you.  So she took out this black cat with the characteristic white mark on the chest, white toes and a white belly.  Miss Scarlet was very happy to meet me, but when I passed her to my husband she reached for him and licked him on the face all the while she was purring.  So she wanted us to take her home and we couldnt say no to her.  She obviously had been taken care of because she was so calm and loving. Our second pet that we adopted from ALI was Daisy. During the time that my mother was in her battle against cancer, she spent time in a care center.  The care center had a dog that lived there with the residents.  It was the visits from that dog that she looked forward to, and sometimes all we talked about was that dog.  I had heard about dog therapy, but until I witnessed the effect it had on people, I didnt know how helpful this therapy could be.  I decided this was something I needed to do. We wrote ALI to ask them if they had any dog that might be suitable for dog therapy.  They introduced us to Daisy and the rest is history. For 6 years Daisy and I visited the Care Center every other Saturday morning. Most of the residents dont remember my name, but they always remember Daisys.  I feel my Mom would be pleased.  Mom has been gone for some time now, but somehow I know when I got a smile from one of the residents, I know my mother is smiling too. Daisy is at least 11 years old and we just retired her this year.  Our third pet that we adopted from ALI was Ginger.  Daisy needed a friend; someone to chew on her neck, chase her and sleep with her,  Also, since Daisy was very much my dog, my husband wanted to find a dog that would really just be his.  He went out to ALI and Ginger picked him out.  He turned around in the kennel to see a dog with huge ears and a grin, just starring at him and it was love at first sight.  Ginger will never be as well behaved as Daisy, but she is every bit as loving and truly fun to have around.  Daisy loves her and they are best friends.For several years after our adoptions we also did some volunteer work for ALI.  Currently we are not because we have some other obligations, but I would highly recommend that volunteering at the shelter is very rewarding.  This is not just an animal shelter, this is a home for animals looking for forever homes.
Animal Lifeline of Iowa, Inc.	43475	10	/users/profile/44341	jennacath	Volunteer	5	06/10/2010	I was going through a difficult time in my life when I began volunteering at Animal Lifeline. I knew that I would find some comfort caring for these animals, but I never expected to find the kind of solace that I did here. The staff and other volunteers love what they do, and they love each animal separately and in a different way. Some of the animals that have come through have been in terrible situations, and to be able to care for them and help give them another chance at life is a feeling that is indescribable.
Animal Lifeline of Iowa, Inc.	43193	10	/users/profile/43994	triggersmom	Volunteer	5	06/07/2010	The first time I visited AnimalLifeline I was looking to adopt a dog as a companion for my golden retriever. I was not successful with my first visit but I started checking their website and noticed they were needing volunteers so I applied. That was approx. 2-3 years ago and I am still volunteering. I work every thursday and have gained so much from the experience, including a bassett mix (Trigger) that had a broken leg ( he had been shot) but is now the best dog ever!! His sister loves him dearly and they bonded at their very first meeting. The staff and volunteers at Animal Lifeline are wonderful and really do care about what happens to all the animals that come in. Everyone that works there goes above and beyond, time and time again to find our animals wonderful forever homes. I may spend a small amount of time there each week but I have to say that it is the most rewarding experience of my week. Shelter animals are very appreciative of the care they receive and will show you over and over again what wonderful pets they can be.
Animal Lifeline of Iowa, Inc.	43100	9	/users/profile/43874	khill	Former staff	5	06/05/2010	Animal Lifeline of Central Iowa is a beautiful place where many dogs and cats with special needs end up at the shelter.  They have been brought to the shelter because no one wants a broken or ill dog or cat. Maybe they just can't afford to take care of it. Maybe they just don't have time to care for it. Maybe they think there disposable.Whatever the reason may have been, which I know there was some very sad cases, but Animal Lifeline helped save many lives of these sweet souls. There was many times working at the Shelter a new dog or cat would arrive, I thought they would never get adopted.  But I can say they usually did.There are alot of kind people out there that opened there heart and adopted one or two of these special need angels, I was one of them.Most shelters would have gave up on these animals but now Animal Lifeline of Central Iowa.It's a great place with very nice people.
Animal Lifeline of Iowa, Inc.	43097	9	/users/profile/43872	ken1959	General Member of the Public	5	06/05/2010	After my doberman of 16 years passed on I decided that since he had been rescued from an abusive neighbor that any dog I got after that should be rescued animals not bought from pet shops or breeders. I found Animal Lifeline of Iowa online and read several of the stories  stories on there site, I was impressed with what I saw and with the work they do there. Along with their great dedication to saving , caring for and placing animals in need of homes. I was especially impressed at the screening before I was allowed to become a parent of one of the animals here and the fact that as part of the agreement I was required by them to let them know if anything happened to the animal - and the fact that if I couldnt in fact care for the animal that I bring it back to Animal Lifeline. Which really showed me their dedication. I have adopted 3 dogs from them, we currently have Cooper in our family - a black lab/chow mix that we adopted in February of 2007. It is about 189 miles to Animal Lifeline from our home, but well worth the drive for the level of love, devotion and dedication that they show for every animal they rescue , as well as the attention they give to the adoptive "parents"
Animal Lifeline of Iowa, Inc.	43090	10	/users/profile/43864	cashmeres-person	General Member of the Public	5	06/05/2010	Adopting Cashmere: My life changed when I adopted Cashmere.  Animals do that to humans, but this particular animal won my heart forever.  During the 2 hour car ride home to Iowa City I kept my hand in the pet carrier, rubbed her head and talked to her the entire way.   Cashmere is a one person cat and I am lucky to be her person.    She wants for nothing and is spoiled rotten, as it should be.  She has beds, blankets, pillows, toys, cat trees, cat jungles, treats, and never ending love.  Cashmere sleeps with me at night, sits at the table in the morning while I read the paper and drink my coffee, she follows me everywhere in the house, and talks up a storm when she wants to tell me something.  Thank you for taking such good care of Cashmere until I adopted her.  I guarantee you that she couldnt be loved anymore than she is right now.  She has found her forever home and I am forever grateful to share my life with her.  Thank you Animal Lifeline and a special thank you to Martha.  Cashmere sends an extra purr, just for you.  Love,Susan
Great River Players Inc	28061	6	/users/profile/29134	sam1	Volunteer	5	02/11/2010	I started out with Great River Players in 2005 when I had just finished 5th grade; and I have already been in 5 of their shows. It was then that I knew I wanted to act for the rest of my life and pursue an acting career. Fortunately, I don't have to leave them just yet! Being a sophmore, I still have some years. Everybody involved with GRP is what I consider family. Some of them are my closest friends! Driving 30 minutes back and forth everyday for rehearsal is definitely worth my time if it means I get to see the most loving/caring people I've ever known every day! :)
Great River Players Inc	27562	5	/users/profile/28644	3137	Volunteer	5	02/10/2010	Over a span of many many years I have been involved with Keokuk Community Theater which is now named Great River Players. Acting, producing, working backstage,makeup,props and more has been a wonderful and fullfilling experience. We are blessed with people of all ages who share their talents, time and friendship.  The Keokuk Community responds very positively to our productions. Great River Players provides a variety of live theater experiences for our tri state area to enjoy.
Great River Players Inc	27522	9	/users/profile/28607	dippypainting	Volunteer	5	02/09/2010	I joined Great River Players because I needed something to do. How little did I know that this organization would become a big part of my life. I always enjoyed sewing, but in Great River Players, sewing became more of a joy than at any other time. I've held offices from board member to president of the board, but it is being among the actors, directors, stage hands and other voulunteers than brings the most joy to my life.I have seen Great River Players grow so much in the almost 40 years that I have volunteer with this group. The quality of the shows has become one equaled to a professional troup. All the volunteers that I have encountered have been dedicated and talented people that strectch beyong the bounds to present to the community the best that theatre has to offer.We are all volunteers, but you wouldn't know by the love we have for this organization, a love that is rewarded by the interest the community has in our productions.
Great River Players Inc	27484	7	/users/profile/28572	born2bmild	Volunteer	5	02/09/2010	Having been involved with Great River Players since 1987, I have seen the organization grow, not only in the amount of patrons and season ticket  holders, but quality of shows presented and the  quality of  talent produced.  GRP offers a 3 show regular season, in addition, 2 free summer theatre program  are in place, which offers students from grades 4-7, and 8-12 grades from the tri-state area a chance to meet other like minded students, with an interest in theatre.  GRP also awards an annual scholarship to a graduating HS seniior that is  going into the field of  performing arts in any capacity.  Members of GRP are often asked to  perform at various community activities such as dinner theatres for  Big Brother Big Sister and United Way.Being a part of  GRP has been very rewarding to me  personally, by letting me discover unique ways to matter to  my community, by directing, acting, singing or by encouraging new talent.Everyone in GRP is a volunteer from director, actor, stagehands and ticket takers.

Great River Players Inc	27379	7	/users/profile/28445	two-people-on-stools-at-the-center-of-the-stage	Board Member	5	02/09/2010	After 20 years of involvement in almost every phase of production for this active community theater group, I am still amazed at the fresh and active group who continue to provide quality live theater for Keokuk, Iowa and the surrounding area.  Beyond the three formal productions each year, we sponsor two summer shows for youngsters and teens and produce a minimum of two fund-raising projects for our patrons.  Involvement by the members goes beyond the theater and finds them in many community groups, helping to enhance quality of life and arts in our midwestern town.  Our current production is in its final week of prep and our next show goes up in April.My perception of community theater is that its purposes are entertainment, social interaction and education.  Great River Players does it all.
Corridor Therapy Dogs	273597	3	/users/profile/362852	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	12/02/2015	I am a special education teacher at Linn-Mar high school and I teach students with autism. I have had the extreme pleasure of having the Corridor Therapy Dogs come out at least once a year to visit our students. Contacting Janet is always so easy and she is very accommodating to our group. She normally brings 3 to 6 groups of dogs and their handlers. I can honestly say that the adults get just as much out of the experience as the students do. It is a delight to see my students' faces light up when many times there is not much enjoyment with the day-to-day class activities. But when the therapy dogs are visiting, it is a completely different story. There are smiles, giggles, joy and a real connection between my students and the dogs. They are a true pleasure to have and I wish we could have them visit every month.
Corridor Therapy Dogs	272485	4	/users/profile/361540	Anna108	Client Served	5	11/19/2015	I have had two wonderful experiences with Corridor Therapy Dogs and look forward to many more. The handlers are not only kind enough to take time out of their busy lives to come into my school, they are also patient enough to deal with a room full of 8th graders! My students loved every minute of spending time with the incredibly well-trained dogs and many kids told me it was the highlight of their year. Students keep asking about the dogs and I'm glad I can tell them that they'll be back soon! 
Corridor Therapy Dogs	272457	4	/users/profile/361511	Writer	Client Served	4	11/19/2015	Cait and Gunner, Steve and Digger, and Janet and Stella are all incredible!  When human contact cannot enter the world of an Alzheimer's patient, a wet nose, soft fur and wagging tail can make all the difference.  To see the joy that the dogs and trainers bring to our patients is beyond belief.  They are a godsend.

My students look forward to our biweekly visits more than anything else!  Janet is a joy to be around, and has the BEST dog Stella (not that we are biased or anything).  Stella reads with some of our kiddos, and simply cuddles with others.  I have one kiddo who is non-verbal and she and Stella have an amazing connection.  It's truly like Stella can read her mind, and they have their own way of communicating.  It's heart warming!  Before Stella arrives, I usually get the best work out of my students, because they know their favorite reward is on her way!

Corridor Therapy Dogs	272078	5	/users/profile/361036	Writer	Client Served	5	11/15/2015	Tony Nevett and Danny the Greyhound visit our special school every week in Corby Northamptonshire. The children can't wait for Danny's day they really look forward to it.The school caters for pupils aged 4- 18 years with learning and behaviour difficulties. These problems impact on their learning. Many have difficulty managing their own behaviour, often they have difficulties with their reading and are unable to read at age appropriate levels. Danny curls up with each child who wants to read to him and he listens. He isn't judgemental the children don't feel any pressure. They stroke his head, they tickle his ear as they read their book. Sometimes they don't want to stop, they keep on reading. Danny doesn't mind, if a child want s to read Danny will always listen. The results have been fantastic! Children have become much more fluent and as a result their comprehension improves. But just as important is the improvement in their self confidence and self esteem. They can walk tall, they realise they can do it! Its not just the reading Danny provides a therapeutic support. When a child is in crisis, when they struggle  to control their own actions, Danny is there. He senses it before the adults do. He knows when a child needs help and he's there. Children tell him their problems, the issues, what's troubling them and he helps them to work through the problems, he teaches them to cope and to move on. If a young person is unable to talk to an adult about a problem they will nearly always tell Danny. They know he will listen, they know he won't judge them and most of all they know he can help them. Thank you Danny, thank you so much Tony for giving up your time every week to bring Danny to school. We can't wait for your next visit.
Susan G Komen Breast Cancer Foundation	106012	1	/users/profile/142572	carhughes	General Member of the Public	1	02/04/2012	Horrible decision-making based around a political agenda, spearheaded by Brinker and Handel, both hell bent on causing as much damage to Planned Parenthood, affecting 20% of American women that PP serves.  SGK foundation's recent actions prove they favor politics and militant political agendas of a few niche groups over the health and welfare of millions of women, who need health assistance.
Susan G Komen Breast Cancer Foundation	105989	1	/users/profile/142511	Leanwork	Donor	1	02/03/2012	I've contributed to Susan G Komen Foundation annually for the past 10 years.  My faith in the organization is irrevocably broken- how dare Nancy Brinker and her team withdraw funding for cancer screening for low income women.  How unconscionable for SGK, which as done great work in the PAST pit themselves against Planned Parenthood,. DISHONORABLE and embarrassing for women everywhere.
Susan G Komen Breast Cancer Foundation	105974	1	/users/profile/142486	rehj	Donor	1	02/03/2012	Bad decision to reverse course.  I've donated and supported the organization in the past, but no more.

The executives and the board of directors ought to resign and make room for new people. Restoring funding to Planned Parenthood is the right move, but I've lost confidence in the current leadership.

Humility Of Mary Housing Incorporated	299207		/users/profile/390114	trekgirl777	Client Served	1	08/04/2016	As a struggling single mother of two very young ones, I signed up with HMH back in 2006.  The worker showed me one place only.  Although I wasn't used to living "in in the hood", my options were non existent, so I accepted.  The place was nasty, so I was rather taken aback when I was told that I would have to help clean up vacant places for new residents - something that apparently hadn't been done to my place.  It took three grown women (myself, my sister, and my step-mom) all day to get the grease off the walls in the kitchen.  There were dead  roaches, as well as live ones.  There was no type of assistance, other than the rent being pretty low (although, $350 for the place I was living in was not worth it).  There were no doors inside the house, the bedrooms were just walk throughs.  The other tenants used the back hallway as a garbage room (most of their residents are trashy).  You have to get permission to spend the night else where, and you're not allowed guests past ten pm - which sucked for me because my friends and I all worked third shift.  My worker, who I shall not name, looked as though she hadn't showered in days and hadn't washed her hair in weeks.  Her intelligence was lower than an average pre-schoolers, and all she wanted to do was snoop into my personal life.  I lived there less than 4 months (it was right next to a drug dealer's house), and I will never seek assistance from those fools again. I've tried posting this twice, being told each time that "my review contains inappropriate language".  I'm deleting a four letter word before roaches this time, but oh my god.

The services provided by this organization make a tremendous impact on our community.  Meeting the participants and hearing their success stories is heart warming.  One participant's experience that stands out is going from homeless, to getting a college degree, full-time employment and coming back to HMHI to serve on the development board.  The only thing that would make the program better is unlimited resources for funding so that even more lives can enjoy a "fresh start".

They don't stand over you the whole time your shopping.

Our family helps serve dinner there a couple of times a year.  What I noticed about the mission is how it treats its visitors and volunteers and the general public -- the same.  All are equal in their eyes.  It has made a lasting impression upon my kids by showing the compassion to those that are less fortunate -- inasmuch that they serve in capacities like this on their own.
The Gospel Mission	23793	7	/users/profile/24926	steve	Volunteer	5	12/11/2009	Sioux City Gospel Mission is awsome. I have been involved as a vendor and a volunteer. I have seen men end up at the mission and turn their lives around to be productive members of our society. I have also worked with men who can not be a productive member of our society, and the mission becomes their home. They are all loved and cared for equally, as far as I can see.The Sioux City Gospel mission plays a very important role in our area to reach out to those who are in need. The staff is the BEST.
The Gospel Mission	23792	9	/users/profile/24925	LBauer6	Volunteer	5	12/11/2009	I have been involved with the Sioux City Gospel Mission for the last 5 years.  In that time I have seen Siouxlanders perception of their ministry move from one of "for drunk, down and outers" to realizing "they not only serve the homeless but affect the lives of whole families in this tri-state area".
The Gospel Mission	23784	4	/users/profile/24917	cjoemily	Volunteer	5	12/11/2009	I have  know  about  the  Sioux  City Gospel Mission for  years. Ive  helped  at  the  building  over  the  years  with construction projects  and  currently  serve  on the  board.  The  Gospel mission works  very  diligently to fullfill its  mission of  feeding the  hungry, clothing the poor, sheltering the  homeless  and  leading them  to Christ.  I am  always  impressed  to hear  of the  impact in mens  lives  that result  from the  great  efforts  of  all the  staff  and  God  working thru them   to lend  a  hand  to those    who  need  it  most . The  new programing  recently  added  to  help  the  men  and  women  vocationally  as  well as  spiritual mentorship  will be  another  step  in sharing Gods  love  for  all .
The Gospel Mission	23723	3	/users/profile/24852	John Paul Engel	Volunteer	5	12/10/2009	The Sioux City Gospel Mission offers its hand out to groups in need across our entire community.  I am active in several nonprofit organizations including Junior Achievement, Sioux City Marathon, Local Community Centers and the Gospel Mission and its staff is always willing to lend resources to further the mission of other organizations.  I am particularly impressed by Vernon Meyer of the Gospel Mission for all the programs he has put in place and for his personal mentoring of the homeless.  He is truely an inspiration.  This last fall we were able to make a huge impact for the children of our community by giving away backpacks with school supplies to over 4,000 students.  Many of these students wouldn't have been able to afford the proper supplies to start school.  We were able to insure that they all started school on an equal footing with their peers.  Let me share with you a quick story.  Toward the end of the day we gave away the back packs a young man came up to me and said "I've been walking all day to get here.  I am an Iraqi veteran.  My mother died and now I have nothing. Can you help me."  I helped him get enrolled so he could spend the night and get a drink of waterand he was out there helping us unload the trucks.  The one of the other men started to mentor him and encourage him to think of using the GI bill to get an education.  A month later I stopped by the Mission to pick up some resources for JA that Vernon was loaning us for the day.  I was greated with a big smile by the young man.  He had started to work at the Mission and had secured another job as well.  He had a plan to go out on his own in the next month.  This is just one story.  The Sioux City Gospel Mission is changing lives and giving people, including our veterans, the leg up they need to get back into being productive members of our society.  They are doing God's work and I applaud them for their commitment.  I am a better man for being involved with their efforts.
Outreach Inc	155694		/users/profile/206638	nohunger	Donor	5	04/22/2013	A friend introduced us to Outreach in 2007.  We have witnessed their work and they continue to amaze us with their ability to stretch every contribution dollar.  We feel they are one of the most efficient charities in the U.S.  We are confident they get the greatest benefit from every dollar we contribute.  We have witnessed their work in Tanzania and know they are truly making a difference in the lives of so many children and families. Food, medical support and education will cause a long term change to the recipients.  Since their inception they have provided thousands of children a fighting chance to survive.  They have given them hope for a future and a means by which to grow into productive adults.  We have also seen the support Outreach provides to Americans in need.  Their quick response to the Hurricane Sandy victims was amazing.   They supplied hundreds of thousands of meals just days after the tragic storm.    Outreach supplies food to many different parts of the world and with that food comes hope.   We will continue to support them and encourage others to do so as well.   
Outreach Inc	155686		/users/profile/206626	brigk100	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/22/2013	I have worked with and observed Outreach in action over the last 5 years.  Their goal is to supply humanitarian aid to those with the greatest need.  With years of professional business expertise they operate their non-profit with a keen business model of low cost and efficient operations.  They are responsible for promoting food packaging to many other charities.   They also provide healthy food and humanitarian aid in the United States and to many developing countries around the world.   They organize medical and occupation training missions to benefit the people of Tanzania.   I have attended one medical mission and was able to see firsthand the operation in Tanzania and witness the effects of their efforts.  Children in Singida and Manyoni are healthier and therefore better able to learn. 
Outreach Inc	147297		/users/profile/194597	mfsheahan	Professional with expertise in this field	5	12/26/2012	The Memphis Feeds Initiative (MFI), Memphis, TN is working with Outreach Inc., and The Outreach Program organization since 2010. Our experience has been excellent. They respond above and beyond that which is required. This organization has provided product, equipment and expertise for numerous events throughout the Mid-South area over the past three years (2010-2012) having packaged over 1,000,000 meals. Their packaging standards have been very helpful in assuring our finished meals reach their intended destination both within the United States of America but also throughtout the world. We highly recommend Outreach to any qualified  organization interested in packaging food for the benefit of the hungry, and food insecure people of the world. Clean water is the only component for these meal products to be prepared. Outreach has developed a water purification system program which can be provided to those countries and organizations which do not have such a purfication service available. Thank you Outreach, Union, Iowa! 
Outreach Inc	146919		/users/profile/193975	billkanatas	Volunteer	5	12/18/2012	I first got involved in 2011 with this organization when I helped pack 28,000 meals that we sent to Hurricane sandy victims. I then went to another one of their packing events that resulted in over 100,000 meals that were donated to food insecure Children in Dade County Florida. It was apparent to me at that time that this organization did great things. I asked the organization how my family and I could get more involved and to this date I have been personally involved in packing over 1,600,000 meals!! This organization makes a difference in the world.
Outreach Inc	146916		/users/profile/193968	Chris105	Professional with expertise in this field	5	12/18/2012	I have long been personally involved and financially committed to charities in the US and abroad. There are many very fine organizations providing needed services which I have supported over the years; but in my experience, few have reached the same high level of authenticity, passion, service commitment, and genuine heart-centered care, as Outreach. In fact, I have been so impressed with the quality of the meals that Outreach creates and their impact on the hungry - and the high-impact, transformative energy of the meal packaging experience for those who participate - that my business partner and I have planned and hosted numerous meal packaging events - resulting in over 1.5 million nutritious meals for the hungry and food insecure in this country - and drawing in thousands of volunteers and dozens of partner organizations. And from a personal perspective, working with children, families, seniors, veterans, and so many caring organizations - schools, churches, civic organizations, chambers of commerce, and even corporations - has been illuminating, energizing, and most importantly, joyous!
Outreach Inc	146618		/users/profile/193569	SMART	Advisor	5	12/13/2012	My work with Outreach began as part of a Strategic Planning Team.  Since then it has expanded to include knowledge of their full operation, meal packagings in the U.S. and abroad, and participation in a mission trip to Tanzania.  What strikes me about this organization is their "we'll get it done no matter what" philosophy.  Kathy and Floyd Hammer, who lead Outreach, are extraordinarily selfless individuals, savvy business persons and extreme philanthropists.  I have no idea how many meals they have packaged, shipped and delivered to those in need, but it must be in the millions by now.  Their particular interest is in Singina, Tanzania.  Not only do they bring two medical mission groups there each year who attend to the health and well-being of children, but they also perform dozens of surgeries on both children and adults.  Their work in Tanzania includes building a children's center, a school, a girls' dormitory, a hospital, village water purification systems and more.  Their American staff there has hired and trained Tanzanians to keep these projects working providing jobs and opportunities for families to improve their lives.  The work they do in the U.S. in extraordinary, but the commitment they have made to Singida is literally changing the face of the community and lifting it out of despair and instilling hope for a better future.
Orchard Place	313072	1	/users/profile/404444	lmartino	Board Member	5	10/21/2016	I first became aware of Orchard Place when a friend suggested it for a volunteer opportunity.  Little did I know that over 10 years later I would still be engaged with the organization.  It's because of the important mission, successful outcomes, corporate responsibility, and hard working and committed staff that I keep coming back.  Orchard Place changes the lives of kids and families in central Iowa by providing high quality mental health services.  The organization meets kids where they are whether that be in their school, through outpatient therapy or through the PMIC services for kids in crisis.  This is a wonderful organization which I am proud to serve.    
Orchard Place	306786	1	/users/profile/398085	05jnicole	Board Member	5	09/27/2016	Orchard Place is an organization doing extremely meaningful work in the lives of children and their families across the state of Iowa.  Their work not only solves immediate health concerns for children in crisis but has programs that foster mental health outcomes which keep children functioning in their home and their communities.  I've heard countless testimonies from children whose lives have been forever changed by the people delivering these services at Orchard Place.  That is why I am dedicated to raising awareness for the organization and why I think allocating funds for organizations like this are critical to the health and wellness of our youth.
Orchard Place	304545		/users/profile/395724	IowaProud	Client Served	5	09/14/2016	Orchard Place helps almost 10,000 Iowa kids who have emotional or behavioral issues each year.  Parents who don't know where to turn, need to contact Orchard Place.  I know first-hand that the people at Orchard Place CARE about helping kids and families.  They not only help kids, they help raise awareness with some fantastic events during the year such as the Moonlight Classic, Spelling Bee, Holiday Gift Drive and School Supply Drive.  Treating mental health issues early is the key to providing a better life for today's kids.  They do wonderful work that is having an impact on the future of all Iowans.
Orchard Place	303968	1	/users/profile/395123	kim_bert	Board Member	5	09/13/2016	Several years ago, a friend needed help addressing her daughter's mental health issues. Orchard Place provided her the counseling and support needed to help the daughter make safer choices and cope more effectively. As a result, I learned about Orchard Place and was so impressed that I joined their board. Since that time, I've had many opportunities to interact with staff and leadership, and my admiration for this organization continues to grow.  Raising a son myself, I've known struggling families, and I'm always proud to recommend Orchard Place...and grateful that we have a resource like this in our community. 
Orchard Place	203097	3	/users/profile/264905	IowaMom	Volunteer	5	06/17/2014	As a volunteer at Orchard Place, i was able to see firsthand just how impactful their services are to children and teens in Iowa.

Riders Club of America	297579		/users/profile/388387	bcolton	Volunteer	5	07/21/2016	Hello:I have been a volunteer for Riders Club in Cedar Rapids, IA for about five years now. It is a wonderful organization  for which to volunteer.  The riders I meet are so grateful for the program. The great majority of them are elderly and cannot drive themselves. Because this service is so economical, they call it a "life saver".Brad 
Riders Club of America	297522		/users/profile/388323	Writer	Volunteer	5	07/21/2016	As a volunteer driver for Riders Club,  I routinely hear my riders thanking me for driving them to their appointments, church, the grocery store etc. and telling me how glad they are for such an organization in Cedar Rapids.  One couple has told me that Riders Club is one of the reasons they decided to move to Cedar Rapids.  How cool is that!
Riders Club of America	297521		/users/profile/388322	Writer	Volunteer	5	07/21/2016	We volunteer for Rider's Club, and the people who use the service rave about Rider's Club.  They talk about Rider's Club leadership, and how friendly and helpful they are.  They talk about how valuable the service is to those who can not drive and can not afford Uber or a taxi.  Truly a valuable non-profit for Iowans.

Horizons - A Family Service Alliance	194727		/users/profile/254488	Brett8	Volunteer	5	02/23/2014	Delivering meals to the homebound elderly is a great experience and allows one to give back to the community.  Our family delivers meals at least once a week and finds ways to help in the kitchen or with breakfast bags when we can.  They can always use drivers to help deliver meals.  Businesses also help deliver meals.  The experience teaches my kids the importance of helping those who need help and I'm always amazed at how much the staff gets done with minimal help.  Please look into helping Meals on Wheels once a week or once a month.  
Horizons - A Family Service Alliance	115042		/users/profile/156739	kentmattison	Board Member	5	06/13/2012	I have served as a board member at Horizon's and also as a volunteer delivering meals through Horizons' Meal-On-Wheels Program.  Many of the hundreds of hot meals delivered daily are to home bound elderly widowed women.  In some cases this is the only hot meal they receive.   Horizon's provides consumer credit counseling, including budgeting, debt management to many single mother's that may be jobless or having a very difficult time making ends meet.  They also provide behavioral and mental health counciling.  These services are much needed by women and families.  Getting this help in a responsive manner is getting more difficult, and Horizon's meets this important need which is too often overlooked.
Horizons - A Family Service Alliance	114836		/users/profile/156467	TimKintner	Board Member	5	06/12/2012	From my board experience with Horizons, I have seen first hand how the variety of services they offer provide instrumental support to women of all ages.  Their meals on wheels program supports the dietary and safety needs of elderly women.  The mental health and financial counseling services serve primarily younger and middle-aged women.  Horizons is unique in that they provide this broad-based variety of support services. In addition, the delivery of these services is done very effectively through passionate staff who are sensative to delivering these services efficiently and effectively.

I am always so impressed at the care and compassion of the staff and the important role they play in supporting families. Thanks, Horizons, for all you do! 
A Call To Serve Ministries of Iowa	111749		/users/profile/152154	Jesse B.	Volunteer	5	05/10/2012	The best part of my experience with ACTS was the feeling of making a difference in the community.  While working at ACTS, I helped develop a Marion County resource directory for community members and helped an old woman move into her new town in Pella.  Both of these projects were extremely rewarding and made me feel great about the things going on at ACTS.  I knew I was making a difference in Pella by helping others, which was rewarding because I had not had the chance to serve people in the community in this way since entering Central College.  Knowing that someone may use the directory I helped create to find help in their lives for financial reasons, health reasons, or other specific needs made me feel great about my work at ACTS.  I think ACTS is a great nonprofit organization and will definitely consider it for an internship in the future!

I had a terrific experience working with this organization! ACTS truly lives out the Christian faith in this community. ACTS gives people who want to serve the opportunity to help those in need and provides services to people who need assistance in the community.  The biggest part that impacted me about ACTS is that they are really trying to find the best way to help people. They are trying to work with other non-profits in the area and local churches to become aware of all of the resources in the community to be able to direct people in need to the right place. They are using their own time and resources to organize this collaboration among ministries in the area. They also don't just help the people they serve; they are committed to keeping relationships with the people. The staff is great to work with and are dedicated people to their job and to their faith. They are such a blessing to this community!

A Call To Serve Ministries of Iowa	65373		/users/profile/71461	jpbbennett	Board Member	5	02/09/2011	We created ACTS in 2006 out of a simple idea--- how can we do more to serve others in the communities we live in, and do it in a way that shows the love of Christ.  Once we began serving, others got involved and the snowball began to build.  Nearly 5 years later ACTS has been able to help hundreds of families, organizations, and communities by sharing the God-given talents and skills volunteers have with those who need a hand.  We hope you'll consider joining us on an upcoming service opportunity and be a part of what God is doing in central Iowa.

She has also helped with the care of sick kittens that I have found.  One kitten was found in the poring rain, soaking wet and very dehydrated.  She was very near death.  I took her to Tracy who gave her fluids and put her in an incubator for a week where she recovered and has now been placed in her forever home!  Tracy is compassionate, knowledgeable, and works harder than anyone else I know.  This world is a better place because of her and her passion for animals!
Wildthunder Wildlife and Animal Rehabilitation and Sanctuary	320508		/users/profile/413142	Julie288	Client Served	5	12/26/2016	The morning after a windstorm I found, on the ground under a tall tree, a tiny baby squirrel.  She was cold, and close to death.  I called the county game warden, hoping to find help.  I was referred to Tracy Belle.  I filled two pop bottles with hot water, wrapped them in towels, and put the baby on them while transporting the baby to her.  Tracy knew what to do, and the baby pulled through.  A few weeks later, "Rocky" was released back into our neighborhood.  She grew up, and has plenty of offspring populating our area.  She may still be in the mix.  It's impossible to know, because Tracy raised her right---growing into an adult WILD squirrel.   It has been a joy to grow to know Tracy and watch her work with sick, wounded, and abandoned animals.  She is gifted in her ability to earn their trust.  Wildthunder Wars will remain a place that I have complete confidence in referring others to.  
Meals From The Heartland	260451		/users/profile/349034	CommentonIowa	General Member of the Public	1	09/30/2015	Uses child labor, child fundraisers, and even prison labor and prisoners raising funds.  Seemingly good at pulling in schools and churches.  Lack of mechanization for packaging that would increase production and cleanliness increases expenses.  Failure to reveal where raw materials are purchased from and who owns those businesses leads one to be highly suspicious of this organization. Few raw materials seem to be available from the agriculture state in which they are registered.  Unknown nutritional supplement added at some point.  Seems to require clean water to be useful for the end recipients.  Broad destination objectives seem to show lack of focus. Haiti, Africa, or food banks in Iowa?   Be suspicious.

The envelope was soaked through and my seeds got wet. I dried them out until I was ready to plant. None of them germinated. I sent SSE and email and explained what happened, just so they would be aware that the packaging was NOT  waterproof and my seeds had molded from the rain that soaked the envelope. They emailed me back within a couple days stating they were sending me out replacement seeds. I had only purchased 3 or 4 packets for a very small backyard garden. I was blown away with their promptness, especially because I hadn't contacted them with the intention of getting replacement product. I love what they stand for and I will definitely do business with them again!

Hopeful Africa Inc	286651		/users/profile/376721	Casie_T	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	The Power of EducationI give to Hopeful Africa because I believe in the power of education to foster sustainable prosperity around the world. Hopeful Africa works to do just that through educational development and equal partnership. I have had the great opportunity to volunteer on the Executive Team as the Social Media Manager of the nonprofit for over two years, and it has been the most rewarding two years of my life thus far. Last May Hopeful Africa hosted their annual celebration event Hope Night, of which I helped plan and promote. The exec team spent months and months of planning and fundraising leading up to the event. It was a huge success. We had 200+ attendees, which was double than the year prior, and we raised $12,000 in that single two hour event. Again, doubling our funds from the year prior. This was definitely a collaborative event for all team members, and I was so overcome with reward and fulfillment following the event. The success of Hope Night 2015 shows how team work and passion can make a world of difference for an organization. The funds raised at the event went directly to supporting the programs at our seven partner schools in Kenya. I have stuck with Hopeful Africa for many years because it was easy to see the impact that we were making as an organization.
Hopeful Africa Inc	286650		/users/profile/376720	Moses_B	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	It all started in 2006 when I relocated back to the United State from Kenya, Africa. I saw the disparity between the education system I grew up in and the education system that I was a part of in West Des Moines, Iowa. In order to create educational opportunities for the youth, Kenya introduced free primary education in Kenya. However, there were some unexpected consequences with the dramatic enrollment increases. Teachers became overwhelmed, resources were exhausted, and ultimately the quality of education was compromised. In 2008, I decided something needed to be done, so I started a club at my high school. With the funds raised, we were able to provide educational resources for a school in Nakuru, Kenya. Little did I know what would follow. Hopeful Africa has grown tremendously in the last seven years, from a simple high school club to a successful nonprofit organization receiving support from across the state of Iowa and beyond. Through Hopeful Africas efforts, over $90,000 has been invested at seven schools in Kenya benefiting over 3,000 students. We have provided 5,231 books, 27 computers, 143 high school scholarships, and 18 teachers, just to name a few. We have created several high school and college clubs, hosted numerous fundraising and awareness events, and built a team of passionate individuals to champion our cause. The investments at our partner schools have paid off too: test scores have increased, school rankings have soared, teacher to student ratios have decreased, graduation rates have improved, and enrollment in secondary schools has increased. This past summer I had the opportunity to hear a story of one of the lives that we have impacted. I met a grandmother of one of the students that we sponsored. She shared that she had searched for months for support for her granddaughter but all was in vain. Then one day her granddaughter came back home and shared that she was selected for our scholarship program. She fell on her knees and thanked God for this miracle. She continued to say, My hope is that my granddaughter and other sponsored students can continue their education, go away to college, and one day return to better their community with the education they've been given.' It is in moments like this and people like her that I get the inspiration to continue to serve. These past seven years have been a story of dreams becoming reality. The impact on the lives of thousands of students was previously unimaginable for a such a small club. I believe this is where passion plays such a key role though, because I have continually and shamelessly shared my story with others, they have taken root in our cause, and our impact has grown tremendously. Even though the need is urgent and dire, I am continually inspired by the people I work with and the lives that we are changing in the communities that we serve. This story is just the beginning of what the future holds.

Brotherhood Of Christ Church	302477	1	/users/profile/393612	Writer	Former staff	4	09/02/2016	I lived the first 25 of my 28 years in this community. I saw, experienced, and lived it through the eyes of a child, a teenager, and young adult.  I look back at this large portion of my life with pride and  gratitude. I was taught all the things and given all the tools, both through negative and positive experiences, to tackle any challenge or joy life should choose to toss my way. As a member of society at large now, I have a deeper appreciation for what my community gave me than I ever did when I lived there. I see the young people, the children, that came from this place, they are all, without exception, outstanding characters. We were raised well, by loving parents that put every ounce of energy into bringing up a generation of loving, responsible people. Their success, in my observations, was due largely to the positive pressures of community ideals. Parents had pressure to perform at a higher level, (though admittedly this was not always done in the most effective, caring or responsible way). As children, we had peer pressure continuously, to do the right thing. I have a lot of rough memories too. It wasn't all fun and games. But when it comes right down to it, I have to look at the ultimate product that it gave, the children born and raised there. That is ultimately what I use to judge the character of the community as a whole. A good society will produce good offspring. While individuals had agendas to push, politics to play and points to make, the final and most important goal, to raise upright children, was a complete success. My memories I hold dear, all of them. My experiences in life have made me a strong man, a loving father, caring husband, and responsible, honest person, and in this I owe thanks to the Brotherhood of Christ Community, the memories of which I will cherish for my life time.

Leonard and Doris Edwards said Livingston told them their grandchild would be deformed if they left the community, and told another relative to beware a recurrence of cancer if she left. "He's pulling every string," said Leonard Edwards. "He's the best I've ever seen at it. I hope I never see another one." Their son lived on the land for two years before leaving in 1990 after his wife suffered from epilepsy. He claims the episode was caused by the stress of life in the community, where women are under particular pressure not to fall behind in doing traditional tasks such as the laundry and cooking without any modern conveniences.

I was drawn to the organization because they are the only group I know of that works to connect low-income individuals with fresh, local, organically produced vegetables and fruits, while educating families about farming, food, and the land.  I have seen firsthand the astonishing amount of work that goes into this all-volunteer organization.  I would encourage anyone who can to devote some time to LFC to help them fulfill their mission of providing fresh, local produce to people in need.  There is always a need for extra hands in the office, on farm days, and for community events.  LFC, thank you for your hard work in making our community a more just and welcoming place to live.  I have seen firsthand the difference that LFC makes in client families' lives.
Adopt-A-Family Local Foods Connection	23203	1	/users/profile/24279	ericnost	Former Volunteer	5	12/02/2009	I have known Local Foods Connection for over a couple of years now. I first helped out in the summer of 2007 when I accompanied families in the program who receive CSA shares out to the farms which supply the produce.Most of these families, especially the children, had little experience with farms. These trips, then, became an amazing interactive learning experience in which the farmer(s) delightfully answered any and all questions. In driving the families out to the farms, I had the opportunity to hear how grateful they were to have the shares, because it allowed them to eat more nutritiously. And in some cases, I had the opportunity to hear the personal stories that really emphasized the necessity of programs like LFC.My experience with LFC that summer led me (with some help from LFC) to start a similar program  in Grinnell, IA. We have purchased CSA shares from local farmers for area families for two summers now. It has been a tough project for us to coordinate, because we've been working with disadvantaged families who have little access to transportation and who sometimes have multiple jobs. But that just goes to show how inspiring it is that LFC continues to be successful and to help more families. I know that there is much more work to be done when it comes to building a just (local) foods system in Iowa and LFC is the group to do it.

ANIMAL WELFARE FOUNDATION OF IOWA	169750		/users/profile/224977	MyBusiness	Volunteer	4	09/14/2013	Ive been a volunteer with Animal Welfare Foundation of Iowa for 9 years. In addition, to being a volunteer, I was also a board member for several years. During that time, the financial information provided was not very specific and how it was reported made one question how well the financials were being handled.  During my time on the board, a change in officers took place. A few members that were involved from the organizations inception stepped down. After this occurred, an audit was conducted on the past two years financials. The new board members were saddened and upset about what was found. Personally, I was always proud to be a volunteer for this organization, but after learning the findings of the audit I was sickened and felt betrayed. I really trusted and admired the previous leaders.  In addition, all of us true hardily believe this organization really did put 100% of the money raised towards AWFs pets it rescued.  In the end, the shakeup in officers has truly turned this organization around for the better. The organization now has a Board of Directors who performs random audits and the financials are taken care of in a professional manner. They also have a professional bookkeeper and a chain of command which prevents shady spending, lost records, etc. This has in turn, created a more trusting organization. One you can count that when they say 100% of the money raised goes only towards the animals, it goes for only Animal Welfare Foundation of Iowas animals it rescues and not for someone elses personal gain or to take care of their irresponsibly large group of personal pets. This is a good organization who is working to better their community and change things for the better. I have no doubt when I donate money now that Im really donating to the animals they are saving.  Animal Welfare Foundation of Iowa is now truly a GREAT NONPROFIT!
Iowa Parrot Rescue	243019		/users/profile/329636	BLRM	Client Served	5	05/14/2015	This rescue started in 1999 and one of the most successful in the US and is  inspected yearly by the state.   I wandered into that rescue looking for a cockatoo a couple years ago and assumed all rescues were like this one.....and I was really wrong.  This rescue is self sufficient and loves volunteers and all adopters sign a contract that if their life changes and they cannot keep the adopted bird, then it will go  back to Iowa Parrot Rescue.   I adopted my Kenny the Cockatoo from this rescue and have no regrets.

Restoring Hope International	289390	2	/users/profile/379636	Pappanie	Donor	5	05/11/2016	Restoring Hope is an awesome organization that focuses on meeting the needs of orphans in Africa.  The need is great and the people of RHI sacrifice to get your support on the ground where it is needed most.

Noahs Ark Foundation Inc	48726	1	/users/profile/49902	connie13	Client Served	5	07/26/2010	I was introduced to this great animal shelter by one of my friends who used to run this shelter and though she has since changed jobs, she is still very active there.  This no-kill rescue shelter does an excellent job of taking in dogs and cats that have been abandoned, found, unable to be cared for by their owners, etc. They are a hard working, compassionate group of people who act on behalf of these animals to try and find them their "Forever Homes" and they do this most efficiently and effectively. They are partners with the Petsmart Store in Clive, IA where they take any adoptable kittens and cats so they receive better exposure and so increase their chances of being adopted. They are also associated with the Rescue Wagon program, whereby most of the dogs that aren't adopted from their shelter are picked up and taken to a larger metropolitan area which also increases their chance of finding homes.  The cleanliness of this shelter is unbelievable considering the amount of puppies they sometimes have. They follow a very rigorous system in order to maintain this level. They have many volunteers who appear to me to be more than happy to donate their time cleaning, walking the dogs and helping with the never ending task of fund raising. The animals brought into this shelter are all checked for medical problems, vaccinated and spaded/neutered before they are put up for adoption. And this is just what I am aware of for I know they do so much more for the community of Fairfield-animals of the human persuasion included! I am very impressed and very happy with the new four legged friend they helped me to find.

We chose ChildServe because the child care provider we were using before had high school students taking care of the kids in the afternoon, and they were awful. ChildServe does not do this. They have well trained, attentive adults that care a lot about the kids they care for, and they don't switch them out with high school kids in the afternoon. They also follow your lead when your trying to do something like potty training, which is very helpful. My daughters current Lead teacher is awesome, and I feel good driving away as I go to work.

Backyard Abundance	123946	1	/users/profile/168712	Carol61	Client Served	1	09/30/2012	The landscaper charged $1180 for a landscape plan only, and apparently felt his role and responsibility was finished after receiving the check. It took hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars of plants to implement. No information was given about where to obtain many of the highly unusual plants. Not even the local nurseries could find them. Sea kale was in the plan, when I finally found one internet source, I find out that it needs at least a Zone 7, not a Zone 5. The rain garden location did nothing for the flooding in the back of the yard after a heavy rain. The aronia bushes and blueberry bushes died because of their prescribed location in the shade. There was a large area, approximately 1200 square feet that I planted in a beautiful herbal groundcover--coreopsis, creeping thyme, oregano, foam flower, lovage, asters, yarrow, and so forth. Unfortunately, the plan also included a perennial "white clover" (trifolium replens) to be planted between them. The groundcover looked splendid until cooler temperatures, when the clover became so aggressive, the runners, legs, with long, long roots, took over all the expensive groundcover. Unfortunately, the designer and executive of this nonprofit, has stalled in taking responsibility. As much as I am a supporter of ecological landscaping, I feel greatly let down. I paid a lot of money for his expertise. He certainly had good intentions, however his knowledge was lacking. I still support his mission, however his business practices need great improvement.

Art Life Society Inc	286967		/users/profile/377039	Natasha_F	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	Breaking Open our Piggy BanksHaving kids has been a big curb on my activism. Im not one of the mothers who was dragging my kids to protests in a sling or a stroller. I was lucky if I made it to the playground. For the past few years my focus has been homewards. Its natural, I know, but lately I have felt more ready. Ready to act in a way I havent been for a long time.Good thing because I am in Europe, and Europe is in crisis. This past month I have been flung, (or have flung myself) into direct action with local Syrian families near my home in the Languedoc Region of France. My friends and family all know this as Ive been posting and emailing updates here and there, requesting funds, sharing petitions and heart wrenching accounts from the trenches of other regions. Im online a fair amount for my work, but most of the times Im pretty strict with myself around when is family time and when I can be on my phone or computer. Not recently.This means, of course, that I have barely done the dishes in a month. Barely played Chutes and Ladders (ok, I dont mind either of these.) My husband has picked up the most of the slack, picking up the kids from school and not picking up a lot of crap in the living room. And while Ive been woefully neglecting my privileged little kiddos, I am reminded of how much they learn by watching and listening to us.My seven year old has been deeply curious about the work Ive been involved in lately. Like youd expect, I get a lot of questions. And most of them are right on.Why cant we just give them a home? How long does a war last? Mom, why dont we just take them shopping so they can choose their own groceries.? Cant they just give us a shopping list so we make sure to get the food they like?And this morning as she crawled into bed with me for a cuddle, the first thing out of her mouth, Mom, how many refugee children are there? Why sweetheart? In the world or in Bziers?Here, in Bziers.about 1520 I think, why?Because I want to share my money with the kids.I headed down to make my first coffee of the morning, and shortly after she traipsed into the kitchen with a plastic bag with half of her piggy bank. She had convinced her little brother to share half of his too, no small feat. A few hours later I delivered the ten euros in change to my neighbor who was driving up to Als with one of the families we had met in Bziers. They had just received government housing and my kids had met their kids last week. Five euros each my daughter instructed me, for my new friends to buy something they like in their new home.We hear a lot of about how we need to disconnect and pay attention to our kids. But what about when we are connected because were connecting with something larger than ourselves, larger than our own immediate families. Were giving them a chance to see beyond their own houses. To understand that they can share what they have. That the world isnt always fair but they can do their part to make it better. And if not, as one of my colleagues here said, We can always start a Facebook group for these poor, neglected kids.

Washington County Humane Society	228082		/users/profile/291784	rhondascritters33	Volunteer	4	10/27/2014	I have been volunteering at W.C.H.S. for over 3 years now. It is locally known as PAWS (Providing Animals With Shelter) & More Animal Shelter. It was started by a lady who convinced a business to allow her to put cages in the back of their shed for her to keep the animals in. A few years ago they were able to buy what was a building used for crafting & with much remodeling & building, have built a small, but significant, shelter for the community. They rescue, treat, heal, adopt, & most of all, love the animals they take in. Most of the population they take in are, of course, dogs & cats, but have also had birds & rabbits since I have been there. Even a baby turkey once. As is the case with all shelters, funds are badly needed & hard to get. The director is constantly filling out applications for grants to make much needed improvements for the welfare of the animals (& staff). Much has been done & much more needs to be done. Currently the number of animals has exceeded the number of cages, but room is always made for more, even if it involves putting up portable kennels until room is available. This is a very well kept & clean facility and I have been to many shelters to judge by. The staff is friendly & willing to help possible adopters in any way. I am happy & proud to volunteer at PAWS & More & hope to continue for years to come.

Central Iowa Bible Camp	97072		/users/profile/113504	JenDfromIA	Volunteer	5	09/01/2011	My children have enjoyed the benefits of the camp since we moved to Earlham in 2005. The camp serves not just the local community but anyone wanting to attend. I have volunteered at the camp for a week at a time the last two years. I have also had the pleasure of working with, serving with, & living in the community with the camp director & his family as well. Annually a camp clean up is scheduled in the spring which involves an enormous amount of community involvement to get the camp ready to host the summer activities. The camp is consistently making improvements & updates. Many testimonies & baptisms have been shared here.

Self-Help International	118099	3	/users/profile/160613	xcrunner9	Volunteer	5	07/11/2012	As an intern with Self Help International and after traveling to Ghana to see the work Self Help has done, I am grateful for the experience here. A rather small non-profit in terms of staff, this fact holds no weight when compared to the impact that I saw first-hand in Ghana. With hundreds of beneficiaries and thousands of dollars loaned out every period, to say Self Help impacts lives would be a bit of an understatement. These women are so grateful for the loans, because the loan opens doors for themselves, but also their families, that would otherwise not be afforded to them. Women are able to send their kids to school, build a new shop for their selling or cooking, and provide healthy meals for the children. Stories of success are common in Ghana and Nicaragua but Self Help does not stop there. They have tirelessly worked to receive grants to building training centers in Ghana and Nicaragua to teach more efficient farming techniques and provide educational classes in raising animals, crops, and other plants. 
National Czech & Slovak Museum & Library	99793	1	/users/profile/120973	Rebecca23456789	Volunteer	5	10/27/2011	I recently performed a service learning project for my Museum Studies certificate at the University of Iowa. I worked with the marketing department and was given full license to work with the raw data provided to me, in order to create a professional and comprehensive presentation. I greatly appreciated the opportunity, and look forward to working with the NCSML in the future. The Museum is currently in an interim location, but do not let that deter you as a visitor or volunteer.

YOUTH EMERGENCY SERVICES & SHELTER OF IOWA	286609	1	/users/profile/376679	Chad_D2	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	A child's futureWho will help when their family cannot or will not?   Y.E.S.S will but they cannot do it alone and I am happy I have been able to help them for many years (http://www.yessiowa.org/).  About 8 years ago a friend of mine was heavily involved with their Duck Derby fund raising event and other activities at Y.E.S.S.   Initially I helped him with the Derby, donated goods, and some money.  When I dropped off the donations I toured the facility a few times and got to know more about what Y.E.S.S does.   From there, I went from helping now and then to making it my own personal cause.  Not only have I had the pleasure of helping with money, food, and gifts, I recently started volunteering weekly as a Therapy Dog handler.  Jager, my 178 pound Labrador Retriever/Rottweiler mix, provides the kids who participate with unconditional love and helps bring a sense of normalcy. This is a welcome distraction for children who are away from home under oftentimes scary and unpleasant circumstances.What I like most about Y.E.S.S. is also the reason I have stuck with them over the years and the reason I plan to continue my support.  They are there to help those who are not in a position to help themselves.  In other words it is not just a hand-out and a pat on the back on the way out the door.  They not only provide for the immediate and most pressing needs such as food and shelter --  they go further to address the root of the problem and help the child get through a difficult time in his or her life.  My hope is the help provided, lessons learned, and the support received pays dividends throughout the childs life. Why am I telling my story to you?  I, and others like me, can only help so much. Placing first, second or third at #MyGivingStory would help Y.E.S.S do even more.    
Homes 4 My Peeps	195413		/users/profile/255441	Tyrie B.	General Member of the Public	5	03/09/2014	I think this is outstanding process to bring the community together once again, with taking the hood out of the term being used today and restoring the true meaning of the word neighborhood. To see such a none profit organization step up to rebuild the neighborhood  in which african americans and other nationalites live, without seeking the praise like other organizations do to seek praise for rebuilding home for folks who are less income savvy. To restructure homes in the neighborhood and to teach home owner hot to maintain thier homes and how to make the land useful in other ways of better living. 
Promise 4 Paws Dog Rescue Inc.	273548	1	/users/profile/362791	Megan104	Volunteer	5	12/02/2015	Promise 4 Paws is an amazing place. They give sanctuary to older dogs who had trouble getting adopted at local shelters. They provide the dogs with a warm home, a huge fenced in yard, and all the love and affection they could want. Donations and volunteers are always welcome and I personally recommend volunteering. You get to spend the day with the sweetest dogs alive, and learn different skills, like how to handle medications and feeding time with a large amount of dogs. This nonprofit is perfect for anyone who loves dogs and wants to make a difference in their lives.

TIGERACAT RESCUES	72928		/users/profile/79725	MLarson	Board Member	4	02/22/2011	I've been with TigeraCat Rescues since its beginning.  I am consistently amazed at how well it has performed with the dedicated work of volunteers and supporters.  TigeraCat has continued to gain local support as more people learn first-hand the dedication of its volunteer staff and the high-quality of care it gives to the animals it serves. TigeraCat Rescues has continued to gain community support, expand services, avoid euthanazia, and help more animals without incurring huge amounts of debt.  I believe this shows its volunteer staff's dedication to making frugal but responsible financial decisions with its donors money.   TigeraCat's donors don't want their money spent on salaries or going into someone elses pocket.  They expect the funds to help save cats & kittens.  And since TigeraCat has no paid staff, funds go directly towards providing proper care of the animals!

Freedom Homes Of The Qcz Inc	2464	1	/users/profile/3949	mastersoulsearcher	General Member of the Public	1	01/12/2009	this is a poorly run organization that should be checked out by the city and state.  they are supposed to be a christian based nonprofit helping those with drug and alcohol problems. they have no qualified expert trained staff on hand.  they have residents in all their buildings that pay them rent is all. they should really be checked out for compliance to their articles of incorp. and their non profit status.
Raising Readers In Story County	72131		/users/profile/78871	Carolyn Jons	Board Member	5	02/21/2011	In 2004 I was one of 13 board members who saw urgent early childhood literacy needs and founded the nonprofit organization that became Raising Readers in Story County. We've made impressive strides toward our mission of improving language and literacy development in children from birth to eight years of age and nurturing healthy parent-child relationships. For example, one of our main programs is Reach Out and Read, a national model that promotes early literacy and school readiness. The first year we partnered with 6 local pediatricians. We donated 500 books which they gave to 6-month-olds at their checkups. Our program quickly became popular with both families and healthcare professionals. Now Raising Readers annually provides over 9,000 books that are given county-wide to children ages 6-months to 5 years. The doctors encourage parents to read with their children every day, and parents report on our annual surveys they are reading more at home. In 2009 Story County received the first Bookend County Award from the Reach Out and Read National Center for having 100% of primary care physicians participating in the program. Raising Readers has also developed a unique Books and More program featuring a series of parent education offerings. We train volunteers to help share the curricula with families. Participants have praised these classes, saying they gained confidence in their parenting skills, increased their literacy-related activities, and enhanced bonding with their children. Our third major program area involves partnering with human service agencies, faith communities, and other groups who work directly with families at risk. Raising Readers volunteers visit their sites, read to children, and give families books to take home. We are a cost-effective volunteer-driven organization, and we contract for expertise as needed. Typically, a full 90% of our funds go to directly serve families. Individuals, service groups, corporations, foundations, and grantors invest in Raising Readers in Story County in order to be partners in effectively addressing low literacy in our country. On behalf of our dedicated board and volunteers, I can promise anyone who would consider supporting us that we will stretch every penny and use your donations wisely on proven programs.
Cedar House Shelter Inc	193109	3	/users/profile/252225	Barbarah510	General Member of the Public	1	01/25/2014	My daughter, 38 years old, with Asperger's Disorder, was made to leave Cedar House Shelter on Wednesday, January 22nd at 8:30pm by the staff manager, Curtis. The temperature outside was zero degrees and blowing snow. She and the manager had an argument and despite the fact she had sixteen days of paid lodging remaining he told her she was being evicted immediately. He refused to have a conversation when my husband called and hung up stating he did not have to explain himself to anyone or us. The police were very kind and told our daughter she could stay in the police station lobby until morning. She is being assisted by ARC of East Central Iowa and they were able to find a place for her to stay the night to which the police drove her. The next morning my husband called Curtis asking to him to return the money to our daughter for the rent. He refused, stating she had signed an agreement that money would not be refunded and again hung up on my husband. One of the reasons our daughter was at Cedar House Shelter was because she has not been able or capable of finding employment, had been recently divorced by her husband and has no income to obtain lodging. We, her parents, have only been able to send small amounts of money. One hundred and twenty dollars does not seem like a large amount of money, but for someone who has none, it is huge!We understand that her Asperger's greatly affects her social and communication skills, but to evict her in the dark and cold because she "can't keep her mouth shut!" is unforgivable, cruel, and heartless. We believe that situations like this should be investigated and that only those who have understanding of mental health issues be allowed to manage these shelters.********A conversation I had with the house manager, Curtis, shortly after my daughter began her stay gives a sad commentary to how much "power" this gentleman feels he wields. He told me that he works many long hours and keeps this shelter running and he has the complete backing of (I don't recall if it was the Director, the Board of Directors, or whom). He stated he had been the recipient of many complaints but "he (Director? a member of the Board?) has told me that what I say goes and he supports all my decisions, so nobody should mess with me, because it won't do them any good. I even get invited to special events .**************************

Iowa City Public Library Friends Foundation	316991		/users/profile/408183	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	10/30/2016	We only contribute now to this organization because it sends prompt thank you letters no matter the size of our gift, and they always have a note from the library development person who tells us what we're impacting.

FOR GODS CHILDREN INTERNATIONAL A NON PROFIT CORPORATION	113000		/users/profile/153778	TimeDesigns08	Volunteer	5	05/25/2012	I did part of my teaching internship in 2008 with this organization. I helped at a kids camp in Romania teaching various orphan group throughout the summer how to pray. It was a fantastic experience that changed my life. This organization is dedicated to helping those cast aside by society. Many of these kids were malnourished, had experienced abuse of some sort and barely had enough supplies to last them the week they were there. It burdened my heart to help them when I returned home. I began sending resources and money to the ministry. On that note I appreciate FGCI because I saw first hand where the money was going. The government system is still very corrupt so those traveling over would often pack light to pack the supplies needed for the kids. It was a good feeling knowing the clothing and toys I sent were actually reaching the children. This experience wasn't just for that summer it has continued for me. I am still in contact with one of the children four years later. This ministry has changed my life and furthered my desire to help those in need. Upon graduatuiion from Bible College I decided to go for my masters in social work to continue helping this group.  I'm now going into grant writing to help this ministry meet the needs of the children they help :) on a larger scale. If you have any desire or passion for children I would definitely recommend looking into their work. Their website is www.fgci.org  Highly recommended! I'm still working with the director so I have put 2012 down as my last interaction. 
Habitat For Humanity International Inc	127940	1	/users/profile/173050	cp2012	Volunteer	5	10/23/2012	This was an amazing organization to volunteer for. Habitat for Humanity in general is great but I had the opportunity to volunteer in Waterloo. I came to Waterloo with a school service trip during my spring break and loved it! They provided lunch and lodging for the week and we were able to meet the staff there. They also organized for us to go watch a hockey game. The contractors were very patient with our group of novice home-builders- some of us have never hammered a nail before but by the end of the week, we were power saw masters. The people we met and worked with were just so grateful, it made hammering in light rain and standing all day so much better. The best part had to be seeing the progress on the house after just a week.
Books From Bobby Inc	289802		/users/profile/380056	Writer	Volunteer	5	05/13/2016	Though a relatively new organizations, Books From Bobby has made its imprint on Des Moines Public Schools.

There is so much work to be done to close the gap on illiteracy and Books From Bobby is pose to do its part in filling that gap.

YWCA - Clinton	168785	3	/users/profile/223754	LJLF	Volunteer	5	09/10/2013	The YWCA Clinton is an incredible nonprofit because of the work they do and the effect they have on the lives of survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault and homelessness.  Their childcare and fitness center and classes is second to none in the Clinton community.  The YWCA Team of staff and board  make sure their mission, "eliminating racism, empowering women and promoting peace, justice, freedom and dignity for all" is central to everything they do.  I would challenge anyone to find a nonprofit who is more worthy of their time and their financial support.  I am very proud of this local organization.
