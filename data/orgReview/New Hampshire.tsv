LostNMissing, Inc	250182	1	/users/profile/338014	Alicia48	Volunteer	5	07/27/2015	I have been helping a man search for his missing sister, Tammy Sue Clements who went missing in 1980 at age 15. This gentleman is uncertain how to navigate these terrible waters. I reached out to MANY organizations with what info I had- trying to get this little lost girl out there where her voice could be heard. She had not even had a missing persons report filed- ever. The organization Lostnmissing was the fist organization to help me- to help us I should say. Through them Tammy had her first flier made, and we were finally able to start posting her to many different pages. We had great difficulty in getting the NCIC number so that this little girl could be listed at sites such as doenetwork and namus. Lostnmissing not only took our report, but helped us gain the ncic number from a small town police department who were reluctant to give it to family. Their advocacy for the lost has helped us immensely and inspired me to continue working with families,  knowing I have them to aid me.

The dedication of these people, is above and beyond. My own daughter volunteered, who passed away in May. She worked endless hours posting to help families, identify John and Jane Doe's, and those missing for years. The agony of families, cases long forgot by police, and these families need closure and peace, and these folks with Lostnmissing wont stop till every lost soul is found, and closure is final.

I pray that you never have a loved one go missing, but if you do, I pray that the resources of LostNMissing be available for you.  From creating FB pages to identifying resources for billboards, this organization made me feel as if I was the only client served and all along held my heart with genuine concern and empathy.  Even after my son's remains were recovered, they checked in to see how I was doing. You have no idea how simple kindness can help a grieving heart.  Thank you LostNMissing: you provided resources, hope and kindness in my darkest hour.

They had created missing posters, and contacted me to ask if we would like the story published the story on their site. Cynthia collected the information needed to give a complete and accurate description and everyone from the organization were very compassionate, caring and helpful. They were prepared to do whatever it took to make sure the story was out there. The organization had many contacts available for us for news organizations and offered to help set up interviews. Cynthia offered a ton of great advice from searching to making public statements. She helped provide tips and potential leads to the police and was constantly searching for information leading to the recovery of my sister. The staff at LostNMissing created a facebook page to spread awareness and were vigilant in monitoring it for any leads. I can't thank them enough for their help, prayers, compassion and care. This is a truly wonderful group of people! Drew Bradshaw

We need more people like them in the world. I contacted the Sacramento Police and told them about my missing brother but they didn't do anything at all. They didn't at least follow their procedures of listing him as a missing person who is mentally disable and unable to feed himself with no where to sleep. lostnmissing got on the task and thanks to the team, we have found my brother. Thanks again Cynthia and April!

They are by far the most organized, detail oriented, and steadfast non profit that I had the pleasure of getting involved with. They just took the bull by the horns and did what needed to be done and for nothing in return. I cannot express how grateful we are that when the media, law enforcement and people let you down a total stranger walks in to lift your  faith in humanity. At our lowest point in our lives Cynthia Caron came into it and gave us hope and showed us compassion in our situation. I would highly recommend their site to anyone that is in dire need of help.

When my nephew was missing, they made a poster that i could share on facebook, helped me through the registration and then created a facebook page dedicated to finding him.  They also shared the poster and page and began registering him as missing on NamUs and other reputable sited dedicated to finding missing persons.  As I was sharing the facebook page, and saw my friends liking and sharing both the page and poster, I received a message that my nephew had made contact with a friend... a few hours later I spoke to him and found him to be safe and sound.  All the lovely people who work for LostNMissing were wonderfully communicative and emotionally supportive throughout.  Thank-you, with all my heart!!!Kathi

You did an outstanding job in your communications and in giving us strength during this  difficult time.  We cannot praise enough the Lost and Missing organization and the wonderful people I met who  are dedicating their time and resources to help families such as mine in desperate and heartbreaking  situations. Your organization brought immeasurable comfort and strength to my family. This sad experience has raised our awareness of this organization and its miraculous power to help  families such as ours survive an unfortunate crisis. The goodness and generosity of the folks from Lost  and Missing who worked with us has brought us much peace and comfort and will remain in our hearts  forever. Thank you for holding us together.  With heartfelt gratitude, The Mundo Family

We as a family were so distraught, with NO where to turn but LostNMissing, Inc. showed us empathy, compassion and most of all honesty! They assisted with fliers, communication, support and even opened a blog to raise more awareness of Carla's MISSING status. To say they went the extra mile would be an understatement.  In March of 2013, I decided to offer my services as an advocate for MISSING persons. It has been cathartic for me to be able to help other families in need. I will continue to Volunteer for LostNMissing, Inc. for years to come, as this organization always puts the family first. I am proud to represent this amazing organization as a Volunteer. Unfortunately, to date (feb 2014) Carla is still Missing, but we will NEVER give up HOPE until she found and is back home with us.

In the world of missing persons, where there are few resources for families of missing persons 18 years and older, LostNMissing fills that much needed void, providing support to families with missing loved ones,  with professionalism, dedication, compassion and humanity.   Among other things, LostNMissing located and paid for a billboard in San Francisco, featuring my son and 4 other missing young men, provided beautifully designed fliers and digital themes to raise awareness of the search for my son (and 4 others from San Francisco)   LostNMissing truly goes the extra mile, even contacting a web master at one of the locations of a sighting of my son.    One truly gets the impression that LostNMissing (and Cynthia Caron) cares for each and every missing person.

It was create from a loving heart and continues to grow with each loving volunteer member.  You can be sure that you and your family will be represented with dignity and respect.    
LostNMissing, Inc	161915	1	/users/profile/214792	Pam_43	Client Served	5	07/02/2013	I would like to say, I love this website and organization. I love the spiritual poems, they keep me alive inside after loosing my 16 yr. old daughter last October, it really helps me cope. Thank you Dave. My story goes something like this. Last year in October, I received a devastating  phone call that changed my life forever.  You see, my daughter went missing. The results of her missing were not happy results. My point is, this organization reached out to myself and other family members. They had gotten all the information together to get her into the national database for missing persons. They certainly worked fast and hard. I appreciate everything they did for me. I couldn't have done it without them.
LostNMissing, Inc	161849	1	/users/profile/38129	sandylacrosse	General Member of the Public	5	07/01/2013	I met the woman that started LostNMissing,Inc several years ago when we were searching for a missing child in upstate NY. Since that time, virtually thousands of missing people have been found. Unfortunately some of those people were found deceased. Even though they were not alive, the family members had closure. LostNMissing,Inc has grown by leaps and bounds because there are so many wonderful volunteers that have given themselves unselfishly to the cause. The positive reviews say it all. There will always be a few negative reviews from people that cannot be grateful or appreciate the fact that these people are volunteers, not paid professional. They are doing the best that they can.  I am speaking from personal interaction with this organization. Thank you to everyone involved.
LostNMissing, Inc	37415	9	/users/profile/38129	sandylacrosse	General Member of the Public	5	04/29/2010	LostnMissing has been a wonderful provider of so manynotifications of missing people. It also keeps the site updated when people are found. So much effort is put into this non profit org. Considering it newness I cannot think of anyway they can improve. It is an honest open site and provides beautiful stories of the missing. It isn't just your average missing posters. The person that runs this site does an amazing job, as does the people that are working with her
LostNMissing, Inc	161814	1	/users/profile/214615	Laurie40	General Member of the Public	5	06/30/2013	I first heard about LostNMissing when I opened a page for Ayla Reynolds and then saw all of the families and their missing that they are helping on a daily basis and how committed they are. I have seen them do amazing things for Ayla awareness as well as being a strong support for her mother. I will continue to support them and the wonderful work they do.
LostNMissing, Inc	161810	1	/users/profile/214610	Danw60	Client Served	5	06/30/2013	Last year our son, Jorry Palm went missing June 3rd. He was missing 53 days. LostNMissing came to our Aid. They placed our sons picture and all information on their site, the National site. They worked very hard on our behalf. They gave us Emotional support during this Tragic time we were enduring. They made us Banners, fliers, They Organized a Balloon Launch for our son. The Founder Cynthia Caron and her staff were Fantastic to us. They were there the whole time for us. They kept in touch and always asked if we needed anything. This Organization is an Absolute God send to anyone who uses there services to help find missing loved ones. We go through enough emotional roll coasters, but every time we needed something, LostNMissing were there. I am so happy it was LostNMissing who were there for us. I can't thank them enough for everything they did. I would Recommend LostNMissing for everyone whose loved one went missing. Let it be noted all people who work with LostNMissing are volunteers, they receive no compensation. This is because they care and love people. Thank you again LostNMissing. We love you folks.    
LostNMissing, Inc	161805	1	/users/profile/162622	Carrie26	Donor	5	06/30/2013	I met Cynthia and LostNMissing when I became involved with missing persons on FaceBook.  I found there is so much more to assisting families of the missing than just sharing information on Facebook.  I decided that there was no way I would ever be as professional and knowledgeable as the LostNMissing organization.  I choose to donate to them when I can and support them however I can.  I personally have met a mother of a  "lost" adult child.  Cynthia and LostNMissing supported and assisted to a level that is beyond comprehension and the adult child was located safely!!! This organization, completely NON-PROFIT, works tirelessly.  I hope and PRAY they continue with their work.  An AMAZING group, I would hope everyone would support them, I can't think of a better group to lend my support.
LostNMissing, Inc	119614		/users/profile/162622	Carrie26	General Member of the Public	5	07/31/2012	I'd never been involved with missing persons...then came across a story on Facebook.  Along with another woman, I thought I could make a difference in spreading the word about the missing......and then Cynthia and LostNMissing connected with me.  Their organization is so completely focused and knowledgeable about missing persons, I chose to help Cynthia and her group as much as possible...let the experts do their job. I wish there were more I could do to support LostNMissing because they are FANTASTIC!  
LostNMissing, Inc	161762		/users/profile/203341	Kurt A.	Volunteer	4	06/29/2013	I have received continuing notices from LostnMissing relating to many cases of missing persons which I am always happy to receive. Their update system and the manner in which they support distressed families is most gracious. As a Non Profit Organisation they place a great amount of effort into the continuing wish of locating persons and hopefully to reconnect them. I feel that such organisations should continue to be supported as best is possible in both my professional and personal opinion. Many families have thankfully gained closure and regained the family members they were searching for due to these efforts and I hope this shall continue well into the future.  Ambassador Kurt Alleyne.
LostNMissing, Inc	152291	2	/users/profile/203341	Kurt A.	Volunteer	5	04/05/2013	LostNMissing I have found to be an excellent missing persons service highly dedicated to  finding the many missing persons noted. Always courteous to myself and interactions in relation to the notifications of information are clear and precise which I find extremely helpful.  A proactive organisation that keeps the interests of families close to mind at all times.  As an individual that works within Humanitarian Affairs I greatly appreciate the work that is undertaken which itself must induce quite stressful times. Updated information is fluid and prompt. I would certainly place any recommendation of LostNMissing to any families or indeed individual searching for missing persons in a highly positive manner.  Whilst operating this organization it uses some resources that are difficult to assist with for many but I would very much like to see the continuance and further building and I support fully the work undertaken.  In my professional view matters are dealt with in a Compassionate and truly caring manner always understanding of the needs of those they assist and to my knowledge have always given exemplary service. I look forward to further interactions and wish for every success in the future. I hope very much that further support will be given so that further extensions of their works can be made as needed. Mr. Kurt Alleyne. Ambassador for Humanitarian Affairs. International Human Rights Commission.

One of the many services they provide is to educate the general public ... One event took me from thinking that lost and missing people are drug addicts and run-aways ... To the truth and reality ... IT CAN HAPPEN TO ANYONE. I am sad that we need people doing the things that you do ... But I feel such relief knowing the service you provide for all of our lost and missing brothers and sisters. Keep it up, you are so much hope to so many families.

Not only did they make banners to share on social networking sites to get her pictures out there, I got moral support as well. Just knowing they are there for us (the loved ones of the missing) makes this living nightmare a bit easier to get through. THANK YOU TO EVERYONE AT LOST N MISSING.

LostNMissing, Inc	161737		/users/profile/203605	Karen164	Client Served	5	06/28/2013	I met Cyndy via her wonderful facebook postings to help a nationwide search for people who are missing.  I had recognized the face of a teen's picture hanging on the wall in Wallmart.  It turned out I had seen this young man at the courthouse and kept my eye open for him and thought I saw him at a Burger King.  Lost and Missing helped this family who were desperately looking for their son.  Following this, I friend her fb page and have been copying and posting all of the missing cases she tiresly post day after day, year after year in the hopes someone will no something to help.  I never in a million years would think I needed to call upon Cynthia to help me when our son went missing for several days.  Cynthia was instramentel in bringing him to safety.  She was able to call our son and help the police ping his call.  He was at high risk of harm to himself at that given time.  She was able to speak with him and help him emotionally.   She has continued to support me in difficult times and given me great advice.  For this  my husband and I will ever be greatful.  I would without hesitation highly reacomend LostNMissing.  Keep up the great work.  I will continue to volunteer to do my part by repost all of the lost people all over the country...Proud to know Cynthia

Those who write references should only be those who either volunteer and have first hand knowledge of the work of the team or those families who have directly contacted your organization for assistance. By standers and internet sleuthing groups base their opinions from a distance and do not know first hand just how many families lives you've touched. It's also been rumored that another "competitor" has been fueling the negativity and it is clearly obvious they send the same people to go after families that you are already are working with. I find that in poor taste considering they too should have their work be for the missing person and not to bring fame upon themselves. That is what I've most admired from LNM. The work always comes first without bragging and huge media campaigns about the org. It is about the families and the missing people at LNM. Congrats on the 2013 Badge!
LostNMissing, Inc	158703		/users/profile/202602	Jill L	Volunteer	5	05/24/2013	As a volunteer with LNM I am proud to say I am a member of this organization. I've watched families of missing go from grieving to feeling hopeful and have seen them transformed from feeling helpless to gaining strength.  All support members, through the guidance of Cynthia Caron, work nonstop and effortlessly for families grieving the loss of their missing. When they have nowhere to turn they find us and we are here to help them through all steps until their loved one is found, and after.

Anyone seeking assistance for their missing loved one should always research actual families that have had the one on one experience with this organization. LostNMissing is one of the most professional organizations that I've worked for and I have worked for a few others to compare. The attention to the families needs, the outreach to media and the detailed and compassionate services provided is what enables them to be successful.

LostNMissing, Inc	160701	13	/users/profile/201726	Friend of Jenn	Volunteer	1	06/15/2013	Lost N Missing has demonstrated distrust of a police investigation in which they were supposed to be "partnering" and have abused family members of a missing person so appallingly that the family had to publicly request that LnM remove themselves from the case. And no, I'm not part of an "orchestrated" anything.  I am an independent thinker who forms my own opinions based on the evidence available to me, and acts on those opinions regardless of what others are doing.  If LnM is so paranoid as to believe that people have to be recruited to express their horror at the appalling actions of this organization, they are in deep denial. On LnM's website, they claim that they partner with law enforcement.   I find this interesting, when presently, both the president of this organization and the treasurer/board member are publically questioning the integrity of the police investigation into the murder of Jennifer Ramsaran.  They must have found it a bit embarrassing when Jennifer's husband Ganesh -- the very man that LnM spent many hours defending publically as having an "airtight alibi" and having nothing to do with Jennifer's missing status has now been arrested for her murder.  And...I find it interesting that LnM feels that it is part of their "mission" to defend the "innocence" of GR  -- both before Jennifer's body was found, and even now after his arrest...how is that "partnering" with law enforcement??   Are they so arrogant as to believe that they know more than the fine men and women who have spent five months carefully investigating this crime?  Do they really doubt the work of the medical examiner which led to GR's arrest?   Quite frankly, if Lost N Missing does not trust law enforcement, I would suggest it would be difficult for them to partner with law enforcement.  I would doubt that law enforcement would welcome such partnership.  Secondly, Lost N Missing gushes about the love and compassion and support they extend to the family of missing persons.  In the case of Jennifer Ramsaran, they continue to "support" the man who has been indicted for her murder.  But their "love and compassion" has fallen far short with regard to Jennifer's grieving mother and father, Jennifer's sister, and Jennifers cousins, aunt, and other extended family.  To these members of Jennifer's family -- they have been crass and insensitive.  From inappropriate pm's to Jennifer's mother, to deleting comments made by Jennifer's family on Facebook (comments as innocuous as "my sister would never leave on her own"), to threatening to sue the family if negative reviews  here on Great Non-profits were not removed (isn't that blackmail??),  Cynthia Caron even stated in a public blog that she felt no pity for Jennifer's family.    Even after Jennifer's mother and sister have publically and politely requested that Lost N Missing remove themselves from Jennifer's case, LNM persists in harrassing the family by posting diatribes on both the Jennifer Ramsaran Missing FB site as well as the Justice for Jennifer site.  Currently, L&M has 4 staff members administrating that site, so they are still inserting themselves into Jennifer's case, and in so doing are continuing to create drama and prevent the family from moving on into healing and closure. Interestingly, LnM feel they have the right to even invade the Justice for Jennifer site to post tirades against the efforts of this group, but find any (well-warranted) criticism of their own actions to be "cyber-harrassment."    Lost N Missing has caused much additional grief and unwanted drama to a family in the most horrific of situations.  In my opinion, they ought not to have the opportunity to inflict this sort of pain on any other individuals. ETA:  Examples of distrust of the police investigation1) Posted by Cynthia Caron, on  5/25 on Jennifer Ramsaran Missing Facebook site: " I'm also not fond of the fact that his arrest and charges brought forth is on circumstantial evidence. Any charges brought forth I would have hoped and wanted to be solid proof.  (So...CC states it is "fact" that the arrest was only on circumstantial evidence? She believes that Chenango County LE have no "solid proof?" Hmmm....Sheriff Cutting stated that the arrest was based on the results of the Medical Examiner's autopsy; not sure how CC construes that to be "circumstantial evidence" and no "solid proof")   2) In an interview with News Channel 9,  "Caron said she has a lot of questions about the investigation that led to Remys arrest."   In FB comments, she has echoed this sentiment, hinting that she had "information" that doesn't "fit" with what the police are saying. 3) Police and the DA have stated that  the investigative work of computer experts have revealed that GR's alibi of being home working on the computer is false.  Cynthia Caron takes direct issue with the IT experts who investigated the case. She posted on 5/25 on the JRM facebook site: "he is an IT person. An IT person is not going to be so stupid as to say they were on a computer working as an alibi if they were not. " 4) Cynthia Caron, on 6/15, posted this on the Jennifer Ramsaran Missing FB page : He wants nothing more than to find the killer(s) of Jennifer and to prove he is innocent. He put a lot of faith in the Chenango Sheriff to find the killer and now realizes that he should not have put so much faith in the system and should have hired his own top notch PI's once Jennifer's body was found. 5) Cynthia Caron posted: In Jen's case there was never any domestic issues in the home, no violence (JRM 5/25)  Is this woman truly so arrogant as to state with total confidence that a woman she NEVER MET was NEVER the victim of abuse or violence from her husband???  Surely this is something to be proven (or not) at trial based on the testimony of those who KNEW Jennifer -- her family, employer, true friends, pastor, etc. 6) Karen Krapps -- a board member and treasurer of LnM posted numerous long diatribes -- about 7 or 8, maybe more, all in a row, on the Justice for Jennifer FB site (and this is what I mean by invading the site -- polite people make a short statement on FB, and go about their business, and maybe return a day or so later to clarify or respond or whatever.  They don't attempt to take over the site. )  The gist of KK's statements was that "adultery doesn't equal murder" (well, sorry KK, but there's a heck of a whole lot more evidence than the fact that GR commited adultery), and she tells us that we should not even consider GR's adultery as being a potential motive for his wife's murder, and  "I do not believe for one minute that for the petty amount of money he would have lost in a divorce, he would have risked going to prison for the rest of his life just to keep from losing it." She implies false arrest -- mentions that there have been other cases of people who have been arrested for murder but then found innocent by forensic evidence (newsflash KK -- the arrest was BASED on forensic evidence from the autopsy).  KK has made it clear that she believes GR is being "railroaded and not treated fairly or justly" by law enforcement.  7) Cynthia Caron mirrors the sentiments of Karen K with her insinuations of false arrest: "I can only say that I've already seen and known of those charged with murder that were found innocent and later the real killer(s) arrested. .. There is so much that just doesn't fit....contrary to rumors and gossip. " (posted on JRM Facebook, 5/24)
LostNMissing, Inc	151158	31	/users/profile/201726	Friend of Jenn	Volunteer	1	03/16/2013	Cynthia Caron's "assistance" in the Jennifer Ramsaran case borders on the absurd.  During the time that Jenn was missing, Ms. Caron suggested that she may have run off with hippies or be in some cult.  She always veered away from any suggestion that Jenn may have met with foul play (which is indeed what did happen); rather she helped promote the theory (suggested by Jenn's husband, and Jenn's husband's mistress) that Jenn had run off.  She gave an extensive list that was supposed to help us find and identify Jenn (which included the condiments she liked, and portrayed Jenn as a "dreamer" who failed to fit in with her family.  She  failed to mention that Jenn was a Sunday School teacher, a Girl Scout Troop Leader, a knitting teacher, etc.-- in other words,  a type of person that is the bedrock of any community - not one to suddenly abandon the 3 children who were her life).    Her list of "helpful information" contained many inconsistencies and incorrect info (such as Jenn didn't run -- when Jenn had recently completed a half-marathon with a very respectable score), but the main problem with the "list" is that it contained many items that were absurdly non-material, and nothing that was particularly helpful in understanding the type of person that Jenn was, and where she might be.  She has supported the most likely suspect in Jenn's death, and gullibly accepted everything he has told her, while at the same time publically attacking Jenn's family, and even suing a local journalist and the private investigator hired by Jenn's family.  When local volunteers tried to organized a search, Cynthia strongly discouraged it.   Her Facebook page for Jenn is....well...let's just say she deletes any postings made from someone with serious questions or helpful comments that could have led to finding Jenn earlier, and that could help with bringing justice to her now.   There is only one helpful thing that Cynthia did that I am aware of -- she did encourage the husband (finally, after Jenn was missing 2 months) to do a series of interviews with local press.  This did help raise awareness (and probably led to a local person finally discovering Jenn's body).  The interviews were also helpful to many in helping us realize that Jenn most likely did NOT run off, but was the victim of foul play. Ms. Caron still insists that we "can't know" that Jennifer met with foul play.  And, I suppose it may be correct that she can't make such a public statement without verification from law enforcement (and the final reports are not yet in).  But it is quite obvious that Jenn met with foul play of some sort -- her body was found, nude, on the side of the road,  miles from her home, and miles from where her van was found in a parking lot in Norwich.  Her clothes have not been found.  So...if Jenn did NOT meet with foul play, then she must have parked her van in Norwich, stripped naked, and walked through the rain about 12 miles down State Road 23 and then to Center Road, where she then rolled herself off an embankment and died.  Now...that really stretches the imagination. And yes, the fact that Jenn was a Sunday School teacher, a knitting teacher, and a Girl Scout Troop leader tell us a whole lot more about Jenn than what condiments she likes on her hamburger.  Jenn's life revolved around her kids and around community activities.  The type of activities she was involved in portray a woman of faith, a woman committed to her family, a woman highly unlikely to run off.   And...I can't help but wonder...where did Ms. Caron get the information that Jenn had "changed a lot" in the last 6 months of her life?  Presumably from Jenn's husband and the husband's mistress.  Was this verified by Jenn's pastor?  By close freinds that were NOT sleeping with her husband? By her parents? By her sister or cousins?

LostNMissing, Inc	159921	2	/users/profile/202372	Kare6k	Board Member	5	06/07/2013	Edited my June 7 post on June 20 to include: The point in my writing this, is to point out that the negative "reviews" that have been written about LostNMissing were NOT about LostNMissing at all, but instead were just criticisms and condemnations of people who they have a basic disagreement of opinion with. May it be noted that their assessment of the views and opinions held by Cynthia & I are absolutely incorrect.  The official work of LostNMissing in the Jennifer Ramsaran case ceased upon the discovery of her body. As it was at that point that she was no longer a lost or missing person. Anything done from that point on under the official heading of LNM was done ONLY as a courtesy (such as continuing to help maintain the Jennifer L.Ramsaran - Missing Person page (turned Jennifer Ramsaran Memorial), until someone else could be found to take it over; sharing of banners; making a memorial video). Once the lost or missing person's portion of any case is solved, we no longer have any official role in the case. That does not mean that we disappear, as unofficially we continue to be a friend to all, and a support system for many of our former clients. Jennifer went missing on 12/11/12. We were not brought onto the case until 1/22/13.... 42 days AFTER Jennifer went missing. Jennifer's body was found on 2/26/13 meaning that LostNMissing in an official capacity was only involved in this missing persons case for a total 35 days. Almost immediately upon our arrival onto the case we were met with rejection, resistance and an unwillingness to accept our help, advice and recommendations. In those five short weeks, we began an internet campaign to bring awareness to Jennifer's missing persons status making and posted banners with Jennifer's picture, her missing status, and contact information daily on various social media sites. We requested several times to meet with Jennifer's natural family. These requests were made to enable us to be able to personally invite them to the "Shining Hope" event, and to get information, pictures and input for the flyers that we eventually had to have printed using only the information and pictures we had gathered from LE, her husband & children and a handful of friends because our requests to meet with her family were rejected. Cynthia did receive a phone call from Jennifer's father and did have a conversation with him that was to be followed up with a call from his wife. When that didn't happen Cynthia attempted to contact her through private message via facebook which eventually was responded to and about 5 or 6 messages were exchanged (the next day someone from the JFJR page classified Cynthia's attempt to contact Jennifer's mother as "harassment of Jennifer's mother"... it was NOT). Cynthia established continued contact with law enforcement and was in regular contact with Jennifer's husband (who after all was the individual who contacted us and requested our assistance with the case) and several of Jennifer's friends. She secured the use of a billboard and offered to help either the ADM of the JFJR page or Jennifer's family establish an accountable means for accepting donations for another billboard, as well as for other expenses related to that making of the public aware of Jennifer's missing persons case and encouraging information related to that case to be shared with law enforcement, etc. She took over control of a Facebook page that had already been established (sometime in the 6 weeks prior to our involvement) and assigned LNM volunteers to administrate over it (during this time we were also helping to maintain approx. 2 dozen other facebook pages for other clients). After making the arrangements for a public event Cynthia traveled to Jennifer's hometown at her own personal expense (approx a 4.5 hr drive one way) and on 2/16/13 held a public "Shining Hope" event in order to heighten community and media awareness to the missing person case. Cynthia herself walked areas of the community and distributed and hung flyers, again to promote awareness. Cynthia drove to the areas where Jennifer's cell phone and van had been found and collected data and took video and pictures. She spent time with Jennifer's children. And may it again be noted that this was all done within the 5 short weeks that LNM was involved in the case. And it was all done under already difficult conditions made even more difficult due to the involvement of a few self-appointed, obstinate, headstrong, but otherwise believed well intentioned people who felt that they could do our job better than we could even though they very obviously didn't understand what our job was. There was so much misunderstanding and confusion going on that at one point even Jennifer's family became so confused over which group held which position that they publicly ridiculed the wrong group for planning to have a public search [against the advice of law enforcement] and having put out a public request for members of the public who owned 4-wheelers to bring them to help with the search. However it was NOT LostNMissing who was planning those unapproved searches, as in honoring the request of law enforcement to not hold any public searches LostNMissing made it known that we were opposed to any public searches that were not conducted by professional search & rescue teams (SARs). We, however, did encourage searches by professional SARs (a view that was held in common with her family). Yet somehow LNM got blamed for (paraphrasing) 'turning the whole [search] ordeal into a circus.' May it also be noted that during LostNMissing's 5 week involvement with the Jennifer Ramsaran missing person's case Cynthia had several other missing person's cases that she was working on; she was also holding down a full time job that requires her to travel; and in addition to having a marriage and household to maintain, she had a child in his senior yr in highschool and also has a special needs adult child whom she has guardianship over; and a blind brother who lives in Ohio and since her own mother's passing this past Nov. has taken on the responsibility of trying to assist (long distance) with his special needs; in the middle of all of this her community was hit with a blizzard for two days; and like every other human being she has to eat, sleep, and go to the bathroom...in simple words it would have been virtually impossible for her to have the time to "harass" anyone. [Please note: any mention of Jennifer's family in the above was only done for the specific purpose of explaining the course of events that took place and was NOT meant in anyway to be a criticism of anything they did or did not do. We offer them our full and complete sympathy and blame only confusion, frustration and grief for any misunderstandings between them and our organization]  As for the so called "review" offered up against us as private citizens....While I recognize that this is NOT the place to discuss these basic differences of opinion, I will use this space only to clarify... 1) If all it took to deem a person guilty was an arrest, we would have no need for a judicial system. Rejecting the lynch mob mentality that doesn't afford the accused a fair and impartial trial does NOT equate to "questioning the integrity of the police investigation." At this point it doesn't even equate to questioning the integrity of the evidence collected during that investigation because NONE of that evidence has been shared with the public. Withholding judgment UNTIL the accused is afforded a fair and impartial trail where the integrity of the evidence can be questioned and challenged, is how justice is served. LostNMissing supports justice.2) LostNMissing is an organization that provides assistance to the families of the lost and missing. It is NOT an organization that determines the guilt or innocence of anyone, as that is what we have a judicial system for.3) Not wanting or intending to be insensitive or disrespectful of the family, I can only respond by saying that if the family did not want "drama" they should have not used themselves, or allowed anyone else, to use the Justice for Jennifer Ramsaran PUBLIC facebook page as a forum to post lies, and libel against anyone. As in partaking in and allowing for it they were acknowledging the existence of the built in reasonable expectation for rebuttal, refutation or expostulation. 4) For the record, unlike Cynthia, Karen Krepps' (though not expressed until now) gut instinct has always leaned more toward Ganish Ramsaran's guilt, but just exactly like Cynthia, Karen Krepps is withholding and reserving judgment until AFTER the accused had been afforded a fair and impartial trial and the integrity of the evidence has been questioned and challenged.5) I would suggest that the people writing these falsified reviews (that truly have nothing at all to do with the organization LostNMissing and instead are just criticisms and condemnations of private citizens that just happen to work for the organization) get on with their life and realize the rights of others to own view points and opinions that differ from that of their own. ThanksKaren Krepps   Response to Lindsay14:1. LE followed and applied established commonly accepted protocols that are followed in investigating most all missing persons cases. LE asked the usual, and necessary questions that are asked in most all missing persons cases.Apparently "some" members of Jennifer's family were offended by both the type of questions and the answers that were given by certain "other" members of Jennifer's family. The questions were asked, and answers/statements were given and on record.ALL of this took place several weeks before LostNMissing had anything whatsoever to do with the case! Enter LostNMissing...1/22/13Ms Caron "alluded" to nothing, nor did she "disparage the victims character." She very simply shared with the public the on the record answers/statements that were given to LE in those initial interviews (and later shared with Ms Caron) in regard to any noticeable/notable differences or changes in their missing loved ones disposition, personal life, character, mood, dress, habits, sleep, personal appearance, day to day activities, likes, dislikes, etc., That "some" family members were/are offended by that is both unintended and unfortunate, but sometimes unavoidable.    We are realistic and do know that 85% of our missing persons when located are found deceased, however, we always are of hope that if it is YOUR loved one that goes missing that they will be among the 15% that are found alive. We hoped and prayed that Jennifer would be one of the 15% so we maintained a focus on ANY scenario that presented this as a possibility. No possible scenario that was presented as an example was presented for ANY other purpose other than to maintain hope that she would be one of the 15%.Therefore yes, we were hoping that she was despondent, or depressed, had become involved in something/anything that caused her to feel that she had to walk away from everything for a while, or whatever other scenario that presented an option for the BEST possible outcome...a found alive Jennifer. Even if they did have some private, instinctual, or personal reason to have doubt ...given the only alternative to finding an alive Jennifer was finding a deceased Jennifer, we did not and do not understand why your family didn't opt to cling to the hope.  As for our organization in every case unless or until hard evidence is discovered by LE that would suggest that foul play was involved we will continue to encourage a family to maintain hope... as we know that 15% of our cases have resulted in positive outcomes. So therefore it is those cases that we turn to and present as examples of why every family should maintain hope. I repeat: That we presented those examples as possibilities is in NO way whatsoever intended to disparage the character of anyone, but is ONLY intended to provide the family with reason to hope.  We are extremely sorry if your family did not understand our purpose in presenting examples of positive outcomes of other missing persons cases, but we hope that this helps you understand it.   Facebook...We did not take over as adm. of the original FB page until 1/22/13, so anything that took place prior to that had nothing to do with us or our policies.  Enter LostNMissing 1/22/13...With Facebook not having in place any way for our adms to verify the relationship, or intent of a person posting on the page, anyone can claim to be anyone they want to claim to being. To avoid altogether from providing ANYONE (family or otherwise) the ability to post messages of negative or ill intent, or in opposition with the intent of the page, our adms are trained to judge only the content of the message (and ignore all else including claimed family relationship...reason being again, that we have no way to verify those claims). Bottom line is that if ANY message is found to be confrontational and/or not in compliance with the intent of the page, the post is deleted, period!  To be clear, you are wrong to assume that the only msgs that were removed were msgs written by individuals claiming to be members of your family, as without giving out details, I can tell you for an absolute fact that more than one msg was removed that was most definitely NOT written by a member of your family. ALL msgs were met with the same scrutiny no matter their source.  At any given time we monitor 2 - 3 dozen Missing Persons FB pages and the same rules that were applied to Jennifer's page apply to all of the pages we monitor...we do not adjust or personalize the rules for anyone or any case.  Fact is after hearing of her complaint Ms Caron sent Ms Buff a private msg and requested that she call her so that Ms Caron could personally explain our policies, and apologize for any misunderstanding.  Instead of calling her, Ms Buff opted to hop on board this ongoing well orchestrated crusade against Ms Caron and the LNM organization. Choosing to give her the benefit of the doubt we opted to overlook those initial actions and attributed them to her simply being distraught over her sisters missing status...but that only worked to intensify the crusade [against Ms Caron and the LNM organization] that she had begun to be actively involved in and had in fact begun publicly soliciting for other people to become a part of too.  At that point it was more than simply a matter of boycotting our organization, but had gone far beyond that and had turned personal, malicious, vicious, malevolent, injurious, & libelous against Ms Caron and the LNM organization.    2) When a reporter "reports" they use in context quoted material. Below is a link to the article mentioned. Please take notice in concern of Ms Caron the ONLY quotes he uses are two quotes for a total of six words, first quote: one-time and second quote: It was not an affair. When reading the article and seeing how he utilized the quotes it is VERY easy to see that both quotes were completely and entirely taken out of the context in which they were spoken and were placed into the context that he wanted to put them in so that they would say what he wanted to portray them as saying.  For example he wrote:  *Caron, responding to questions from The Daily Star, also said Ganesh Ramsaran admitted to police after his wife disappeared that he had a one-time sexual encounter with a woman who is a mutual friend of both Ganesh and Jennifer Ramsaran.* Since he did quote her as saying the two words, why is the rest of the stuff she supposedly said not quoted too???? The answer is that the 2 words were in fact said by her (thus the quotes) but the rest of what he attributed to her is not a factual account of the words she spoke or the context in which they were uttered. He lifted those two words out of their correct context and put quotes around them, then wrote what he wanted to say around those words in an attempt to give his entire article validity by tricking the reader into thinking that ALL of what he attributed to Ms. Caron was said by Ms Caron when in fact it was NOT. Very twisted, very dishonest and absent of any journalistic integrity. http://thedailystar.com/localnews/x1503756987/Report-Blood-found-in-missing-womans-van Ms Caron has already explained that she was very specific in her response to Mr Mahoney in stating that according to police reports (and also according to what Mr Ramsaran had personally told her) that in concern of the infidelity she was told that "it was not an affair, but instead was a one-time infidelity, that he greatly regretted and his wife had no knowledge of." When later in the conversation Mr Mahoney brought it up and again referred to it as an "affair" she again said that per her information it was not an affair, but rather a one time infidelity. Mahoney said: "yes, an affair" Ms Caron said: "no, a one time infidelity" Mahoney: "what is the difference between 'affairs' and 'infidelity'"? Ms. Caron (speaking metaphorically): "Mr. Mahoney, would you say that if a man went away on a business trip and he and a woman had too much to drink and ended up in bed...would you call that an affair?"  Please note: Ms. Caron was NOT even speaking about Mr Ramsaran, but instead only for the purpose of trying to establish the difference between an affair and a one time infidelity she was using a make believe story about some make believe guy who went away on a make believe business trip got make believe drunk, met up with a make believe woman who also got make believe drunk and they ended up in a make believe bed together! Yet Mr Mahoney claimed in his article that Ms Caron said [in reference to Mr Ramsaran's infidelity] that "the encounter was fueled by alcohol" when she said no such thing! Again, please re-read the article: http://thedailystar.com/localnews/x1503756987/Report-Blood-found-in-missing-womans-van   3) Ms. Caron personally took time away from her own family, and time away from her work for pay career, to travel to the community (at her own personal financial expense...LNM finances were only used to cover a portion of the cost of the actual event, Ms. Caron out of her own pocket paid for the rest) and held a community event (Shining Hope) in hopes of uniting the community and the family in their common desire to find an alive Jennifer. Sadly it seems that her family's common belief that Jennifer was deceased prevented them from attending this intended to be unifying community event in spite of Ms Caron having reached out to them. If there were another reason that prevented Jennifer's family from attending the Shining Hope event it was NEVER shared with us. Had it been, we would have made EVERY effort to accommodate them and diplomatically address their concerns. As while these events have been trivialized and mocked by certain individuals, experience has proven them to be very beneficial to both the emotional well-being of the families of the missing and in gaining community awareness and support. Their purpose is multi-faceted, with the main points being to provide a quiet and comfortable setting where groups of people can meet with the missing person's family and friends, offer them their support, share in their grief, pay honor to their missing loved one(s), raise the communities awareness to the missing person case, and motivate hope. Most definitely we wanted to provide that service to ALL, not just some, of Jennifer's family, most especially her children. Having their maternal grandparents there would have been very meaningful and comforting for them and we would have done everything within our means to make that happen. Yet beyond reaching out, inviting them to attend, and leaving our contact information with them, there was little else that we could do. Sadly, as it was, even that, was by some, considered "harassment." LNM did not come on board until a full 6 weeks after Jennifer went missing. In the weeks prior to that was when the so called "wars" began. We had no control over and no involvement in that.Fact is during those early weeks of her disappearance (before LNM had anything whatsoever to do with Jennifer's missing persons case) it was in fact Tracy aka Jillian aka Jack Stevens, aka Jennifer Ann Perry, aka Lauren Sullivan, aka many other aliases who was posting very disparaging things about Jennifer. She inferred that Jennifer led a "kinky" lifestyle. That Jennifer and her husband had a 'BDSM/kink lifestyle." Suggested that Jennifer may have left her family (aka, 'abandoned') in order to enter "the scene" which she explained is an underground community made up of an entire subculture of people who feel judged if they follow their true identities by leaving what she called "their "vanilla" lifestyles". She even tried to insinuate that Jennifer was mentally unstable by stating that she had read somewhere that Jennifer was taking medication, but gee she couldn't recall if they were psychotropic's or not. And also presented the possibility that Jennifer left willingly and had taken off with someone she met online. In addition while not wanting to be "judge-ey" she expressed criticism of Jennifer's parents and made the claim that it took them 26 days to come home from Arizona after their daughter went missing. WS Verified Insider - Jennifer Ramsaran Case: 12-26-2012 04:42pm msg #340,12-26-2012, 06:47pm msg #355, 12-27-2012 07:32pm msg #361,01-02-2013 08:55pm msg # 394, 01-05-2013 05:59pm msg # 427 Ironically it was also this same Tracy (with more than a dozen aliases) who created the second FB page (the one supported by Jennifer's sister & mother) when the original FB page blocked her for posting confrontational, disparaging, inappropriate messages and messages soliciting for volunteer searchers even though it had been explained that LE requested no searches. Seems that somewhere between her original messages on WS and the point that she was blocked on FB she changed her position and decided that Jennifer was murdered and her husband was a murderer. Perhaps without Jennifer's family knowing of her many aliases she began the second FB page and Jennifers family signed on.    Enter LostNMissing 1/22/13Wanting to protect Jennifer's family from having their vulnerabilities and pain exploited or from being scammed during this stressful and vulnerable time Ms. Caron signed on Tracy's FB Jennifer's page and following her first message posted she was hastefully blocked. However, because numerous LNM volunteers had also signed on we were aware that within just a few days that the venom was turned on Ms Caron and the LNM organization in full force as several people had begun to post vicious accusatory and libelous comments insinuating that Ms. Caron was "involved" with Mr Ramsaran, was a thieving b!t@h, had harassed Tracy on the WS site (when in fact all she did was make a public response to some of the public messages that Tracy had posted... if Tracy did not want Ms Caron to respond, she was free to put her on her ignore list), implied that Cynthia was some kind of a threat to her and her family and implied this as being her reason for using aliases (in spite of the fact that within their rules it is clearly stated: "Facebook is a community where people use their real identities. We require everyone to provide their real names, so you always know who you're connecting with. This helps keep our community safe."), insinuated that either Jennifer's husband or Cynthia herself was somehow responsible for flyers being take down, accused her of hacking the JFJR site, others accused her of hacking their FB accounts others merely insinuated it, accused her of being involved in murder, accused her of insistently contacting Jennifer's mother and harassing her (there was only ONE, I repeat ONE brief exchange that Cynthia had with her...it consisted of a total of each writing maybe 3 FB private msgs in direct response to each other ), accused her of saying that Jennifer abandoned her family, accused her of demanding that Jennifer's mother admit that Jennifer was mentally unstable, repeatedly named her as being a cyber-bully, of being mentally unstable, some solicited the public to report LNM to the NH Attorney General's Office, some solicited the public to post negative reviews and provided a link to this very non-profit review site, etc.Heck, Tracy under the JFJR pseudo even put up for 24 hrs a message she wrote for the specific purpose of trashing and posting lies about Cynthia then by using another one of her aliases of Tracy Anne Stearns she responded to her own message to add more bashing...guess she isn't aware of the fact that EVERYTHING that is posted on FB is permalinked to FB for ever and ever?!?! https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=509172275796149&id=485680108145366  4) I doubt that you truly feel that Cynthia is deserving of the orchestrated crusade and solicited negative review writing campaign to have her organization destroyed simply because at some point she posted a message that said that your uncle (Jennys father) didnt want her reported missing... and that Ms. Caron omitted saying that this was at 5:30PM. Jen was due home at 5PM and her planned trip was 1-1  hours each way?!?!?Is it not possible that Ms Caron's omission was completely unintended and therefore not unprofessional at all, and simply a mistake??? Or could it have been a matter of her merely sharing a piece of incomplete information that had been shared with her without her having any knowledge of it being incomplete?? Did you ever think to simply ask her?!?!?! Nevertheless, need I point out the blatant hypocrisy in attacking and participating in this solicited orchestrated crusade of negative review writing and filing of complaints with the NH AG against Ms Caron and LNM on the claimed basis that she displayed "unprofessionalism", while at the very same time showing nothing but continued respect for "Tracy" aka Jillian, aka etc and so on...who, like Ms Caron was a verified insider on the WS board, and who began the other FB page now known as "Justice for Jennifer Ramsaran" (therefore was expected to display "professionalism")...and who on 01-05-2013 said: "As an aside, and I don't meant to sound all judge-ey, but why if your child is missing, would you wait so long (26 days) to come? There could be a myriad of reasons: job issues, perhaps there are financial issues that make the trip cost prohibitive, perhaps it's believed she left willingly, but still...."http://websleuths.com/forums/showthread.php?p=8698479   Now to address Stephanie's concerns:Stephanie said: "Numerous family members have informed me that they feel harassed, specifically by Cynthia. They feel that she was argumentative with and even aggressive toward them. I was also the family member informed by an employee of the newspaper in question that Cynthia did in fact reveal the information, and then tell the reporter, "By the way, that's off the record." "  Response:A public claim of harassment made against someone is a VERY serious matter that could work to not only destroy a totally innocent persons reputation, but can also have a very negative impact on the lives of everyone that surrounds that person. Such a claim therefore must be substantiated with factual, verifiable proof, not rumor, gossip, innuendo or simply a belief in the claims of ones family. While it may very well be true that some of your family did "feel" harassed... IF they weren't factually being harassed those feelings are NOT valid. Correcting the record or correcting a printed falsehood on a public forum or social network is NOT harassment even if the person or persons posting the inaccuracies or falsehoods repeatedly ask not to be corrected.Posting "A" message in response to a message that has been placed on a board in public forum or on social network page is NOT harassment.Sending someone "A" private message via a social network, and responding to their responses is NOT harassment. Accepting "A" phone call from someone and asking that they have their wife call them so that they can explain the organizations services, is NOT harassmentFact is there has not been one single ounce of evidence presented by any of the negative review writers (or anyone else any place) that would support a claim of harassment or bullying done at the hand of Cynthia or LNM, because neither Cynthia or LNM has EVER harassed or bullied anyone. .That you included the following in your "review" reveals to me the real root cause of the issues that you and your family have with Cynthia and LNM....quoting you: "My biggest complaint is that Cynthia took into account the word of only one member of this very large family, and took those words at gospel truth. All the family is asking for is some open-mindedness and a willingness to consider that the real truth may be something other than what she is hearing."   As in those two sentences you have stated that it wasn't that Cynthia or LNM did anything wrong, it was that she/they DID in fact maintain their professionalism by keeping their focus directed on the hope that Jennifer would be found alive at a time when your family's focus was apparently only on the alternative (finding a body, and not an alive Jennifer).  Perhaps your family found it antagonistic that we would be willing to work directly with the person that you and your family had decided was responsible for Jennifer's death (please note that this was decided by your family several weeks before LNMs involvement in the case)??? And perhaps what antagonized your family most was that for reasons they apparently did not understand Cynthia did in fact publicly express a belief (in regard to Jennifer's husband) that opposed your families own belief???  But for the children's sake, for your family's sake, and most especially for Jennifer's sake we hoped first that she would be found alive, and when she wasn't we prayed that her murderer would be found to be a complete stranger.   We could never have maintained a focus on finding an alive Jennifer had we capitulated to your family's apparent desire for us to view her husband as a murderer. Can you not see how the two positions directly conflict with one another...how could we keep her children, her family or the public hopeful that she would be found alive if we had already decided that he was her murderer????  And what if your family was wrong? What if she had been found alive? How professional would it have been for us to capitulate to your family's desire for us to treat her husband as a murderer and had we willingly hopped on that 'let's judge, try, and convict him through social network media bandwagon' only to have her found alive? Even after she was found deceased it would have still been extremely unethical for us to jump upon that bandwagon. As what if the autopsy report combined with LEs investigation had cleared him completely of any and all wrong doing or had netted them an arrest, confession and conviction of someone else? What would be said of our "professionalism" then?? That is not to say that we did not recognize that it was possible that Remy could be found responsible for her death, but we also recognized that it was possible that someone else connected or unconnected to her life could be found responsible for her death. As I said we had no pre-existing bias and had been provided no greater reason to suspect him for her murder than we were given to suspect anyone else of being responsible for her murder.  If there were reasons of substance for why your family so strongly believed that Jennifer had been murdered and that Remy was responsible, those reasons were NEVER shared with us by anyone from your family. As everyone in your family rejected our involvement from the moment we became involved which was a full 6 weeks after Jennifer went missing. Fact is we reached out and provided contact information to members of your family and requested to speak and meet with them and (outside of the very brief exchange between Cynthia & Jennifers mom) the ONLY person who responded to that request was Jennifer's father and that phone conversation had to be cut short because he called while Cynthia was driving to an appointment that could not be broken.     Please, please, please understand that none of what I am saying is being said with the intent of disparaging anyone, but instead ONLY for the specific purpose of clearing up the record by trying to get you to see things from another vantage point.  We wanted nothing more than to find an alive Jennifer, and are heartbroken for your family that our hope did not become a reality. We wanted very much to work with your family, yet understood ahead of time that the possibility existed that Jennifer's mother's, father's, and sister's pain & feelings of vulnerability would be so intense that the only people they may have wanted to work with was LE. We did not take any offense at that, and were very respectful of those feelings. But it was our hope that they would have welcomed our assistance. We cannot be blamed that they didn't.  Beyond knowing that in most cases like this it is common for the husband to be the first person looked at with suspicion, we don't know how or why this division between Jennifer's family and her husband even existed. As there was no evidence available to us that supported or revealed that this division existed prior to Jennifer's missing. In fact on the face it appeared that the family was very closely knitted as Jennifer and her husband lived next door to her parents and it seemed like they all had a good relationship. Looking over the information we were able to access from all outward appearances Jennifer was living within a safe and stable environment that was filled with family and love. And up to and until her body was found no one from her family ever suggested the opposite existed.  In fact each family member picked up the brush and helped paint a portrait of a very happy, very content, well loved, very stable, very honest, very outgoing, highly thought of, highly respected, very intelligent, very active, very talented (even taught knitting classes), very faithful, very accomplished, very personable, very protective and "Mommy" oriented (and hands on children involved), very devoted, community minded, Girl Scout involved, church involved (even taught Sunday school) one who had strong and bonded relationships with all who loved her and all whom she loved, was hard working, fun, spiritual...in other words EVERYONE in your family has painted a portrait of Jennifer that presented her as being the exact OPPOSITE of a controlled, living in fear, beaten down, weakened, victimized, trapped, or abused type of individual.     The facts are what they are, and the facts are that we had NEVER been given any reason whatsoever for not maintaining the goal of finding an alive Jennifer. Because LE never attached to the case a suspicion of "foul play", never named anyone as a suspect, have kept tight-lipped throughout the investigation, discouraged any public searches, etc.... they gave us no reason to alter or rethink that goal. Because all the information available us presented to us a well functioning, close knit family and presented Jennifer as the exact opposite of a controlled, living in fear, beaten down, weakened, victimized, trapped, or abused type of individual, it gave us no reason to alter or rethink that goal. Because your family refused to work with or even talk with us, they to gave us no reason to alter or rethink that goal.  So we held strong to that goal and remained focused only on finding an alive Jennifer.Not because we took sides in anything. Not because we refused to be open minded. Not because we refused to consider a negative outcome. Not because we refused to consider the possibility of a guilty Remy or a guilty friend or relative....but instead ONLY because we had been given no reason not to continue to hope that an alive Jennifer would in fact be found.   It has been thrown at us numerous times that we did not know Jennifer. No we didn't... however fact also is that we did not know her family, or her friends, or her husband either and therefore we did not have any pre-existing bias regarding anyone.  And it needs also to be noted that for every person who did know them and had expressed to us a belief that Remy had murdered her, there was another person who knew them who expressed to us a belief that he was a victim himself and had nothing to do with her missing status or what turned out to be her murder. And having what some have called a goofy, a gregarious, a narcissistic personality and an obsession with running and working out makes no one a murderer. Nor does committing adultery make anyone a murderer...if it did considering the current divorce rates and rates of infidelity in this nation, we would have more people in prison than out of prison. Yes, it is morally wrong to commit adultery, but it is not a crime, and it makes no one a murderer, but instead just an adulterer.   It also HAS to be understood that we have had cases where the loved ones left behind are 100% certain that their loved one simply ran away, as they had ran away several times before, only to find out later that they had not ran away, but instead had been murdered. As well, we have had cases where loved ones are 100% certain that their missing loved one met with foul play (because they believe to know for a fact that they would never ever leave them, their children, their ailing mother, handicapped sibling, their successful business, etc.) and are 110% certain that they know who is responsible, only to later find out that their loved one was alive and well the entire time that they were absolutely certain that they would never willingly go missing. You name it we have had it or at least heard about it. It is not EVER us that is not open minded in regard to the numerous possibilities that exist in missing person cases. Let's face it, if we hadn't remained open-minded as to ALL of those possibilities in regard to Jennifer's case and instead had closed off our minds to limit our thinking only to Remy murdering her as being the only possibility, no one in your family would have had a problem with us or anything that we were doing.    To conclude; there is absolutely no reason for anyone to harbor so much ill will for Cynthia or LNM. Nothing that Cynthia/LNM did or didn't do had anything at all to do with Jennifer's missing status or death. Cynthia/LNM harassed no one. They disparaged no one. They bullied no one. They did not hamper the investigation in any way (but may in fact have inadvertently aided it). They did not cause your family's pain, they did not exploit it, nor did they do anything to either intentionally or unintentionally intensify or trivialize it. They DID try to protect your family from having their pain exploited by an unlicensed, unprincipled, self-appointed, rogue who refused to even identify themselves. They DID fully identify themselves and offered to work with the people running the JFJR site. (side note: since there are at present 1,100+ members of the JFJR site and all except one person has their name identified with each msg they post, don't you think that trying to use the excuse of fear for her safety as an excuse for hiding her identity/utilizing multiple aliases kind of raises eyebrows and falls short as being a rational excuse??)  They DID try to protect your family from having their pain commercialized for profit by un-vetted, unregistered, unknowns who use multiple aliases to skirt around and avoid the legal requirements and accountability involved in taking in donations and holding fundraiser's, etc.  They DID recommend that professional SAR's be used. They DID try to discourage public searches from being done so that any and all possible or probable evidence would be protected from removal or contamination.  They DID try to prevent the whole investigation process from being turned into a three ring circus by overzealous crime solver wannabes (my goodness Tracy was encouraging people to ignore LE's request of no public searches and was even arranging for 4-wheelers etc. to be brought in by anyone who wanted to take part. Thankfully Joann was able to get through to her as Cynthia had tried to no avail).  They DID tell people not to donate through the JFJR site (where there is no accountability at all in place), and told them to instead to donate either directly to the family or through an account set up by the family and offered help in setting up such an account (apparently that didn't sit well with Tracy as she admitted on her latest "review" that this was the reason she blocked Cynthia from the JFJR site...Quoting her: "You were highly vocal about and against people donating to the family via our site. You posted numerous posts telling people NOT to donate to the family via our site. Then, and only then did I block you from that site...." Why should that have even bothered her, let alone caused her to block Cynthia?)   While I can't claim to speak for all, I know I speak for most in saying that your family does have the family of LostNMissing's deepest and most heartfelt sympathy. While we know for certain that someone is guilty for having murdered Jennifer, and want desperately for justice to be served, we continue to hope and pray that the guilty party is not Remy as we can't imagine a more horrific ending to Jennifer's life than to be murdered by the one person who vowed to both her and God, that for the remainder of their own life, to always love, honor and protect her.  We can also not imagine a more horrific thing for their children to have to bear for the rest of their precious lives than to have to carry with them the burden of the knowledge that their father murdered their mother.  Having said that, while we do not "want" him to be guilty IF in fact he is guilty we also and most definitely hope and pray that he will be made to answer fully, and in the most punishing of ways, for this horrific crime!  While Remy has in fact been charged with this inexcusable and horrific crime, from all outward signs it appears that the case against Remy is built entirely on circumstantial evidence meaning that not even the Sheriff's Dept and investigators, can say without any reasonable doubt that Remy in fact murdered Jennifer. So how can we?? This may or may not change depending upon the evidence collected and presented in a court of law (which despite the claims of the rumor-mills has NOT been released and is only in the hands of the DA and Defense Attorneys). Therefore we must all wait until trial, listen to all evidence and then put it in the hands of a jury to determine if in fact they believe that the evidence (circumstantial or otherwise) is so overwhelming as to support a guilty verdict. As in our system of justice one is not required to prove their innocence, so innocence must be presumed in the absence of having evidence (circumstantial or otherwise) to support a determination of guilt beyond that of a reasonable doubt. Regardless, no matter what one may believe or not believe, whether he is determined by a jury of his piers to be guilty or not guilty, ..no matter the outcome of all of this..LNM and Cynthia Caron, and her staff, have nothing whatsoever to do with Remy's or anyone else's guilt or innocence.  May God be with your family and comfort them through this very trying time.
LostNMissing, Inc	151577	15	/users/profile/202372	Kare6k	Board Member	5	03/24/2013	First and foremost I would like to extend my deepest sympathies to all of Jennifer Ramsaran's loved ones, both family & friends. My thoughts and prayers go out to all who knew and love her. Having read many of the exchanges surrounding this specific case, as well as the "reviews" I believe that the source of the "conflict" is in the failure of some to understand what our organization does and does not do.  My name is Karen Krepps. I am the Treasurer/Board Member Volunteer for the non-profit LostNMissing, Inc. I would like to bring awareness to the public of a number of concerns I've observed as well as clarifications to those concerns. As the Treasurer who oversees all financial records, and as a B.o.D. of this wonderful and committed organization I can assure you that none, I repeat NONE of the monetary or in-kind donations have ever been used for anything other than to assist the families of missing persons. In addition I can also assure you that Cynthia Caron has each year donated herself more in time and of her own personal income [both she and her husband] than what has been totally donated and received over the five years that LNM has existed as a registered non-profit.  I would also like to reiterate a previous fact that was stated in that from it's inception LostNMissing has had a distinguished and stellar reputation. We are a highly principled, and reputable organization who has worked with on average over 300 families of missing persons each year (approx 1,500 since it's inception with never a previous negative review). Many of those families have in fact consisted of divided families and/or families in conflict and therefore not able to work together and function in unity. In those cases we have many times reached out to and worked jointly with other aid to the missing organizations, as we believe that never should the focus of finding a missing loved one be side tracked by new or pre-existing personal conflicts, family disputes, pre-existing bias, rushes to judgment, oneupmenship or for any other reason. Our goal and mission is VERY narrow in scope and does NOT include becoming embroiled in family disagreements, disputes, finger pointing, or assigning guilt or innocence. As experience proves out when a loved one becomes missing, ALL families have within them members that experience a myraid of emotions, with some who become extremely distraught, and others who are so desparate for answers that they become frustrated, disheartened, confused, angry, or vulnerable.  We therefore strive to maintain a very strict set of directives ...those directives being, to aid the family in keeping their focus on the hope of finding their missing loved one. We do this by helping them to continue to bring awareness to the public of the missing individual. As well, we support law enforcement and families in all ways possible with media, internet, and public awareness......we leave the "investigative work" to the investigators, the "prosecutors work" to the local DA, and the "perceivers of innocence or guilt" to the Judge & jurors and do NOT encourage vigilantism. While we have great respect for their work, we are NOT a crime solver/crime stopping/justice seeking organization. Fact is much of our clientele involve families of missing individuals who have gone missing by their own accord or volition (people with deminished mental capacities, people suffering from depression, people wishing to escape a troubled relationship, people wishing to avoid debt that they cannot pay, underage children wishing to take a shortcut to independence, underage children wishing to live with their non-custodial parent, people who choose to hide themselves from certain family members, people who have joined cults, people who have become involved in extra-marital affairs, etc, and so on...the list is massive...no two cases are perfectly alike, and many involve NO crime whatsoever). Our organization is in place to serve one primary purpose...that is to aid the families of missing people with maintaining hope in finding their missing loved one. We very simply and very clearly work with local law enforcement to try to guide families as to what needs done to help locate their missing family member. For missing adults, this includes media, marketing, designing missing posters and banners, and assisting the family with needed events as well as contracting for search and rescue, "IF" and only "IF" that is advised or requested by their local police agency.  In addition, when and "IF" law enforcement notifies us that a probable crime is involved with a loved ones disappearance, then and only then will we assist the family in them being able to connect to one of the highly reputable, well vetted professionally operated victims advocate and/or crime solving support organizations that are in existance in their local area. Until then we ONLY provide them with the limited in scope, neutral, non-judgmental services that our orgaization is set up to provide. As again, our goal is ONLY to assist the family in maintaining hope and finding their missing loved one. We are always available to the family and work with professionalism and compassion. We are here to offer our services and support to ANY and all who request it. It is very understandable that emotions run high while a loved one is missing, and that the devistation over having that loved ones body found deceased can be overwhelming and can cause family members to lash out and react in ways not in line with their normal character. Grief has a way of clouding our thought. It is NOT understandable [nor is it legal] however, for anyone to act with a conscience intent to demean, disparage, defame, slander or libel against an organization or individual, for any reason let alone simply because that organization or individual does not provide the services that are desired nor is teh organization tolerant of any attempts by others to push them to go outside of the scope of the services that they offer.    To be clear: 1) we do not have, nor have we ever had a private investigator working for us 2) we do not/did not cyber-bully anyone...nor do we have the desire, the know how or ability to "hack" anything....in addition we have no influence or control over what Facebook does or does not do 3) we set up a page on a social network website (Facebook) for the very specific purpose of providing a forum for people to offer support and prayer for the family of the individual missing...anything that was posted by ANYONE that did not meet this purpose was deleted for the 2 very specific purposes of a) keeping hope alive by keeping the focus ONLY on finding the missing person b) protecting the family from unwanted postings/comments (prohibiting any unnecessary and unwanted drama that serves no one any good purpose)...asking that maturity and respect be shown and removing from public view messages that do not adhere to the stated purpose of the site is NOT to display malice or cruelty toward anyone 4) at no time have we ever "leaked" anything...before sharing any information we make every attempt to verify it... if it is unable to be verified but is believed that it could be helpful in locating the individual we make certain to note that it has not been verified 5) we understand that many areas of a loved ones life are "sensitive" areas and we strive to be as respectful as possible of that...however, often times the ability to locate a missing person relies heavily upon the family looking at every possible scenario of why their loved one may be missing...that we provide a list of possible scenarios for the family & friends to consider is NOT an attempt to degrade or malign the reputation of the missing individual or of any of their family members 6) trying to help family and friends keep the focus on hope and finding the missing individual requires us to walk a very thin line between encouraging family and friends to share sometimes sensitive information that may aid in their finding while at the same time also encouraging them to steer clear of and resist any finger pointing, rushes to judgment, assigning of guilt or innocence, etc. 7) that we keep records of all of our correspondences...is NOT to be interpretted as we "record" our conversations 8) we do not "defend" the individuals who request our services, we instead provide them to the best of our ability the services that our organization is set up to provide....neither do we attempt to establish anyone's guilt or innocence...as noted prior, many of our cases have no involvement with a crime being committed whatsoever.   I truly hope this helps to clarify what our organization does and also helps to clear up the apparent misconceptions of the services we offer. As for the character of Cynthia Caron, I have known Cynthia for 36 yrs, and I have not only trusted her with my life, but also with the lives of my children and would most definitely trust her with the lives of my grandchildren. She is one of the most giving, committed, passionate, compassionate, and selfless individuals around. She is the mother of three children...her middle child, now a special needs young adult (of which Cynthia has legal guardianship) has provided her with a strong background in advocating for and helping those who cannot help themselves in many ways over the years from the Epilepsy Foundation to Parents of Children with OCD to the Autism Society and the Alzheimer's Association (not to mention the fact that throughout her childhood and early adulthood...until he could learn enough to establish an independent life himself... she served as being the eyes for her brother who was born blind and is only 11 months older than she. They have an extremely close bond, still today.) She has and maintains a superior and highly respected reputation, as does her organization. All who personally know her are in awe of her devoted commitment to aiding the families of the missing. She has a heart of gold, and is truly one of the best "good people" that I have been blessed to know in my life. Neither does she, nor her organization deserve the negative, demeaning, defamatory, and libelous comments and reviews that have been made about both. Anything that was "eyebrow raising" or maliciously done against Jennifer was NOT done by Cynthia or this organization. Again I would like to extend my deepest sympathies to all of Jennifer Ramsaran's loved ones...from the bottom of my heart I pray that you will be provided the strength to overcome your heartache and grief and I hope and pray that you will with little delay and absolute clarity get the answers needed in concern of her missing and her death...may she rest in peace.  Respectfully,Karen KreppsB.o.D.

The love and support from you, together with your production of multiple versions of the flyers, and follow-through until the thankfully brief search, meant an enormous amount. You are amazing and the work you do, which seems tireless and 24/7, is a true gift. I don't know how you find the strength to hear these stories and go after the efforts with such energy - you must be an angel. You were exactly right with your advice on how to locate our Holly and I'm beyond relieved that she was found. Of course we are devastated with the outcome, but surely it would have been worse if the search dragged on. Thank you a thousand thanks. With love and hope,Nicole

Texas Equisearch and CUE  will actually search- not send up lanterns and splash their logo all over. The organization exists solely for the ego of the owner. I have contacted their corporate sponsors.

Since day one of meeting Cynthia, she has been very helpful with any questions I may have & always responded in a very timely manor.  I'm happy that I can help my state to locate missing persons & am proud to be part of this team, they all work very hard.

Cynthia and the whole team are incredible. Always out to help new volunteers. I started in 2013 and am so thankful to be able to help. I would just like to say to end this is LostNMissing Inc is one of the best organizations for missing persons. The whole team works so hard to get missing persons out there. They go above and beyond.

LostNMissing, Inc	158772	1	/users/profile/94479	Angela S.	General Member of the Public	5	05/25/2013	I got interested in LostNMissing a few years ago when a situation with my family brought my attention to the number of homeless people who were going missing or dying under strange circumstances and nothing being done by the cops or anybody else in this one particular State which is Oregon.Then I noticed a few odd things that I picked up on regarding kids who seemed to appear in this one particular family for no reason and then sort of disappeared and I could never find a satisfactory explanation, so I started watching several missing sites and got so wrapped up in posting these missing people posts that I have actually made it my quest in life to keep on doing this because I believe that one day one of these posts will give me the proof that I need to nail certain people whom I believe are involved in the crimes mentioned above.    LostNMissing is a very fine and truthful website and that is why I use this site and three others every day.

LostNMissing, Inc	158637	11	/users/profile/210495	julieroberts0804	Professional with expertise in this field	1	05/23/2013	Mrs. Caron should be embarrassed and ashamed of her actions toward the family of Jennifer L. Ramsaran and toward the people who have helped  the family.  I have followed this case from the beginning and have been appalled at the way she has spoken of Jennifer and the people who formed a Facebook page to support finding her and then seek justice for her.   I have worked missing persons cases in the past and wouldn't hire this company. It is beyond reason why Mrs. Caron would continue on in a disrespectful manner, seeking vengeance long after a case that she said she no longer had anything to do with.  She blindly took Mr. Ramsaran's lies as truth without question, even when his statements to the press and videorecorded interviews rose serious suspicion in anyone who can see the forest through the trees. The URL links in below posts are unacceptable.  There appears to be grounds for a libel suit in my opinion.  I will never suggest her company to another family that ever seeks assistance in finding a missing person.  I am embarrassed that I have in the past. The fact that there are many positive reviews posted immediately after a negative review is posted is very telling.     
LostNMissing, Inc	158508	1	/users/profile/210303	AmandaKaye	Volunteer	5	05/22/2013	My name is Amanda and I have volunteered for LNM from time to time over the past 4 years. I would love to give more time but having children and a full time job only enables me so much time. I know firsthand the hours and time that Cynthia puts into her company and familys who have missing. She never stops until all needs are met and will work towards the near impossible and come out with solutions when obstacles stand in the way! I have learned and grown from her outstanding professional relationships with all she does! Anyone that is saying anything different does not know Cynthia!!! She is a mentor to many other organizations who come to her for assistance. She turns nobody away. She uses her own personal income to enhance her nonprofit funds when low. I swear she never sleeps. In reading reviews I can only say that proof is that never has a negative word or opinion been given to her by any family or anyone who knows her until this group of Facebook posters are parroting each other with unfounded and baseless accusations.

Thankfully Cnthia Caron came in my life as a gift from God as I see it. She has been a blessing, I call her my Special Angel Friend. Anyone that has been blessed to have the lostnmissing help them knows Cynthia and her organzation will help and do anything they can to help assist you in keep, finding and supporting families with Missing loved one's. Cynthia and LostnMissing I cannot thank you enough for the blessings you bestilled apon me and Ashley's family. Anyway I can help pay it forward know I'm alway's here to lend support. Thank youfor EVERYTHING your amazing and your organzation is WONDERFUL. I can honestly say I feel so blessed to have found this wonderful organzation but mostly the wonderful realtionship I have with Cynthia. Thank you LostNMissing keep up the great work and support, your a true blessing 
LostNMissing, Inc	150975	4	/users/profile/201362	Kyla S.	General Member of the Public	5	03/12/2013	My Cousin Ashley Carroll has been missing since 5/6/10 from the Albany, NY area , with no leads on her whereabouts. When Ashley first went Missing I was blessed to meet Cynthia Caron through devine intervention, if you were to ask me. Cynthia has been sooooo helpful in updating and circulating flyers for my missing cousin and our family. As if that wasn't enough for a complete stanger to do in our time of need, It got better. When another Missing person was found deceased :'( and they had a billboard getting ready to be set up in hope's to find her, I found out sadly she was found deceased and Cynthia reached out to me after speaking with  the friends, family and supporters of this other young lady's Missing case and offered that My cousin could be displayed on this billboard seeing how everything had already been paid , that truly was the most generous and kind gesture that anyone had done for our family. I'm truly sadden that the young lady the billboard was intended for was found deceased and my heart breaks for them because noone in this situation ever wants that outcome, however I feel blessed that My cousin was thought of and the other people involved decided to keep the monies and help another family in need, and we happened to be on the receving end of her kindness. I honestly Can't ever tell you how blessed to have people like Cynthia out here in the world because it make's me believe that Angel's do walk among us here on earth. I don't think there are enough word's to explain my greatfulness for all who do acts of kindness not because they have too but because they choose too. So to close this comment to everyone who has suffered behind having a Missing loved one know your not alone and there are amazing, loving and compassionate people out in the world that do care about our Missing loved one's and do whatever they can to help us find them, so that we should be greatful! Don't kill the messanger, there just trying to help! There using info provided to them and not always is the information 100% correct but there not putting information out to point fingers but rather to HELP FIND OUR MISSING!!! Tysm to all of you but a very extra special Thanks to Cynthia Caron who has been a true blessing XoXo
LostNMissing, Inc	158464	12	/users/profile/202628	warpnine	General Member of the Public	1	05/21/2013	I'm not going to personally attack Cynthia Caron, but I will question many of her choices in the Jennifer Ramsaran case.  Her decision to spend most of her time defending Ganesh instead of actually doing something for Jennifer was a very poor one.  It's difficult to help "so many" families with missing members if you're on the internet all day everyday  ranting on people who only want to see Justice for a woman who did nothing wrong other than to be murdered by her husband in cold blood.    This case is much more personal for my wife and I.  WE WERE JEN'S FRIENDS.  WE KNEW HER FOR 20 YEARS.   You've never met her, but assumed that everything the husband told you must be the truth.  Mistake #2.  If you had backtracked in Jan/Feb and said "ok, listen, I'm not going to continually defend Ganesh when we should be trying to find Jen.  THAT's the important thing here."  Didn't happen.  Instead, Jen is dragged through the mud by her husband in the media.  Did you ever question why he sat at home everyday while total strangers were looking for Jen?   You need to lay off the people who are upset on the J4J page. Those people have had to put up with a lot of threats (mostly from your organization), and silence (mostly from you deleting any comments where Ganesh's actions were questioned).   You cannot threaten anyone with fear tactics anymore.  You have no more bargaining chips left.  Your last one is sitting in a jail cell.  It would be best if you just shut it down and walked away.  You leave them alone.....they'll leave you alone.
LostNMissing, Inc	151741	15	/users/profile/202628	warpnine	General Member of the Public	1	03/27/2013	It's sad that LnM's employee's have to write reviews of their own organization just to try to keep up their "rating".   Perhaps they were a great and helpful organization to other families, but not to the family of Jennifer Renz Ramsaran.   Well, they were very nice to the missing victim's husband, and took every word of his as gospel.  Cynthia Caron spent more time on Websleuths and Facebook constantly defending Jennifer's suspected husband than anything else.  It's a shame she wasn't helping familes actually find missing people.  I know she didn't help them here.  From day 1, she became the husband's public relations rep, and because SHE "ruled him out", based on ONLY information that he gave her, he must not have had anything to do with her disappearance.  His alibi has so many holes in it, not to mention his affair, which Cynthia tried to downplay as a "one-time tryst". Because she took everything he said as fact, she tried to get the mother of the victim to announce that Jennifer was mentally ill and ran off on her own.  The poor victim's mom had to block Cynthia from her FB page the harrassment wouldn't stop.  Not to mention that EVERYTHING Joann Buff states in her review from earlier this March is absolutely true.  Instead of doing the right things to find Jennifer, Cynthia, on top of defending the husband and deleting ANY FB comments that posted an opinion that differed from hers, thought that posting Jen's likes and dislikes would be helpful to find her.  She doesn't like condiments on her hamburgers and only drinks water with lemon?  Excuse me while I alert CNN.  Cynthia also took the time to TRASH the MISSING PERSON.  She left her 3 children on her own right before one of the kid's birthdays and right before Christmas?  She hung out near local druggies so she must be a druggie?  She was on her phone all the time so she must have met up with someone online and just DITCHED her kids?The way you represented yourself and your "organization" in this case was absolutely deplorable.  You did nothing but dishonor Jennifer, her memory, and her family.  It is the hope of everyone that you cease discussing the case that you are no longer a part of, and stop threatening people with lawsuits for posting their opinions.  There's nothing you can do now to stop Remy from going to prison for the rest of his life.  You bought his story and now you're going down on a sinking ship.  It's a shame and while I would normally feel very sorry for you, I can't because of what you and Remy put Jennfer's family through.   "No prayers. Never."

Most I have found to be there for "their own selfish agendas " and "notoriety ". Lost and Missing truly cares for our missing, and sincerely want to help us thru the nightmare of losing a loved one. I am grateful for Cynthia and her foundation. Proud to be a small part of Lost and Missing. You can rest assured, if Cynthia says she is going to do something she will. Thank you Cynthia for seeing the need there is to help The Missing and the families left behind as something you felt passionate enough about to step up to the plate and try to make a difference in the lives of so many.We're Blessed to have you.

LostNMissing, Inc	151588	4	/users/profile/202392	Roxanne4	Volunteer	5	03/25/2013	I personally know that LostNMissing is great and very helpful to a lot of people . Everyone that is a volunteer does have a very big heart! Before I started to volunteer for LostNMissing if i was not sure on something i could send a message to Cynthia Caron, as I have her as a friend on Facebook, and she would find me the info that I need or tell me what I need to know.   I would tell anyone to have LostNMissing take their missing persons' case as Iknow that Cynthia Caron and all volunteers for are doing it from the heart. They really do care about everyone and they show their care. Thank you Cynthia Caron and LostNMissing for all the great work you do and keep it up! Those that do not have anything nice to say are just trying to make themselves look good and it is not making them look good at all .i am proud and happy to be part of lostnmissing . 
LostNMissing, Inc	158437	13	/users/profile/210212	Harmonica	General Member of the Public	1	05/21/2013	I am absolutely disgusted with Cynthia Caron's behavior. She defended Jennifer's husband since day one and treated Jenny's family horribly. She had the audacity to create a website to harass and provide personal information of those who spent many hours aiding in the search of Jennifer. I'm just blown away. I will be sending links to that website to every single person who has donated to her charity. 
LostNMissing, Inc	158420	2	/users/profile/210188	Marcus Dixon	General Member of the Public	5	05/21/2013	I have spent some time with members of lostnmissing and have seen how they spend so much time devoted to getting information out to the public about finding lost and missing people. This is a very hard working organization. Their work is superior and deserve a 5 star rating! Way to go lostnmissing ! keep up the great job you are doing!
LostNMissing, Inc	158352	12	/users/profile/200552	GregLR	Volunteer	1	05/20/2013	It is critical that anyone being threatened by Cynthia Caron of LostNMissing, consult with an attorney. All a cease & desist is, is a formal letter demanding that a party stops and refrains from an activity that the demanding person finds objectionable.   What she continues to do is considered a legal threat.  Mrs. Caron, you are a martyr and a bully. YOU made a decision in choosing to represent Ganesh Ramsaran.  In poor taste, you catered to his story and never did much to help find Jennifer.  In fact, you fed into his obvious lies and created enough drama to take the focus off of Jennifer and her family.  The most disturbing element is the lies you told.  You claimed to have insider information from local law enforcement and you posted consistently on Websleuths.com under the tag Lavanda Dolce  (sp?) where you claimed that you were working directly with law enforcement and you were backing Mr. Ramsaran 100%.   You fought with Jennifer's sister on social media sites all the while still defending a murderer.  You should be ashamed of yourself.  You can't seem to find it inside of your heart to apologize, can you?  Take some ownership, show some humbleness and then MAYBE you'll get 5% of respect from the majority affiliated in this case. Also, naming people's names on here or anywhere else for that matter is considered libel and slander. I'm not scared of you one bit and I don't find you of importance.   I am also not here under anyone's thumb.   Mrs. Caron, quite frankly, you disgust me.
LostNMissing, Inc	151795	17	/users/profile/200552	GregLR	General Member of the Public	1	03/28/2013	Mrs. Caron, you are nothing but an online bully. I cannot believe how unfprofessional you are.   This social media and online presence you have is only a detriment to your organization. Prior to this, you may have led a reputable organization but you are now carrying yourself in a manner in which does not suit a non profit organization, specifically focused on the missing. Your idle threats are disgusting.  I feel sad for those you are attacking.   I wish you had more tact and compassion. I cannot imagine you being a leader for this organization if this is your true personality.    Trace my IP, do what you need to do -  as a general member of the public,  I am entitled to my opinion and this behavior is disgraceful.   You do not scare me with your threats and bully behavior. ******Edit to respond to Info_lostnmissing - The behavior I find disgraceful is the continuous online drama.  If you are in a position that holds reputation and respect, I would think that your online presence is important to you.  I would think you take your job very seriously and would want to be noble, compassionate, sincere, honest, specific, tactful, & fair.  I haven't seen any of that.  I have followed your posts on Facebook and cannot believe the way you attack people for voicing an opinion, the way you block people who do not agree with your theories, & the way you slander people for having an opposing view.  You threaten various websites with lawsuits that are erroneous.   You state that you are a simple person who spends hours of your own time helping others, however; I have seen a lot of wasted time in the case of Jennifer Ramsaran. I do think that you didn't do Jennifer any justice when you spoke of her.  In fact, I didn't hear you mention much good about her.  I know that you received most of your information third hand but I hope that in your next case, you take the time to really talk to the right people.   I could spend hours here typing what I feel was done wrong but there's no point.  I hope you learned something.  No one is perfect and maybe you were misled by someone.  Maybe after there is an arrest, you'll have a better and different perspective.   I hope that's the case.   I'm only posting because I want justice for Jennifer and feel that you had the ability to do so much more to help her case and the side show circus and drama didn't help the investigation at all.  People wanted to trust and believe you and they sided with you for reasons unknown because of your name and organization.   I think that people are starting to think outside of the box now and develop theor own theory.  I think you should have kept your opinion more to yourself and state only facts.  Now facts are being put out there but for months, nothing much was said other than she didn't like whip cream and liked sleeping in.   I think the best thing you can do is just stop with the chaos.  Be humble, do the right thing and seek justice for Jennifer as well.

Last night i got a message from Cynthia Carson from lost n missing. Not only did she update my moms flier for this year. She surprised and amazed me with a age enhancement picture of my mom. This has brought tears to my eyes. And i do think god had his hand in this. I will never beable to say thank you enough. I wish their were more organizations like lost n missing out their!

They devoted themselves entirely by making numerous efforts to help Law enforcement without interfering.  I cannot say enough about Cynthia and what she has done and all she sacrifices for others by her efforts.  She is an angel, an un selfish, compassionate, strong woman  who will embrace you like she has known you for years.  The Lost & Missing staff are all amazing...thank you for helping an old friend and his family.

Our search for our son came to a tragic end and I don't know how we could have held up if not for the help of lostnmissing.They made missing person flyers and helped our family get billboards(at no cost to our family)thru out the Boston area. Lostnmissing did not stop when Dennis was found they have continued to be a source of strength to our family thru these very difficult days.Our family do not have enough words to express how much we have been comforted and helped by Cynthia and all the staff at lostnmissing.With our thanksEd bushard

LostNMissing, Inc	154601	2	/users/profile/205444	SAVEDbyaANGEL	Client Served	5	04/13/2013	December 11, 2012, my good friend, Jennifer Ramsaran became missing.  My husband was the one who noticed her husbands Facebook page first.  Remy posted his plea of help to all his family and friends that she did not return home from a trip to the mall in Syracuse, NY.  I was in shock and in horror to find out and read about this.  Im sure that every person who was ever close to her felt the same way.  Each day seemed like an eternity, and I could not imagine what Remy and his children were going through.  My close friend who is Jennys friend as well, recommended to Remy that a Facebook page be set up for her being missing.  When this comment was made, NO ONE offered to set up a page for her, this includes close family and friends.  So I offered to help Remy set one up.  He was emotionally drained and exhausted from this whole ordeal of what he and his children were going through.  I started the page on January 1st, 2013, to help Remy and of course Jenny.  Within a couple days, there were horrible and mean comments accusing Remy of being the one who harmed, hurt and even killed Jenny.  I could not even believe that people would even be posting these horrible comments.  Remy, his children, his family, his close friends, were all reading these awful comments.  I had to delete and even ban people so they could not post again their hateful messages to the public.  I am a good friend to the Ramsarans, and I truly believe Remy had nothing to do with Jenny being killed.  He will remain innocent in my eyes, unless proven otherwise by the police department.  One of the people that I banned was angry over it, and started their own Facebook page for Jenny.  The rude, horrible comments and gossip that they made towards Remy and the page I set up were unbelievable.  These same people were also posting on the websleuths website, and also under all the news articles that were posted online about Jenny.  It was done hourly, day-by-day.  I had to sit and watch my computer all day long, trying to stop this craziness that these people who claimed to be caring and doing all they could for Jenny, post mean and hateful comments about Remy and or my page I set up.  I was so stressed and getting very depressed during these weeks.  I as well have a very large family to take care of and think of.  I did not know what to do or how to deal with all the mental stress for all of this.  I too was dealing with Jenny being missing and scenarios of what could have happened to her.  I was suffering myself.  All I thought I was doing was just setting a Facebook page up for Remy and that was it.  I didnt know that this was going to consume every hour and minute of my life.  The pain and anguish it caused Remy, his kids, his close family and friends, and myself was AWFUL!  I had NO idea what to do my husband just wanted me to stop the page.  But with all the lies and untruths that were being brought up on the other page, there needed to be a page that had the truth and honestly trying to help find her.  I really dont see how this other page and people who comment horrible gossip, could think they have done nothing wrong.  When a person makes a rude, judging, blaming comment that in itself is wrong.  I really did not know what to do.  One day I saw a comment made by Cynthia Caron.  It was obvious there was a conflict going on between the 2 pages.  She seemed to notice this, so she posted an article she made about how to put a Facebook page, website, etc up for a missing person.  What to do and what not to do.  I read it, and was so RELIEVED!  I had to contact her to get more information and what I could do about this horrible mess.  I have never seen anything so horrible as to what was happening on the other Facebook page and other websites.  I talked to her on the phone and relayed everything I was going through that was happening to Remy.  It was a HUGE relief to me that she understood and has dealt with similar situations as this.   She explained all the services her LostNMissing organization did to help the families who have a family member that is missing.  The JOY I felt when I found her and the answers I was given to help was AMAZING.  The first thing was I contacted Remy and had the 2 talk together.  Remy and I both did not know how to handle the media about this horrible situation.  Remy and I were both in tears of GRATITUDE Cynthia Caron was an ANGEL sent to HELP us.  She SAVED us from this AWFUL HELL that we were going through.  The sheer RELIEF was amazing  Cynthia, immediately that day set up a website and blog for Jenny.  She was so on the ball to help.  She even went on websleuths website to make comments and to try to squash all the horrible gossiping that was going on.  She had some of her staff added to the Facebook page, and they were constantly on top of all the rude and horrible comments people tried to put on her Facebook page that I set up.  This page was meant to help find her, not accuse Remy of doing anything or not doing anything.  I am a good friend who set up this page and why would I want hateful mean comments being said on it.  What friend would want hateful mean comments being said about their friend?  I know I wouldnt.  It seemed after awhile after the hateful mean comments and even quoting comments Remy made on his personal Facebook page, the mean comments started to be directed to Cynthia Caron.  It was AWFUL to see this happen to such a WONDERFUL person and organization.  This woman and her staff, spend hours upon hours of their time, NOT being paid, but by SELF SERVICE to OTHERS and try to help families with missing family members.  What is so awful is, that close family, friends and these people who are thinking they are helping, did not know the personal information and the private police investigation that were and is currently happening.  These things are still NOT disclosed to the public.  So these horrible accusations are going on, but they do not know what is being held from the public.  Remy seemed to be put on the cross by others.  I feel when the truth comes out, they still will believe their awful gossiping rumors and I feel their opinions and judgments will not change.  I wish I lived closer so I could of helped personally put up fliers, go door to door talking with neighbors, but I couldnt.  All I could do was help put up a Facebook page and keep sharing her photo and information with friends of mine on Facebook.  I was BLESSED by ANGELS from the LostNMissing Organization to come SAVE us from the media, etc.  They were and are a Godsend!  I wish I was closer to have attended the wonderful Shining Hope event that LostNMissing put together for Jenny.  Only Remy, his children, his parents and close friends attended this event.  No one from Jennys side of the family or others who claimed to want to find Jenny (and setting up the other Facebook page), ever attended this event.  These other judgmental people, family members, etc, did not come to support Jennys husband and her children.  I feel that is very sad.  It was a beautiful event from the photos that were posted.  It was still criticized by others on the other Facebook page.  Cynthia Caron and LostNMissing is now being crucified by these judgmental people.  Some of them have also put fake Facebook profiles up so no one even knows who they are.  Its pretty freaky, that these judgmental people are out there, and creating a horrible horrible mess with this all and keep putting up fake profiles of who they are, and hiding themselves.  Its scary.  Some of these Facebook members from the other site are even stalking Remy, his children and close friends of his.  This is scary.  Remy, his children, family and friends, are already going through a horrible ordeal as it is.  Why should they feel their lives are in jeopardy as well?  The only SAVIOR from the whole media mess and wars was and is Cynthia Caron and her LostNMissing organization.  She seriously is doing this out of her LOVING and KIND HEART to help those families who are in pain and suffering from a missing family member.  PLEASE do not read or believe these hateful comments.  Cynthia saved Remy, his children, family and close friends from the media wars that took place.  I am sure this is the worst she has ever seen.  I hope its the only one she will ever see.  But she is there to HELP, she has a lot of information, a lot of guidance, love, understanding to you and your family, if your family member is missing.  She will guide you through anything and everything you need help with.  Its hard when you feel like theres nothing you can do, and your numb and feel like you cant move.  LostNMissing will HOLD your HAND and guide you through this!  PLEASE let them help you!  I would give my recommendation to ANYONE and EVERYONE who has a family member that is missing.  I pray you dont have to deal with that.  But if it does she is an ANGEL I believe my Heavenly Father sent her to help us  He sends people here on the earth to help each other to not let us go through the pain and trials alone.  Please contact LostNMissing Becky W.
LostNMissing, Inc	154592	1	/users/profile/200784	Krista4	Volunteer	5	04/13/2013	I simply want to add to my first review, now that I've had some time to truly get started as a volunteer for Lost N Missing...having had not only the pleasure, but the HONOR of being part of this remarkable organization I am blown away by the work they, and especially LnM's founder and president Cynthia Caron does on a daily basis for the countless family members of those who are missing.  Reading the attacks brought on by a very select few who have organized a mob style defamation of character against both Mrs. Caron and her organization breaks my heart.  It makes me truly question their agenda and what they are hoping to gain by such malicious actions - do they think all of the families who receive the help of Lost N Missing would be better off if they somehow were ever able to dismantle the company?  Do they believe that those who are missing would be better off without the aid and awareness that I, countless other volunteers and Cynthia work so hard to achieve for them?  Do they believe that the hope we try to instill,\or the support that we do all we can to offer is all for nothing?  Because while having worked for LnM, while having even just read the NUMEROUS glowing reviews that family members have taken time out to written during such horrific times in their lives, I know that the work we do is not only needed, important, selfless, and at the highest quality possible - but that without Lost N Missing this country would be at a huge disadvantage.  After years of building this organization to what it is, and the hope of what it can continue to grow into - how sad and discouraging it much be for the founder who has poured her heart and soul into helping others, to have to fear that accepting one case has potentially had grave consequences for all the other future cases to come.  With all of this being said - again I just want to put much emphasis on how proud I am of myself for being a part of this non profit organization, and what a truly honoring and humbling experience it was to have even been asked in the first place!  No matter what I pray that Mrs. Caron is able to continue her work, and that those who are obsessed with tearing her down find compassion and humanity within themselves to think before they act - to look at the big picture before they are so quick to judge and point fingers at someone elses efforts, and ask themselves where were they, and what did they do to help in the case that's being referred?  Because having been there from day 11 of Jennifer Ramsaran's disapearence, until her body was found and who still is in contact with friends, her children and husband - I saw first hand the endless efforts made by LnM to help aid in any efforts to bring Jennifer home, I witnessed the hours upon hours that went into trying to correct lies and fabrications so the correct information was being put out there and rumors were being corrected.  I saw who it was that was on television pleading for support, and who was not.  So where were all of you who are pointing fingers and being critical?  Were you raising money for fliers, billboards, etc?  Were you doing interviews or speaking endlessly with anyone you could to bring awareness?  Were you being attacked privately and professionally for not a single just reason?  Were you sitting down next to or speaking with the young children who in the end lost their mom?  Because I know Cynthia was!  I know that I was!  So again trying to be as respectful as possible - I can only ask WHERE WERE YOU?  With that all being said I hate every time I get assigned a new task and wish there was no need for the position I have within Lost N Missing, I wish we all lived in a world where Cynthia's services were no where near as in demand as they are....but that's not the case, and the fact is that this organization is needed more and more on a daily basis...so I can only hope and pray that the work we do continues, and that we're able to for future years and years to come be able to still do all we can for those who are missing and to support their families!  Again thank you for starting this organization to begin with Mrs. Caron, and I thank you with my entire heart that you saw something in me that filled the high expectations and standards you hold for those who assist in the work you do.  To the families I've already worked with and the families I will meet in the future - my heart aches for you, and I will always, as everyone else at Lost N Missing does, give 100% into doing all I can for you and your loved one!  Blessings!Krista L Foos - Event Coordinator for Lost N Missing
LostNMissing, Inc	150586	5	/users/profile/200784	Krista4	Volunteer	5	03/05/2013	I first became introduced to Lost N Missing, and Cynthia Caron about 6 weeks ago and was working closely with Mrs Caron  to aid in a case that I had been introduced to by members of a family whom needed assistance.  Due to the unbelievable professionalism, dedication and amazing work this organization does and that I was seeing first hand, I inquired about becoming a full time volunteer and was humbled and honored to have been accepted as part of the LNM team, taking on the role of Event Coordinator.  I am not only looking forward to beginning work with this organization, again I am honored to be part of such an amazing group of people.  If God Forbid I was ever in a situation where i needed assistance from an organization such as this, I could only pray that LNM would be able to come to my aid.  Mrs. Caron is one of the single most dedicated volunteers that I have not only come in contact with, but have ever heard of - and recently seeing this organizations 5 star rating being lowered by some hateful people or for all we know just one or two people with many accounts, all in the span of one or two days - all regarding one case - is gut wrenching....because before looking into joining this team, I read countless reviews, looked over countless cases they have worked on, and without Lost N Missing this country would be a much sadder place - with much less help offered to those in need!  Again it is with great excitement, dedication and honor that I look forward to diving in and aiding in this cause.  
LostNMissing, Inc	154530	24	/users/profile/205364	Patricia64	Volunteer	1	04/12/2013	 Who's the bully here? Conversation started March 23Patricia Powell BeckerI am Jennifer Renz Ramsaran's aunt. Why am I banned from posting on her L&M site? 8:06amPatricia Powell BeckerLet me rephrase, Why was I banned from posting there? 10:32amCynthia CaronPatricia, I have 3 other Adm and myself and Remy's friend who are ADM on that site. I have no idea who banned you nor why. I only know that there was a few days that a ton of people were posting horrible things and turning that page into a circus and many were banned. Fact is, I also know posts disappeared that was not from anyone but from a Facebook glitch as my own posts disappeared. One post in particular was a beautiful poem that I wrote, and wrote it directly on the page not copied and pasted, and it even disappeared. I believe that is when I wrote on the page that posts were disappearing.Many people do not know the truth as it pertains to those who were ADM the HFJR page. Nobody knows the horrible and cruel things they did to draw Joann into their web of deceit. I have asked her very kindly on a number of occasions to call me or to listen to what I know and what I've seen....and all the screenshots that I have collected to show proof that what she said that I said and/or did about Jennifer is all blatant lies.This attack against my company is not just a malicious campaign by Kevin and Tracy...but is a full legal problem in so many ways as they have falsely called and made reports (and put it in writing to me) to the Attorney General of NH.So not only am I being maliciously attacked, my company attacked, my name and person attacked....but nobody and I mean nobody ever bothered to come to me direct and say..."what is going on?" or "why was I banned?".......instead, people used their pain, hurt and anger by attacking me. What is mind boggling is why Joann would repeat their words knowing full well what they are saying is false. NEVER did I contact Carol and demand to know (incessantly) if Jenn was "mentally ill" and never did I phone her and never did I write her over and over and harass her. I sent Carol one message to discuss the Shining Hope Event and I have that one message.That page was shut down as I was told from my staff that yesterday they were planning campaigns against the Sheriff Dept of "flooding them" with calls and demanding answers as to why Remy has not been arrested yet. They also wrote a lot of stuff about Remy's dad. (I don't know what was written or said I did not see any of it but was told what happened.) I also know the District Attorney was well aware of the problems on that site as they were writing information that pertained to the case and investigation and at that...their information was wrong.I cannot expand further than that but can only say if I had the "power" to have shut that page down...believe me...I would have had it shut down at the get go...the very moment I learned the lies that Kevin Ryan was telling Joann....and the 11 screen names that Jillian has gathered and used to cause malicious havoc in numerous sites. Did they think this was my first missing person to be a potential homicide victim? Or my first case in which a family was divided? Or our first time representing someone that potentially could have been the one who caused harm to the missing loved one? I knew I needed to keep 100% accurate records from the start, all documentation and all screenshots. In the meantime while their "worldwide professional PI and his sidekick TracyakaJillianakaJackakaJennifer professed to have gotten two billboards...of which nobody ever saw and you know as well as I they would have posted photos of it....lied and said that Remy and I halted the searches....of which she admitted that Cobb told her no at the get go...and just kept spinning a web of deceit that was NOT about Finding Jennifer (as what did they really do to find her? Lie and say they were trompsing through fields?The really "funny" one was when she said she was at the apartments and hanging posters and talked door to door to all the residents ! Ironically she picked the perfect time to say she was there...it was when WE were there and trust me when I say...she was NOT there and there were NOT posters there except the ones we put up and photographed. She wrote that she interviewed the residents and Jenn's car was there no more than two days??? And Joann wonders why the site was taken down?I have to tell you Patricia....in any other case....and we do over 300 families per year of which 12 - 15 are usually of this magnitude.....I am still amazed that she was not arrested for interference of a criminal investigation. Any other Sheriff and State Police that I have worked with would have given her ONE warning and once it was not obeyed...would have been arrested and charged. They are both very lucky from that aspect. Course it's not over for them yet as now they do have to answer to what they did to me, my company and my work.I do have numerous screen shots if you're interested in seeing some of the truth. All I tried to do was PROTECT ALL of Jennifer's family...including Joann, Carol and Tom...from what I knew about them and Patricia....I'm not being arrogant when I say this....I am saying this from experience...none of what happened would have. Joann and her family did NOT need all that drama and interference and I certainly did not need to have experienced such awful harassment against my company and myself.March 23 1:56pmPatricia Powell BeckerWow, not the information that I expected. So...,I ask again. I am Jennifer Renz Ramsaran's aunt. Can you find out why was I banned from posting on her L&M site? BTW, I have no clue about who many of the people are that you speak of above. I know my sister-in-law, brother-in-law, my nieces & nephew-in-law but I'm out of the loop about what you are talking about above. I see the family members about once a year. The last time I saw them, before March 5, 2013, was at Tom's 70th birthday celebration. 2:13pmCynthia CaronBut you are not banned from that site??? I went and looked. Are you talking about Jennifer L. Ramsaran - Missing Person ???Because you are not banned. Posts that disappeared did not mean banned. I did change the settings for a period of time so that NO posts were made when Jennifer's earthly body was located as we couldnt keep up with the negative posts. IT was better to block all posting. I just went and looked and Patricia, you are not a blocked person. 2:14pmCynthia CaronPlease go and look and when I get back home in an hour if you are still blocked/banned let me know and I will have to check further. I have to tell you honestly that it is very difficult to keep up with Facebook and their ever changing ways. 2:18pmCynthia CaronIf it were not for the outreach of the public to see our missing loved ones. I would not even be on here. Also, here are some screenshots. Please tell me where Joann can possibly state that I was unprofessional to the family? I will send more later. 2:31pmPatricia Powell BeckerI have no clue as to what your interaction has been with the family or your relationship with them is. I know that I WAS blocked from posting on that site, but am no longer blocked at Jennifer L. Ramsaran - Missing Person. That's why I rephrased from "am" to "was" banned. I can't find my few posts that I put on there though. Has the name of that site been changed from when I posted? BTW, I can't see those screen shots, too tiny for my eyesight. 2:47pmCynthia CaronI don't know where posts went or my poem. Fact is even the earlier from missing us gone, however....I know how ours are gone because when we make posters of missing we post and upload on our site first. The reason is those who share will have friends who share and their friends...etc. So when located we delete from our page which then deletes from anyone else who may have it. It also takes the comments away and is also deleted with the poster. It has to be done that way else posters will be shared six months from now and the person is no longer missing. 2:50pmPatricia Powell BeckerThe posts on the site only date back to Feb 22 2:56pmCynthia CaronUnfortunately I had only one interaction with Jenn's mom and she wanted nothing to do with my company or help. Jenns sister never responded until after body found and has been very upset and has posted a lot of things she believes from two Internet bloggers of which one professes to be a private investigator and I have a personal libel case w my attorney now for blatant lies they've told and done and for cyber harrassnent against me and my nonprofit company. Apparently Joann chooses to believe them? I am so very sorry for the loss of your niece . My own daughter only a few years younger. I cannot imagine. 2:59pmCynthia CaronLibel is Against the two people. Not Joann.Yes I gave you more info as I thought your message was going to start harassing me as I've been getting people from the other site who think we I shut it down. 3:15pmPatricia Powell BeckerI'm quite sure that during the time that I was blocked from posting on that site that I was able to see other people posting to the site. 3:27pmCynthia CaronAny person who had problems should have contacted me either via Facebook or email...even through our website. I can't answer to who, why or how you were not able to post?
LostNMissing, Inc	154389	27	/users/profile/205222	stephshapiro	General Member of the Public	1	04/12/2013	I am also a cousin to Jennifer Ramsaran.  I would like to address several of the issues that arise from the previous posts.  Kudos, Lindsay, I feel that your post was well-written, civil, and to the point.  I am one of the family members that was blocked from posting on the Lost-n-Missing facebook page.  The morning after Jenny's body was located, information regarding this was posted on facebook.  The admin of the Lost-n-Missing page lambasted the Help Find Jennifer Ramsaran site for posting the information, claiming that the family had not been notified.  I simply stated that our family did know Tuesday evening, and that I received my phone call by 5:30 A.M. on Wednesday morning from a family member so that I would not get to work and find out.  For this, I was blocked.  In fact, later that entire post was removed.  This is just one of many examples that I can think of in which the admin of the site has mistreated family members.  That same day, an aunt of Jenny's from her mother's side contacted me and said she had been blocked as well for asking questions about what was posted.  Numerous family members have informed me that they feel harassed, specifically by Cynthia.  They feel that she was argumentative with and even aggressive toward them.  I was also the family member informed by an employee of the newspaper in question that Cynthia did in fact reveal the information, and then tell the reporter, "By the way, that's off the record."  My biggest complaint is that Cynthia took into account the word of only one member of this very large family, and took those words at gospel truth.  All the family is asking for is some open-mindedness and a willingness to consider that the real truth may be something other than what she is hearing.  Jo ann has NEVER requested that any of us make any posts regarding this issue.  This is something that has been highly upsetting to many of us, to the point that some are incapable of responding because they are so hurt emotionally by Cynthia's actions. Lindsay is very well-informed, reads many sites regularly, and has screen shots on her phone of posts that were made, and then removed.  So, yes, she has the information to back up what she is saying. Other family members have emails with the postings that we were sending to each other that have since been taken down from facebook.  There are MANY of us...plenty to catch what has been put up before it is removed. I am sincerely happy to see that other families have had good experiences with this organization, but as for me and my family, we cannot recommend this organization to anyone. It saddens me to say, as this is such a traumatic event for any family, and one would hope that an organization trying to help would bring hope and help, not chaos and emotional distress.
LostNMissing, Inc	154336	36	/users/profile/205165	Lindsay14	General Member of the Public	1	04/11/2013	My name is Lindsay Renz and I am Jennifer Ramsaran's cousin. I've had a lot of trouble deciding what to write about Lost N Missing and Cynthia Carron as its representative-- not because I'm afraid Ms. Carron will threaten to sue me like she has several others, but because there are so many examples of Ms. Carron's unprofessional behavior since she began acting as a representative of Jennys husband. Ive decided to limit myself to four examples. 1)On the Facebook page that Ms. Carron administrated she frequently alluded to changes in Jens personality over the past 9 months implying that those changes were a reason for Jenny to run away and leave her childrensomething anyone who knew Jen knew was impossible. We couldnt understand why Ms. Carron would go to such lengths to disparage the victims character. In addition, several family members had their posts deleted or blocked. Given that they typically started with Im Jennys [insert family relationship] I really have trouble believing that Ms. Carron was unaware she was blocking family members. I also have serious concerns about Ms. Carrons ability to manage a Facebook account, given how many posts were mysteriously deleted. Ms. Carron frequently claimed that she was not deleting posts so the rate at which they vanished was concerningso much so that I started taking screen shots of everything I could. 2)When a local reporter obtained information about blood evidence found in Jennys van and her husbands affair, Ms. Carron confirmed it for him and suggested that the blood was from a nose bleed. She then characterized the affair as a one-time, alcohol fueled incident that was irrelevant as Ms. Carron was certain that Jenny was unaware of it.  Clearly Ms. Carron felt the affair was irrelevant as she included the mistress in a web video memorializing Jen. In my mind, the correct response would be no comment or to refer the reporter to the police.Regardless, I dont know how she could make either statement given she admitted that the police were not providing her case information and its impossible for anyone to say what Jenny knew or didnt know unless Jenny had shared that with themherself. Ms. Carron never met Jenny and therefore it is impossible that Jenny wouldve confided in her. 3)Ms. Carrons obvious antagonism toward others in the community who made efforts to find Jenny and make others aware that she was missing. While I understand people have strong feelings, I would have assumed that Ms. Carron, as a professional, would have been able to control herself. I haveclosely followed the Facebook wars as well as the websleuths boards where Ms. Carron posted. As far as I could see, the only person acting antagonistically was Ms. Carron. 4)On the websleuths board, posting under the screen name Lavanda Dolce, Ms. Carrons unprofessionalism was even more blatant. At one point she posted that my uncle (Jennys father) didnt want her reported missing. What Ms. Carron omitted was that this was at5:30PM. Jen was due home at5PMand her planned trip was 1-1  hours each way. Perhaps Ms. Carron had good intentions and things just got out of her control. I dont know. Based on some of the older reviews here, there are a lot of people who believe that Ms. Carron and Lost N Missing helped them. All I can say is that I would tell anyone that I knew to avoid Lost N Missing, especially if there are questionable circumstances in your loved ones disappearance. What I do know is that Ms. Carrons actions and words have been deeply hurtful to me and my family. I dont know exactly what happened to JennyI have to trust that the police and district attorney will do their jobs and that our family will see justice served. At this point the only thing I can do is make people aware of Ms. Carrons inexplicably unprofessional actions in Jennys case and try to spare another family the pain she has caused mine.    Response to Cynthia Carron, 4/11/2013: Ms. Carron,  I wrote this post based upon comments made by you or those acting on behalf of your organization posting on the Facebook page you were acting as admin on and via other social media.  While I was not commenting on either facebook page until very recently I can assure you I read them and the websleuths board several times per day.    I am confident in my facts and stand by everything I have written above. In regards to #4 above, unless you are going to claim that you were not posting as "Lavanda Dolce" you did claim that my uncle told Jenny's husband not to report her missing after he was called in AZ.   I can't say for sure who gave you that information but it was posted by "Lavanda Dolce."   I don't appreciate being called a lier. In regards to your discussion with Mr Mahony, I read both the article and your response to him.  I don't believe you gave him the information-- I'm sure he got that elsewhere, but I believe you confirmed it.  However, you are correct, I wasn't involved in that phone call and don't know the exact content.  But the simple fact is after everything you have said and done in the past few months I find him to be far more creditable. This is a site to review non-profits and specifically requests candid and personal reviews.  I am writting a review that includes my opinion and the reasons I arrived at those opinions.   I can assure you that my cousin, Joann Buff did not write a single word in this review or request that I post it, so I would appreciate it if you could direct your comments/complaints to me.  
LostNMissing, Inc	154075	5	/users/profile/204906	MissingAngel305	Client Served	5	04/10/2013	LostNmissing came in to my life when I most needed the support of someone. Not only did they take their time to listen to me but they also went above and beyond their call of duty to help and assist in spreading the word of my missing son Angel "Ito" Garcia missing status amoung other services. LostNmissing provided all the needed materials to mark the one year anniversary of my son's disappearance, they have and still continue to provide me as well as the rest of the family and friends with personal attention. I am pleased to say that LostNmissing have jumped through many hoops to help obtain a donation of a billboard to help spread the word of my son's disappearing and thanks to their hard work and commitment they succeded.  They not only volunteer to help with the Vigil, and the billboard but they also offered their services to help with any upcoming searches should we have any one come up. LostNmissing  continuosly update and spread any new information via the internet  through a page that they have created for my son, their own page and facebook. LostNmissing with their genuine, dedicated and persistance way they have helped me, my family and friends not only to understand the meaning of the word "volunteer" but also the value of volunteering. There are many things that we cherish in this live, for many of us is our families, our homes, our jobs, life itself and for others it's just about what they have or don't have but for me the act of GIVING is one of the most beautiful guesture of man kind. Thank you Cynthia for your hard work and thank you to the wonderfull team of Angels who also helped very much to make everything possible. God bless you all!Love, Laura

They are truly a godsend to us families with missing people. And there is so little help out there. Especially if your missing loved one is adult. They don't care if it's and adult or child. They reach out and try to help all families without descrimination. We am very blessed to have them on our side. Thank you for all you do.

Client Served	5	03/02/2013	I have had the pleasure of speaking to Cynthis Caran on the phone and having a lot of contact with her online. Lost N Missing has done more for us and our missing daughter than any other organization. They have sponsored rallies for us. They've rented rooms for us while we was out searching for our missing daughter. Even when we was stranded in that city I called Cynthia and she instantly rented us a room.  This organization has designed many fliers for me. Sent me many fliers free to use for searching. They are an honest and most helpful group of people that I have ever known. They even designed a Christmas picture for me of Christina, along with many other missing people, and when I told Cynthia I wish i could afford to have copies made for Christmas cards she ordered them for me. It didn't cost a lt but it meant the world to me. We struggle financially. And all the help they have given us means a lot to us.  Her fb page is committed to the missing also. She shares missing people information daily and is truly there for their families. I feel she is a friend to me for life. Not many people reach out to missing families and especially offer the support that she does. I cannot imagine her doing anything intentional that is hurtful to anyone.Cynthia is a God send to me and many others.

I do not know the details of that incident, but I do know that a lot of families have been assisted by this organization without any negative issues. I have also had not had any negative issues dealing with the organization. There are two sides to every story and this is not the forum for a dispute to be settled in. This is an organization that assists missing persons families in an attempt to find their loved ones. I have seen this work first hand and have not noticed any problems, only the sharing of missing person information on the internet to assist in finding and trying to bring home missing persons.

They changed my life, and I truly believe that the work they helped my family with led to the finding of my step father. In a time of need when someone that is a staple in your everyday life goes missing, you don't need people to tell you everything is going to be OK, you need people that have gone through what you have, people who have the same dreams and hopes to find missing people, someone who actually can fathom even a morsel of what your going through. The staff at lostnmissing are those people. They have changed my life, and the life of those around me. I can not thank them enough for lending me a little bit of their hope, when my well was almost dry.
LostNMissing, Inc	152328	3	/users/profile/203361	Laurie36	General Member of the Public	5	04/05/2013	My first experience with LostNMissing, I had attended a vigil for my friends missing baby girl. After seeing LostNMissing in action, I was so impressed. The lengths that they went to for just one little girl? After speaking briefly at the vigil with my friend, She began telling me how she does not know how she would be getting through this without (Cynthia) LostNMissing. Of course I had already seen the many fliers and many postings from them to spread awareness. At that very moment speaking with the mother of this missing baby girl with tears in her eyes, I became very aware the importance of this organization. So naturally when another friend recently came to me very upset that her Brother in law who had mental illness went missing and she didn't know what to do, I immediately asked her if she had contacted Cynthia from LostNMissing and gave her the information to do that. Literally within the hour I was seeing postings and pleas to share them. With permission this family was contacted by LostNMissing and sent me emails thanking me for putting them in contact. This non profitable organization stuck by this family the entire time. The missing person was found to have committed suicide and yet again, LostNMissing was right there to offer their services and with so much love and care, this family was able to not only have some closure but to have the genuine and continued support from the most amazing people. For this, I am so very grateful and God forbid, If I ever was in this position, I would not just want but NEED them in my corner. Volunteers that go so far above and beyond.

LostNMissing came in and  created a beautiful new flier for Ali and sent it out to everyone of their contacts and social networking pages. It helped reach so many new people that had not seen or heard of my daughter before. Since then we continue to get new tips. And most of all we continue to have HOPE.
LostNMissing, Inc	152212	2	/users/profile/174708	Cheryl1967	Client Served	5	04/05/2013	My niece Kelly Armstrong was murdered by her boyfriend Travis Funke.  Lost and Missing helped us with the awareness we needed to find her remains. They helped us with a balloon launch and also a poster distribution. Cynthia has been there through this 2 year process by supporting my family and myself with questions. She gave us positive support to not give up and be strong. She was there to hear our cries and even gave a shoulder to cry on. This organization is an A+ in my book. I have been able to call when sad. or email her with my concerns. She helped us to set up searches and directed the family in how to get this all put together. My niece is still missing and Cynthia has helped me not to give up the possibility that she will come home. Maybe not today or next year but I am hopeful because of Lost and missing.. 
LostNMissing, Inc	129339		/users/profile/174708	Cheryl1967	General Member of the Public	5	10/25/2012	Cynthia and LostnMissing have been my backbone for the last year and 3 months. She is quick to reply to my emails. She helped with a candlelight vigil when my niece was reported missing September 2011. She has been there through all of it. My niece was murdered by her boyfriend who has  said he put her in the lanfill. We have not found her but Cynthia is there when I feel lost and sad.. LostnMissing is a wonderful start when you are lost from a loved one who is missing or murdered. 
LostNMissing, Inc	151857	21	/users/profile/202764	onlyforjennifernow	General Member of the Public	1	03/29/2013	Back off Cynthia Caron.  Your organization has given the husband of Jennifer Ramsaran a public voice.  Jennifer's husband has NOT been ruled out as a POI in her disappearance and death.   Please let others who choose to be a voice for Jennifer carry on with their good work in peace.  The local general public supports them, it does not support an out-of-state, out-of-touch organization like yours.
LostNMissing, Inc	151680	4	/users/profile/202531	Kasey A.	General Member of the Public	5	03/26/2013	 Being a person involved in the "world of the missing" I have come in contact with LostnMissing on many occasions. I have also followed much of their work. I have witnessed very empathetic, helpful, well informed. Hard work. LostnMissing would be the FIRST organization I would recommend any family unfortunate enough to be walking the road of "The Missing". God Bless.
LostNMissing, Inc	151480	6	/users/profile/202237	Peace4u	Professional with expertise in this field	5	03/22/2013	I would like to address all the nay-sayers of LostnMissing, Inc. & esp., the friends of Jennifer Ramsaran who feel it necessary to spill the second phase of Grief; Anger, all over this review board. When a loved one goes missing it is a very painful experience which I personally am living through everyday. My Mother In-Law went missing last month, and to this day we still have no leads and her whereabouts & car still have not been found. But each and every day I still have hope and faith that one day we will have closure and she will be found. I am a Funeral Industry professional with many years of experience dealing with families who have lost a loved one as well as losing many friends to tragedies and or disease. I guess you could say I know Death very well, unfortunately.  May I suggest you funnel your energies into Grief Counseling and or Grief Therapy to help heal, because the road ahead may be a very difficult one. There are five stages/psychological responses to dying; 1- Denial, 2- Anger, 3- Bargaining, 4- Depression and 5- Acceptance. I truly am sorry for your loss of Jennifer, but please step back for a moment and reflect on Jennifer's life and love for you. Now, let me leave you with one of my favorite sayings - "Death leaves a heartache no one can heal, love leaves a memory no one can steal"
LostNMissing, Inc	151468	42	/users/profile/202219	Joann Buff	General Member of the Public	1	03/21/2013	First of all, none of the above "roles" accurately describes my position.  I am the sister of Jennifer Ramsaran whom Cynthia Caron took on as a missing person case from her husband, but not by my family.  I cannot supply a complete review at this time due to a pending investigation.  I can, however write about Ms. Caron denying that she sent a private investigator to see me regarding the private investigator that I chose to work with on the day that it was confirmed that the body found was indeed my sister's.  This PI spent about ten minutes at my brother-in-law's home (her client), then he came to my parents house (next door) and spoke to my husband.  He identified himself as working for both Ms. Caron and G. Ramsaran.  He gave his name and license number to my husband, re-iterated Caron's repeated efforts to slander the PI advising my family, and then spent another hour at Ramsaran's home.  I was so disgusted by this ill-timed visit and lack of compassion from someone who runs a missing person's organization that I contacted both my own PI and also Lt. R. Cobb in charge of my sister's investigation immediately.  Caron has contacted me privately regarding this event, accusing me of lying about it.  Clearly either she, or this PI, is the person lying.  My family feels doubly victimized by this woman in the manner she has spoken on-line about my sister in a degrading manner, deleting several family and friend's posts on my sister's missing Face Book page, and also how she has treated both my mother and I in private correspondence.  Response to Carons response below:Cynthia, I have no wish to speak to someone who has repeatedly falsely accused me of leaking case material to Websleuths w/out proof.  No one from WS contacted me to verify someone as an insider.  Show me the posts where I supposedly offered inside information.  It would be stupid of me to supply info to WS, I have nothing to gain by revealing evidence.   Why should I inquire into any more truth regarding the PI?  I saw the man with my own eyes driving out the driveway.  He told my husband that he approached both you and Ganesh at the Shining Hope Event offering pro-bono PI services and you accepted after you were assured that he was indeed licensed in NYS.  He Identified himself as working for both of you.  Therefore, one of you is not telling the truth.  It seems to me that you are awfully quick to accuse others and myself of lying w/out inquiring into your own facts. Your attempt to diminish this event by saying it was expected is despicable, but thats what Ive come to expect from you.   And I personally dont appreciate the side circus of going after Tracy and Kevin along with the FB wars, which you persist in doing as evidenced herefinding my sister was supposed to be your focus.   Additionally, why should I contact you to settle the matter?  You have treated me horribly.  I dont believe you, I dont trust you, and I am certainly not accountable to you in any way.     When I posted my one comment on the JRMP page, I identified myself as Jennys sister.  My post, My sisters case is not a FB page competition.  I do not believe that she ran off on her own volition as this site continuously alleges, was deleted.  When someone criticized you or your admin for deleting the sisters post, it was put back up and a response provided that stated (paraphrased): Show some maturity.  We are looking for an ALIVE Jennifer.  Her children could be looking here.  There was nothing wrong with my post and it certainly didnt warrant that response, nor the one that came after it from someone claiming that I practice to deceive.  Furthermore, I know my family members were identifying themselves on that page and still getting deleted and/or blocked. You never knew Jennifer, you have no claim to know what Jennifer would have wanted.  I know she wouldnt have liked the way youve portrayed her on FB or WS.  There was no behavior change around me or my parents who LIVE NEXT DOOR to her.  You accuse people on WS of armchair sleuthing when you yourself are guilty of armchair psychology of my sisters emotional and mental state.   The malice and cruel behavior Ive witnessed comes from you, Cynthia. A fair judge hears both sides before making a decision, yet you made public declarations without hearing Jennys side of the story.  It was your job to find Jennifer, not to analyze her emotional or mental state, nor to determine who is innocent or guilty. Youre handling of this case is grossly unprofessional.   You owe my family a public apology.  Second response to CC: I hope this review site is monitoring how you are treating me here Cynthia.  I am the sister of a missing person.  I have not been polygraphed, nor questioned in my sisters disappearance, but the people you work with have.  More accusations from you again with no proof.  Again, what purpose would my PI have for leaking info pertinent to the case?  An employee w/ the Star told a family member that you did indeed reveal this info to JM, and then were foolish enough to tell him afterwards that its off the record. I just looked up when I posted my one comment on the JRMP and it was 2/13/13, weeks after you took on Jennifers case.  I was never banned (that I know of), I unliked the page after being deleted.  The HFJR page was never my page Cynthia, but I am glad that you are admitting to having something to do with its disappearance.   This is bordering on harassment.    3rd response:CC, if you are going to continue to falsely call me a liar, I will continue to respond.  Now youre deleting posts where I proved you incorrect.  I have the text, I can supply them for anyone from this site who would like to see them.     
LostNMissing, Inc	151280	9	/users/profile/201934	losikz	Client Served	5	03/19/2013	I am Eugene Losiks mother.  My son went missing from a hotel area in Boston, where he was staying overnight.   Eugene was missing  from February of 2010 until November of 2010.   While I HATE to be a mother of a missing young man, I feel so grateful that we got to work with LostNMissing and personally  with Cynthia Caron.  We would not know what to do and where to start without her.  Without her  I would just sit there next to that hotel and cry for 9 months.  Instead  we worked!  We worked together with LostNMissing to look for Gene!  In few short days Cynthia arranged for the live scent dog to work on the area where Gene went missing.  We had few very well organized fliers distribution events, in the areas where the fliers would not be removed the moment they went out.  Cynthia Caron did something absolutely impossible to do without her  she had myself and my husband live on Jane Velez-Mitchell show.  That interview helped us to keep the media attention on the case when we needed it most.  Cynthia Caron personally walked into some office buildings along the very busy highway near Boston and told them our sons story, and next thing we knew  a huge banner with Eugenes picture, and all the information was on display for everyone to see it.   I also wanted to mention that Cynthia is our neighbor, she lives with her  family next town from us.  We got to know her personally, and her husband, and her two beautiful sons.  They live a very humble life in a beautiful modest suburban house with their boys, two dogs and a cat.  Cynthia can enjoy her gorgeous backyard and sit next to her husband in front of the fire he puts out every day.   Instead she keeps herself very busy helping people in need, in the darkest times of their lives, because she wants to help and knows how!  She is an amazing person; generous, smart and very resourceful.  Did you know that she holds annual flea markets events where her husband would donate his own personal items to raise money for LostNMissing?  Did you know that Cynthia has an account on Ebay where she sells HER OWN items, things she actually needs,  and all the proceeds go to LostNMissing? 100% of the proceeds!  Did you know that Cynthia often spends her own money so those endless fliers would be of better quality?  Who else do you know would do such a thing and use their own money?   She never ever asked for a penny from us all she did was from the open heart!  Cynthia deeply cares about the cause, and is a blessing to all of us!

LostNMissing, Inc	151196	22	/users/profile/201776	RichAnderson	General Member of the Public	1	03/17/2013	Cynthia Caron the founder and owner of LostNMissing has been sending out the following message to various people on Facebook about how she is planning to sue six people for harassment, libel and defamation which was then forwarded to me. I did not receive this message directly. I thought in all fairness considering previous reviews posted here it should be shared. It should be noted I find it disgusting she is apparently using money donated to her organization to assist families of missing persons for lawyer services to accomplish this.  I believe suing six people would be very expensive and that the money donated to her organization shouldn't be spent this way, especially when she has brought on the "attacks" by her unprofessional, shocking behavior on the Internet which at times has stooped to bullying in a kind way to force people to do as she requests.  We are in the process of filing a harassment, libel and defamation of character charges against a group of people who publicly wrote they are going to "turn us in" and write letters and false references about myself and my organization, LostNMissing Inc.  One has already begun to do such on GuideStar which is the reporting agency for nonprofits. Reference number 61 written by an anonymous person with the screenname of GregLR is not factual and is more than probably from the same group that the Sheriff Dept is aware of as well as our corporate attorney.  When reviewing our history it is clear this is an attempt to further defame our companies excellent reputation. Please help us bury this terrible "reference" as we are dependable upon GuideStar as our agency that we point families for referrals of our work.  I am devastated and have not slept in two days and keep throwing up over all of this malicious attacks. The link is:  	Now they found GuideStar to post a bad reference on me and while it is only one post so far.my fear is all other 6 people named in the libel case will find it and begin posting too.  They already wrote on Websleuth that they are sending letters to the attorney general in NH to have my company closed, to the BBB and to the IRS.  However, GuideStar is the premium of all nonprofit agencies that oversee nonprofits. It is the huge link on our website so that those can learn of our work by reading referrals.  It is where ANY and ALL companies and grants would go in order for us to obtain a grant.  GuideStar will NOT remove negative posts.  They feel the public has the right to know about an organization.  This is going to crush me.  Here is today's anonymous post and it is completely a blatant lie.  Why are these people doing this to me? :http://greatnonprofits.org/org/lostnmissing-inc

There is only so much someone can do, and when others didn't do enough in my mind, they helped. Update i will gladly say is that my brother is home, safe.  i really do believe part of that is because of the posters / web information that was sent out, because everyone was looking for him, even if it was just a "i saw that face" lets call in to the police kind of moment, and those may be the key to finding someone
LostNMissing, Inc	151087	26	/users/profile/201582	DogNponySHOW	Volunteer	1	03/14/2013	I have been following missing persons cases for several months and have recently learned of LostNMissing through the case of Jennifer Ramsaran. I am appalled at how Mrs. Caron has handled herself in regards to this case.  Specifically as to how she continues to post on social media all the while, Jennifer Ramsaran's family is requesting her to STOP. At what point does one realize how traumatic this is for Jennifer's family?   Mrs. Caron seems to have taken this case very personal as she has backed a possible person of interest, Mr. Ramsaran who subsequently has failed his polygraph.  While this is not a dispute as to his guilt or not, Mrs. Caron cannot let justice prevail.  She is consistently posting on The Help Find Jennifer Ramsaran facebook in a tirade, rivaling a screaming lunatic and just when it's time to step back to her and try to reason, she not only deletes her post but blocks the poster.   Very immature and unprofessional. After researching Mrs. Caron, it seems that she is not all of what she claims to be.  Records do not lie. She may have done a lot of good in other missing persons' cases but in this case, she has dropped the ball.  She has been a nightmare!   I can't imagine how Jennifer's family must feel as I do not know Jennifer nor have any vested interest other than being a follower of missing people. Mrs. Caron would be better suited for day time talkshow drama, ala Jerry Springer.  I don't find her compassion genuine nor her ability to be drama free, professional, and most importantly TACTFUL.  I find her classless and an embarrasment to agencies that are around for the right reasons. I personally plan on contact the state of NH to confirm that she is legit as well as to file a complaint.   She should be ashamed of herself.
LostNMissing, Inc	151083	25	/users/profile/201575	JusticeForJen	Professional with expertise in this field	1	03/14/2013	LostNMissing is NOT registered with the Attorney General's office in NH, something that is required by LAW of all nonprofits.  Per a representative of this office, Cynthia Caron will be receiving a letter in the mail demanding she register within a certain time frame.  In addition, as a result of her failure to register her organization, she potentially faces the following actions:  subpoena to court, compelling registration, forced release of her financial records, and fines. It is beyond shady to register, and the most common reason given was that organizations who don't register balk at providing financial information, and any governmental oversight of their agency. 
LostNMissing, Inc	150942	31	/users/profile/201322	JusticeForJennifer	Professional with expertise in this field	1	03/12/2013	I would like to personally recommend that any family seeking help for their missing loved one, steer clear of Cynthia Caron.  She continually creates drama where it doesnt belong, and will spend valuable time doing so, if anyone doesnt agree with her.  She will waste time and resources on childish online behavior, as if she has nothing better to do. I have been following the case of the missing mom, Jennifer Ramsaran very closely since the beginning. What I've also been following since the beginning is Cynthia Caron's unprofessional, unethical, and inexcusable behavior as it relates to this case, and especially as it relates to the lack of respect shown to Jennifer and Jennifers parents.  It has been appalling, at best.   Despite much circumstantial evidence that points otherwise, Cynthia Caron has left no stone unturned in painting Jennifer out to be a reckless mother who purposely abandoned her three young children just prior to Christmas, her daughter's Christmas concert, and her daughter's birthday.  Never once did she mention throughout the search for Jennifer, that Jennifer was a Sunday school teacher, taught knitting classes, was a former girl scout leader, nor did she discuss how devoted Jennifer was to her children. Cynthia Caron has minimized the fact that Jennifer's husband had an affair prior to Jennifer's disappearance, by publicly stating that it was just an "alcohol fueled tryst.  She has stated repeatedly that Jennifer may have left to meet an online lover, was playing online games, and/or that she left because she was "mentally despondent.  She stood strong in her defense of Jennifers husband, when all evidence pointed toward foul play (ie. no activity on her credit cards in the over two months since she went missing, no one seeing or hearing from Jennifer, Jennifers phone being found tossed on the side of the road by her husband, and her van abandoned with blood in it).  She even crafted the unlikely scenario that Jennifer was seen alive a week or so prior to discovery of her body, which was found nude and encased in ice, dumped off the side of a back road in Pharsalia late last month.  And she continues to stand strong in defense of Jennifers husband, probably for donation purposes.   Cynthia Caron herself vocally expressed outrage (as did Jennifers husband) regarding a public search of that area that was set to take place in mid-January.  The police were aware of this search, yet Cynthia Caron and Jennifers husband team were very vocal about no one searching for Jennifer.   They also alerted the media and asked them to print an article asking people not to search, well aware of the fact that searching public land is not illegal.   Furthermore, it took Cynthia Caron weeks to secure a donation site for a billboard to be placed over 60 miles away from town, after she kept insisting that billboards cost $30,000.  Just prior to this, others were able to secure two free local billboards, not far from where Jens body was found.  Cynthia Caron has consistently painted Jennifer in a negative light, deleted any posts on her page that questioned her unscrupulous tactics, and harassed Jennifer's family.  Now that Jennifer has been found, she is stating publicly that many people panic after they accidentally cause the death of a loved one, prior to disposing the body,  which fittingly paves the way for a quirky defense at best, for Jennifer's husband. She states that she has lawsuits pending against many people who have spoken out on Jennifer's behalf, the very same people who have worked diligently to try to find Jennifer and spread awareness of her disappearance.  To me, this states that she cant move on, and insists on creating more useless drama, instead of spending that valuable time doing something for the families she says shes devoted to helping. I do believe that Cynthia Caron doesnt understand the definition of libel, nor is she fully aware of the fact that she will be fully liable for the legal expenses incurred by anyone she claims to be suing, once she loses.  These bullying tactics may have worked in high school, but this is real life. Any money donated to this organization is a waste.  RESPONSE TO CC's POST BELOW:  I look forward to hearing your testimony once you're subpoenaed to testify in this case.

If only I and the rest of the families who have had loved ones missing (in my case my wife) knew about this incredible organization, we would not have to endure such heart ache alone. Cynthia and her professional volunteer staff provided much needed counseling to the kids and I. Explained what the processes are that were going through and helped us get through every day by taking one day at a time in order for the healing process to begin. I am going to make it a mission in life to raise funds and awareness for LostNMissing as they were there in our hour of need, when people related by blood who calls themselves family were non existent when it came to supporting the kids and I. Please feel free to contact me with any questions as I will be more than happy to expand with further details.
LostNMissing, Inc	150580	7	/users/profile/200795	TaurusGolfNUT	Professional with expertise in this field	5	03/05/2013	I personally worked with Ms. Caron on the specific case that these trolls are writing about and while they may find it funny to post awful ratings, it should be known that many things occurred on the case between the Sheriff and Ms. Caron that the online bloggers have no clue about. I give Ms. Caron 5 stars for her class and especially for the confidentiality that she has maintained by keeping the truth away from the public on very important factors to help preserve the reputation of a deceased young mother who went missing. While the public is making comments about the husband, of which I believe they can be sued for that too, they do not know the entire story or the facts to the case. Ms. Caron does and has never uttered a word in light of the harassment people are giving her. I also am glad that this is not going by the wayside as Ms. Caron has legal counsel who is in possession of the names of 4 who are spearheading this campaign of hatred. All 4 should hope to have calendars cleared for court dates as a libel law suit is not a laughing matter. Oh? It's did I mention the libel lawsuit will be public record?  Once the lawsuits are complete and the truth is told there will be many people who will be far more humiliated than what they think they are doing to Ms. Caron's reputation.  Cynthia remember what I told you? Deep breaths, stay strong and listen to your attorneys. They are smart and justice will be done for you. When the libel suit is over you can post it for the world to see along side your writings of those who create malicious havoc as anything in the court system will be public knowledge! All of them will be known to everyone, as they should be! Good luck dear and remember it is the families that counts and needs you and these trolls are nothing more than lost souls with no lives and multiple personality disorders. But you know that as you hold the proof from all the writings everyone gave you including our good friend among them at WS! Be ready trolls...your cave is about to cave in on you...as deserved.

LostNMissing, Inc	150547	6	/users/profile/200750	my74buggie	Client Served	4	03/05/2013	First, before I write my review, I'd like to point out that I noticed all of the bad reviews were written on the same day.... by people who signed up for an account specifically to attack this organization.  Sounds fishy to me. My Mom was missing for 6 years and in those 6 years I have had the pleasure and displeasure of working with many different organizations.  Even after her remains were found strewn across the hot desert hills in Death Valley, I continue to help families of the missing as a friend and supporter.   I have not personally gained from Cynthia's service but I know plenty of people who have.  I have connected with Cynthia via helping other families and she is one of the first people I would recommend to people for creating beautiful posters and getting information out about missing loved ones.  She is so devoted that when I first met her, she had just had surgery and was supposed to be on bed rest but was online helping me through something.  She even uses her pinterest account to share missing loved one's information as well as handling a blog.   Brilliant! I would like to point out from personal experience that you don't HIRE a missing persons organization.  If you do... then THEY are wrong.  They offer services and you should ask for their help, but don't feel obligated to pour your heart and soul and wallet into any of these organizations.  They are providing a service that donors pay for.  You can use as many or none at all if you wish.  Say thank you, but that is all you really owe any of these orgs.  Everything they are doing for your missing loved one.... you can do yourself.  They don't have magic powers or insane amount of connections.  They are people just like you and me.  Remember that. As far as making a facebook page in honor of a missing person.... if you are not requested by the person's family... Don't Do it!  Maybe make one that says "Friends of.......".  If there is one put up by the family and moderated by an organization, they will try to get you to shut yours down.  Not because of territorial-ism, but because if a tip goes to a random facebook page and not to the family... it can get lost in cyberspace and that is so unfair.  Contact the family or the org working with the family and run it by them first.  I would have been mortified if someone had a facebook page for my mom and I didn't know who it was.  I would think it was someone who had to do with her disappearance trying to take information away.  I hope this perspective is more helpful than harmful.

LostNMissing, Inc	150544	2	/users/profile/200747	Licensed Investigator	Volunteer	5	03/05/2013	This is the most caring and helpful  organization I have even encountered. It is quite apparent a very disturbed person has begun a smear campaign against this organization as all negative reviews are posts from March 4. Those truly interested in a great organization can better rely on the opinions of any of the families that Lostnmissing has worked with through the years to find a true review. I have worked with this organization and found Ms Caron to be one of the most caring individuals I have ever met, quickly mobilizing to assist families of the missing. For a true testament of this organization's work, seek the opinions of the many families it has helped. All involved are unpaid volunteers with hearts of gold, well respected by all, including the Law Enforcement community. 
LostNMissing, Inc	150518	27	/users/profile/200710	nothappy	General Member of the Public	1	03/04/2013	This "organization" is an absolute disgrace. Ms. Caron is an aggressive and delusional person. Her treatment of a missing person's family (not the family member she is representing) is insulting and hurtful. What is already the worst time in someone's life is made even worse by Ms.Caron's denigration of the victim.Case in point - the attack on the father of Samantha Koenig. Unbeknownst to Ms. Caron (though according to her she always knows everything) Israel Keyes had asked for a ransom.  Sam's father used money from donations to pay this. This was not info that the public was privy to. Ms. Caron took upon herself to post on social media that sam's father had taken donations and used them inappropriately. Any comments made by family member trying to defende Sam's father were promptly remove and the relatives banned from her page. So what was already traumatising for her father was made even worse by being slandered by Ms. Caron.2nd case - Jennifer Ramsaran - Ms. Caron was hired by Mr. Ramsaran. Shortly there after, posts and press releases starting coming thick and fast from Ms. Caron insulting the victim.It was said over and over that Jennifer had mental problems, comments about her weight, her personality, even saying the affair that Mr.Ramsaran had with Jennifer's BF was because Jennifer "changed and pulled away"Ms. Caron's defence of Mr. Ramsaran resulted in her being removed from crime sites as she could not remain respectful to other members or refrain from insulting Jennifer.Ms. Caron has been insistent that Jennifer simply ran away and needed time away.If a family member posted on her facebook page, that Jennifer did not run away and never would, Ms. Caron argues with the family member then simply removes them from her page.Sadly, Jennifer was found deceased. Was there any regret from Ms. Caron for incorrectly saying Jennifer just ran away, had mental problems etc?No, of course not. Ms. Caron then posted on her fb that Jennifer could have been alive for the past 11 weeks and had only been dead 24 hours!Inferring that either Jennifer had run off and had been having a grand old time in the last 11 weeks, then was set upon by some random stranger - or that she was abducted and has been held this whole time then killed.How great that must make her parents feel to hear that? Are they not going through a hard enough time?Her "experience" amounts to nothing more than a good use of photo shop to make missing posters.This "organization" is an embarrassment to all missing persons organizations.They have in fact even just hired a "psychic" to be their "event planner"??Perhaps under different leadership this may be a helpful organization, but as Ms. Caron is "president and founder" that is not likely to happen.

It's been 15 months since I've seen him last time. It's been a very hard time for my family because we are very close to him. While I am his sister I made a promise to my mom before her passing that I would care for my little brother. The first few months after Timur went missing we didn't know what to do. Our local police department didn't give us much help, actually didn't want take this case to serious for a while since my brother is an adult male of 27 years of age. We were trying to search for any help through the Internet and trying to find people in the same situation. I found Cynthia Caron and LostNMissing, Inc. through the search on Facebook and made a call. Since she and her team took on my brother's case we have finally had the searches and help we've needed! Cynthia and her staff are amazing! I couldn't make it so far without her! From just a person who helps families of missing she is now one of my best friends! She always supports us, she always has the right words to say, she always has sound advice and guidance. Every day, twice or more, she reposts every missing person case on their facebook page, she reaches the media to get the information in to the public, she makes the posts and events for missing persons and their families. What amazes me is that LostNMissing, Inc. never charges for any thing nor for any help they give. They are working just to help families without asking anything back. I feel like God send her to us to help and support us through this hard time. She is very professional and intelligent person. Without her help and support we would be lost. My family and I would highly recommend Cynthia Caron and her team at LostNMissing, Inc. to anyone going through this stressful situation.God Bless Cynthia and her staff!Gulnara Brown and family.

LostNMissing, Inc	144325		/users/profile/190847	StarLiteWishes51	Volunteer	5	11/29/2012	There are no words that could adequately express the gratitude that the Goings family has for the work of LostNMissing. When their 16 year old daughter went missing, the family was met with a lackadaisical and indifferent attitude from law enforcement and little assistance from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Law enforcement immediately assumed a posture of relegated their daughter to the status and label of "runaway" and did little to help locate her. Further, they seemed disinterested in any leads, or potential information that would help bring their daughter back home. When the family spokesperson contacted PEAS and shared the compelling circumstances of their daughter's disappearance and apparent abduction, members of the PEAS and LostNMissing mobilized a grass-roots effort consisting of a team of volunteers and experts within their staff to bring their daughter home safely. LostNMissing created posters for both print and electronic distribution, created a social media page and provided expert guidance on how to coordinate the search as well as methods for the parents and family to cope with the devastation of having a missing child. LostNMissing attended meetings, sent emails to law enforcement, spent countless hours in discussion over the phone with the family and volunteers. They expedited the recording of the case in national databases and tirelessly worked to find the missing teen. I know without a doubt that were it not for the dedication and compassion of LostNMissing, the Goings may not have located their daughter safely.

When I initially contacted Lostnmissing via email I wasn't sure how soon I would hear back.  I was contacted  within 20 minutes!  To be honest, it was a hard phone call because I suddenly became aware of reality and weight of our situation....our daughter was missing.  Even though you were literally right in the middle of the biggest storm ever seen in the U.S. and about to lose power, our emergency became your new priority.  Within an hour of our initial email Lostnmissing had a facebook post with pictures of our daughter.  Your action, care, and daily follow-up  phone calls, brought hope and strength to the storm we were experiencing.  My emotional state and working with authorities made it difficult to focus at times.  I had attempted to put together a poster myself but I couldn't pull it together.  Lostnmissing put the poster together with exact wording  expressing our heart for our missing daughter.  It brought awareness to our local community and through Facebook, "united" the states in search of our daughter.  Thanks to the collaborated efforts of the Meridian and Boise Police, Lostnmissing, and every person who posted and re-posted and reported sightings of her, she was found.  Lostnmissing was a key instrument used in locating our girl.  Forever Grateful,  The Family of "Brooke N."

And LostNMissing is right on the case.....no ifs, ands, or buts, just action.
LostNMissing, Inc	129387		/users/profile/174756	firemedic421	General Member of the Public	5	10/25/2012	This is a wonderful charity/organization that informs the public of missing persons. They assist families of missing loved ones. The public needs to become aware of how many people go missing every day and they do a fantastic job of getting the word out there.  So often only the high profile cases that the media find appealing are featured and heard about by the general public.  This is a travesty of justice for not only the missing but the families that anxiously await their return or for some type of closure. Please donate or volunteer your time to this fantastic organization. Lets bring the missing home.

My daughter Megan Waterman went missing in haughpauge new york in the early hours of june 6 2010. I was so lost and confused. I had went to missing petrson sites added my sweet daughter to there data base. A couple days later I had recieved a call from cynthia from LostNMissing this orginization had done wonders for me. LostNMissing had set up a candle vigel a few weeks later in hopes that someone would know something and come forward. We had a spagatti dinner/ silent auction to raise a reward they did fliers we went to new york and handed out fliers. There was so many times I just wanted to give upi and Cynthia said do not give up hope. Megan will be found trust me. for a non profit orginzation LostNMissing does not think of how much they pay to help familes with missing loved ones. i do not know what I would have done with out them. then the dreaded day came on december 13, 2010 when my daughter was located as an angel. She was a victum of the long island serial killer I had contacted Cynthia they day I found out she knew before I could say it becaause i was hesterical she told me to calm down. Her words and heart had always made me feel better. to this day I am still activley involved with an orginization that helps so many families with missing loved ones. Thank you LostNMissing for all you do.

When a loved one goes missing, the emotions and confusion that immediately follow the disappearance are disorienting.  Very few people have any experience in how to find a missing person and often, law enforcement is limited in what actions they can take.  In our situation, the police were initially very helpful but seemed to lose interest as time passed.  However, the staff at LostnMissing never lost interest, never stopped helping us, and never lost hope. I cannot begin to express the gratitude our family feels towards these wonderful people who are all volunteers.  The team at LostnMissing was the first group to reach out and help us.  They provided poster design and advice throughout the worst 7 weeks of our lives.  They never gave up and that was a huge encouragement to us to keep fighting and do whatever it took to find our loved ones.  The only thing the family of a missing person has to get through the day is hope...without that, they can't go on.  LostnMissing provided us with that hope...we will never look at a Missing Poster the same way again and we will be avid supporters of this volunteer organization for years to come.  Thank you LostnMissing!!!

While many are from areas other than where I live, I generally pass them on because I know many people in other areas and you never know when or where someone might be found thanks to advisories such as these. Thank you for this site and this group. I think the world can save lives through groups like this.

It was shocking to me and I am proud to be a member of the public that shares this organizations posts on Facebook, hoping that someone will know something and speak up.  You often hear about missing women and children, but the number of missing men is staggering.  This organization helps families in need and brings awareness to the increasing problem of missing people in this world.  With the rise in human trafficking this organization is more important than ever.

From organizing vigil events to providing food, pamphlets, and billboards to help raise awareness that Ayla is missing. She also helped with media and internet relations. Initially, we had no idea such an organization existed for missing persons and at no point did she force her organization on us. The more we needed Cynthia, the more she provided and LostNMissing has turned out to be Ayla's guardian angel. I can only hope that she, along with our family will be rewarded with Ayla's return.

My daughter went missing on 12/22/2011 @ 12:00 p.m. after school let out for the Holiday break. I waited to call the police because I told her she could go over her friends house to get her jacket she left, but she went over another friend house and she left their house @ around 8 p.m. without calling us letting us know she was on her way home. By that time I had said, "If she didn't walk thru the door at  9 p.m. I was calling the police." 9 p.m. came around and she wasn't home I called the police and they didn't get to my house till after 1 a.m. By that time and the response I got from The police I posted a message about my daughter missing on my FB page for Jhessye Shockley. I got a response fro Mark and Shanna Palmer, who gave me all the information for Lost and missing, Missing and Exploited Children, Peasintheirpods Children and numerous other organizations. By the next day, my daughters information was made into a FB page and made it public, I also found out later Friday evening from Mark Palmer that my daughter had made local news coverage and local print. I even got a call from a local news paper reporter and her school also was alerted and  contacted all the kids I told them was her friends and they contacted them to see if they had seen my daughter, even a Rilya Alert was put out. All these organizations as a whole helped in the return of my daughter, who was kidnapped and assaulted and is now being investigated. This was a trying time because of the holiday season and me never being involved with someone who has had this happen personally so I had a hard time thinking straight. I am seeking counseling for both of us and send a special thanks to all who took time out to make my child a priority and not blow her off as she was a teen who just left to have fun, because in the end the SA kit and bruises on her body showed other wise. She still tells me more everyday in bits and pieces because she was hit on the head. She is trying to move on like a normal child, but I have noticed when she goes off into her brothers room alone. I heard sobbing and noticed the door was locked so I left her alone. She seems to act normal to me but the closer it gets to her going back to school, the more she seems to act like she is going into a shell. I want to re thank all the organizations that helped and are going to help in the future.

Cynthia also guided me to other online organizations that could help in finding my brother.  Without Cynthia, I would have been totally lost.  She checked in with me to make sure I was doing okay, asked about my family, and has been with me every step of the way.

Instantly I became aware of the selfless and caring role LostNMissing has played in so many lives....The awareness that Cynthia Caron brought to George's case was remarkable.  She arranged television interviews with the family and search parties on cable networks....to get the word out about George and where he was last seen.  The LostNMissing team had constant communication with the family and FB page in organizing all information coming through the page- and keeping the public aware of any information that could be shared to help in the search.  The support that they gave the friends and family of George was so amazing.  It seemed as if George was the only one missing- I had no idea until after George was found, how many other cases Cynthia and her team worked on simultaneously and continue to help.... They were the light in the darkest hours, shedding light on individuals who are missing-young and old-and bringing awareness to each case they work on as if these missing loved ones are their own family.  Truly Amazing and Wonderful !!!!!!

The spirit and energy of LostNMissing astounded us. It was like my brother was their brother. It moved my family to the core to have them working with us. I can honestly say that Cynthia and Angela were the only thing that kept us grounded and going during that time. During the three weeks my brother was missing, it would have been impossible to count the amount of times we thanked God for them.   They will forever hold a piece of my heart and I know that Georgie is watching over them the way they watched over us.

When the horror of a missing loved one strikes the family, you are desperate, horrified but most of all - you are so lost.  What do you do?  Where do you go?   What do you need to file, where? Who do you call besides LE?  What if they do not take you seriously?  Mistakes and delays which are made can cost you a precious time, which are never on yous side when someone is missing.  That is such an unknown and dark territory for everybody. That is where LostNMissing.org comes.  LostNMissing is such a wonderful organization, who has endless sources of knowledge on how to deal in such horrible situation.  They will tell you exactly what needs to be done to start the process, as well, as help you to keep it going.  When my adult son went missing, we found that without LostNMissing we were like blind cats, not knowing what to do, whom to trust and where to ask for help.  We are so grateful to LostNMissing and Cynthia Carol in partially for everything they have done for us.  Organizing flier distribution events, looking for other ways to make the case as visible as possible - they do it all.  Cynthia worked day and night to make sure our son's case was covered locally and nationally, pushing for us to be on CNN live, writing endless articles, announcing the reward.  She went beyond possible and had a banner installed with our missing son's pictures very close to the place where he went missing from.  LostNMissing is a truly admirable organization where everything they do - becomes personal to them. I also wanted to mention, that if God forbid, in spite the efforts,  the outcome is not a favorable, LostNmissing work does not stop here.  Thanks to LostNMissing.org and Cynthia Caron personally, our son's life was celebrated in the best possible way a mother could imagine. thank you, LostNMissing!

Cynthia from Lost and Missing was one of the best things that happened to me during that time.  She not only sent me a beautiful banner of my son, but helped with flyers, articals on the web, and inserts for our ballon launch.  She did so much more than that for me she cared and talked to me.  She was the friend I needed in a desperate time of need.  My son is home and safe, but if you have a missing person and need help Lost and Missing is the first place I would start.

Journeys In Education Inc	73938		/users/profile/80802	Pupusakraut	General Member of the Public	5	02/23/2011	I began my journey with the Mariposa museum, before it even was a museum, working with Joseph's Coat and the co-founder of the Mariposa museum, Linda Marsella. While my parents raised me with cultures from all over the world, Linda created a very special place with Joseph's Coat & the Mariposa Museum by bringing the cultures of the world to everyone else right here in the wonderful little town of Peterborough, NH. Every time I have visited with my family I am amazed and taken into a world of inspiring passion to show all cultures being together artistically, creatively, displaying great feelings of fun, joy, learning and peace. It is a great place for anyone to explore themselves and the world of people & their cultures around them.  Mitakuye Oyasin.   - Jessica Kaiser
Journeys In Education Inc	96584		/users/profile/112291	Paul234	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/25/2011	Dear Board and Staff:       I am writing to thank you for your time, hospitality, and generosity when my wife and I visited your museum recently.   It was certainly the highlight of our trip, which included several days in Boston and a number of visits to institutions and sites in the southern New Hampshire area.      As someone who has worked in the arts and cultural field for more than forty years and travelled a great deal, I have visited countless museums and art galleries in North America and other parts of the world.  I must say that I think your museum is one of the finest I have seen.  While it is not large, it is inspirational and transformative in every respect.     From the moment I set foot in your museum until the moment I left, I felt revitalized, captivated, and at home.  As founder and Director of the World Culture Project - which is devoted to broadening and deepening understanding of culture and cultures throughout the world and was officially declared a World Decade of Cultural Development activity by the United Nations and UNESCO in 1989 -  I was especially taken by the ability of your museum to convey so much information of vital importance about the character and value of the many diverse cultures of the world.  This was achieved through attractively-displayed exhibits and creatively-presented art objects and artifacts.      An added bonus was the pleasure of seeing so many children in the museum enjoying musical instruments from the various cultures of the world and listening to well-told stories from around the world.  It is always wonderful to see a museum that provides exhibitions of the highest quality and variety, as well as 'hands-on opportunities' for visitors.  But when these visitors are children, especially during the middle of summer, one knows that the museum is more than fulfilling the mandate and purpose that were established for it.     I believe your museum deserves a great deal of private and public support.  It is the kind of museum that should exist in every community as a result of its ability to inform and excite as well as enrich and illuminate.  It should be expanded well beyond the present physical premises in my view, largely through the creation of many more outreach programs, travelling exhibitions, and website activities that can reach many more people.  Hopefully, governments, corporations, and foundations will respond generously to this necessity.  You have a great deal to contribute, and much to create that would be of inestimable value to Peterborough, the United States, and the world at large.     With my very best wishes for every success in your future endeavors.  Please don't hesitate to give my name, email address, or telephone number to people who want to talk about a museum that 'has got it right,' and deserves a great deal more financial assistance and developmental support in the years and decades ahead.     With my very best wishes and warmest regards. D.

As part of a series on Peoples of the North, I was introduced to traditional Scottish songs sung while waulking (softening and cleansing) wool, and enjoyed a folk dancing session in which I used muscles and other body parts I hadnt exercised for a while. These programs as well as meandering through the interesting exhibits gave me a sense of connection with those who live in other countries and the diverse communities to which they belong.

Journeys In Education Inc	80526		/users/profile/87896	Anna Petrova	Volunteer	5	02/28/2011	My mother founded the Mariposa Museum as a way to promote world peace, on the principle that educating children about other cultures is the best insurance for a peaceful future.  A child who has dressed in a Vietnamese costume, played an African drum or become fascinated by an Indian puppet will feel a sense of connection whenever he or she hears about these places.  More importantly, such children will always see the people of these countries as human beings like themselves -- and dehumanization of one's "enemy" is a prerequisite of warfare.  What better way, then,  to promote global citizenship, volunteerism and a respect for the many cultures that share our world, than by giving children this wonderful place to learn and play?  Not everyone can afford the luxury of foreign travel -- but a visit to the Mariposa is the next best thing.

I was in college when People Power happened.  It brought back many vivid memories. My anticipation was that of a formal and serious event. But the museum itself was very refreshing. The lay out as well as the items on exhibit catered to my inner child. Our own children were thrilled to see some of the items that they had seen in Manila as well as things that they learn about at Boston's Iskwelahang Pilipino.  The reception immediately after the People Power presentation was very up close and personal. Truly a global experience with everyone sharing thoughts and ideas. The Filipino food of course, was sumptuous!

Journeys In Education Inc	78857		/users/profile/86156	Sinagtala	General Member of the Public	5	02/27/2011	I salute Mariposa Museum for bringing folk art, dances and music -  in the community and the surrounding areas.  I see that there are three ways, for instance, the MM is dealing with these - The first is to do them as the folks do them - retain their purity, simplicity, record them for posterity for what they are. The second is to embellish them, dress them up, modify and shorten them. I observed this in different dance, music, art workshop, lecture and presentation that I attended to come up with good entertainment that will be appreciated by urbanized audiences. And the third is to draw from them as do modern artists. In bringing them to the Mariposa Museum - it makes indigenous folk culture the source of modern art, dance, music and talks.  Visiting the museum brings change in me which is inevitable, I believe . As I try to  integrate myself to other cultures I see changes in me and so do in other people that I met and encounter. The atmosphere and the  environment started to be open, relax, friendly and trustful. Grateful for this great museum for leaving some footprints "values" in my life and others. I know that  even as values change, this maybe replaced with something of equal value. By coming to this place often, I found my cultural identity that may help create great art and person in me and hopefully in others as well.  With this cultural identity discovery  I was able to express my universality. Thank you Mariposa Museum!

What a beautiful, welcoming space! The exhibit brought textiles, costumes and toys that I have rarely seen, and I actively seek Scandinavian themes. The exhibit mixed displays with things children could touch, so it was very engaging. And the third floor was stocked with musical instruments of many countries that everyone could try out.The museum strikes a great balance between lots to see and do, and a calm place to enjoy.
Journeys In Education Inc	78498		/users/profile/85777	devon	General Member of the Public	5	02/27/2011	Enter the Mariposa museum and you are surrounded by a seemingly eclectic array of objects, lots and lots of objects. You are struck by color, vibrant colors. It is almost like entering a bazaar. But your eyes are taking in something different from most museums. This is the vision and creation of people who have a profound understanding of, and appreciation for, the beauty of everyday as well as ceremonial garments, adornments, musical instruments, and a profusion of other objects from a wide range of cultures. There are wonders and surprises in every corner, on every wall, in every display cabinet. You are invited to touch, feel, ponder, smile, exclaim. The genius of this treasure trove, beyond the visual and tactile beauty of it, is that it connects you, quite purposefully, with the people who created each item; you can explore and find out the where, the when, the why, the how of it all, through guided activities, through demonstrations, performances and ceremonies, with people familiar with or from specific cultures. Wherever I go, I explore as many museums as possible. Museums are a passion of mine; they are also important in the work I do, which is picture research. Nowhere have I encountered a museum and an organization quite like the Mariposa, both intimate in feel and vast in its embrace of cultures. And the truly amazing part of it? It exists in a small town in a relatively rural part of southern New Hampshire. It is a testimony to the power of the vision of its creators, the dedication of its staff and supporters, and the receptivity of the public.

The Mariposa  Museum, unlike most others, gives children and adults that exact opportunity by providing its wonderful 'hands on', interactive experience with the clothes, musical instruments, tools, sacred objects and more that leave one truly touched by another culture and time.

Journeys In Education Inc	78168		/users/profile/85438	Tucsonan	General Member of the Public	4	02/26/2011	     After stopping by Mariposa while on a vacation through New England about a year ago, our family realized the great service this museum provides for rural southern New Hampshire.  For one, the museum serves as a starting point for adults who have never experienced direct, first-hand contact with a culture other than their own.  Art can often serve as an attractive if not intriguing introduction into the struggles and joys of a people's daily existence.  Secondly, the museum serves as an invitation to young people to expand the scope of  their examination of  a world they are just beginning to encounter.  Bii-cultural persons who live in the area can use the museum to assist in educating their neighbors about that "other" part of the world from which they come.  And lastly, the museum is a meeting place for those who share or share interest in a common heritage.       The first and last aspects above are what we personally experienced at Mariposa, since we happened to arrive on the same day that Filipino artists were exhibiting some of their work, and Filipinos from the area (surprise!) were in attendance.  We were amazed that Filipinos had even settled there.     If anything, Mariposa needs more space and programs to interpret the cultures whose artifacts are on display.  How timely, for example, with countries like Egypt, Libya, and Tunisia dominating the news, might Mariposa provide some context and therefore understanding of that part of the world.    We enjoyed the museum for the short time we had to visit and were overwhelmed with the volume of artifacts on display there.

During that period we had the pleasure of contributing to the museum's cultural programs and providing other assistance in areas where we were competent. Our desire has always been to see this hidden gem become not so hidden and receive much wider exposure in the New England area, because of the increasing value for Americans (children and adults alike), to  learn more about other cultures in  the 'global village" we live in today.  Mariposa's exhibits and arts programs deliver immeasurable value to visitors in that regard. Kudos and continued good wishes to the museum's director, staff and volunteers.

The experience that Mariposa Museum has broaden my curiosity to expand my interest in learning about other countries. They not only have the paraphernalia's/artifacts  from different countries they visited..or featured, they have write ups/books of wide array of resources. Being a student away from home, i felt so at home finding a place like this -which reminded me that we are all a piece of a big tapestry of people living in this creative world...and everywhere people has stories of their own that shows their own unique culture-struggles and success! I have been in Mariposa while being a student and when i have the chance to be in the USA, i put it in my agenda to see this beautiful -enriched place because of the way they reach out to people from all over the world.

For many people, especially children, this is the closest they will come to experiencing another culture in its "truest" form. With many stereotypes and so much false information floating around in the media it's important to me that cultures are represented in a positive and non-generalizing light, which is exactly what the Mariposa does! Through artifacts, performances and many other interactive ways of learning, the Mariposa provides an environment that celebrates the beauty of cultural variation and opens the minds of young and seasoned generations alike...if you are in the area be sure you don't miss the unique opportunity to experience what the Mariposa is doing*

They are a "living" museum dedicated to educating the local population about the world's cultures.   There is always something new to see or a new event to attend.  I also appreciate the museum as a concert venue.  It is a perfect place to take in chamber music of all sorts.

In its' short time, it has established itself as a local leader in ethnic and global education. When you walk into the museum, it's like walking into another country (s) of beauty. The lectures are always interesting and the classes very good. We can learn much from what the Mariposa has to offer. We are extremely fortunate to have such a place in our community.

I especially enjoy seeing the artwork and clothing from other cultures. These pieces are beautiful and inspiring. I have also enjoyed special events, such as the Scandinavian cooking demonstration.
Journeys In Education Inc	75368		/users/profile/82331	dslow	General Member of the Public	3	02/25/2011	The museum has a welcoming feel and colorful appearance.    One can spend hours gazing at elegantly clad figures, exotic objects, and exquisite textiles. But the interpretive, substantive element seems to be missing.   I see cases marked by country or continent .. howeverno map to help me find my place in the world .. and little to instruct me about who uses an object, how is it used, when is it used, why it is used. Are these still used today or are they parts of a culture's history?I see many have given 5 stars- "far exceeds expectations".     I ask myself were their expectations so low or were mine too high.  I see this         collection a bit the way I first saw  a rock collection. It  intrigued  me but without someone's  explanation  ..it remained just that a collection of wondrous unknown  varied rocks,..  I wanted to be taken away and given a real taste of another culture.   To get a sense of the ways of many whom I know I will never have an opportunity to meet.   I wondered what someone wld learn about me and NH life were I to exhibit my teapot, my sister's old doll and bottle of maple syrup.  From my point of view not much and I imagine they would want to be told, shown or given more .. to really increase their unerstanding.     I left disappointed and not sure why to go back.

Journeys In Education Inc	75131		/users/profile/82070	gwyneth moss bragdon	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/24/2011	On the Mariposa Museum web site page one reads the following words: "When children are raised with respect and curiosity towardsother cultures, the world will know more peace and less war."  As a Dancer and Actress who works with 'Sacred Theater' performing folk tales and mythical plays using Masks from around the World,  I have come to understand intimately, that powerful relationships can be established through the medium of theater, art, and culture. It is by way of relationship that we find ourselves in the world, and it is in the world of interaction that we learn to establish our self holistically, and in harmony with others. Here the importance of nurturing a healthy self in relation to 'another' is a core lesson, and one held unique amongst the vitality of the experiential 'hands on' approach. The Mariposa Museum- provides a safe, purposeful, and fun environment which invokes the imagination, and nurtures the spirit of our children. Bravo to the Mariposa for celebrating the curiosities in our differences and also the common thread in our similarities.. providing a base foundation of tolerance, flexibility, and compassion for a better future now.

Journeys In Education Inc	74660		/users/profile/81574	Zephyr17	Volunteer	5	02/24/2011	I have been going to the Mariposa for what seems like forever. When I was in middle school, one of the required activities for all students was to do community service hours. I didn't want to do the "traditional" clean-up trash, help the elderly, etc... I wanted to do something different and out of the ordinary. So, I asked the Mariposa Museum if there was anything they needed help with, that I could volunteer for. The very next day I was in the Mariposa folding 100 paper cranes. It was a fun way to start off my experience. My volunteer duties soon changed from just folding paper cranes, to folding butterflies, teaching children a craft, helping around the museum, overall, just being a good volunteer. The Mariposa has helped me grow in more ways than one, and I see it change people. Watching how the children and adults go through the museum, and look at all of the beautiful wonders, it really can change a person.

Not only is it an exquisite space with remarkable, tactile exhibits, it is also a haven for encountering the best of world culture.  I always stop by several times when the Tibetan Buddhist lamas visit to create their remarkable sand mandalas. I've also attended wonderful drumming and dance performances, and countless exhibits.  Of special note is the spirit of promoting world peace that guides each step of the Museum's evolution. Appreciation, understanding and compassion for cultures worlds from our own is a natural outgrowth of what visitors experience. I am deeply grateful.

People of differing ethnicities live in our cities of Manchester and Nashua.  The Monadnock region  is tucked away in the Southwestern corner of the state.

In addition, I have proposed (and been welcomed) events to be held at the Mariposa which have introduced the public to a variety of musical opportunities. One thing I have learned is that the Mariposa Museum has a large and enthusiastic following- people will come to their concerts because the concert is at the Mariposa, regardless of whether or not they know about the music involved. Such is the "track record" the Mariposa has established in the region- they can be counted on to provide interesting, stimulating and enjoyable experiences. I have also had the opportunity to explore the collections presented by the museum, and am always struck by the variety, quality, and excellent presentation of items, as well as the respect for the many cultures featured. The Mariposa is a jewel in the Monadnock region of NH, and I'm proud to be able to visit and participate in its offerings!
Journeys In Education Inc	74350		/users/profile/81235	Article Noun	General Member of the Public	4	02/24/2011	I visited the the Mariposa Museum in November 2010. It's a beautiful building and the staff was incredibly friendly.  Right off the bat, I was surprised by the large number of different cultural artifacts  and I was really impressed by the cultural exchange events the museum had organized in the past few years alone. The goal of the museum is to explore and celebrate unique cultures and customs from all over the world. I'm not from New England but suspect that the Mariposa Museum is itself, unique and and should be celebrated for bringing distant cultures to Peterborough and giving the children (and adults) the opportunity to learn more about different cultures and the things we have in common. My only critique would relate to the layout. I would suggest either separating and/or labeling the different exhibits more clearly. The reason is, the Museum has an informal or intimate feeling that works really well to make you feel comfortable and appeals to children, but layout feels less designed than it could, almost incidental. I think the museum would benefit from labeling sections better or shifting them around a bit so that a tour has an obvious start and end point and conveys a message or tells a story. Upon mentioning the appeal to children I think I need to take a second to say how wonderful the child play area is. Very comfortable and welcoming and also very interetsing and educational. This is the real highpoint I think. Great job!

Some dresses were short, some were longer, but all were wedding dresses.  I became curious and wanted to see more.  So we went to the other rooms in the museum where they had instruments and furniture from all different cultures.  I don't usually like museums, because they bore me.  But this museum in particular I would go back and visit again.  I'll be sure to this summer.

I will always remember drummers from Japan--have never heard anything like it, and found it to be a deep insight into a nobel and ancient culture.  We can't experience such things on the internet or even on television. The Mariposa Museum allows us important, cultural experiences like no other organization could do.

When I worked in the elementary school we attended musical programs in which the students were also able to try out the instruments from all over the world. They provide visuals and hands on experience for the students and adults of areas of the world many may never get to but through their experiences in the Mariposa Museum they learn of the existence of them. The middle school has also benefited from the different programs and information available when they have a unit on other countries. They are handicap accessible and provide opportunities for these students as well.I have attended cultural programs for music, foods, customs and fashions. The Mariposa Museum contains a wealth of cultural information available to all.

The students from the ConVal schooldistrict are extremely lucky to have this excellent resource for world culture in their community.  The staff are extremely knowledgable, enthusiastic and helpful. The collection is first class.

Quarterly culture change keeps the content fresh and increases exposure to other peoples and their ways of life.  Frequent events to stimulate young and old, from crafts for children through Native American drumming, musicians and storytelling from Ghana and around the world, to gourmet catering and Scottish Whiskey tasting.  Exceptionally friendly people and a warm inviting space round out this unique world journey.

I still feel a thrill each time I walk through the door, as if I'm walking into another magical world.  During my involvement, I have seen the Mariposa grow and expand in its appeal to the community, reaching out to seniors, expanding its involvement with education and children, and providing superb entertainment in an intimate, inclusive space. When I meet people with children, I recommend it as a place where kids can directly experience different cultures through play.  For adults, it is a place to travel the world and learn about how we are all so different, yet all so alike.  For many others especially our senior members, the Mariposa provides a place to travel in time to places they have lived and people, sometimes family members they have known. It is astounding that a place of this caliber, offering experiences that it does survives and thrives in such a small town in such a sparsely populated community.  It brings to the community a great richness and depth that is not normally found outside of major cities.

I was there recently for anevent, and was so impressed with the breath (sp?) and depth of theircollection, plus the warm and friendly atmosphere. It is very important that we have institutions such as the Mariposa in New Hampshire to remind us of the vast world of other people and other culturesbecause living in New Hampshire can be an isolating experience ifyou let it. Racially there is not much of a mix, and economically itcan feel rather "unmixed" at times too.Bravo Mariposa! Keep up the fine work!

It is like a window to people's soul and a glimpse to other people's world. Once one enters the building, it is like stepping into a completely different world. It is welcoming and cozy. Arts and artifacts artistically blend together, the information are very educational and informative - it touches the enriching imagination of both young and old and the staff are very warm and knowledgeable. The not so expensive (sometimes free) performances, concerts, exhibits, and lectures are inspiring and edifying to the soul. This is learning is all about - having real fun as well! My husband and I have visited a number of museums, Mariposa has by far the most inexpensive yet very enriching way of educating the mind and enriching the soul. Once out of the building, one has a better view and understanding of the different peoples and cultures. The seed has also been planted in ones heart and mind the hunger and desire to learn more, live better, and share the best.
Journeys In Education Inc	72290		/users/profile/79037	scoot	General Member of the Public	5	02/21/2011	The Mariposa Museum is like a trip around the world without leaving town.  From children's dolls to native costumes, one can learn so much even in a brief visit.  It's also great fun to try out the ethnic instruments from several continents!  I and my friends can think of no more deserving an institute than the Mariposa.  We hope it will always be there to enlighten and entertain minds both young and old.  One could call it an "educational experience," yet it is so much exciting than that phrase sounds.  Step into the building and you step into another world--or, rather, a microcosm of our wide and wondrous world.

It's a place dedicated to life, color and the world.  Located in the vibrant downtown community of Peterborough, New Hampshire, it's worth a trip from hours away, just to experience what a small jewel of a museum can offer in the way of warmth and deep information about other world cultures.   The Museum is housed in a rebuilt 19th Century Church, spectacularly well-designed space inside, and historically preserved on the outside.  The many  varied concerts held there benefit from its beauty and lovely acoustics, as well as the cultural folk art and artifacts that surround every visitor.

The museum is tactile, colorful and wonderful.  It serves schools around the region in a way that no other local nonprofit does...and it's easier to reach (and thus more afforable) than institutions in Boston or other cities.  Of note is the museum's free offerings -- which are regular and plentiful -- that open exhibits, concerts, lectures and performances to all.  The Mariposa certainly builds bridges, and creates opportunities for global understanding in a very special way.

When we settled in NH I was astonished to discover the Mariposa,  an unprecedented resource for kids and adults, who would otherwise not have a chance to study and experience the wider world in such a personal, engaging forum. I never fail to bring foreign guests to the museum; it shows a side of "American culture"- its tolerance, curiosity and idealism that most outsiders tend to forget.
Journeys In Education Inc	71740		/users/profile/78446	Luz59	General Member of the Public	5	02/20/2011	As parent, teacher and in my own right as an artist I have frequently enjoyed the resources the Mariposa Museum has to offer. I have taken my own children and students to exhibits and performances which serve to broaden their cultural awareness and open their eyes, hearts and minds to the world beyond their own doorsteps. I have participated and helped to facilitate workshops there which furthered my own skills as an artist and teacher as well as contributing to the professional development of district educators. This is a gem of a museum and an invaluable addition to our community. Just viewing and of course interacting with the exhibis in this very 'hands on' museum opens the door to conversations on topics such as diversity, multiple perspectives and tolerance - so necessary in our culture today. The staff there are always willing to share their knowledge and sometimes even personal resources and connections with a teacher in need! I strongly (and often!) recommend the Mariposa Museum as a treasure trove of exploration for all generations.

Perhaps due to the nature of the collection the museum staff has embraced a vigorous outreach and education mission over the years, drawing in a variety of audiences to their classrooms, programs, exhibits, and performances.  I enjoy going to this museum every time I visit Peterborough, happy in this quintessential New England town to encounter visions of other places and other cultures whilst knowing that the museum is invested in making connections with their audiences.

Then you're talking with David and the Mariposa staff, and it gets to you:  You are one special person who has had a terrific journey to be here.  And because of this importance, listening to someone else discovering their amazing individuality is exciting and quieting at the same time.  The world would be so blank without us, like that wall without the Mona Lisa.  And if you make something, it just might be curated by Mariposa.

This special place feels like home to me.  I am so grateful that my grand-daughter, Maya, will grow up knowing this wonderful museum, with its many puppets, its hands-on collection of amazing musical instruments from all over the world, its creative classes for children and seniors, and its many and varied lectures and cultural performances,  complete with delicious traidtional foods from the featured region!

It was packed with a wonderful array of items to examine and explore.  The variety of colors alone were transporting on a gray February day.

I've learned wonderful crafts, and stories I can use at school. The Mariposa is very generous in lending their books, puppet theaters, etc. to schools.      With decreasing school budgets, the Mariposa has offered free buses for field trips. This has made it doable for my class to visit. They also work hard in trying to tie in curr. standards with their exhibits.

Journeys In Education Inc	71362		/users/profile/78035	anne	Client Served	5	02/19/2011	     Peterborough is, historically, a very typical New England community.  Yet on the Main Street of this little town is the Mariposa Museum, our gateway to the entire world.  Exhibits change, local participation is invited and encouraged, guests visit from across the globe, and we also discover the heritage, talents and skills of our very own neighbors.     I was a member of the committee that helped salvage the building after a terrible fire.  We were all excited about Linda and David's vision of a museum.  They worked hard and long, always knitting its execution into the community.  Since Linda's death, David and every level of helper, from tour guide to head administrator, has continued the beautiful flow of reaching out and giving back.     I love to attend the First Friday evening performances, and have witnessed drummers from Japan and shadow puppets from Indonesia.  Students from our school visited the museum the last time the Tibetan monks came to create a sand mandala;  Terri Reeves did a wonderful presentation on the history and variety of mandalas.  I also attended a workshop on mandalas there and used the ideas to do a project with students at school.     Mariposa's offerings are endless.  Their help is always kind and generous.  They fulfill their mission every day by opening their doors and letting in the world.

Journeys In Education Inc	71186		/users/profile/77808	James G.	Donor	5	02/18/2011	It's hard to describe the Mariposa Museum. It needs to be experienced.  Spend some time on the third floor playing the amazing array of percussion, string and wind instruments suitable for all ages. I like to drop in and improvise using the drums and metalophones or play my  flute; sometimes a family with kids or a visitor from another country will come in and jam.  On the first floor, here's a structured children's craft room with frequent workshops, and a gift shop that sells a variety of fair-trade and exotic gifts and crafts to keep the museum going. The frequent performances by local musicians, artists, dancers and poets are not to be missed.  The Zen garden outside offers an opportunity to meditate or rake the stones, while dozens of hand-made peace flags the size and shape of Tibetan  prayer flags flutter overhead. The wooden parquet floor on the second floor, with its Tao design in the center has absorbed the ambiance of performances and presentations from every corner of the globe and radiates back those energies even when the room is unoccupied.  Before it was a museum, the building was a puppet opera theatre. Though the building and most of the props were destroyed by fire, one large camel puppet remains from those days to provide a sense of continuity, smiling at visitors who climb the stairs.  The permanent and rotating exhibitions are too diverse to describe. Again, one must visit this place to appreciate it.

I have also helped out occasionally when large classes have come in.  The Mariposa is a facinating place - I learn something new every single time I go there.  I discover something new every time I go there.  I could spend days wandering around the Mariposa and never be bored.  With globalization and technology shrinking the distances between our boarders I think it is ever more important to understand more about other cultures and develop an appreciation for different traditions, art forms and beliefs.  The Mariposa is working to that end - educating and entertaining both young and old.

It is a treasure to be explored and protected. More than 10 years ago my family got involved in the museum. Not only have we visited it and attended events there. Two of the more memorable were the Gamelan Orchestra and the Tibetan Buddhist Sand Painting. We got to play Indonesian musical instruments as part of the orchestra. My son and wife visited each day to watch the progression of the sand painting. They also talked with and ate with the monks. We have also created and hosted events there. These include A Christmas Wassail, New Year's meditations, and singalongs.

One of my best experiences as a staff person at Conval High School was traveling with students to observe monks creating an intricate sand mandala at the Mariposa Museum.  While we cycled students through the museum, David Blair gave the students an experiential exposure to meditation. The student discussion that followed was insightful and thought provoking. Where else would local students get an up close look at a group of monks chanting and creating a remarkable sand mandala? In such a vanilla state, the Mariposa offers a taste of other cultures that we would not otherwise have here.

The great challenge of small town life is knowing a larger world  exists outside of what you see every day. The Mariposa Museum does both. I have left many a performance at the Mariposa thinking, "Wow. Is this a cool place." And by "place" I mean not just the Mariposa (though I do think that) but the larger  world I  live in. The programs at the Mariposa have broadened my mind and sparked me to further explore cultures I knew little about. Their recent evening on the Philipines opened my eyes to the music, people and history of a culture I knew little about. Watching traditionally dressed dancers from different generations was  breath taking.

Perreault	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/18/2011	My experiences with the Mariposa Museum have been the following, all of which was connected to a recent exhibit on Finnish and French Canadian cultures as examples of populations living in the northern parts of the world: - Giving my N.H. Humanities Council slide lecture, "Before Peyton Place: In Search of the Real Grace Metalious" at the museum, June 26. 2010.- Being a member of the audience for an evening of French Canadian and New England Franco-American storytelling and songs by singer, songwriter, guitarist, and storyteller Kenneth Jean Cloutier, July 2, 2010.- Participating in a roundtable style discussion with members of the general public, most of whom were either Finnish Americans or New England Franco-Americans, during which we shared stories of our familial, religious, work-related, and other experiences as members of the our respective ethnic groups, August 22, 2010. In all cases, these were extremely positive experiences, as Mariposa Museum director David Blair and his staff were well organized, welcoming, and helpful in making all three events a success. In fact, audience members for my slide lecture on Grace Metalious (ne Marie Grace DeRepentigny in Manchester, N.H.'s Franco-American community) included writers Ernest Hebert, Howard Mansfield, and Sy Montgomery, while the discussion on ethnic experiences attracted such people as Margaret Langford, professor of French at Keene State College and author of translations of Franco-American novels from French to English. The Mariposa Museum therefore attracts not only the general public but experts in various cultural fields, all due to the quality of its programs and its exhibits.

Not only are there fixed exhibits of artifacts from around the globe, but there are special changing exhibits that spotlight different regions of our world. Usually there are talks, presentations, and musical and dance performances in conjunction with these.  In the past I have watched Buddhist monks crafting a sand mandala, I have listened to African drummers, heard an Irish pipe ensemble, and marveled at the performers in an Argentine Tango demonstration. A retired educator, I appreciate the opportunities the Mariposa has given me to continue to learn and to continue to give to my community.

Mariposa Museum fills an important gap for local residents by putting them in touch with the larger world. This is particularly significant for young people growing up in Peterborough. Through programs and exhibits at the Mariposa young people come to an early understanding that the world is much larger than the world they grew up in. Not only are they exposed to the immense size of the world but they come in direct contact with many of the cultures that make up the world. Through performance and artifacts the Mariposa serves as a doorway to the world that would not otherwise be available to people. As a result of such exposure Mariposa is making an important and serious contribution to peoples understanding of how the wider world is different from their own. This understanding causes people to be more tolerant and accepting of the great variety of cultures throughout the world.

Who would have thought such a gem of a museum would exist here?  It is the little engine that could.  Such a small enterprise, motivated by talented staff and board, seems to have excelled at every turn.  Now when we are visiting in the area, the Mariposa Museum will always be on our itinerary -- what a great combination of education and fun!
Journeys In Education Inc	70962		/users/profile/77574	same	Volunteer	5	02/18/2011	My association with the Mariposa Museum came about through an article in the local paper requesting volunteers.  I had just recently moved to Peterborough and did not know many people.  The fact that they were looking for someone to help with the textiles, as well as bake for receptions, etc. seemed "right up my alley" and selfishly I felt it would be a way to become acquainted with more people.  I feel the Mariposa has given me more than I have given them in that the knowledge and  pride that staff, board members, and volunteers are constantly passing along to all who enter is invaluable.  I  am example of never too old to learn and in the past four years as a volunteer my world has been broadened.

The Museum not only provides its visitors with rare opportunities to experience world cultures. It is also committed to the artists (dancers, musicians, visual artists, etc) whose work it presents to the public. This commitment has led to long-term friendship and relationships that encourage the artists to continue their work and in doing so greatly enrich all of our lives.

I am living in a community for peoples with special needs and this colorful and authentic  hand on displays, offers to all who  lives with us and  visit the Museum a wonderful rich few into other worlds, lives and times. Thank you

What a wonderful treasure!

The Mariposa is a stimulating environment with folk art, games, music, books and art activities that excite children of all ages.  
Journeys In Education Inc	70726		/users/profile/77308	skippy	General Member of the Public	5	02/18/2011	The Mariposa Museum brings cultures from around the world to the small New England town of Peterborough and surrounding towns. Their exhibits are usually very interactive and educational. My son's most memorable experience there was when Tibetan monks came and created a sand mandala at the museum. The children were also allowed to create their own sand mandala during the visit. It was a memorable experience and was also useful to my son later in high school when he was in an eastern world heritage class and creating their own mandala projects.

Events are consistently entertaining and informativetruly transporting experiences.
Journeys In Education Inc	70589		/users/profile/77159	hugh	Donor	5	02/18/2011	  Mariposa is one of the unique jewels making Peterborough a destination for tourists and for school field trips as well as helping the town be a vibrant community for residents. The museum is not a large building, yet its impact is large, not just through beautiful collections selected from cultures around the world, but also from the many sponsored performances and workshops drawing upon talent from afar as well as from the Monadnock region. As a donor and visitor, I've found that every dollar given is used effectively and imaginatively, with visible results. One hope I have for Mariposa is that additional funds would allow it the resources to reach out at greater distance to other museums in New England where there is an overlap of interests, knowledge, artifacts and programs. This could be a win-win pathway to enhance critical mass, without growing an appropriately scaled institution beyond sustainable size.

I have often used the website to illustrate how the visual arts should be a multicultural experience.
Journeys In Education Inc	70501		/users/profile/77066	Augusta T.	Volunteer	5	02/18/2011	This museum is a total gem!  It's collections are unique, thoughtful, and deeply enriching.  The Mariposa caters simultaneously to adults and children, and its interactive nature distinguishes it from the majority of museums in the Monadnock Region.  For inspiring events, check the website, as they are frequent and consistently fabulous!
Journeys In Education Inc	70475		/users/profile/77035	nkraevskaia	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/18/2011	There are not so many museums in the world which have such an informal interactive way of functioning as Mariposa Museum. The visual perception of ethnographic objects is only the first introduction to other cultures. The possibility to touch, to put on, to experience provokes the curiosity both in children and adults, creates the feeling that you are also a part of this cultural patchwork.Visiting the Mariposa Museum in 2003 I was really impressed by rich collection of this small museum and by the wide range of educational and community projects conducted by it.The passion and the enthusiasm of the founders and staff of the Museum helped to transform the private collection display, a small provincial meeting place into the really important international spot where different cultures and nationalities meet and communicate.Mariposa  Museum is a perfect model for the youth educational institutions.Natalia Kraevskaia,art curator, Director of art gallery Salon Natasha, Hanoi, Vietnam

Journeys In Education Inc	70384		/users/profile/76942	Gordon	Donor	5	02/17/2011	I was particularly impressed with how much the museum allowed visitors to see, touch, and play with artifacts and instruments from such a diverse selection of societies. I never dreamed that there were so many different ways to make sound and music. I have found the exhibits to be eye-and ear-openers!
Journeys In Education Inc	70364		/users/profile/76916	Doug	Donor	4	02/17/2011	The Mariposa Museum performs a unique double function in our community and for this region. It offers exhibits and performances to bring alive the many diverse cultures of our world for people of all ages in this region and visitors here. But the fact that they draw many of their cultural artifacts from people who live in this region and who have traveled to these exotic places helps us to realize what a cosmopolitan community we are in the midst of right here in the Monadnock region. I am stimulated and delighted by the programs I attend, but I am also appreciative of the other people I meet there. The museum doesn't just display cultures. It creates a broader and deeper one right here.
Journeys In Education Inc	70355		/users/profile/76905	Peterborough Sue	General Member of the Public	5	02/17/2011	I have attended Mariposa since its founding. As an ESL teacher, I am constantly in touch with local immigrant families. Without exception, each visitor I have taken has been surprised to find a part of their heritage and culture. The Cambodian students watched the monks making a mandala, the Vietnamese woman was moved to tears to see paintings of her country, the Women of the World Conversation club members were delighted to discover pieces in the museum which told their stories. The museum is very affordable for everyone, with educator and student discounts, a bargain elder program, free First Friday events. It hosts a wide range of musical performances. Most recently, I loaned an Indonesian ceremonial garment for display and was personally moved that my mother-in-law's wedding gift to us spoke to others. Mariposa welcomes ideas and suggestions, which led  me to organizing an afternoon event of British Tea for the community.
Journeys In Education Inc	70083		/users/profile/76598	Gaylord	General Member of the Public	5	02/17/2011	Mariposa does so much with its school outreach programs, its cross-cultural "events", and its hands-on, here-is-the-world exhibits.  I love the Mariposa, and I am proud to be a sponsor. 
Journeys In Education Inc	70042		/users/profile/76554	jeastmanny	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/17/2011	I have worked for many years with non-profits focused on promoting education and awareness of different world cultures through experiential learning. I know firsthand how important this mission is and Mariposa Museum & World Cultures Center is a great example of a non-profit offering creative, interactive programs that build appreciation and respect for cultures that are different from our own. By showcasing and celebrating world cultures in a dynamic, respectful, engaging way, Mariposa offers all who visit a chance to develop greater understanding, tolerance, and connection with the wider world.
Journeys In Education Inc	70040		/users/profile/76552	Richard	Board Member	5	02/17/2011	I discovered and became involved with Mariposa during 2010.  Its mission of "bringing the world to New England" is critically important to all of us.   Our country is changing; it is becoming much more diverse and all of us need to fully understand and appreciate this diversity. 
Journeys In Education Inc	70030		/users/profile/76541	DRWJ	Volunteer	5	02/17/2011	Remarkable small museum relating to cultures of the world.  Located in downtown Peterborough in south-central New Hampshire.  Unique in northern New England.  Regularly focuses on different regions of the world with performances, lectures and exhibits.  current focus is the Mediterranean.  Appeals to young and old - school groups and families regularly visit.  Uses print and electronic media to project its content. 
Journeys In Education Inc	70029		/users/profile/76540	johnmatthias44	General Member of the Public	4	02/17/2011	My initial experience at the museum was a "First Friday " event several years ago.  My family and I were hooked!  We have since become members of the museum  to enjoy the rich, high quality and varied presentations.  From Tibetan sand painting to mandolin performances,to displays of folk art,  traditional costumes, and  tasting delicious ethnic food, there is always something new to experience.

I have made contributions of storytelling from my  Native American tradition there and my wife, who is Swedish, has contributed artifacts from her country to an exhibit there, and we have attended many events and exhibits there, always a rewarding experience, full of unexpected delights and learning.  It has become a cultural focal point for gathering the people of the Monadnock region.

Our students are fortunate to see, touch, and use artifacts from many other cultures that are collected and exhibited at the Mariposa Museum. I have found the exhibits to be thoughtfully curated, with a range of objects and activities. The museum staff are flexible and willing to work with school groups.
Journeys In Education Inc	69918		/users/profile/76422	Anne T.	Volunteer	5	02/17/2011	The Mariposa is vibrant regional treasure as a lively museum with an active program schedule to keep bringing in people in the community and beyond.  Not enough can be said about the rich collections of treasures from around the world with plenty of opportunity to interact, having a visual and tactile feast or making a ruckus or quiet tune.  The museum has always been very proactive about keeping in the eye of the community with rotating gallery exhibits and performances. In a addition to being a lovely space of wood and glass and interesting architectural lines to contrast with the rich colorful displays, the space transforms into an inspiring performance venue for anything from storytelling to lectures to music from around the world, mostly presented simply without needing any amplification.  The space has a lovely acoustic and a natural performance backdrop,  honoring a previous use of the building as a marionette opera stage.  The museum has been able to host anything from fabulous multicultural performers, who would never happen to appear in this rural area, to local performers who have had an opportunity to hone a new set, group, story or whatever.  One example is the master talesman, Sebastian Lockwood, who has developed many tales of around the world and ages with a wonderful, inspiring venue to share his tales freshly crafted.   I have had the opportunity to present medieval and renaissance vocal harmonies from around the world as I studied them in a group called Halcyon, a favorite place to gather audience and perform. There is untold wealth of cultural opportunity that the museum provides to the local school children, the community and the region with its rich offerings.  The Mariposa helps to put the little town of Peterborough, New Hampshire on the map as a place to expect the unusual and intellectually broadening.  From the ashes of a tragic fire has grown an amazing gem.

Journeys In Education Inc	69894		/users/profile/76396	Ellie	General Member of the Public	5	02/17/2011	I became involved with the Mariposa museum about a year ago as they planned an exhibit of Northern European countries including Finland. I was most impressed with the thoroughness of their research and their truly personal interest in learning all they could for their exhibits and programs. David Blair is a remarkable, caring person who truly loves what he does and that attitude is conveyed to all who work with him. I attended many of the programs and was always impressed with the variety and thought that went into them. I can't endorse their missionenough. They provide a marvelous cultural learning experience here in cold, wintery NH!
Journeys In Education Inc	69888		/users/profile/76389	MaryD	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/17/2011	I have known Mariposa since its early days: both as a performer and as a neighbor.  The physical space has added so much to the town of Peterborough: turning what might have been a vacant building  into a hive of activity for people of all ages. Mariposa both anchors a site of beauty and energy on a small town main street, and brings in visitors to our region, giving a much-needed boost to other businesses. From the moment one steps into the Museum, she is drawn into a world of beauty, activity and diversity.  Unlike a retail store, the precious objects displayed are to share, not to acquire-- the beauty of fabric, wood, music and dance belongs to all.  For so many of us it is an oasis of joy in a confusing world.
Journeys In Education Inc	69886		/users/profile/76386	mombay	General Member of the Public	5	02/17/2011	I watched in awe as the Mariposa took a burned out building on Main Street and turned it into the most Important Cultural and Social place in Peterborough, NH and surrounding New England.This region is filled with interesting people, but there was no cultural center where people of all ages,creeds, race and persuasion could meet almost every day until Mariposa opened it's doors to us.For instance, last week my granddaughter and  I attended a mandolin concert to a standing room only audience. It was the opening of the 'People of the Mediterranean 'exhibit and included a buffet with home cooked foods from Morocco, Spain and Greece. We ate supper, I met friends I had not seen in months, family members, several new interesting people, and and enjoyed showing my granddaughter a museum quality exhibit of another cultural region.. After the concert we went downstairs and she was taught how to weave a Valentines heart for her Mom and Dad in the craft room.When I take my granddaughter for a walk , she will say" Let's go see what is at the Mariposa today"and we can go there to  their multi-cultural  'children room' with books, games, puppets,crafts or go up to the top floor where she can try musical instruments from around the world or try on traditional costumes . I can enjoy the exhibits , both the permanent and quarterly, or shop in the store and always find the best present for any age there , without the high prices of other Museums.I could go on and on because this is the best place in the entire Southern New Hampshire region as far as I am concerned. It brings the World to us all every day, and is a place where we can all learn about the Culture which surrounds us. In this 'world wide web' era..we must learn to respect each others culture. The Mariposa is Pioneering this effort. Bravo!!! PS; I forgot to tell you that  I can take Tango Lessons there in the evenings!!
Journeys In Education Inc	69878		/users/profile/76377	Nancy Lloyd	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/17/2011	I have lived in the area for thirteen years and have enjoyed the many global offerings that Mariposa has presented. Concerts - I especially like any kind of guitar music, to lectures, to symposiums - one on the philosophy/psychology  of Carl Jung, to the sand paintings of the Tibetan monks come to mind. In addition, are the many visits to the mueum and to gifts from the gift store which I have enjoyed sharing with friends. It's a great area resource - we must keep it flourishing!!  Nancy L.
Journeys In Education Inc	69860		/users/profile/76359	Jean Gogolin	General Member of the Public	5	02/17/2011	That Mariposa exists at all is a boon.  That it exists in a town as small as Peterborough, New Hampshire, is even better.  Our whole family enjoys the museum - especially visiting grandchildren who love trying on the costumes and playing the musical instruments from around the world!  Everywhere you look is another treasure. 
Journeys In Education Inc	69849		/users/profile/76347	Bobrue	General Member of the Public	5	02/17/2011	People around the world in general, and our corner of New Hampshire in particular, need exposure to the diversity of cultures from other points on the globe.  Mariposa Museum brings these cultures alive with interactive demonstrations, shows, and exhibits by those from these cultures.  It's wonderful to watch Buddhist monks create a sand painting or native costumes being worn by people from that culture.    When attending concerts and community talks given in the museum, I was exposed to the rich diversity inherent in our global family by the extraordinary exhibits on static display.  These exhibits invariably lead to my conversations with those present about cultures very different from ours. Peterborough is blessed to have the Mariposa as a resource of learning, diversity, and awareness.  To me, it is a special place indeed.
Journeys In Education Inc	69833		/users/profile/76327	rhamm	Volunteer	5	02/17/2011	Mariposa Museum is a window on the world, curated with care, a unique resource for residents of the Monadnock region.  In truth, we may believe that it "belongs" to us in southwestern New Hampshire, but its influence is felt well beyond our neighborhood into neighboring states.  I am individual with roots in the Republic of the Philippines.  Mariposa became the best choice for gifting a number of artifacts from the Maranao region of Mindanao because I was confident that, with Mariposa and the Blairs, their story would continue to be told with sensitivity and wonder.  I'm grateful for educational work of Mariposa Museum.
Journeys In Education Inc	69788		/users/profile/76274	tomwest	Donor	5	02/17/2011	Mariposa provides a window into a world many in the US would never normally see.  IT provides a hands-on experience for children and adults alike to better understand that we are all brothers and sisters.  They provide fixed exhibits and regular shows which exposes the region to many ideas and cultures thereby improving the region in a special way.
Journeys In Education Inc	69721		/users/profile/76201	Rosel	General Member of the Public	5	02/16/2011	The Mariposa is a glorious window in to other cultures, creating many an opportunity for the individual (young to old) to continue learning and broaden their horizons. On a local level it is an invaluable resource; a dynamic organization built on initiative and the generous support of many fascinating, kind people. There are programs for school children, classes for the elderly, illuminating exhibitions, talks and performances. The Museum is given to sharing worlds; sacred traditions, music, the finery of costumes.... just to cite a few. As a family we have been fortunate to hear a wonderful drummer from Guinea, watch dancers perform from India & Cambodia, listen to a bard retell the story of theOdyssey, Gilgamesh...... . Our daughters have volunteered  there, have worked alongside Tibetan Monks, connected with 'Free the Children' and modeled exquisitely made wedding dresses from all over the world. One relatively light-hearted night out comprised a 'scotch' whiskey tasting. The list goes on. The Mariposa is a magnetic pull for us all.                                                                                                                                             
Journeys In Education Inc	69379		/users/profile/75814	cynthia	Volunteer	5	02/16/2011	 The Mariposa Museum in Peterborough NH is an extraordinary asset to the communities in the Monadnock region. Here children, families, school groups, and anyone interested in other countries and cultures will find a remarkably broad range of artifacts. The Mariposa is housed in a wonderful historic space  originally a church  that has been completely renovated into a very accessible and lovely space. It includes intimate alcove spaces for play with musical instruments, and large display cases that feature costumes and artifacts from around the world. The exhibits and programs change frequently at Mariposa and include musical performances, story telling, crafts, and exhibits. Best of all, the Mariposa truly serves its community and visitors to the area. It is a wonderful asset to our community that has been able to thrive because the people involved have made personal sacrifices to keep the Museum up and running, but the best thing about Mariposa is the ownership that children take as soon as they enter the space. It is a wonderful place for youngsters to learn and develop.

We stopped in Peterborough for lunch and wandered into the Mariposa quite by accident, drawn  by its colorful and inviting window display.   We were completely caught  by surprise to see this rich cultural treasure here in this little New England village.  Before long we were playing drums and chanting upstairs.  We caused quite a ruckus and had a marvelous time.  We've been back several more times and continue to make a point of stopping in Peterborogh in no small part to  visit the Mariposa, looking forward to  see what new delights they have in store for us.    The hostess, I might add, was very charming and completely knowledgeable and enthusiastic.  A real joy!

The extraordinary, rich and lively musical performances and ever-changing cultural exhibitions are a treasure to be heralded in the Monadnock region, and the museum itself is located in a charming and historic setting.  Free First Friday performances are always special! Mariposa displays directly, and intimately, the humanity that we all share in common on this planet.  Awareness and appreciation of diverse cultures leads to better understanding the world we live in today, which is so vital as cultures come rapidly into closer and closer contact.   The museum has made large impressions on my children in this regard.  I'm proud to be a supporter of their cause and vision.

I think the programing is great as well - I would just love to see more of it. Mariposa is a little gem in Peterborough and I felt lucky to have stumbled upon it.
Journeys In Education Inc	68636		/users/profile/74995	Diana	Client Served	5	02/15/2011	Both as a mother and as a individual, I find the Mariposa Museum, its programs, staff and exhibits fascinating, highly educating and inspiring!  Living in rural New Hampshire, one would never dream of having access to the programs that the Museum offers so close by.  The educational staff is absolutely incredible... going above and beyond to expose our community and its children to eye-opening programs (from Buddhist monks creating mandalas, to scottish bagpiping demonstrations... to programs about clothing, cooking, map making, and art from around the world...) They are also pivotal in our community in the promotion of the Arts in general. I serve on several nonprofit boards and understand the challenges that nonprofits face -- the Mariposa should be commended on so many levels. 
Journeys In Education Inc	68378		/users/profile/74711	museum	General Member of the Public	2	02/15/2011	While having a worthy mission and vision the museum falls short in notable ways.The conceptual design of its exhibits lacks focus, depth and coherence.  What did the curator want a visitor to learn or take away about a culture and its artifacts?  Labels are spare and uninformative.It is not easy to walk through a 'new exhibit'.  Objects are displayedin disparate cases throughout the museum. Their cases are interspersed with permanent collection caseswhich are also poorly labeled.  There seems to be no logic, rhyme or reason for the position of one case to the next.There is little to orient the visitor  .. not even maps to identify the location of countries.I saw a beautiful array of dolls, textiles, ceramics, jewelry, masks, instruments buttheir meaning or significance escaped me.   What are their provenance? Why should I care?How do they reflect traditional cultures? Are they still relevant to those cultures? If trying to bring the world to me .. explain the world .. don't just show me a hodge-podge of things.albethem pretty things. I gather the museum's school program and senior series are outstanding, and that the performances are world class.  So  make the exhibits as valuable and compelling.  Have them live up to the mission.

To us it means mermaids, madrigals and mandolins! We have heard stories about mermaids on St. Patrick's Day; we've listened to lovely madrigals sung by Lachrimae, a group from Franklin Pierce University; and we've enjoyed hearing a group of wonderful mandolin players serenade us with songs from Italy. Where else can you travel the world in a few beautifully decorated rooms? The exhibits are interesting as well. It is a place where the public can share in the cultural riches of our global community.

Whoever chooses to take advantage of their displays, program and speakers also allows themselves to be whisked away by an education that is enjoyable.  With great art and organization real life experiences  expose the differences and commonalities of many cultures while satisfying the pallet for seeing something new.   Whenever I browse their displays, this odd thing happens, I learn more about me, my possibilities and my limitations through a articulate and clearly compassionate lens.

Journeys In Education Inc	68056		/users/profile/74371	Englund	General Member of the Public	5	02/14/2011	(THE LETTER BELOW WAS PUBLISHED IN THE KEENE SENTINEL IN EARLY FEBRUARY OF THIS YEAR.) To the Editor:   The Mariposa Museum, located in the old Baptist Church building, has a ten-year history in the center of downtown Peterborough and is a treasure of the Monadnock Region.  The permanent collection includes folk art, textiles, costumes, arts, toys, and instruments from all continents.  Rotating exhibits feature visiting artists in residence, photography displays, works borrowed from other galleries, and other special events.  Our most recent Mariposa visit to the museum occurred in conjunction with the opening of "Southeast Asia," a two-month exhibition which included many items representing the vibrant cultures of Cambodia, Vietnam, the Philippines, Thailand, and Indonesia.  The program included the marvelous storyteller, Sebastian Lockwood, who told the famous story of "The Monkey King:  A Journey to the West."  The story, first recorded in China in the year 560, is loved throughout Asia and was truly appreciated by the audience in the museum's auditorium.   The Mariposa is a family-friendly facility.  Rather than seeing the traditional do not touch signs next to exhibits in most museums, signs at the Mariposa urge children to try on the clothes which represent costumes of many cultures or to play the instruments, or to play with the puppets or play a game of "I Spy" finding the items on a card in the exhibit cases or on the walls.  Check out their web-site, www.mariposamuseum.org, for a user-friendly complete and very interesting introduction to the Mariposa.  And treat yourself and your children or grandchildren to a magical afternoon of discovery. Robert J. Englund71 Cameron Cove, Munsonville

From clothes, fabrics, jewelry, bowls and other personal and domestic artifacts to sculpture, paintings, and decorative fabric panels, a visitor is instantly fascinated throughout his or her visit.  Personally, I was enchanted by the variety of objects, their colorfulness, and their venues which are literally world-wide.  I wish such a museum had existed when my children were small.  If I was totally engaged and discovering how much I had to learn, I can imagine how exciting the museum would be to youngsters for whom the hands-on features would be especially exciting.  I know of no small ethnic museum with as much variety and as lively an atmosphere.  I look forward to its growth and proliferation of exhibits!

From its light and inviting building, to its changing exhibits, to the generosity of making the space available for a variety of performers, it plays a very valuable role in indtroducing small-town kids and grownups to a larger world.  The quality of the folk art displayed is outstanding, and when augmented by special things loaned for exhibits, gives a literally tangible appreciation for other cultures.   For unlike most other museums, Mariposa encourages children to feel, touch, experience, bringing cultures to life. Finally, the way the museum is developing exhibits with local ethnic groups builds links among generations. preserving and passing along a rich cultural heritage. They do good work.

The Buddist Monks spent several days working on a Sand Mandala at the Museum. Each day my son was excited to watch this creation occur before us. On the last day, they walked the Mandala down to the river. His whole body lite up. To this day he has the little bit of sand that the monks passed out in a baggie on his art table. Need we say more. Thank you for this gem in the middle of the Mondanock Region!

Although Peterborough is a tiny village in comparison to the larger world out there, the Mariposa is cherished by the community because they bring us such interesting, thought provoking exhibitions.  Especially today - with stories such as the revolution in Egypt on our TVs and computers - we need to understand all cultures and appreciate them for their beauty and diversity!  Bravo to the Mariposa Museum!

It was a delightful experience.  I left saying that Mariposa was the most wonderful museum I had ever been to.  It engaged us at all levels, was hands on and even kept my ADD grandson interested.
Journeys In Education Inc	67507		/users/profile/73787	DRAKH	Board Member	5	02/13/2011	When we moved to New Hampshire five years ago, my family and I were delighted to discover the Mariposa Museum through the free programs offered to the community during First Fridays.  As a folklorist, I am astounded by the range of artifacts, performances, programs, and please touch policy of the museum.  We are now members of the museum and have enjoyed the Mariposa's creative approach to education--from watching monks working on a sand mandala to exploring the taste and history of various foods.  Truly, the Mariposa brings the world to New England's doorstep.
Journeys In Education Inc	67478		/users/profile/73756	CAMA	General Member of the Public	5	02/13/2011	Mariposa is a rich resource of culture, art and education bridging the key component of community for the local residents and visitors of the state of New Hampshire.  Any organization that enhances a community in its broader scope of relating with all of human culture while infusing creativity and enjoyment is worth treasuring. 
Journeys In Education Inc	67436		/users/profile/73708	mustangbuddy	Volunteer	4	02/12/2011	I believe that the Mariposa is a wonderful museum that offers many opportunities to expand one's knowledge of world culture in a vast array of fun and engaging activities and presentations that contribute greatly to the community.   
Journeys In Education Inc	67413		/users/profile/73683	NBGR	Donor	5	02/12/2011	The Mariposa is not only a place to see what things other parts of the world value, but to learn more about how they live. I attend every program that I can: the senior series, First Fridays and special talks or concerts. They often include the foods of the region, the costumes and customs, the music and stories. This enriches and widens the horizons of those living in a small but beautiful community.
Journeys In Education Inc	67351		/users/profile/73614	KPKV	General Member of the Public	5	02/12/2011	The Mariposa is one of the pillars of the regional community. It is a place to which I take every visitor to my home, which is in the next town over. The Mariposa is a beautiful place filled with beautiful things. Most importantly it is peopled with beautiful souls. I first became aware of the site by taking our, then, 1st grader who fell in love with the museum. She is now about to graduate high school and her joy about the Mariposa remains the same. She has infected my wife and I with similar feelings. We in turn have infected many, many friends who greatly enjoy the exhibits, music, dance, lectures, parties, staff, and just being a part of such a wonderful institution.
Journeys In Education Inc	67320		/users/profile/73581	NEMO	General Member of the Public	5	02/12/2011	The Mariposa Museum was constructed in the space that housed the first, and only, Marionette Opera in America. The New England Marionette Opera was totally destroyed by fire on Jan. 1, 1999. The building was declared a total loss and 245 hand-crafted marionettes were lost in the inferno. One of the eight marionettes which survived the fire was Madama Butterfly, from the opera of the same name. As the Mariposa Museum began restoring the fire-ravaged building, they asked the Opera if they could have that marionette to display within several feet from where she originally performed. The answer was yes. The marionette costume was remade by the very same Japanese fashion designer who made all the original costumes for the Marionette Opera. The marionette was restrung and repaired. And today Madama Butterfly is prominently on display at the Mariposa Museum with the 10-ft. of control lines soaring up to the marionette control which is suspended from the balcony of the museum. This was a wonderful first step for the Mariposa Museum to honor and preserve this one-of-a-kind art form in the very location where it was born. It also keeps alive one of the most unique art forms to come on the cultural scene in decades, and it gives the thousands of patrons who viewed the New England Marionette Opera an opportunity to reconnect with this lost thread in the American cultural tapestry. This gesture by the Mariposa Museum was a true cultural and community wonder.
Journeys In Education Inc	67317		/users/profile/73578	BAMbam	Advisor	5	02/12/2011	The Mariposa Museum is a passport to the world for those who do not have the financial resources to travel beyond the borders of New England and therefore have little exposure to the diversity and beauty of the cultures of the world. It accomplishes its mission through educational programs, exhibitions, performances, and teacher workshops. When people better understand each other, respect will flourish and the world will know more peace. I have personally seen the results of the museum's many arts education programs.  Students who visit the museum experience cultures through exposure to folk art, stories, artifacts, music, etc.,gain an appreciation of other cultures, learn not to fear people who are "different" and accept others without prejudice to skin color, culture or ethnicity 
Journeys In Education Inc	67310		/users/profile/73569	cntleger	General Member of the Public	5	02/12/2011	Mariposa Museum is a real New England gem!  Our family regularly travels more than a hour each way to take advantage of the learning opportunities and changing exhibits.  There is more art and culture packed into this building than in most major art museums and the hands-on opportunities for children as well as the quality and variety of exhibits are second to none.  The icing on the cake is an incredibly knowledgeable staff with an enthusiasm that is infectious!  
Journeys In Education Inc	67303		/users/profile/73562	sierr	Volunteer	5	02/12/2011	After living on the Big Island of Hawai'i for 2 years & working at the historic Volcano Art Center, I returned back home to New England and discovered a hidden gem tucked in the heart of the Monadnock region of New Hampshire ---the splendid Mariposa Museum, right in downtown Peterborough.    Such a feast for the senses----color, music, creativity, knowledge, an impressive collection of clothing, textiles, fine arts & crafts from around the world & fascinating musical instruments you can actually touch and play.  All this and more on 3 light-filled floors await the visitor--young & old.    The library alone is worth it's weight in gold, and (monthly) First Friday's, featuring musical talent, informative films & artist receptions serve as a popular destination for both locals and out-of-towners.  So much to see, do and LEARN in this historic, renovated church---plus  free parking, which makes visiting easy.  What more could you ask for?
Journeys In Education Inc	67302		/users/profile/73561	zephyr	Donor	4	02/12/2011	I have enjoyed the glimpses of far away foreign lands and cultures over the many years.  The Mariposa helps us see beyond the surface of any culture by exposing us to life elements, what makes up the daily routine of residents at their home country?  For example, last night's discussion about picking olives from the family olive trees in Greece.  Very personal and cozy presentation that has the ability to transport you.

The Mariposa Museum brings a touch of the world's cultures  to a special corner of New England.  It is a brilliant idea, well done at little or no cost to a large number of people.   The Mariposa Museum adds another destination  in a  community that has several outstanding attractions.  The joy of learning and warm welcome starts outside the building.  Prayer flags flying over the Zen Garden  next to the museum and  Umbul-umbuls at the entrance beckon all to enter.

I have since seen the museum transfer not just information and experience (to all ages) but generate and excitement, a curiosity and, most importantly, a tolerance for the world outside New England. The staff and volunteers are fabulously creative and welcoming and magical things happen at the Mariposa.
Journeys In Education Inc	54723		/users/profile/56483	Holly Bull	General Member of the Public	5	10/13/2010	I wish Princeton, NJ had something like this that was so accessible to families, especially children. My daughter, Lia, was excited about her two visits there and described them to others in detail. She really liked the "treasure hunt" option and I thought this was a brilliant way to engage kids and parents and make sure they reach all three floors of the museum. Being an anthopology major and a great fan of the "Please Touch" museum model, I think the Mariposa has blended a rich cultural array of artifacts with the fun of actually being able to use some of them. Lia and I spent about 45 minutes in the music gallery alone playing and musing over the variety of instruments from around the world. I particularly like the second floor space for presentations -- it's utterly peaceful and aesthetically appealing and I'm just sorry that I haven't been able to attend an event there.
FIRST	308144		/users/profile/399528	IsyRivers	Volunteer	5	10/06/2016	A very cool program that gets kids learning about Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) under the guise of building robots, friendly competition, and gracious professionalism.   
FIRST	306670		/users/profile/397953	Writer	Client Served	5	09/27/2016	This program is changing the culture of our world for the better.  Pairing students with professional mentors to work side by side to achieve a goal with too little resources and time is astonishing. Many people think that FIRST is just about engineering and robots but as someone who went into digital marketing I can tell you that what FIRST is:  FIRST is an opportunity to be inspired.  It is the platform that is provided that can launch your life by not just teaching the technical skill, but the soft skills required to be prosperous.  Coming into FIRST when I was in high school I was deathly afraid of public speaking.  Now I embrace it though hosting events, my own podcast, and articulating myself to be the influential person in the room.I now give back as a mentor in my own FIRST program to hopefully inspire the next generation as I was before.  Thank you FIRST.

FIRST	306057	1	/users/profile/397322	mrlim	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/22/2016	FIRST Robotics is one of the best educational experiences available right now. You build robots that play sports against other schools. It combines the learning of Robotics with the intangibles and excitement of sports. Strong students learn very high level skills to become real high flyers in life. Weaker students gain inspiration, excitement and motivation towards learning dreaded subjects like science, technology, engineering and math. I've seen at risk students choose to stay in school and build successful careers because of Robotics. I've seen smart kids learn the work ethic and confidence needed to launch start-ups and have them purchased by Google. I've even seen it save an entire school by providing a marquee program that the entire community rallied around, causing enrollments double. It is a life changing program for everyone who gets involved. We just need to keep spreading the word about this amazing program, because every student should have access to it.

FIRST	305941		/users/profile/397212	brian.s	Volunteer	5	09/21/2016	I participated in FIRST programs throughout school, and am now a mentor for an FRC team. I had and continue to have a lot of fun, and I learned a lot of really valuable things. The main overarching concept I learned was what working as an engineer (of any kind) means. School (even college to a large extent) really doesn't involve much engineering. To me, this means solving open-ended problems with complex constraints as a team. I enjoy doing this, and FIRST helped me see  how a job in engineering is a good fit for me. As a volunteer mentor, I enjoy working with high school students to help them discover what this means too.  I think actual experience is by far the best way to decide whether you want to study engineering in college and beyond, and have some idea which area you want to learn more about.Unlike school, FIRST's programs help participants learn "why" (why are we doing this? why aren't we doing that? why are we doing this now? why are we doing it this way? why is that important?). If you want to really understand something, that's the most important thing to know, and FIRST is good at designing programs which encourage students to figure that out, both on their own and with help from experienced adults.

They had hands-on opportunities to explore and build, and to compete in the most positive way. What's really special about FIRST, though, is the outreach to kids who would not otherwise have a chance to build a robot or be on a team or travel to a competition. FIRST opens their eyes to the possibility of a career in STEM, and the experience of being on a team builds skills and confidence that make such a career possible. I now volunteer for FIRST so I can give back and make it possible for other people's children to have this same opportunity.

He is a shy kid, but as the team's driver and captain, he had to overcome his shyness and seek out other teams and collaborate with them in their alliances.

FIRST	258387	1	/users/profile/346879	LMinBoston	Volunteer	4	09/19/2015	First Robotics helps introduce engineering and robotics to kids and teens in a fun and competitive way, but also in a way that lets them explore the world of science, tech, marketing and engineering.  First makes these fields accessible to kids who might never have thought of or pursued engineering and science. And First is a great entry for girls into STEM.   And First stresses good sportsmanship and comraderie at the competition, and helps build an engaged and supportive community.
FIRST	258218	1	/users/profile/346706	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	09/18/2015	I have been so impressed with the students with whom I've interacted! Some of them joined half-heartedly and are now pursuing engineering degrees in college or have gone on to work for NASA and high-tech firms. Others were looking for a way to connect in high school and are now enthusiastic leaders of a team where they are pursuing a new-found passion. It's really wonderful to see the genuine enthusiasm and commitment these students express during the competitions and how that carries over into their school environment!
FIRST	257998		/users/profile/346480	Kristen58	General Member of the Public	5	09/17/2015	What a wonderful way for our young population to compete. This program progresses through all grade levels and ages involving its participates in competitions that inspire using STEM and creative disciplines to succeed. Building robots out of LEGO technologies for the younger kids and complicated hardware software components for the older kids. It is extremely close to real-world problem solving through engineering. What a way to build the leaders in the next generations!    
FIRST	257856		/users/profile/346325	Autumn45	Volunteer	5	09/16/2015	As a seventh grader my older brother joined the local first team and I went to competitions with my parents I was hooked. Then when I entered 9th grade the teacher coach told me I had to join so I did. Then I was on the team for four years. Also I was on an ftc team where I was their first female captain and mainly built the bot by myself. During my senior year I helped our town start up FLL teams. After high school I became a junior mentor. I also started a JR FLL team with a teacher that I met through FRC since her daughters went through the program also. Now I am a two year old teacher and a mentor for the ftc team. 
FIRST	257807		/users/profile/346276	NormanB	Advisor	5	09/16/2015	Going to regional competitions, once as an advisor and once as the parent of a middle schooler, I've been impressed with the enthusiasm of the student participants. The kids really get into the program. They want to do well, for themselves, for their teams and their schools. The kids and the mentors put in additional hours, even beyond their commitments, because they're excited by the challenge. The children show a level of engagement equal to what I've seen in school sports. They're learning how to work together and how to solve problems -- which is something students don't always get in classroom subjects. The commitment I've seen from mentors is equally impressive. As an advisor, I've heard amazing stories about how participation in FIRST has helped children, and has motivated them to major in STEM disciplines in college -- including some students who had never thought they could attend college. I'm very proud my son participated in the FIRST program!
FIRST	257611		/users/profile/245595	Eric55	Volunteer	4	09/15/2015	FIRST is one of the most influential forces shaping my life. As a high school student, a small spark of interest in engineering and technology was fanned  into a passion and a career by the intense fun and practical learning provided by FRC. As a professional engineer now mentoring multiple levels of FIRST programs, I see - on a daily basis - the impact a competitive environment and a supportive community of passionate volunteers can have on students from a vast multitude of backgrounds. This program gave me an amazing start and continues to do so year after year for thousands of bright young minds across the country and even the world. Dean Kamen's vision of changing the culture and elevating careers science and technology to a level of admiration only given to entertainers and athletes is a noble one. And the organization he founded has executed against that vision year after year, only growing bigger and louder with each season.
FIRST	257537	2	/users/profile/345976	Writer	Volunteer	2	09/15/2015	Too many of the top teams that students look up to only care about having an "perfect image" and don't actually care about the students, mentors or any other members of FIRST. These people alone have made my experience with FIRST absolutely horrible.
FIRST	257495		/users/profile/345929	robomom	Volunteer	5	09/15/2015	I know of no other organization that does supports education and kids in such a fun way as FIRST. I first got involved as a parent, and when I saw how much fun FRC is for the kids and the mentors, I knew I had to be involved. I am not a techie and wasn't sure how I could be a part, but found my niche in helping with fundraising and providing meals for the kids on long work days. As an employee for a grade school, I suggested (ok, I begged) to the principal that we add FLL as an elective for middle school. I was shocked when she asked me to teach the class! I found that even I, a non-techie mom could coach an FLL team- and I love it!My younger daughter has since stepped into the FIRST world as a scout on her FRC team and it has really become a family "thing."  I have watched as both of my daughters have gained confidence, experience, and a purpose that they would not have found anywhere else. FIRST has empowered them and given them am amazing "resume" for their high school years. I have heard it said many times that "there is no exit strategy for FIRST" and I'm sure I will still be a part of the team even after my girls both graduate.When I meet parents of new high school students, I always encourage them to have their kids try out FIRST. Many kids who would be lost in other programs and sports find their home there.
FIRST	257471		/users/profile/345902	siageah	Board Member	5	09/15/2015	When I began in first. I was in 5th grade. Seeing the programming and building in First Lego League was amazing. How can a 11 year old build a robot? A better question is, why don't people understand how amazing FIRST is! There is no other program where kids as young as 6 can start working with robots. I'm on 1 of 3 Girlscout FRC teams. I makes me so sad when I see the amount of girls interested in robotics. I would just like to tell all girls who are passionate about robotics to tell all other girls, if they want to be in robotics, do it!
FIRST	257453		/users/profile/345884	Writer	Client Served	5	09/15/2015	When I first joined the robotics team when I was a freshman, I didn't know what I was getting into.  Over the years of growing up with FIRST Robotics, I learned how to design, how to write, and how to communicate.  FIRST robotics touches every person who participates and it teaches them to lead the future.  Much of the recent progress happening in today's society can be traced back, in some way, to FIRST.  
FIRST	257252		/users/profile/345659	Writer	Client Served	5	09/14/2015	I've been in FIRST for six seasons now, entering my seventh (third FTC). FIRST has greatly influenced and improved my life, by teaching me a slew of skills, from engineering processes to coding to business aspects. As well, I have met a lot of great friends through it. FIRST is awesome!
FIRST	257219		/users/profile/345627	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	09/14/2015	I was a teammate from 2013-2015 for two seasons,and this influenced me a lot. It even solids my decision to study aboard to see more. Also I am going to become a mentor for FTC and FRC teams this year.
FIRST	257181		/users/profile/345592	LeadMentor	Volunteer	5	09/14/2015	I've been an adult volunteer for multiple years each in scouting, youth sports, and several STEM extracurriculars.  They all serve their communities well, but FIRST stands out for developing a combination of technical and non-technical skills together with positive, inclusive core values that prepares students for workplace and college success. The FIRST organization is well-managed at headquarters by pros who do an incredible job managing a huge staff of passionate volunteers.  Dollar for dollar, FIRST provides an incomparable return on investment with documented  results.
FIRST	187481		/users/profile/244496	Koko P.	Volunteer	5	11/01/2013	I have been involved with FIRST Robotics for 12 years.While I no longer FIRST will save the world from itself (our problems are too diverse and deep for any one size fits all solution) I do believe FIRST is one of the best tools to help you cope with the uncertain future facing our youth.The level of professionalism this program has is amazing. From the game production. to the distribution of kits   to teams to the amazing events. I think the polished production helps FIRST spread the word. It actually comes off as more legit than Battlebots which I felt was more of a disorganized exhibition that a competition. FIRST not only teaches kids skills that help with STEM activities but life skills as well. Accountability.Responsibility. Integrity. Creativity. Personal growth that will help these students (and often the adults as well) get further in life. I endorse FIRST to anyone who's ear I can mange to catch to tell them about this amazing program.
FIRST	187399		/users/profile/244412	Laura173	Volunteer	5	11/01/2013	I became involved with FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) in 2007 when my kids joined our local robotics teams (one in FRC - high school, and one in FLL - intermediate school).  This is a world-wide program that encourages students to learn about and become inspired by science, technology, engineering, and math through hands-on activities and competitions which are free and open to the public.  As an engineer myself I was drawn to help the team and mentor the students in areas from programming to writing award submission essays to working on their presentation skills in front of groups of adults as well as other students.  I cannot say enough about the positive skills that my kids learned from their experience on our Robotics teams.  They are now in college, one majoring in Computer Science & Engineering and the other majoring in Elementary Education with a collaborative second major in Math and Computer Science.  They learned to work as part of a team; they learned math and engineering skills.  They learned confidence; they learned respect.  They were both honored to be team captains in their senior year; they learned leadership.  FIRST is a life long experience that will be with them for the rest of their life.  As for me and my husband (yes, we got the whole family involved), we are still mentoring the team even 3 years after our kids have graduated from high school.  I too learn something new about engineering, or working with young people, or about myself every year.  Our kids also come back and work with the new members of their team when they are on break from college.  If you have an opportunity to become involved with a FIRST team, do not hesitate.  You will never regret it.  It is the hardest fun you will ever have... and the rewards far exceed the cost.
FIRST	172968		/users/profile/228994	4049	Advisor	5	10/03/2013	I became involved with FRC as an advisor three years ago.  At first, the program seemed daunting as there were no blueprints or designs other than a rule book to follow.  This was very frustrating to myself and the students that were involved.   With that being said, FRC has been the best program for both myself and my students to grow in learning how to reason, design for the challenge, utilize resources, collaborate with others, and in general compete with the resources we have at hand.  For us, it has brought together multiple groups of students together who would otherwise not cross each others paths.  Students who are mathematically and computer science gifted are natually drawn to this program, as are students who excell in fabrication and construction.  All talents are required and necessary to make this project successful.  
FIRST	172960		/users/profile/228987	chuck.trautwein	Advisor	5	10/03/2013	This upcoming season, our FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) team is celebrating ten years. We started in 2005with help from other FIRST teams and folks from NASA. We live in Garrett County - a very rural county in the State of Maryland, about an hour or so south of Pittsburgh. The impact of our team is beyond measure - affecting not only our students members but our County as a whole. All of our student members go on to college with at least 95% pursuing STEM careers - many receiving scholarships and entrance to their preferred school as a result of their FIRST experience in high school. In addition to affecting our student members, our team has grown to be the leader for community and school-based STEM education in Garrett County - sponsoring everything from summer tech camps for elementary school students to pumpkin chucking events in conjunction with local fall festivals. It's been wonderful for our team to have competed at the Pittsburgh Regional giving those who live in Garrett County and support our team a greater chance to travel to see  a FIRST (FRC) competition.
FIRST	172959		/users/profile/228984	pghlri	Volunteer	5	10/03/2013	I was introduced to FIRST through my son. Coming from a background of electromechanical industrial controls, I naturally took to the organization. The students and mentors involved are the best people to inspire young minds of today. The FIRST organization provides a venue for the team and personnel talents. The yearly challenge and strict rules allows the wildest designs  to come to life and solve very difficult problem. Everyone, no mater the skill level can have a huge part of a team. The best part of FIRST is that an entire school can be a part of the project. No matter the interest every student can play a role in a FIRST team. The draw for me as a volunteer is the total package. But helping students explore science and problem solving techniques has been very rewarding and always leaves me cheering on the teams.
FIRST	172930		/users/profile/228939	joelman111	Volunteer	5	10/02/2013	FIRST is a program that gets high school students more educated in robotics and engineering. It is much better than a normal classroom setting, where you follow a set of instructions to complete your robot and learn the VERY basics of programming. FIRST is definately trial and error based, where students are encouraged to think outside the box or normality, and come of with great ideas. One of the best parts about FIRST is how the games are as fun and exciting as a tradtional sporting event; even the atmosphere is similar to going to baseball/football game. I have been involved in FIRST for only two years, and I have already gotten these messages I am explaining and many more. If it were not for FIRST I would certainly not be as knowledgible in robotics, and not considering going to college at CMU or MIT, definately one of the most prestieged science/technology colleges in the world. I would personally like to thank FIRST for intoducing me into a new field I may not have been interested in otherwise.
FIRST	172926		/users/profile/228930	S. P.	Volunteer	5	10/02/2013	FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) is an organization that gets kids excited about engineering, science, and technology.  Excited doesn't really quite cover it.  Students participating in FIRST events are more enthusiastic about conquering engineering challenges than any Pittsburgh sport fan.  Every time I go to the competitions I am amazed by the excitement and energy of these kids.  I am a mentor with a FIRST Robotics team at a local high school.  (There are other FIRST organizations for junior high and elementary school ages, too.)  Each year FIRST Robotics introduces a new engineering design challenges in the form of a game.  All the teams have six weeks to build a robot to play this game.  At the end of the six weeks we ship the robot and don't see it again until competition.  I work as an engineer and having a deliverable in only six weeks is an amazing feat.   One of the things that impresses me most about FIRST is the concept of gracious professionalism.  The teams are very focused on winning the game, but they are even more tightly focused on helping everyone have a good competition.  It is not uncommon for a team to show up at competition missing a key component (such as a working program for their robot) and by the end of the day other teams will have helped them get the machine up and running.  The culture of gracious professionalism is, I think, my favorite thing about FIRST.  We are helping train young people to go in to the world and be fierce, focused, competitive, but NOT jerks!

It has taught me more about electrical systems 3d modeling, and mechanical designs along with the importance of gracious professionalism and teamwork. FIRST has given me the opprotunity to explore the world of engineering in a way i had never thought of before
FIRST	172873		/users/profile/228871	Michaeleen G M.	Volunteer	5	10/02/2013	I have worked with FIRST as a volunteer at a regional competition and I am in my second year as a mentor to a high school that has both FTC and FRC teams.  FIRST is a great way to address the STEM needs in our schools.  The kids on these teams are the best.  One of the most important things they learn from FIRST is gracious professionalism.  Former FIRST graduates in our school have gone on to study various types of engineering, computer software, even biomedical engineering.  The regional competitions are a lot of fun for the kids.  I really enjoy working with these young people.   
FIRST	172857		/users/profile/228851	dcrum	Advisor	5	10/02/2013	We began our invlovement with FIRST last year. Our students were very excited about the prospects of building a robot, even though, we had no idea what to expect. Fortunately, we had three veteren teams in our area that pitched in to help us get started and before we knew it, the build season was upon us. It was the longest/shortest 6 weeks of my life! Long hours, everyday, but the weeks flew by as we prepared for the Pittsburgh Regional. As the day finaly arrived, our students were excited beyod containment. The event organizers in Pittsburgh prepared for and ran a flawless competition and our student's were fortunate enough to win the Outstanding Rookie Award as well as qualifying as the top seeded rookie team. What an experience for our student's! Many of them were able to solidify their career choices as engineers and computer programmers after the experience provided by FIRST and the organizers in Pittsburgh. My thanks to all involved in making this experience a great one for all of my students and the great number of students from all of the other schools represented. I can't wait to go again this coming year. Our students are getting excited as they begin making preparatiions for another build season.
FIRST	172816		/users/profile/228811	b0bb0	Volunteer	5	10/02/2013	I have been working with a FISRT team for 10 years.  We get young 9th graders who know very little about robotics, design, building, tools, etc.  When they graduate as 12th graders, they have a huge head start on their college peers. I have had seen several students win full 4-year scholarships to college based upon their FIRST experience.  There are dozens of colleges offering FIRST scholarship. FIRST changes lives!  These children are our technological future. To learn more, visit their website at FIRST dot org.  Also, do a youtube search and see some fantastic videos.

I became a head FRC coach in 2010 and started an FTC team in 2011.  The impact FIRST has had on our students is immeasurable.  I have watched the kids grow from wide-eyed freshmen to true leaders and professionals.  Time spent with FIRST is very well spent, and I plan to continue serving FIRST as long as I can.  Personally, I have changed since starting with FIRST.  I find myself regularly doing community service now, and I like it!  FIRST is an amazing experience for the students, coaches, mentors, and sponsors!
FIRST	172791		/users/profile/228781	innovators	Board Member	5	10/02/2013	My husband and I became involved with FIRST in 2009 when our son was looking on the web for academic challenge.  The experience has been irreplaceable ! Now we are  running a nonprofit for several FIRST robotics teams and mentoring. FIRST builds successful, confident, and bright students for our future workforce. The students become better problem solvers, team players, and learn a variety of skills. This skills include machining, programming, electrical, CAD, pneumatics, designing, and following a timeline.  Because of the success of the students that have been through our FIRST program, we continue our mission even though our son is in college. Seventeen students have graduated with FIRST skills from our team and received $799,000.00 in college scholarships. THAT IS SUCCESS! All of them credit FIRST for their choices that have made. It doesn't end there, once graduated, they continue by finding other teams and programs so they can continue to mentor. It is a wonderful cycle that encourages giving back to your community.  I know from experience, once you get involved you get hooked on FIRST.
FIRST	172786	1	/users/profile/228774	Angelo Z.	Volunteer	5	10/02/2013	A family friend had mentioned that there was this FIRST group built around STIMs, (I did not know what the meant), but I knew that it was robotics and my one boy was very interested.  So, I supported it and then became immersed in this amazing culture.  We had worked together in another creative thinking team competition and that really creates an environment for the kids to come up with ideas, learn how to articulate their ideas so the team can understand their ideas and then bring it to life in the CAD program, and then physically.  I am in my second year of mentoring.  My other son has joined a team in his age group and I was am still blown away by the things the kids create and the "Gracious Professionalism" demonstrated by them and everyone in this program.  I am still overwhelmed that a little over two years ago, I had no idea it even existed.  
FIRST	172782		/users/profile/228772	dr.frank.tate	Volunteer	5	10/02/2013	I decided to donate to FIRST after interacting with some of the kids at the local farmer's market. They were all very knowledgeable about the robot, how it was built, and the plans for the team. The local team (MARS) invited me to their weekly practice, and I've been hooked as a mentor ever since. The program really gives these wonderful kids a great outlet for their intelligence and creativity, and I enjoy the opportunity to assist them. I was in different gifted/magnet programs and schools as a child, but this is so much more advanced than any of the programs I was ever exposed to. I see FIRST doing a great job, and I'm happy to devote my time to it, even though I don't have any kids.
FIRST	172765	1	/users/profile/228745	Lynch279	Volunteer	5	10/02/2013	My husband and I became involved in the FIRST organization 6 yrs ago when my son joined his school robotics team as a Freshman.  One of the most impressive things we have witnessed is how these kids do not hesitate to help other teams during competitions. They compete against each other yet they are there without hesitation when one team is having trouble and needs assistance. They cheer for one another and pick each other up when they are down. Thanks to FIRST my son learned what real team work means and learned how to be a leader. These are life lessons and skills that will help take him through his personal life and his career. He is now in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Cincinnati and landed a co-op position at an engineering firm thanks to the skills he learned while being a member of FIRST ROBOTICS Team 279. 
FIRST	172744		/users/profile/228721	TitanMember312	General Member of the Public	5	10/01/2013	I am entering my second year in the FIRST Robotics.   This started with me and some friends deciding to start a team. As one thing led to another, we went from three members to a little under twenty team members trying to solve the problem using only the tools we owned and the kit of parts provided. We had a large amount of help from many teams as well as the FIRST workers themselves.  In the end we won the rookie inspiration award and almost every team member is back this year with more first year kids with us.   It has helped us with our education by teaching us teamwork, responsibility, and helping your fellow teams in their time of need.  This is a life changing program that I am ecstatic to be a part of.  
FIRST	172738		/users/profile/228714	Lisa280	Volunteer	5	10/01/2013	i joined FIRST as a parent of an enthuiastic High School Freshman.  It wasn't long before I, as an engineer, realized the amazing opportinities that FIRST provides.  You cannot get closer to a real life engineering experience, not even on many internships and college coops.  The program also goes way beyond engineering and provides opportinities in marketing, programming, graphics and automation design, and many more.  This is now my third year on what was a rookie team.  My younger son has joined and my husband provides IT consulting services.  There is another aspect I must mention.  Unlike many competitive activities, FIRST encourages Graceful Professionalism.  Teams are encouraged to teach and assist other teams.  Even though the competition is fierce, everyone is helpful and everyone that succeeds in even getting to competition can be proud of their accomplishments.  We had a graduating Senior with 2 years of FIRST experience and one year of LabView get selected as a Freshman at Carnegie Mellon to work with Graduate Students on a Lunar Robotic Rover project.
FIRST	172737		/users/profile/228713	John187	Volunteer	5	10/01/2013	This is my fifth year as a FIRST Mentor and coach.  I am also an educator.  There is nothing else like FIRST in the schools.  Why is FIRST important?  I could tell you all about the need for STEM education or the need for programmers or the way that FIRST gets kids passionate about STEM but that would only make it a good program.  What makes FIRST great is the ability to provide kids that would not be successful in other extra curricular areas the chance to really shine.  My heart melts every time I see one of my robo kids cheered on by others in the school because of what they have done and are able to do.  Robotics provides a connection to the school for kids that might not be connected.

My role on the team was created because our school started a new team and my son was part of this.  However, this is now my second year without my son being on the team.  He graduated high school and is at a university that is #3 for Mechanical Engineering in the US.  I keep coming back because the program enables students with many different skills and abilities to work on a STEM related project as a team and succeed.  I have students on the team that have autism, ADHD, learning disabilities, the highest GPA's and the lowest GPA's, those who will not continue their education beyond high school and those who will create the next biggest thing, all working together.  What program can incorporate all of that and still turn out a team of winners?  It is FIRST Robotics.  I am not an engineer or technical person.  I am a nurse by trade. The Pittsburgh Regional Director and its program provides guidance and assistance to our team so that we can succeed! 
FIRST	172728		/users/profile/228704	Earl S.	Volunteer	5	10/01/2013	I've been involved with FIRST as a judge, a coach, and a parent for over ten years now. In my opinion, THE most important thing that comes from a student's participation in FIRST is their evolution into a young person who understands and values those life skills that will lead to their personal success. I spend way too much of my personal time working with FIRST students and I wish I could spend more. I'm a professional educator and working with the students restores my faith in the next generation every year.  The programs are a great combination of sport and creativity and additional mentors and coaches are always needed. That such an amazing program runs through the efforts of thousands of volunteers is just one example how valued these programs are by so many people.

FIRST	172684	2	/users/profile/228659	JOgburn	Client Served	5	10/01/2013	Last year we started a FIRST Robotics Team with 7 high school students who just wanted to explore the field of competitive robotics. We had NO idea what we were getting into! After having been through the process of setting up a team, identifying mentors with experience in CAD design, Programming, Electrical Wiring and Mechanical Building, and taking those students through a six week build cycle to complete their first Regional Competition, I can say this is THE best engineering experience hands down. Over the course of the year we recruited 7 more students, raised money to fund our robotic team and got to work closely with industry professionals. Our team members learned what it's like to solve a real engineering problem with real time constraints and real resource limitations. No one is going to do it for you. Your team and the team dynamics are what you make of it. Your fundraising and team marketing is what you make of it. Your robot and your technical skills are as effective as the planning and training and effort that you put into it. It is a great model for the real working world. If you as a student want to be an engineer, this is the opportunity of a lifetime to gets hands-on experience working in a team environment on an engineering challenge that's too big for you to solve.

FIRST	172680		/users/profile/228655	Suzanne45	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/01/2013	The FIRST Robotics program has given 4-H members a wonderful opportunity:   to work together with youth from various schools, mentor youth, learn from experts in the engineering field, time management skills, decision making skills and creative development.  Youth who have been involved learned a great deal from the adult mentors and industry experts who offered to help.  In the community, publicity from the project created a greater awareness of opportunities in the science field and robotics in our town.  As a springboard, a summer robotics camp was launched to help provide a feeder system for the high school program.  All aspects of the project have been positive.  The most difficult part is the funding area which is very competitive in a small community.  Thank you.

They believe that this is all about the winning.  But it is about teamwork and becoming excited about science, technology, engineering and yes math too.  We see young people, who say they hate these subjects; apply these skills to make the bot better.  In the meantime they are developing skills for the future.  Its making kids enjoy learning, interactively.  As said by Bill Cosby, enjoy but be careful you just might learn something. And they do!! More than we can ever imagine. 
FIRST	148418	2	/users/profile/196624	Marcus3	Volunteer	5	01/23/2013	My son and I started our local FIRST LEGO League team after researching many options for character building programs for youth. We landed on FLL because it combined my desire for character building (through its impressive core values) with his desire for something practical and fun. Our first year has been one of the most exciting, challenging, rewarding, and insane things I have ever done. I have never seen kids so dedicated to a program that has such practical implications for their future. These kids are learning the basics of robotics, team building, project management, work flow, and visual programming. They are also learning to dream big while still laying out the necessary steps to accomplishing that dream. As a result of our efforts this year, the local school district is already planning and budgeting to support additional teams next year. We have a five year goal of expanding FIRST in our community to include FLL, FTC, and FRC. On average, I volunteer 6 hours each week for FIRST. Four of those hours are hands on work with students. Two of those hours involve research and preparation using resources from FIRST and LEGO.
FIRST	125155		/users/profile/170301	STEM	Professional with expertise in this field	1	10/11/2012	FIRST LEGO League is the worst Non-profit organization that I have ever dealt with.  They are rude to their volunteers and claim that the Partners in the state will provide training, medallions, etc.  They provide nothing to the volunteers, teams or children.    The staff in New Hampshire are incompetent and disorganized.  When complaints are made against a partner they do nothing at all.  I would not recommend this program to any school or community.  It is expensive and does not even come close to meeting all that they claim in their marketing.  Save your money and use EARLY robotics or Vex or anything else. 
FIRST	97203	2	/users/profile/113857	ebjork	Donor	5	09/06/2011	FIRST is an amazing program that gets high school students to bring together and share their creativity, enthusiasm, hard work, dedication, and incredible smarts to build a robot which competes with other schools around the world. In order to be successful, FIRST team's need several different types of skill sets from the students, ranging from math and engineering skills to build the robots, to business and marketing skills to fundraise and get free parts from companies.  One of the best things about FIRST is they don't hold tryouts to be on the team like most high school sports. If you want to be involved and show initiative, then you're on the team! FIRST is one of the best high school programs around that prepares young minds for life after high school. FIRST is paving the way for the next generation of professionals which will one day run this country.
FIRST	96629	2	/users/profile/51537	sue-glass	Volunteer	5	08/26/2011	FIRST Robotics Program is involves all 50 states, plus many countries. Its purpose is twofold: 1Help students to develop 21st century skills that all employers are looking for such as: gracious professionalism (teamwork, leadership, problem solving, learning to work with other people, project management, meeting deadlines, working within a budget, etc.) 2Get students interested in various careers including those that involve science, technology, engineering and math (STEM). They also provide opportunities for students interested in programming, web design, photography, public relations, marketing, creating business plans, team spirit and more.  FIRST creates a school-to-career pipeline through which young people are inspired to explore opportunities in science and technology. By successfully forming coalitions with corporations, universities, and public schools, FIRST has become the premiere after-school engineering and robotics competition program in the nation.  The FIRST Robotics Competition began in 1992 with 28 teams in a New Hampshire high school gym. The FIRST LEGO League program was introduced in 1998, followed by both the FIRST Tech Challenge and the Junior FIRST LEGO League in 2007. Today, with the support of thousands of dedicated volunteers, the organization serves 196,000 students not only in asll 50 states, but also in 9 provinces and 38 countries. Another of the key benefits of the FIRST programs that I have observed, is the proper behaviors it nurtures.  Gracious professionalism and cooperation are FIRSTs core values, encouraging participants in all FIRST programs to do their best work. It is not about winning or losing, but working together to achieve a common goal. FIRST programs embrace and encourage students of varying interests, abilities, and academic competencies and foster participation by all youth, regardless of income, gender, ethnicity, or background. This is a fantastic after school program for all youth--K-12-- to engage in.
FIRST	50997	3	/users/profile/51537	sue-glass	General Member of the Public	5	08/25/2010	Two years ago I was introduced to a world I never knew existed--the world of FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology).  I was invited to a high-school off-season robotics competition and saw unbridled enthusiasm among the students for learning about and creating robots, employing the disciplines of STEM.  I have since observed another key attribute of FIRST:  Gracious Professionalism.  I see that FIRST is not only fostering a love of STEM, but is also instilling  a real sense of citizenship in its participants by encouraging community service, teamwork, sportsmanship, respect for elders and authority, and mentoring of younger students.  I have also witnessed how the program has transformed previously undirected youth into focused students with a thirst for obtaining higher education whether in STEM subjects or in Liberal Arts.  I do not know of a better after-school program for today's youth and wish I had known about it for my own kids.  I am a convert and will be a lifelong volunteer for this organization.
FIRST	89250	1	/users/profile/101176	Bambi C.	Donor	1	05/25/2011	you state that the president gets a 229,000 annual salary on this site. And people are ginving it 5 stars? Wow! this blows my mind! Why would you want to donate to give the president a 229k annual salary? I will not give it 5 stars, nor 5.00. People really need to looks at the profit statements, for the salary's  before donating to their favorite charity's. You may think twice. there are a lot of them out there that do not make these enormous salaries!
FIRST	51541	1	/users/profile/52256	nottonfirst	Volunteer	5	09/02/2010	For over 15 years, I've been involved with numerous activities/programs to encourage engineering at the pre-college level.  This program does more to further that cause than any other program. However, it is much broader than that. It provides many kids who follow other paths with a good start in practical technology (in the broad sense of the term), math, science, and, of course, engineering. Many kids have learned they have abilities they were never aware of. It should be in every school.
FIRST	51361	4	/users/profile/51991	robot-mom	Volunteer	5	08/31/2010	FIRST is an amazing organization and was just what my son was looking for in an extracurricular activity.  My son has always loved science and was looking for more than school offered.  We became involved with FIRST robotics when my son was in 4th grade.  I became a mentor and worked with some great mentors to help the team find their passion in robotics and science.  The students on the team learned to work as a team, to brainstorm and research a problem, build and program a robot, and present their research and solution to a problem in a creative way.  I saw all of the students blossom.  Their self esteem, organization, perserverance, and sense of community with others interested in science grew through the process of friendly competition through FIRST.
FIRST	51334	1	/users/profile/51956	jillg	Volunteer	5	08/30/2010	FIRST offers students a view into the world of science and technology that they may not get in their regular school curriculum. It also emphasizes teamwork, problem-solving, and responsibility. It's amazing to see how the students get so excited and involved in the program.
FIRST	51307	6	/users/profile/51924	kent1	Volunteer	5	08/30/2010	FIRST is true to its name -- providing inspiration as well as an exposure to science and technology.  Working with engineers and scientists, students learn much more than valuable technical skills.  FIRST exposes the student with excitement of discovery, emphasizes team work, and asks every student and every mentor to exercise gracious professionalism.  I have seen students grow in confidence and maturity -- looking ahead to careers that contribute to community and country.
FIRST	51276	7	/users/profile/51885	mrsw	Volunteer	5	08/30/2010	FIRST offers an incredible opportunity for students of all ages to discover their "hidden" talents in the areas of science and technology. I started two years ago with a small high school team who built what they called their "Ghetto-Bot" and competed in our local regional. This robot was built with chicken-wire, "Duct" tape and plywood, hence the name. Last year I coached, or co-coached a total of four teams, one at each grade level. The excitement and enthusiasm of my students (ages 8 through 17) was awe-inspiring! Some of these kids would have said they didn't know anything about science, or robots, or engineering yet, they managed to design, construct, program and operate a variety of robots. My original team (FRC)constructed a robot that truly looked "space-age" with seperate enclosed compartments for both the electronics and the pnuematics. They even contrived pnuematic shocks for the electronics box! My second high school team (FTC)went all to way to the World Championships after winning our local regional and an "Inovation in Design" award from a major aerospace company! This year we will have two of these teams competing as part of the new Robotics course I am teaching at our high school.My elementary teams are "chomping at the bit" to get started on this year's challenge!I cannot say enough about the level of empowerment this program is offering my students. They are so excited about participating in the program and having their ideas taken seriously that it boggles the mind!Yeah, F.I.R.S.T.!
FIRST	51274	7	/users/profile/51882	kgoudey	Client Served	5	08/30/2010	As a university admissions official, I have been working with FIRST to provide scholarship opportunities to high school seniors involved in FIRST for the past four years. I am continually impressed by the caliber of the students involved in FIRST, as well as the ways in which FIRST encourages students of all grade levels to enjoy the creativity, teamwork and problem solving involved in meeting each year's robotics challenge. The relationships that students build with their mentors, and the team spirit that FIRST fosters through it's emphasis on gracious professionalism are quite remarkable! These students are generally highly motivated and well prepared for the challenges that wait for them in their university studies, as well as their life after FIRST. The fact that so many student participants become mentors as adults is a testament to the success of the program.
FIRST	51198	4	/users/profile/51762	gvigil	Donor	5	08/27/2010	As my company has been involved with FIRST for the past 5 years, we decided to increase our impact and offer scholarships to select participants of the 2010 competition.  The FIRST organization attracts such a high caliber of students that it made our selection process a difficult, but enjoyable one. We were able to directly affect the students in a way that our company never has before.  FIRST is a well oiled machine that helps companies positively impact students across the nation and world and encourage those students into the fields of science and engineering.
FIRST	51131	1	/users/profile/51717	andrew14	Client Served	5	08/27/2010	I started as a high school student in FIRST learning from Engineering mentors about concepts that were not touched in school.  The experience helped me shape my motivations for an engineering degree and specifically a focus on Robotics. Now I spend my free time mentoring and teaching high school students in FIRST.  The passion and dedication of volunteers in the organization keeps my excitement high every year I've been involved.
FIRST	51125	5	/users/profile/51715	cecineumann	Volunteer	5	08/27/2010	I got involved with FIRST because I was intrigued by the Founders notion that the education "problem" in the United States was a DEMAND problem as distingquished from a SUPPLY problem.   "Kids don't stay in school because they can't get their hands on a good book".  They don't stay in school and study because they don't understand why it is so important to their futures -- and so don't WANT to be in school.   And rather than look to the government or to schools to generate demand, why not look to partner with BUSINESSES. Businesses have successfully generated demand for their products for generations, and so they are uniquely qualified to help generate demand to learn -- paaticularly to learn about things that businessess understand will impact the quality of life for all people on our planet.Armed with this theory, I convinced my company to sponsor a team in Detroit, Michigan.  The school would not let me meet with large groups of students as they were afraid of a riot.   So, I went classroom to classrom, convincing kids that they wanted to join the new FIRST team.  I promised fun and good PR.   The kids flat out told me no one would come see the robot they were supposed to build.  They told me they were interested in jobs.  So, to motivate them to join the team, we promised two team leaders summer internships.  And we promised we would pay for  the team of kids who actively participated to go to the finals at Disney.   Thirty-six kids came EVERY meeting to design and build the robot, design team T-Shirts, organize fundraisers and document their experience.   These same kids on their own got dressed up and made formal presentations to the comapany president.   The team changed the kids -- gave them an insight into what they could do with themselves if they worked hard, stayed in school and took some math and science classes.   It changed the employees who developed a new appreciation for themselves (they were heroes to the kids) and for one another.  And this transformation took place in about eight weeks as the team of adults and students came together to solve a problem without enough resources, and without enough time.   And they produced a great, attractive robot and won Rookie of the Year!   A demand to learn was born, as was a new respect for scientists, engineers and mathematicians.
FIRST	51099	5	/users/profile/51686	nhunley	Volunteer	5	08/26/2010	This is one great organizational structure with vision--and a lot of "fun" work opportunities.                        No other group for which I have volunteered has provided such an intensive feeling of accomplishment. My involvement has allowed me to be involved one-on-one with students to motivate and be motivated.Working with the other judges, I have been involved in some intense discussions of which team should get a particular award. In the back-and-forth evaluations of performance against criteria, I am amazed each year that we can actually come to a consensus, always with an overriding concern for the students on a team at the forefront of our deliberations.
FIRST	51073	5	/users/profile/51656	relap	Volunteer	5	08/26/2010	As a chemical engineer, I have always looked for ways to encourage more of our children to study math and science.  The challenge comes with fighting the stereotype that those subjects are hard and boring.  When I started volunteering at FIRST events over 12 years ago, I knew I had found an organization that not only challenged those sterotypes, but busted them to pieces!FIRST is the only organization I've found that inspires kids to push the envelope in math & science while simultaneously linking those concepts to solving fun, real world engineering problems.  The FIRST experience brings kids from vastly different backgrounds and skill sets together, giving them a common goal - "Building a machine to effectively play our game".  Coming together into one cohesive team are the "jocks", the "mechanics", the "programming geeks", the "fundraisers", the "cheerleaders" and the "business folks" - kids that normally wouldn't socialize together, but all necessary parts of a succesful FIRST team.FIRST relies heavily on volunteers who, after attending an event, inevitably want to assist in the non-profit's mission.  They get hooked!  Engineers and scientists from many well-known companies like GM, ExxonMobil, Lucent, and AT&T as well as federal agencies such as NASA, the US Army and the NSA, have volunteered as team mentors.  Mentorship is a critical component allowing kids to see their potential and put their academic knowledge into practice.  Mentors provide vision, inspiration, encouragement, technical know-how and love, all the key ingredients a child needs to grow strong.  FIRST gets kids excited and  wanting to learn more! One measure of FIRST's success is the number of team alumni that return after graduation to become team mentors or sponsors.  Numerous teams have a well-defined lineage, anxious to show off their "family trees".  Many times team alumni end up sponsoring new teams to promote FIRST's growth.  Unlike many organizations that try to force growth, FIRST growth is organic - happening because it is such a posiive experience.  People of all ages can't get enough and are anxious to stay engaged.Core to the FIRST mission is a concept called "Gracious Professionalism".  So, while there is friendly competition at a FIRST event, you also see an incredible amount of teams helping other teams to succeed.  I've witnessed one team help another to completely rebuild a robot that had fallen apart, only to be beaten by them later in the day.  Why would they do that?  The answer is simple ... FIRST structures events to be a "Co-opertition".  The team you're playing against today is a team you may be partnered with tomorrow.  It is always in each team's best interest to make sure they have healthy competitors because they don't know who they'll be partnered up with at any given moment!Finally, FIRST heavily promotes community outreach.  Teams are encouraged to spread the word of math and science to their communities.  Ive seen teams give demonstrations of their robot creations at shopping malls, State Fairs and even the White House!  FIRST teams have managed to get coverage in newspapers, on television and in magazines.  One Canadian team appeared in three episodes of the popular television show "Degrassi Junior High" touting the benefits of math & science using their robots.  I've also seen teams target at risk children, using robotics to get them interested in school again and showing them their potential.  The success is found in the numbers - over 88% of the kids involved in FIRST go on to college.  To an inner city school, FIRST is an invaluable program to keep kids interested in continuing their education.One final, amazing point ... well over 95% of all the FIRST activities throughout the world are planned, organized and executed by volunteers.  This allows money that is raised to go to where it is needed most.  It's also a strong indication of how effective the FIRST program is.  Sometimes FIRST can be "organized chaos", but with the focus remaining on the kids, it always manages to be a great success.I will continue volunteering for FIRST because I truly believe it's the education model we need for a successful future.
FIRST	51070	4	/users/profile/51652	jmercier	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/26/2010	For the past three years I have attended various FIRST Robotic Events both at the regional and national competitions, as Johnson & Wales University is a scholarship provider. From the organizers down to the students, I have been impressed with the different events FIRST puts on. Engineers are needed badly in the workforce and FIRST has provided an opportunity at such a young age for students to work on big projects. These projects have helped develop the technology skills that lay a great foundation for their future careers in technology. We look forward to working with FIRST for many years to come.
FIRST	51030	3	/users/profile/51589	michele18	Volunteer	5	08/25/2010	FIRST, with all of its competitions (FIRST Robotics, Lego League, etc) provides an opportunity for students in elementary, middle, and high school to become and remain excited about science, math, and engineering.  Students in middle and high school often start to question why they are studying math and science -- the FIRST competitions, along with the mentor relationships that are developed, allow students to apply math and science in a fun way, which keeps them interested.  As important as the math and science that students learn are the teamwork, problem-solving, and communication skills that FIRST emphasizes.  These skills will prepare students for a lifetime of achievement, irrespective of the field that they choose to study and pursue.
FIRST	51024	3	/users/profile/51578	maccy	Volunteer	5	08/25/2010	FIRST Robotics is an amazing organization that empowers students and encourages them to be the next generation of innovators. It teaches them to have realistic role models and expectations of their futures. It encourages them to excel at all they do and fosters a love of learning. Not only all that, but it is fun, too! I have been involved with this organization for 7 years and have watched the students learn and grow. My own children have become better people as a result of their involvemnet.
FIRST	51023	3	/users/profile/51577	roneyc	Client Served	5	08/25/2010	Hi, my name is Catherine Roney, i'm from Michigan, and I am a freshman at the University of South Carolina. I'm new to the University and so excited to get started with a whole new chapter of my life. The reason I am writing this review though is not about me, it is about FIRST. I'm sure there is much information available from multiple sources about this organization, and I encourage you to look at some of their accomplishments, they are highly impressive. The reason for my review though is to let you know about the FIRST program, which I have tried to portray through my own personal experiences, and hopefully persuade you to choose FIRST as one of the top ten science and tech nonprofits. Alright, here goes.I was a previous FIRSTer. In case you don't know what that means, I was part of a robotics team my senior year of high school that competed in the FIRST competition. FIRST stands For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology, it's a mouthful, isn't it? I don't know if you have ever been to a FIRST competition before, and if you have been, I hope you know what I mean when I say it is an experience you'll never forget. I have to say, the energy present at any FIRST competition is invigorating. Those who go, get excited, and they might not even know what they are excited about in some cases. They will see teams work together to do their best in each match, and all the while have fun. Yet, even though the energy level is fun and upbeat, there is still an air of comfort present. What do I mean by this? Well, I have personally experienced and witnessed changes in people when they get involved with FIRST. FIRST is not only a place for people to learn about science and technology and how to build robots, it is a place to learn about oneself. People who normally would be reserved and keep to themselves, open up, make friends, and figure out what they want to do in life. This may all sound cliche but I could not be more sincere and honest with my words. The atmosphere surrounding all that FIRST is involved in is a fantastic learning environment not only for engineer majors, but multiple other majors as well. In fact, I was in charge of all other aspects needed to be done for FIRST to be a team when I was involved with FIRST. Submissions for FIRST awards require literacy and eloquence in writing, getting to know the community and the community to know the team is essential for a team's survival, and even business plans are made. Thus, anyone could join and benefit from being a part of FIRST.There is so much more to FIRST and how influential and important it is to those involved. I do hope you will take what I have said into consideration when deciding upon the top ten science and tech nonprofits. I wish you all the best and thank you so much for your time.
FIRST	51015	3	/users/profile/51560	jadave	Volunteer	5	08/25/2010	I've been a FIRST volunteer for 8 years. The robots, competitions, and all the excitement are fantastic yet what makes FIRST stand out for me, and why I continue to volunteer is the impact it has on students.  Every year, I am amazed and impressed to see the creativity students use to solve the challenge. Without the boundary of being told that something is too hard or that something is impossible, the students accomplishments are amazing.  Beyond the creativity, what I find most special about FIRST is how it builds self confidence and instills a sense of gracious professionalism in students.  It's rare these days to see an organization that fosters hard competition AND at the same time maintains the perspective that HOW you win or lose is also important.  Students need to learn how to win and how to lose.  FIRST does a great job of giving students the opportunity to learn these lessons.
FIRST	50988	2	/users/profile/51529	bernice1	Volunteer	5	08/24/2010	FIRST is an amazing organization.  The premise is to encourage young folks to pursue fields in science and technology.  FIRST initially started as the FIRST Robotics Competition (FTC).  Then they believed that children needed to get excited about technology prior to high school, so they teamed up with LEGO and had the FIRST LEGO League (FLL) for middle schoolers (9-14 years old).  Now it has expanded to Junior FIRST LEGO League (6-9 year olds) and FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) an alternative to FRC for high school-aged students.  FIRST focuses on "Gracious Professionalism."  In practice, what this means is that team members will work with other teams to assist them.  That includes sharing robotics parts, helping them program the robot, and even borrowing a robot when one was dropped during a competition event.  Gracious Professionalism is a wonderful concept to instill in young people.
FIRST	50986	2	/users/profile/51528	muscholarships4	Donor	5	08/24/2010	As Scholarship Coordinator for the College of Engineering at the University of Missouri, I have attended regional competitions to promote the University-sponsored FIRST scholarships.  I have been impressed with the quality of these competitions and the enthusiasm for learning it has promoted in the student participants.  FIRST helps students become well-rounded individuals with a focus on developing their technological skills.
FIRST	50968	2	/users/profile/51502	jherring	Volunteer	5	08/24/2010	I became aware of FIRST Robotics during a competition that was held at the Kennedy Space Center.  At that time I was a member of the Astronaut Corps and was invited to the competition by another astronaut, Dave Brown.  I was amazed at the quality of the robots and the level of competition.  Since that time I have become involved both from a planning perspective as well as a judge and a judge advisor for the Oklahoma Regional, the Dallas Regional and the National Competition in Atlanta.  FIRST provides students with a way to increase their knowledge of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by working alongside highly talented volunteer engineers and scientists.  They work in a real world environment with limited budgets and strict time-lines to produce high quality and technically proficient robots.  They take their finished product and compete at regional and national competitions against equally talented and competitive robots.  FIRST teaches these students about the value of learning by doing and competing with others in a professional and gracious manner.  The skill sets they learn through FIRST are incredibly valuable to their lifelong learning and professional development.  I highly recommend that communities work to make FIRST a part of their educational goals for all students in their regions.
FIRST	50965	3	/users/profile/51497	prof-waterman	Volunteer	5	08/24/2010	I was asked in 2002 to attend a local FIRST robotics competition as a judge.  The experience was fantastic and I knew from the start that FIRST was and still is the best organization to help excite kids to embrace science and math as a carreer of choice.  FIRST has a wide range of carreer orientaed taasks for high school kids of all interests to become involved.  Yes, the comptition of robots is a common goal of the teams but this is only on the surface.  Once you dig deeper into the goal of each team, you will find the computer nerds to handle software issues, the mechanics to handle the machine functions, the business students to organize funding, yearly events, end etc.  Junior lego competitions engage 6 - 9 year olds, LEGO competitions are for 9 year olds to 8th grade, and FIRST tech challenge and/or FIRST Robotics Competions are for High School age students.  Many corporations sponsor FIRST competitions and teams within their community.  Without corporate spoonsors, the students would not be able to compete (or learn) at a global level to be prepared for industry after high school.  FIRST is the only organization that truely prepares participants for the challenges after high school by partnering the kids with scientist, engineers, and other professionals to complete and compete in a challenge that changes yearly, exposing the kids to new technology along the way.All high schools should allocate money to support a local team to have the opportunity to compete in this World Class organization.
FIRST	50964	3	/users/profile/51495	dennis12	Volunteer	5	08/24/2010	I am the Principal Investigator for the TIME Center (Technology and Innovation in Manufacturing and Engineering), a Regional Center of Excellence funded by the National Science Foundations Advanced Technological Education Program. We have worked closely with our statewide community college partners, regional FIRST partners and various stakeholder groups to support FIRST robotics as a very effective means of engaging students in problem-based learning activities that spur their innovative thinking and creative problem-solving. It has also proven to be an equally effective means of encouraging students to enter and persist in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) education programs and careers. The rebuilding and repair of the STEM pipeline is critical to the continuing success of the United States in maintaining and enhancing its position in the global manufacturing and engineering marketplace, and the FIRST program has proven its value in contributing to that task. On a personal level, I have been truly impressed with the excitement, energy and enthusiasm of the students who participate in FIRST Robotics, and the impact that their participation has on their perception of themselves and the work world they will eventually manage. I am just as impressed with the commitment of the numerous volunteers, teachers, mentors, family members and corporate partners to the very important goals of the FIRST Robotics program, and the enthusiasm with which they demonstrate that commitment. Recent research we conducted also shows that the FIRST Robotics program is attracting more women and minorities to its activities and to STEM educational programs and careers generally, a critical need as we move toward a more diverse, global workforce.
FIRST	50963	4	/users/profile/51494	th	Volunteer	5	08/24/2010	I have worked with students for the last 17 years, starting with my own when they were in kindergarten.  My goal in doing so was to encourage them to look at science and math (STEM) topics, stay interested in them, and use them in real life situations.  Following my kids all through school, I stuck with the task of trying to teach them at school and at home when possible.  Fortunately, I was introduced to FIRST almost five years ago.  Once I saw what it was, it hit me that this program is the culmination of all that I had strived to teach.  In addition, it had the other topics I never was able to quite wrap around, like business and public relations and fundraising.   For the last four-plus years, I have worked with my kids and their friends for about 360 hours during each six-week build season in January and February plus hundreds more hours throughout the year.  My goal was to help the teams students (and my kids) achieve things they never knew could be possible.  FIRST is like that, you work towards the main goal of building and competing with a robot and you may never quite realize that what you are learning is much more than how to build a robot.  I know now it is about dealing with people, learning to share, learning most importantly to give back to the community you live in.  Some teams may worry about winning, raising the most money, going to lots of competitions, and bringing home many awards but this misses the point.  The big picture is much more than this.  For all its technology, math, science, and competition, FIRST is really about people and learning how to deal with them and most importantly, learning how to give back.  Ultimately, FIRST teaches you to be a better student, parent, and educator.  And it is fun.  Isnt this what learning is supposed to be all about?
FIRST	50961	3	/users/profile/51492	norm2	Volunteer	5	08/24/2010	I have been the New England Admission Counselor/Assistant Director of Admission for Florida Tech now entering my 12th year. My very first experience with FIRST was at a WPI/NCSSSMST conference, where I saw the history of FIRST. Then I began to experience the energy, the commitment, the competition of all that FIRST involves. Then, when Florida Tech's freshmen robotics team WON a major competition, and 4 out of the 5 were from New England AND ALL were FIRST competitors, I participated in any and all regional FIRST events. Scholarship Row allowed colleges to be in the hall. Florida Tech guarantees ALL a $10,000 scholarship, if they are academically scholarship qualified for FIRST participation. For my university, and for many more, FIRST is symbolic with excellence, creativity, competition, teamwork and pure love of science. FIRST deserves and has earned your recognition and your support.
FIRST	50960	3	/users/profile/51490	tdcares	Donor	5	08/24/2010	Since learning about FIRST in 2007, our company has supported FIRST programs and I have personally participated in programs and at events. What I have observed is an amazing program that engages children from grade school through high school in more than just robotics, it gets them interested in technology, science and math careers. It takes something that could be intimidating and presents it in a way that all can learn and participate. Not only does it support STEM education but teaches SO MUCH MORE. Its theme of Gracious Professionalism teaches students that it is inot always about winning but the importance of working together and helping others. In addition, teams and partcipants are encouraged to share the message in the community, mentor younger children and provide community service.  It is a remarkable organization and I am proud to be a part of the FIRST family.
FIRST	50942	3	/users/profile/51473	lnguyen2	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/23/2010	First Robotics is a truly inspiring program.  It sucessfully brings together industry, universities, and high schools  to build and support the pipline of students who will go into the technological workforce.
FIRST	50941	3	/users/profile/51472	jjs	Volunteer	5	08/23/2010	FIRST is an organization that seeks to make science and technology interesting and exciting to students through robotics competitions.  As well as encouraging teamwork and "gracious professionalism" FIRST hopes the excitement of participation in the competitions will contribute to students staying in school and thinking about post-secondary education in science and Engineering.  I am a Professional Engineer and I have judged at many competions over the past seven years.  It is inspiring to me to see students excited about the technology of robots, but also very motivating to see the teamwork and growth in the students.  Experienced teams help inexperienced teams, older students mentor younger students and past participants come back and assist.  FIRST is truly an amazing program and I am grateful for my participation, and to the visionaries who created and continue to lead this effort.
FIRST	50939	3	/users/profile/51466	sjlynch	Donor	5	08/23/2010	FIRST is a truly unique organization which helps encourage students from all walks of life to get excited and learn about science and engineering.  FIRST creates and organizes events nationwide which encourages students to apply knowledge in a fun filled game that requires teamwork, on the spot thinking and creatvity. It is such a fun experience watching these kids compete, and see how excited they can get about science.  The program is helping recruit future scientists and engineers, all while letting the kids have a lot of fun.
FIRST	50938	5	/users/profile/51465	ashaki	Volunteer	5	08/23/2010	FIRST Robotics tournaments are the single most exciting outreach activity that I have had an opportunity to witness. As a tournament judge, I am able to interact directly with students who work tremendously hard over a very short 6-week period to build robots for a specified challenge. It is amazing to see what students can do, if you just challenge them. And the FIRST organization does just that. The challenges are difficult, they require time, energy, and resource, but the students get it done anyway. More important is the focus of FIRST on transforming the culture. The award structure celebrates creativity and outreach through a philosophy of gracious professionalism (a term coined by FIRST officials), and a lot of the FIRST teams really get it -- and they know how to reach their school-aged peers. Finally, the FIRST tournaments are like attending a March-Madness basketball event. Music, dancing, and enthusiasm to beat the band. I even saw the band from the Bedford Stuyvesant school in Brooklyn perform at the NY city regional tournament this past spring. It was awesome. If you ever have a chance to go to a FIRST tournament, do yourself and your kids a favor -- just go and see with your own eyes. I guarantee you will have a renewed view of robots and young people in general.
FIRST	50936	6	/users/profile/51463	bigley3	Volunteer	5	08/23/2010	I work for the American Society of Mechanical Engineers and we give scholarships to worthy students who participate on a FIRST Team. Between working for ASME and as a member I have been able to open up the eyes of many coworkers and other volunteers to see all the good that can come from these kids being on a FIRST Robotics team.  In the 4years I have participated I have watch freshman evolve into young adults who have a solid knowledge of what they want to do in the engineering fields and other aspects of life. they have learned to work together for the greater good of the team and learned invaluable life lessons from thier mentors and other teams. I am pleased to see how many high school students come back to thier FIRST Robotic's team to mentor when they can. FIRST has made math and science fun, entertaining, educational and most of all for everyone, not just the geeks...These kids get on the job, hands on training on what they learn in class and then they see how it all clicks and works together in the real world. that is invaluable.
FIRST	50934	6	/users/profile/51460	richard-sisk	Volunteer	5	08/23/2010	FIRST is amazing. The goal of FIRST is to inspire students in the areas of science, engineering, and technology.FIRST uses robot competitions to bring together students to work with engineers and other business people to design a build a robot to meet a challenging competition. I have the privilege of judging the teams in various aspects of team attributes and machine attributes. It is amazing to be able to walk into a group of high school students and ask them to explain complex mechanical designs and to feel the excitement as they relate to you incredible details about their robot, or how they manage their team, or their community outreach.One of my more memorable experiences occurred during the 2009 Championship in Atlanta. I was assigned several teams to interview for an award, one of the teams was from a facility for troubled youth. Students must earn their way onto the team and can only remain on the team if their behavior is exemplary. These students worked hard to build a robot and make it to first a regional competition in Colorado where they achieved the highest honor, the Chairman's Award. This award earned them a trip to the championship in Atlanta. The students on the team related how their FIRST robotics experience has changed their lives. One student plans to mentor other FIRST robotics teams in the area when he graduates.
FIRST	50933	6	/users/profile/51461	AngelaDavison	Volunteer	5	08/23/2010	FIRST speaks in a powerful voice to the best and brightest students, letting them know that their interest in science and technology is a good thing.  FIRST provides an safe environment that fosters, encourages, and frankly celebrates this interest.  Students meet others across the globe who share a passion for technology, and learn that they are not alone or outliers or somehow not worthy of adulation and respect.  FIRST competitions bring forward many of the values enhanced by traditional school activities like sports or social clubs.  FIRST students learn the value of teamwork, refine leadership skills, understand their contribution to the team's functioning, learn what it takes to be a gracious winner and competitor, and learn to honor themselves and respect their talents.  I support FIRST in part because I wish it existed when I was in high school--it would have brought me much self-confidence to have the opportunity to spend time with legions of like-minded students.

Shannon was fostering with Melissa and after the application process and approval I was able to go to Melissa's home and meet my little sweetie before adopting. Melissa was very accommodating and worked with my schedule to set up the meet and greet, I was traveling quite a distance so it was nice having someone so flexible. Since adopting Shannon I follow Melissa and Canine Commitment on Facebook and seeing what this group does for animals on a daily basis makes me so happy that I chose them when adding my new family member and it makes me very happy that they chose me to be Shannon's mom. Keep up the good work Canine Commitment, thank you for all that you do!

I have many contacts in the rescue here in NH and I chose Canine Commitment when the time came to adopt another dog. They truly care about each dog they rescue and do their very best to find good homes for each and every one. As a trainer I appreciate how they encourage these families to utilize obedience training with their new pups. Rescuing animals is an incredibly difficult and often thankless job and these ladies put their hearts and souls into this often heart-rending job. We love our Lola so very much and we are so grateful to Canine Commitment for our beautiful girl.

We just had a baby and I was still sad about loosing our dogs.  We met Ross and she was amazing. She made the process so enjoyable. You could tell her love for each and every animal that was there. There was a puppy there that I wanted but was already taken. Then one of the dogs chose us. He seemed to be attached to the baby. We decided that we would love to have him. We passed our background check and was able to get our puppy. This animal has been such a joy and blessing to our family. He has been nothing but perfect for us. He is such a love bug and has so many quirky ways you just cant help but love him. He makes our hearts swell everyday. Thanks for the hard work and commitment from CCNE, our lives are now a better place for having them bring life back into our home. I dont think I would go anywhere else to adopt a pet. This team is truly amazing. Highly recommended.

Canine Commitment of New England	298033		/users/profile/388866	justen	General Member of the Public	5	07/25/2016	I have adopted 2 dogs from CCNE and both are Antarctic dogs! Ross is very diligent in making sure all dogs are temperament tested (with other dogs, kids and cats!) and if it isn't the right fit she'll tell you. All dogs are thoroughly vet checked and up to date on vaccines and heart worm preventative. I agent personally dealt with Melissa but from all reports she has a heart of gold and is the same as Ross. I work in a vet clinic where we see many of the adoptees and their new "parents" and I haven't ever heard of one complaint, only praise for CCNE.

This is such an excellent organization!  Once the dogs arrive at CCNE, they are given so much love and special care.  In addition, the women that run CCNE carefully place the dogs with adopters; always looking out for the best interests of both parties.  Again, my highest recommendation!
Canine Commitment of New England	298012		/users/profile/388838	Writer	Client Served	5	07/25/2016	I don't even know where to begin!  I've rescued several dogs in my life time, but never have I had the absolute privelege if adopting a Mama Dog.  At CCNE their love of dogs run so deep that they will rescue a pregnant Mama, give her a safe and loving place to have, and care for, her babies, and THEN find safe and loving homes for the whole family of them!  I've never seen such love and dedication.  I was honored to be able to adopt Mama Taylor, who gave birth to 8 beautiful babies at about 18 months old.  Down south she would have been killed without ever having her gorgeous pups; but at CCNE her life was changed forever and for the better.  We cherish every day with this sweet, loving, amazing girl!! We were so happy and taken with the passion of this rescue we also adopted a second pup from them!  We were blessed to adopt a gorgeous little 10 week pup who stole our hearts.  I can honestly say that I will never again adopt a pup of dog from any other organization!  Sure, they wanted references and information, but I would give them whatever they ask for because I realize they only want what is best for the dogs.  We're so thankful!

The director Ross, made the entire adoption process a pleasure. It was a process , which had a steps to make sure we were the perfect fit for our dog and that our dog was also the perfect fit for us. I admire her dedication. I can't be an easy job. I give her full credit as to why our dog fit right into our family. He was born into a loving and nurturing environment at the rescue, surrounded by people that cared and lots of playful children. Therefore he has known nothing else of the world and is a  gentle GIANT. Weighing in at 80 lbs it would be difficult if he was anything but gentle. In the year following his adoption  we had a couple medical hiccups with him and on several occasions I reached out to Ross for her advice. She always responded right away and was more than willing to give us her opinion. We still keep in touch with and has even made a visit. She was such a vital role in our happy lives with our dog. When the time comes we wouldn't rescue our dog from anywhere other than Canine Commitment.  I can't recommend it enough!!!

They also have the added bonus of getting time to snuggle and cuddle with volunteers upon arrival to New Hampshire.   Many of these animals travel a long way to find their forever homes.

Canine Commitment of New England	297981		/users/profile/388807	Writer	Client Served	5	07/25/2016	We adopted our two dogs from CCNE. From the very beginning, they were thorough and I appreciated they had the DOGS' interest at heart. They were kind but firm and asked very important questions. Since we were adopting a puppy each time, they made sure to ask if someone would be home at all times (answer was yes) as the puppy could not be crated for eight hours a day. You'd be shocked to find out how many people do that or expect to get a dog and just cage them all day while they work. The dogs were both in excellent health, had all their shots and paperwork up to date, and were well loved. I have recommended this rescue group to many of my friends and will not hesitate to do so in the future.

We adopted our first fur baby from them in September of 2013 and we couldn't be happier with how everything was handled. Some rescues adopt out a dog and then don't care about updates or forget which dog you adopted - but that is NOT the case with CCNE! If you adopt one of their animals you become part of the CCNE family. They love to hear updates and they actually remember each and every dog. About a year after we adopted our first fur baby, we decided we wanted to open our home up to puppies and dogs in need of a place to stay. We immediately knew we wanted to work with Canine Commitment and in September of 2014, we officially became a CCNE foster home.  And we've been fostering with CCNE ever since :)

Ross and Melissa  pour  their hearts and souls into this calling. They truly care about all the animals they rescue and will not allow adoptions to people who won't care for their furry friends. They fully vet the animals to make sure they are healthy and good tempered.  They let prospective owners know when a dog has particular needs (i.e. must be the only dog in the house, or loves cuddling, or high energy dog needs lots of exercise).  They take the time to get to know the dogs AND the  prospective owner so that they may ensure a perfect match.   I highly recommend Canine Commitment for anyone looking for a new pet.

Every new patient I get from there has also been a pleasure to treat!Thank you for all you do!!

Bauer is now 5 and is the best dog I could ask for. Ross was absolutely amazing to work with, sat with me as I played with the puppies and was very friendly. It was obvious to see she really has a passion for this and cared about the dogs and their well being. I was able to meet Bauer's mother as she was still at the house. To this day she still remembers when I mention Ginnie's puppies or Bauer's birthday in a Facebook post :)

Canine Commitment of New England	297946		/users/profile/388774	Donna255	Client Served	5	07/25/2016	We have adopted two dogs from Canine Commitment in the past few years.  I am so impressed with rescues in general as they consistently try to plug up that hole in the dam of life that spits out animals normally unwanted or uncared for.  I would give Canine Commitment an A+++ for their time, transport and care of these unfortunate animals, bringing them up north and finding homes for all.   This calling in life is 24/7 with no time off for good behavior and they step up each and every time.  Paul and I thank you Ross for all you do!!  Mama Lucy and Ranger thank you as well!

Ross truly gives all of herself to make sure that these animals find the best homes. She spends time to learn about you and helps guide adopters through the process. We love CCNE!!
Canine Commitment of New England	297942		/users/profile/388770	Kerry26	Client Served	5	07/25/2016	We adopted a wonderful dog in April. We were given lots of info about his background and we were even allowed to visit three times (once with our current dog) in order to make sure it was a good fit. Although I have fostered dogs through other agencies, my vet reference etc was checked to make sure it was a good home for the dog. I appreciate that they want to make sure it's a good match. I would adopt through them again! 
Canine Commitment of New England	297940		/users/profile/388769	beekerzeeker	Client Served	5	07/25/2016	I adopted two dogs from Canine Commitment and honestly it is not exaggerating to say that my experience was life-changing!   I could not be happier with my girls, and Canine Commitment literally saved their lives (and thus, mine).  I adopted an adult dog in the summer of 2015 and a puppy in March 2016.  Both experiences were wonderful and my dogs could not be more amazing little creatures.They do a very thorough but very fast-moving check of your references and home situation, as they should to ensure the dogs get adopted to the right home.  I also value their opinion on what home is a good match for every dog; these people know their pups and just want the best for them.Thank you, CCNE! You KNOW I'll be back :)

Canine Commitment of New England	297936		/users/profile/388765	puppyplease	Client Served	5	07/25/2016	This weekend my amazing dog (adopted from CCNE) and I competed in the largest rally obedience trial in the country.  This incredible rescue dog went up against some of the top dogs in the country.  He had 6 perfect scores, came in 5th in the level 3 division, 2nd in the level 2 division, WON the level 1 division and came in SECOND place for the ENTIRE trial!!!  So that is my brag for what THIS dog has done.  My brag for CCNE is just as glowing.  I am a former vet tech, former member of a board of directors for a rescue group and I have been a professional dog trainer for over 13 years.  I look at every dog facility with a critical eye.  I have stopped in unannounced on many occasions and have always found the facility to be immaculate, the volunteers friendly and compassionate, the dogs incredibly well cared for and every legal/paperwork piece is always in place.  When people ask me where to find a dog, CCNE is my only recommendation for rescue.  I have never once had a concern on the care of their dogs, or the significant efforts they make to ensure the well being of dogs in their care.  We are so fortunate to have such a caring and hard working group advocating for these dogs!

Canine Commitment of New England	290003	1	/users/profile/380274	Lisa544	General Member of the Public	1	05/15/2016	We adopted a dog in Feb 2016. Was not told the truth. She had aggression issues. Notified them about them via e-mail. Only response was she was not that way when she was in their care. No options, advice, or concern given.After 3 months, some one-on-one training and group training she was not getting any better. E-mailed them about her issues and surrender per their contract. Again no concern about the dog. Only given time of when to drop her off.At surrender the dog was grabbed and dragged away from us. Not giving us a chance to say good bye. I tried to talk to her and explain and state that I did not want this dog to be bounced back and forth. Her issues need to be known to new adoptees. She said she had no issues. Told us to get off her property.(and not nicely) I was upset and crying already. I threw down the surrender paper work. DO NOT GIVE OR ADOPT from these people. They lie about the dogs and don't really care. 
Canine Commitment of New England	271246	1	/users/profile/360055	Writer	Client Served	1	11/05/2015	I went to Canine Commitment to adopt a puppy. I found a puppy my entire family loved. I filled out an online application with three references. All of the references said the questions were weird and off putting. One of my references was my neighbor. He called me and asked if I was getting a dog or a security clearance? In the end they denied me to get any dog from them.I own a house with plenty of land. I have had dogs all my life and know how to take care of them. They adopted two dogs to a guy at work both of which died "accidental" deaths. The owner of Canine Commitment will not specify why I cannot adopt any dog from them or how my coworker was able to get two from her.I would not adopt from them. I would not donate a single cent to them. They need to reevaluate their business and adoption procedures.

Through The Water Projects multi-media sources online, my elementary-aged children were able to understand and empathize with the basic and dire need of people in other communities to have drinkable water. My son and daughter and their friends worked together to tell others and raising money for a specific water project in Africa. I love that The Water Project links donors to a specific well or project in a specific community. Even though the results are on a real-life timetable and not instant, it is wonderful when you eventually see photographs and video of an actual community enjoying the completed project you directly helped fund.

Volunteer	5	02/13/2012	Its amazing how many causes go right to the roof and have so much exposure and most get on the band wagon and then they get awareness, I support many of these causes. When it comes to the causes of humanbeings, their Dignity, Respect, Equality and their rights, like their right to live, eat, be safe, grow and develop and not be exploited or abused, we fall very short. It seems that if we are not subjected to these unfortunate situations, we pretend they do not happen. We can stand united to yell and protest about freedom of speech and yet we can let others die because they have no food or drinking water. We who have been blessed to not have been born in a third world country pretend that most have what we have. If we are destitute there is hope, we can go to a soup kitchen or a food bank or a government agency and receive some help. Other countries do not have these. How is it , that as humanbeings we can sleep at night knowing that others will die because they have nothing??????????? Talk about mans inhumanity to man. Please help others less fortunate. Please love. Please care. Please let your voice be heard. Please , please, stand up for those who do not have choices.

Not only do they let you know, but they let you help. You can create your very own fundraiser online and have a fundraising page for it. The Water Project inc. also teaches people about people with desperate need of food or water. It teaches us that of the 75% of water on this planet, only 3% of that water is freshwater, and only less than 1%of that freshwater is not glaciers or ice. This information gets a lot of people inspired and willing to help out, heck it got me wanting to help out.

I am a Christian and feel challenged to show the love of God to others. I know that this might sound simplistic to us in the west who don't spend much time wondering where we will get our next supply of clean water. I know I don't but imagine what that would be like. People are thirsting and dying because of no water or drinking dirty water. If enough people get involved we could end the absence of clean water to drink on this planet. This organization makes it so easy to get involved. Please check out their website and join those of us who are already involved. Let's do something extraordinary this year together!

Without it, people would suffer needlessly. Nearly 1,000,000,000 people dont have access to clean, safe drinking water. This is why each citizen should do his/her part in providing clean and safe drinking water for those who dont have it. Could there be any way to help this cause? Well, I know a certain organization that does. It is called The Water Project, Inc. It helps fund safe water projects around the globe. I have raised $350 which I am donating through The Water Project to a specific water project in Rwanda. It will fund the construction of wells and will take about 6-8 months to complete. This will help the people of Rwanda tremendously. Thats why I think that The Water Project, Inc is a very good organization. So please take some time to visit its website- thewaterproject.org. Thanks,Nikhil Dutt   .

Not only do they build wells for communities in need, but also maintain them. A really unique characteristic is that people can purchase products (water bottles, coffee mugs, etc.) and 100% of the money from those go towards the water projects.  Another great thing is that the person donating money can select how much money goes to the actual community vs the governing needs of the organization, so people can feel secure that the money they donate goes to good use!

For every $10 donated it will help a person in another place for 10 years. Every person deserves clean water. On the website, you can make your own fundraising site to help raise money to make a difference. There are many activities avaliable so you can spread awareness. The thing that I don't really like is that there are only a few activities. But overall, the site is great.
The Water Project, Inc.	81034		/users/profile/88539	dalton	Volunteer	5	03/02/2011	This is the third year I have been involved with the water project.  Our church is very small but the program motivated us to raise over $2,000.  The bracelettes provided by the water project are a wonderful visual aid and reminder for anyone involved to keep in mind their mission.  We had old and young members of the church involved and donations were made by everyone.  I used video clips provided by the website to inform and enspire our congregation.  There is a lot of material to read and learn from in order to run an informational and effective campaign.  Water is the basis for so many things; food, thirst, crops, livestock, and hygene.  When a town gets a clean water source, they can improve all aspects of their lives.  I believe this cherity is ideal to support because it solves so many problems that exist.  Instead of the typical band-aid approach to mission work, this organization is providing a lasting solution.  I would recommend the water project to any church or organization that wants to make a lasting difference in the lives of others.

The Water Project, Inc.	48067	1	/users/profile/48960	max10	Donor	5	07/12/2010	There are really so many water-related organizations out there. You've got Charity:Water, Blood:Water, Water.org, and many many others. All of them, of course, do fantastic work. The reason I would recommend The Water Project specifically is this: The price of a well in India through The Water Project is only $1500 (more in Africa). The other water organizations I've mentioned above have wells that cost upwards of $5000. As co-chair of the student-run organization "Performers for Progress," I oversaw/directed a student benefit show that raised $5100 for The Water Project. Incredibly, this was enough for THREE wells (serving 2200 people in total). Whenever we called the organization with questions we had, it was always Peter Chasse, the president and founder, who answered our questions. I don't know for sure, but I imagine that with these larger organizations, getting in contact with an organization's founder is nearly impossible. The Water Project also posted photos on their site and gave us updates about the work being done. It is a truly incredible organization.
Rain for the Sahel and Sahara (RAIN)	231027	1	/users/profile/294634	charter	Volunteer	5	10/30/2014	Rain for the Sahel and Sahara (RAIN) is one of those rare organizations that is not about charity but rather about sustainability.Every dollar invested is intended to create the infrastructure or resources to enable local communities to carry on their educational mandate without further intervention from outside. Of course it takes time to build the communal institutions to accomplish this, so RAIN is the initial resource to make this possible. Education is the key to combating the negative forces of fundamentalism that have played out in the region over the last 12 months. Please support these efforts that will sustain a rich cultural Tuareg heritage. I have been to Niger with Bess and RAIN and experienced the warmth and generosity of a culture in transition. Send me an email cw@charterweeks.com and I will send you my journal of that amazing journey to the very edge of nowhere.Charter Weeks

Rain for the Sahel and Sahara (RAIN)	227257		/users/profile/290985	sutton1941	Professional with expertise in this field	4	10/27/2014	The commitment and passion to the work RAIN does in Niger is a model for all small nonprofits.  The Board and the staff create an environment that allows someone with very little knowledge of western Africa to understand the urgency of the need for education, water and support for the people in the communities served by RAIN. Though these communities are a far distance from the United States, RAIN works diligently to make us realize that all people deserve to be treated with dignity and respect when a foreign nonprofit is dedicated to providing assistance.
Rain for the Sahel and Sahara (RAIN)	226660		/users/profile/290392	sldufficy	Donor	5	10/25/2014	I know that every dollar donated to RAIN is money used in the most effective manner.  It is vital that the cultures of the world's fragile indigenous peoples, such as the life-revering Tuareg, be sustained and preserved.  YOU can help in achieving this by donating to RAIN, an amazing non-profit which is dedicated to education and economic development in Niger.  The Tuareg culture (renowned for its matriarchal families, inspiring music and beautiful jewelry) has survived the harsh realities of the desert since its creation; however, it is at risk in our violent world.  The road to peace is paved with the prosperity of people such as those that RAIN is "boosting" with education and, also, with the essentials for good health that enable learning and putting to work what has been mastered.   God bless the people of Niger, and God bless RAIN for all it accomplishes in Niger!
Rain for the Sahel and Sahara (RAIN)	226397	2	/users/profile/290127	Katieww	Volunteer	5	10/24/2014	RAIN for the Sahel and Sahara is dramatic evidence of the power of one.  When Bess Palmisciano first visited the Sahara desert of Niger, she didn't just exclaim over the scenery, she wanted to learn how a nomadic peoples lived in such a place.  When she saw some of the essential things they needed, she set about her work of recruiting help to dig wells, build schools, enable nomadic children to attend the schools by planting gardens to feed them at school.  RAIN now helps to educate women to be economically independent and girls to be educated while not neglecting  important support for men and boys in Niger. The work of RAIN demonstrates the transformational importance of two statements attributed to two ground-breaking women:  Marilla Ricker, "It had to be done so I did it', and Margaret Mead, "Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has." I am proud to support such valuable work!
Rain for the Sahel and Sahara (RAIN)	226351	1	/users/profile/290081	JohnKorba	Volunteer	5	10/24/2014	I've seen how powerful the mentoring bond can be in practice in schools in this country. A way for both mentor and mentee to see beyond their daily horizon and take new, positive and sometimes scary risks. It can be life-saving.   I am so happy to have discovered RAIN's education programs in Niger that give young nomadic girls opportunities beyond traditional roles and their community mentors new livelihoods and training in health, business and social issues. We know how important every year of school is for these very rural and nomadic youths living in a changing and challenging world. RAIN's impact on their Nigerien partners and friends is real, personal and sustainable - and deserves our help.
Rain for the Sahel and Sahara (RAIN)	225929		/users/profile/289678	Larry45	Donor	5	10/23/2014	A recent 50th  reunion of former Peace Corps volunteers who served in the Niger Republic voted to recognize and fund  RAIN and one other non profit group as a legacy non profit serving the critical needs of Niger citizens.   A sub-committee of former volunteers experienced in international aid and development considered and developed a short list of 6 potential organizations, some very large and established and operating in Niger.  RAIN was selected for recognition and funding due to its leadership, use of primarily well experienced Nigeriens to manage the organization, its support of under-served population, provision of   services in education, economic development, food security in a sustainable  manner, and support of girls education. 
Rain for the Sahel and Sahara (RAIN)	225891		/users/profile/289643	stephanie.powell28	Volunteer	5	10/23/2014	RAIN for the Sahel and Sahara is a fantastic non-profit dedicated to improving the lives of many groups in Niger.

Rain for the Sahel and Sahara (RAIN)	225798		/users/profile/289551	Stephanie171	Donor	5	10/23/2014	There are many reasons that I support RAIN both as a volunteer and as a donor. One of the biggest reasons is that they are an organization who sets the stage for people to help themselves.  They are not an organization that sweeps in and imposes western solutions. RAIN listens first and then works to help. Their staff in Niger is Nigerien.  I think that speaks volumes.  When you speak with their ED, Bess Palmisciano, you see that her deep respect for the Tuareg people informs RAIN in everything that they do.
Rain for the Sahel and Sahara (RAIN)	225765		/users/profile/289520	MMain	Volunteer	5	10/23/2014	Bess and the staff at RAIN are intelligent and compassionate leaders working to create positive change for the nomadic people of Niger, some of the poorest people on Earth. RAIN's efforts are multi-faceted....fundraising, helping to make the rough desert environment more functional for survival, education and training, and selling in the U.S. the goods made by the women of the nomadic cooperatives so that the money can be put back into schools for children back in Niger. A lot of work done efficiently and with incredibly positive results!!
Rain for the Sahel and Sahara (RAIN)	225246		/users/profile/289016	Margo007	Donor	5	10/22/2014	Our small midwest Episcopal congregation makes a yearly donation to an international non-profit that works effectively with local people to make a difference and empower them to improve their lives.  Bess and her work with RAIN in Niger, through the in-country staff and creative programs, was a perfect match for us.  We were able to support a Mentoring program for women and girls where women taught girls traditional artisan crafts, while sharing about health and nutrition.  Our kids wrote and the girls wrote back, giving our children a chance to learn first-hand about Niger, while having fun exchanging letters across the world.  RAIN does transformative work that we are proud to share!

They accomplish a great deal with the funds they receive and truly make a difference to the nomadic people of Niger. I've volunteered with the organization for the past 3 years, helping to communicate their mission and promote fundraising events. I am confident that this is time well-spent and that RAIN will continue to grow and affect positive change for the women, children and communities they serve.

Bess is truly devoted to finding effective, grassroots solutions to challenges affecting vulnerable populations in Niger.  From the very beginning, she and her team have always been conscious of being good stewards of scarce donor funds, doing her best to minimize unnecessary overhead and make every dollar possible reach those who need it most.  She and her team are also quite conscientious in trying to ensure that approaches are developed in a participatory fashion so that they empower rural populations while ensuring that they respond to real needs.

It is such a pleasure to be involved with an organization that is making a difference in the lives of so many people, especially in the lives of women and girls in the Mentoring program.

Rain for the Sahel and Sahara (RAIN)	83675		/users/profile/92729	bill	Donor	5	03/29/2011	I have been impressed by Rain from the very first news article I read about this great organization. Rain focuses on the very root of poverty. Rain works with some of the most overlooked people in the world. I am especially happy with Rain's effort to not only help with food but also to help a people sustain their culture, history and language.The idea to enable sustainable gardening at school locations is nothing short of brilliant! Their empowerment of women is a key force enabling their partners to survive in a hostile environment and a world of shrinking resources. Our family chose to make Rain one of charitable partners in our family's effort to eliminate poverty from the world's people! Let there be Rain wherever it is needed!
Rain for the Sahel and Sahara (RAIN)	83426		/users/profile/92411	bmnbmn77	Professional with expertise in this field	5	03/28/2011	RAIN's  work in Niger is a great example of how local community initiative with an organization's clear vision and commitment, can plant seeds that can bring new forms of life to a community in need. By working in a variety of fields, such as gardening, education, artisan co-ops, animal husbandry, for example, RAIN works with many different aspects of life in a community. Working with people with a plan for the future is an inspiration in a time when too much of the development work in Niger addresses rapid crisis intervention without a deeper understanding of of the long-term needs of rural communities in Niger. RAIN's understanding of Nigerien communities also included the idea that women are important and powerful sources of social change in their communities. Women's participation in RAIN activities provides a firm base of motivated community members that demonstrate their initiative by participating in activities which have a direct impact on them individually as well as on the community as a whole.

I've also written 2 major public tv series about Water - The Drop of Life, and A Dollar A Day, inspiring stories about escaping poverty, and know the value that RAIN brings to the people of the Sahel and Sahara deserts. In my support of this mission, I had the pleasure of hosting a benefit for RAIN in my living room, joined by several Tuareg and members of my community who were thrilled to learn about the culture and witness songs and artifacts that in turn support the endeavors of RAIN. I'm grateful to Bess and John Ahlgren, who have brought so much hope and sustenance to a people in grave need. This is a precious gift to humanity that needs to be nurtured and cultivated.
Rain for the Sahel and Sahara (RAIN)	82184		/users/profile/90231	lido	Volunteer	5	03/14/2011	Bess Palmisciano, the nomads advocate In 2002 a New Hampshire woman  named Bess Palmisciano visited the Sahara Desert with her husband.  This trip would change her life and the life of others forever.  Bess says, Theres a mystery at the heart of it, an attraction I dont completely understand. The mystery lies in the remote Niger region of West Africa.  The attraction is the legendary Tuareg and Wodaabe nomads who live in these beautiful and barren lands.  Bess and her husband wereintroduced to the vast Sahara by their Tuareg guide, Moussa Haidara.  Bess saw the school Moussahad attended as a child.  But what had once been a bustling compound housing the residential school and its teachers with a dispensary and a garden to feed the students was now a cluster ofabandoned buildings.  Nigers support for its schools had shrunk with the nations economy.  Thiscountry is the poorest in the world. Bess would return several times, digging deep to learn about the intriguing cultures, harsh life, and dire needs of these nomadic people who, in spite of increasing drought and political unrest, sharea sharp desire to improve their conditions. And here it was that Bess found her calling.  Starting with no knowledge of either the official French language or the peoples mother tongue, with no connections in the country save Moussa,and with only the vaguest idea of how to obtain funding, she would not only help rebuild this schoolbut, in partnership with nomadic parents, create programs for the sustainable development of schoolmarket gardens with drip irrigation systems as well as programs for community enterprises such as womens artisan cooperatives and grain-grinding businesses that set aside half their profits for their schools. That is how Rain for the Sahel and Sahara (RAIN) was born.  Now, nine years later, the non-profitorganization that grew out of a serendipitous journey has made a profound impact on the eduction,health and food security of Niger nomads in many areas.  In a region with a literacy rate under 10%more and more children are enrolling in school.  With Besss astute, hands-on guidance as Executive Director, RAIN has created libraries and market gardens, wells and updated irrigationsystems, womens artisan cooperatives, scholarship and student mentoring programs, and has been tremendously effective in providing HIV/AIDS awareness and education.  Parents, mostly women,serve as mentors, encouraging children to stay in school, teaching after-school classes in traditionalskills, talking to them of opportunities for their futures  opportunities these illiterate mentors neverhad but desperately want for their children.  Recently the mentors were offered RAIN-designedand sponsored bilingual literacy classes, learning to read and write in French as well as in theirown language. The mysterious pull that the desert of Niger exerted on Bess Palmisciano has resulted in deepfriendships, long-term sustainable change, and a permanent relationship with the dunes of theSahara and its wanderers.  				*    *    *    *    *    *   *

Educating and empowering women is the best way to support wome. It is not easy to find strong organisations that do this and RAIN is one of the best working in very very difficult and remote commun ities I wanted to donate and volunteer for women in Nigere and this work really really makes a differece
Rain for the Sahel and Sahara (RAIN)	81900		/users/profile/89813	jenburtdavis	Donor	5	03/11/2011	RAIN operates in a region of Niger where you find the poorest of the poor.  Already Niger is ranked as the poorest country in the world according to the UN's Human Development Index and if you are working in the poorest of the poor area, you are reaching some of the neediest people. 
Rain for the Sahel and Sahara (RAIN)	81789		/users/profile/89680	Roderick R.	Board Member	5	03/10/2011	RAIN celebrates its 10th Anniversary this year. We can look back on a decade of success that epitomises RAIN's mission, that is to support the nomadic and rural peoples of West Africa, with a current focus on Niger, one of the world's poorest countries.RAIN has worked with communities throughout Niger to create working partnerships to dig wells and plant market gardens, so as to make schools viable and so facilitating the education of  young women. Our model is self-sustaining, relying on inputs from each community, and creating means by which young women learn skills that translate into jobs and small businesses, that in turn provide income, sometimes up to  half of which is ploughed back into the community and into the appropriate RAIN programme.RAIN's strength is that funds can be delivered directly to its programmes; RAIN's greatest challenge to to satisfy the demand for the introduction of its model
Rain for the Sahel and Sahara (RAIN)	41573	10	/users/profile/42383	ruthk	Volunteer	5	05/28/2010	My husband and I are very active in the international philanthropic community. I think RAIN is unique in many ways- primarily in the way that so much of the organization's budget is devoted to the programs themselves. Another unique aspect is how vested the entire community is in every program: from planning to execution. This seems to guarantee sustainability and success. Niger is the poorest country in the world, but we get positive stories of changes every week. I feel I'm really able to make a difference working with RAIN.
Rain for the Sahel and Sahara (RAIN)	41567	5	/users/profile/42376	sallyb3	Volunteer	4	05/28/2010	Throughout the years, I've seen RAIN grow and expand, and it's been very exciting for me to be a part of it.  Every year, more girls in Niger are getting the help they need to stay in school- and more women are becoming literate, as well. What impresses me most is that it is all community based-entire families working to help other families, women helping girls, parents building schools, wells and gardens.
Rain for the Sahel and Sahara (RAIN)	41480	10	/users/profile/42298	bonnie10	Volunteer	5	05/28/2010	RAIN is an outstanding non-profit in that it manages maximum impact for dollar given.  It was begun by an energetic and compassionate lawyer who visited friends at the embassy in Niger about five years ago and who was overwhlemed and inspired by the need there and also by opportunity and resourcefulness of the nomadic people.  Currently RAIN is paying particular attention to the needs of women and children and is developing a network of mentors that benefits both.
Rain for the Sahel and Sahara (RAIN)	38787	2	/users/profile/39690	rain4web	Former staff	5	05/13/2010	I had the priviledge to work for RAIN and see the efforts and the benefits of all that it does for the Tuareg people and their children.  The passion this organization brings is awe inspiring.  RAIN helps the people of Niger overcome natural adversity by providing the resources and tools to thrive.  They teach the children the power of nutrition, farming and education through their efforts with the school market gardens.  And RAIN empowers women though the Artisan Cooperative initiative to bring their crafts to the US; which provides an income for themselves and the schools for the children.  RAIN has so much more to offer!

Rain for the Sahel and Sahara (RAIN)	38695	8	/users/profile/39593	allison5	Board Member	5	05/12/2010	I joined the Board of RAIN in 2009 and have been very impressed with the organization. RAIN is very lean and is able to provide many direct services with low overhead. The dedication of Bess Palmisciano is truly inspiring. Bess has forged unique bonds with the nomadic people of Niger, their leaders trust her and look to her for help with their needs. Niger is a very under-served country and RAIN fills many gaps in education, water security, artisan cooperatives, and mentoring for girls. I feel very lucky to be able to be involved with such a focused, effective organization.
Rain for the Sahel and Sahara (RAIN)	38458	8	/users/profile/39337	rainks	Donor	5	05/10/2010	Having know RAIN's Founder, Bess Palmisciano, for more than 30 years, I am most confident in reviewing RAIN.RAIN is a worthy non-profit for the following reasons:INTEGRITY & transparency of use of funds:  The money gets to the people through food, education and work mentoring programs to improve the economics of the people.Committment to HELPING OTHERS HELP THEMSELVES:  The goal is for the recipients of RAIN's assistance to become self-sustaining.Assistance to a community WITHOUT ATTEMPTING TO CHANGE THE CULTURE:  No one is looking for converts here.  Respecting the native culture of those they are trying to help is a critical part of RAIN's program. RAIN volunteers and programs work WITH the existing culture not against it.PURITY Oof SPIRIT:  RAIN was created to help Nomads in the Sahel and Sahara regions, the poorest on the planet,feed themselves and educate their children in hopes of expanding the opportunities for future generations.It all began when Bess fell in love.  Founder, Bess Palmisciano, along with friends and family, hired a guide to take them through the Sahel and Sahara.  She wasn't setting out to change the world but to simply explore a land and its people.  Experiencing first hand how the Tourags of Niger lived simply within a coopertaive, kind, peaceful culture, Bess fell in love with that culture.  When she realized that educational assistance from the Nigerian govt. was all but negligible, Bess realized that she could help.  By raising funds for seeds....really, seeds...to grow vegetable gardens and use these gardens to feed the school children or sell to pay for books, RAIN was born.Today, RAIN is one of, if not the only, NGO in the region with simple programs to help these people solve their own problems: hunger, education and economy.Thank you for taking the time to review why RAIN is a worthy non-profit.  In a time when there ae so many organizations looking for assisatance, I hope you are now most comfortable with participating in RAIN and helping a people in the poorest part of the world help themselves to a less dependent and more vibrant future.

Rain for the Sahel and Sahara (RAIN)	38366	8	/users/profile/39239	reekatrak	Board Member	4	05/08/2010	The RAIN organization is particularly attractive to me because of it's intimate, direct approach to the challenges of the Tuarag people in Niger. Each project is developed withing a small community of Tuarag peoples with the goal that within a few years the program will be self sustaining and RAIN can move on to the next project. Rain begins by investing money and resources to help the locals build a school, start a garden, and develop a mentoring program. This initial investments grows to not only provide small business opportunities for the adults, but also provides food and education stability within the community. I'm proud to be part of this effort.
Rain for the Sahel and Sahara (RAIN)	38255	4	/users/profile/39029	tucker42	General Member of the Public	5	05/07/2010	RAIN is a very unique organization, in that it's able to reach very remote areas where other NGO's are unable to. Just in the last six months, their expansion of ten school market gardens, as well as their emergency food aid campaign during the recent droughts has impressed me with their quick responsiveness and concrete results. I've also assisted in selling handmade items from the women's artisan cooperatives, and without exception, people are touched to learn exactly who made the item they are purchasing and how 100% of their purchase is going to that artisan and to the community school.

I love giving back to people who are less fortunate. It's a heart warming experience getting to know the residents whose house you are working on. Especially when at the end of a long week, you take a step back and look at what you have accomplished......for someone else  :-)  "Labor Of Love" is our motto. We have an opportunity to share our love with others by serving them and meeting their needs.  This past summer we were in Sunapee NH and i worked on a house that needed painting. She was a single mom of two boys whose husband passed away from a bike accident. All she could say to our group was don't leave. The impact we left on her and the boys can not be described.  I actually just sent her a letter and look forward to hearing from her and the boys.              I anxiously await for the next workcamp....it's 20 weeks and 5 days in Lebanon from today....not that i am counting:-)

The camp is not only a place to grow and develop spiritually but a place to be a humble servant of God's by being HIS hands and feet! Working on resident's homes were such a huge blessing! The worship blew me away but most of all, through this camp, GOD blew me more in his current of never-ending love!

Even though weve never had hands-on experience with the camp, its truly moving to know that there are young people and adults giving their time and effort to help those less fortunate.  We know that WorkCampNE is professionally run by dedicated people who strive to make this a wonderful experience for the campers and homeowners.  We feel blessed to be associated with such an enthusiastic and inspirational group of people.

Most of my clients are very low income and come with a variety of needs.  When I first heard of Workcamp I was not sure what to expect.  I worried that my clients would get their hopes up only to be dashed down again when monies ran out or volunteers did not do the work promised.  My clients and I were thrilled to find the exact opposite!  The Workcamp volunteers were so hardworking and gracious.  Several of my clients benefited from the work they did and I heard nothing but high praise for their commitment to finish the jobs they started and with how polite and considerate they were to the needs of each client.  I want to thank all of them for their dedication to helping those less fortunate.  
workcampNE, Inc	64455		/users/profile/70475	Jay McBournie	Volunteer	5	02/07/2011	I went to work camp for the first time last summer. I wasn't sure what to expect and I thought it wasn't going to be fun. I ended up having one of the best weeks of my life and cannot wait to go back again this summer.  I made great friends and the best part was helping the family. We worked on her house and seeing the difference in her life really made me understand how important it is to help others. All of the staff is awesome and I still keep in touch with kids that I met from other states. 
workcampNE, Inc	64141		/users/profile/70114	Judy Barrett	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/07/2011	 During the past five years I have had the pleasure of coordinating the needs of several Kennebunkport families with the staff and volunteers of Workcamp NE. several times.They are a blessing for our low income seniors and handicapped residents. Because of their effort ,these individuals are able to remain in their homes. The volunteers installed new windows, roofs, ramps and bathroom railings. They replaced rotten siding and painted up homes. All at no cost to our residents.   More importantly is the bond of friendship that has been established. My seniors refer to them as "MY kids" All still display photoes. Some still receive cards and notes just to keep in touch. I look forward to working with this organization. Our residents continue to ask "Are they coming back- even for a visit?" In this day of so much negativity especially concerning our youth- Workcamp NE is an example that there is positivity and caring still in our society.
workcampNE, Inc	64066		/users/profile/70034	Lori S.	Volunteer	4	02/06/2011	The 2010 summer was one of my best summers ever.  I was able to relish in the joys of WorkcampNE.  The week I attended felt like just a few short days.  It was over before I even knew it.  Community service, bonding with area residents, mentoring highschool students were just some of the experiences I was able to have during this week.  I felt fulfilled after this week was over and it transferred over to my home life.
workcampNE, Inc	64010		/users/profile/69975	edadams146	Volunteer	5	02/06/2011	For the past five years, workcampNE has been the central focus of my summer.  I have witnessed hundreds of teenagers positively affect hundreds of lives. They have provided repair to homes that never would have never been able to done on their own.  I'm proud to be associated with them and as a high school teacher, i cannot think of a better way to spend my summer.
workcampNE, Inc	63992		/users/profile/69952	Stone Cold Steve Soundboard	Volunteer	5	02/06/2011	I went to WorkCampNE to help others, but I came away with much more than I gave.  I've never worked so hard and felt so fulfilled and appreciated.  The organization and and execution of camp was outstanding.  From the time you arrive till you leave,  you know what's going on and you feel comfortable and cared for.  The work assignments were challenging, but rewarding.  I will continue to attend work camp as long as my 50+ year old bones wlil allow.
workcampNE, Inc	63834		/users/profile/69782	Tgaither1	Volunteer	5	02/05/2011	I was blessed with the opportunity to go to work camp last year. My son Josh had been going for several years before and coming back home and talking about all the people that touched his life. To see a young man go and serve the less fortunate and bring them to the lord was simply amazing. I served as a crew leader with young men and women of different talents with different backgrounds and watch them come together with one common goal, to show the love of god through working on the residents homes doing construction projects. Painting, siding, roofing, etc... Also we were able to do devotions and invite the home owners to join us to learn more about the lords love, not only for us but for them also. Work Camp New England works all year to find families that will allow total strangers to come into their home and tear stuff up. Tear down walls not only constructed walls, but walls of past hurts and scars that are removed and healed by the Lord. It is simply an amazing place run by truly amazing people. It not only made a difference in the home owners life, the kids on my crews life, but changed my life forever!
workcampNE, Inc	63453		/users/profile/69375	contactmail2002-bsn	Volunteer	5	02/04/2011	This camp allowed me to experience and gain an attitude towards servicing others. This was my first service project where I had to work along side with others and fix up homes! It is an amazing christian camp where students from all over New England come with their churches to repair homes by giving up one week of their summer! The worship at the camp blew me away. You meet friends from different parts of New England who also share a heart to serve. It's wonderful!
workcampNE, Inc	63345		/users/profile/69254	Thomas H.	Volunteer	5	02/04/2011	I have gone to Workcamp New England that last two years. I had so much fun and the impact was incredible.  The students who attend do a great favor by working on the homes of the elderly and underprivileged.  I am still not sure who is blessed more the residents (the people who have free repair done to their homes) or the students, who learn what it means to work hard and help other people. Workcamp New England is true charity that makes a lasting change.  One of my favorite memories of WCNE was painting Angy's house (elderly Woman in MA).  She was happy to get her house painted, but more than that she was over joyed that young people wanted to come hang out with her.  She was truly blessed and so was our work crew.  Angie is wonderful. This is an organization I hope to be a part of well into the future. 
workcampNE, Inc	63227		/users/profile/69126	PreachItFly	Volunteer	5	02/04/2011	What is WorkCampNE? Very plainly it is a place where both Jr. High and High school students come to exemplify that servant heart of Jesus, through various work projects. I have been a part of many non-profit organizations and I can honestly say this one is run with excellence. The experience of the leadership as well as the well thought out logistics to seemingly every problem was like nothing I've ever seen before. The fact that I saw High school students get excited about scraping paint and replacing siding on a strangers house in 90 degree heat is a testament to the passion and humility that is WorkCampNE. This is something that I am eager to take back to my community. I look forward  to being a part of WorkCampNE for a very long time.
workcampNE, Inc	63206		/users/profile/69100	dccjason	Volunteer	5	02/04/2011	WorkcampNE has been a great oppurtunity for my midwest youth group to experience what it means to help out those in need. they provide a great program in which it allows for the youth to feel that they are needed and most importantly they allow the youth to make connections with the residents they serve. WorkcampNe is a great spring board to use to bring youth back to the Midwest and want to serve people here too. 
workcampNE, Inc	63200		/users/profile/69095	KenT	Board Member	5	02/04/2011	It has been such a blessing to see students grow in their faith - youth ministers connect with their "kids" and witness the residents of the communities we serve connect with our Sr. High Schoolers & Jr. Highers.Home repairs take a back seat to the lives impacted... but that's ok, the goal is to be examples of what God calls us to do - love one another. We choose to do so through tangible efforts of providing minor home repairs... and our students & volunteers are THE BEST!!
workcampNE, Inc	63104		/users/profile/68994	Joanna	Volunteer	5	02/03/2011	WorkcampNE is such a fantastic experience for young people. It isn't easy to convince teenagers to give up their time to help those less fortunate, but one visit to this camp seems to be all most students need to be hooked. WorkcampNE shifts the focus off of the individual and onto how the individual is meant to live as a contributing part of a community.  
workcampNE, Inc	63031		/users/profile/68915	nhtennis	Volunteer	5	02/03/2011	workcampNE is an organization that impacts the lives of many individuals. I have been involved for over 8 years as a volunteer at camp and a board member. workcampNE's impact is twofold. First, the young adults who volunteer a week of their summer vacation get the opportunity to share Christ's love for others by repairing homes of the elderly and less fortunate, and second the lives of the homeowners are touched by the work done and new friendships made. Both my kids participated for quite a few years and have said they looked forward to this week where they could help others and grow in their own faith. 
workcampNE, Inc	63024		/users/profile/68908	Jordyn	Volunteer	5	02/03/2011	This Organization really opened my eyes to the lives of less fortunate than I am. For example, the third year there there was an older lady that had one side of her house open to the elements. It was rotten. It wasnt on our list of things to do when we discovered it but arrangments where quickly made to take care of the gaping hole in the side of her house. It really stuck me with the compasion of this mission and the people who help.
workcampNE, Inc	62928		/users/profile/68804	KDE21	Volunteer	5	02/03/2011	Last summer was my first experience with Workcamp NE. I came in not knowing what to expect, and I lelft with the best experience of my life. not only did I love seeing the lives we changed throughout the week, but I also grew in my own faith as well. My whole crew used our own personal experiences to reach out ot our resident, and it was a wonderful feeling watching them grow in their faith as well. I  came back from camp with the love of serving others, and I'll definitely be coming back this year!
workcampNE, Inc	62915		/users/profile/68791	MelEitel	Volunteer	5	02/03/2011	WorkcampNE has been a vital part of the New Englad landscape. Not only is it helping to beautify the homes of those less fortunate, it is helping to restore humanity, respect and self-worth to those who need it most. WorkcampNE serves those less fortunate than most to rebuild their homes, give it a much needed paint job, add a wheelchair ramp for those house-bound by wheelchairs or even patching a roof. Entire communities have come together to help rebuild their towns and restore the historic beauty that New England has been known for over the past century and more! The staff and students that come are polite and very motivated to share a part of their summer with these strangers that, by the end of the week, feel like family. Many of our residents still keep in contact with their "kids" through the year.Every family that is part of WorkcampNE, is drawn back to it year after year. Loving others and helping them in their time of need is such an amazing opportunity for all who are involved, we can't wait to go back next year!

Our volunteers, mostly retired men and women, provide minor maintenance and repair to the homes of the elderly (60+) and disabled.      Frequently we get requests for service that my volunteers cannot perform.  And this is where the WorkcampNE has come in.     We have partnered with the WorkcampNE folks and referred those jobs that we could not do.  They and their volunteers have performed services to well over 100 of our clients over the years.I have worked with a few of the different workcamps and found WorkcampNE to be the absolute best.  We'd love to have them again.
workcampNE, Inc	62846		/users/profile/68718	Kalt	Volunteer	5	02/03/2011	I took a group of students to New England this last summer. We had the opportunity to renovate homes in Maine through WorkCampNE. It was an experience my students will never forget! They repeatedly ask if we will be heading back. We actually brought four students with our group who'd been in the past, but whose churches were not returning that summer. They believed so much in the work they did through WKNE that they HAD to return. The work we did truly made an impact on the recipients. WKNE has been very good about making sure we have everything we need, personalizing our trip experience, making an impact in New England, and following up with us after returning home. It's been a HUGE blessing and joy to work with this organization. 
workcampNE, Inc	62838		/users/profile/68709	knwiam7	Volunteer	5	02/03/2011	Workcamp is exceptional!  It's well organized and such a blessing to the communities it serves.  In a day in age when most are looking to get the most for themselves, Workcamp does just the opposite.  Those that attend Workcamp come with one person in mind - whoever they're going to serve.  
workcampNE, Inc	62822		/users/profile/68692	jredman	Volunteer	5	02/03/2011	Workcamp NE is a wonderful organization. They are thorough and well organized. The leadership and coordinators have made it so efficient and have managed to create an experience that my students look forward to.  I've worked with other groups in the past - but none with the heart, humility, patience, and understanding that Workcamp NE details. It's truly a great cause overseen by great people.

workcampNE, Inc	62746		/users/profile/68599	jgaither14	Volunteer	5	02/03/2011	I've gone to Workcamp for the past 4 summers as a volunteer and I can't emphasize the kind of good work that comes out of this organization.  I've seen God move in tons of ways through the willingness of the staff and volunteers, and I've been given a passion for missions work through my opportunities there.  I've seen residents who've drastically changed from the first moment we stepped foot in their houses to the end of the work week only 5 days later.  Through Workcamp, I've come to know more about God, community, missional living, and what it means to be a true Christian in these times.
workcampNE, Inc	62715		/users/profile/68566	lccdave	Board Member	5	02/03/2011	I have been involved with workcampNE for 6 years in multiple capacities.  My first experience with workcampNE was as an intern with Manchester Christian Church when they attended the summer program.  I quickly saw the value and impact this orgnaization has on students and community residents.  The students I led began the week unsure of themselves, but by the week's end they had bonded together and developed a new appreciation for service.  This lead me to bring the students from my ministry in IL for 5 years.  Every year my students could not wait to come back to workcampNE.  They loved the spiritual growth that took place, the friendships they formed, and the joy seen on the resident's faces.  workcampNE had a profound impact on the lives of the students in my ministry. I began serving as a Board Member for workcampNE in 2009.  I have now been able to witness the integrity and commitment of workcampNE to living out G.R.A.C.E to further impact students and communities. 
workcampNE, Inc	62707		/users/profile/68558	Suzanne	General Member of the Public	5	02/03/2011	My son went to WorkcampNE last summer for the first time with the JR. high group. It was a life changing experience for him. He went a quiet shy not sure of his faith kind of kid and came back with such confident and a new understanding of what it means to serve God. The family he helped were so appreciative and it gave him the opportunity to see how others live and just how blessed he is. He cannot wait to go back this summer!! The staff is AMAZING! They have all kept in touch with my son this past year and continued to grow their relationships and it's going to be like a family reunion this summer. They do such great work for others but the kids are the ones that really win. They are learning how to be amazing Christ followers and productive citizens in our communities.

I can see and hear from any seat , plus get a glass of wine as I watch! I couldn't ask for more than that but there is one more thing . I can park in the parking garage and go right to the theater so even the weather can't keep me away.
Red River Theatres Inc	317467		/users/profile/408626	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	10/31/2016	Whenever I have someone visiting Concord I always point them towards Red River Theatres because they constantly have great films rotating through. So as a member of the public and as a Concord resident I'm thrilled with everything that Red River contributes to the arts scene here.Additionally, I work at a nonprofit in Concord and have collaborated with Red River several times. Their staff is incredibly dedicated, knowledgeable, and friendly. So I would definitely recommend Red River Theatres to other nonprofits looking to rent out a theater space or looking to advertise.
Red River Theatres Inc	317388		/users/profile/408555	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	10/31/2016	This theater has been a major contributor to the wonderful  transformation of our downtown.

The staff were extremely helpful and really nice to work with. The theatre was comfortable, the film looked great and our discussion afterwards was inspiring. Red River took the time to get to know us and helped get the word out about our film. It was all about the content of our film (Black history) and ensuring we had a full house. We couldn't have asked for a better venue and a better group of people. A much needed organization for the area. Thank you Red River! We'll be back!
Red River Theatres Inc	312065	1	/users/profile/403421	sarge808	Volunteer	5	10/19/2016	Red River has so many different ways to entertain or challenge you! My wife who was handicapped, loved to go for a dinner at our favorite Mexican Restaurant close by and then we were able to park in the parking garage and walk right into the theater without going outside into the New Hampshire winter weather.I have been to many events that speak to the needs of our community, country and world that are not offered anywhere else near us or are exclusive to groups here in Concord. I had the incredible experience of moderating a discussion with two Vietnam Veteran advocates after we watched the documentary "Stray Dog",I don't know of a place anywhere that has the depth of program offerings that speak to so many different people in our society.Red River is truly a yet to be discovered gem for many that will eventually become lifetime fans and supporters of this great venue in Concord.

The seats in the 2 main theatres are really comfortable.  You can drink wine and beer at your seats, and enjoy sandwiches and snacks from local merchants.  We especially enjoy the special events like the sing-alongs and the quote-alongs.  The theatre has become a part of the downtown revival, and sponsors many community events.

They also host special events like discussions with movie makers, costume balls, and panel discussions about tough topics. Over the years, I have watched excellent indies there, heard fascinating talks, and have even participated in a panel or two. Red River is a great boon to the arts scene in New Hampshire!

I'm a huge Red River fan...they provide a unique movie-viewing experience in Concord that you can't get anywhere else in New Hampshire. I work for another nonprofit in town, and have noticed over many years that Red River also serves the community very well, offering space and support for meetings, screenings, and gatherings, plus free outdoor movies in summer, which is so much fun.

Red River Theatres Inc	310952	1	/users/profile/402289	shay993	Volunteer	5	10/15/2016	When we moved to Concord, NH, two years ago, we had already heard and read about the Red River Theatres.  We were so excited to be relocating to a town that had it's own Nonprofit theatre.  Our fist week here, we took time out of our day of unpacking and went to Red River to see a film.It was love at first sight. My wife and I eventually became volunteers and we are still very active in our volunteer efforts with RRT.The staff is incredible, the theatre is a gem in the heart of Concord and the films and events at Red River Theatre are what you would expect to see in a large city, like Boston. We will continue to support RRT and we tell everyone about this amazing nonprofit movie theatre.Shay Cameron, Concord, NH 
Red River Theatres Inc	232328	1	/users/profile/295862	Cherie G.	Client Served	5	10/31/2014	Red River Theatres is far and away my favorite place to spend an evening in downtown Concord. It's one of those rare cinemas where I can show up without even checking the listings, buy a ticket for whatever happens to be showing next, and always be happy I did. Curated by their enthusiastic, expert staff, the film selections are invariably both top-notch and entertaining.  With Red River, I never have to chose between high art and a good time. Not only are their first-run features among the best of the best, their special events and screenings are often THE social event of a weekend. I've been to sing-along screenings of musical films as diverse as West Side Story--shown in a downtown parking garage right after a choral performance of Bernstein's Mass--and Les Misrables--complete with a costume contest. I even attended a Rocky Horror Picture Show interactive party, which was a bit outside my comfort zone but turned out to be a kick. I still miss the erstwhile film series called Xtreme Friday Nights that featured high-art horror and unusually edgy foreign films. While Xtreme was running, I never missed a Friday. But I'd have to say my favorite events are the silent movie screenings with original, improvised scores by Jeff Rapsis. The first one I attended was a New Year's Eve event featuring Fritz Lang's classic, Metropolis. Between the recently-unearthed, lost footage and Jeff's brilliant musical stylings, I got to see one of my favorite films of all time in a whole new light. Plus, there was champagne. All of which is to say: Red River Theatres is central to what makes Concord, NH a cool place to party and a wonderful place to live.

Red River Theatres Inc	231564	1	/users/profile/295142	Dayana333	Donor	5	10/31/2014	Red River Theatres provides a greatly needed alternative to for profit- movie theater offerings.  As a teacher and a parent, it has provided the opportunity for myself, my family and friends to enjoy foreign films of high quality serving as a window into other cultures and various genres of film.  Documentaries that educate, such as the film on the Democratic Republic of Congo's repression and abuse of women and children through military means or how big corporations can pollute our environment are timely and encourage conversation and action toward ending social and other injustices.  Discussion panels or forums are frequently part of the events.  Annual Martin Luther King films and other biographical media fill in historical gaps in education.  Classic films and theme nights make for clean fun across generations.  Prince William's wedding was simulcast at the theatre with a full traditional British breakfast and pageantry that made my family feel like a part of history!  They have also hosted many community events with other local non-profits and agencies. Red River Theatres downtown location with ample parking nearby and a beautiful facility make for a pleasant theatre experience all around.  The staff are welcoming, polite and helpful.  There is something for everyone's tastes and interests available.  The addition of the theatre to Concord has certainly enhanced our entertainment experience.

We cry together, we laugh together, we tackle challenging problems in our world and our community together, through film and discussion at Red River Theatres.  In this day and age when we are pulled apart in so many directions,  Red River Theatres brings us together and helps us create the fabric of our community and state.  For the past several years the theater has shown most  of the Oscar contenders as well as great independent films including even foreign films. Basics like comfortable seating,  a view of the screen from any seat, and the best real butter popcorn ever,  are icing on the cake. Friendly staff are always there to help guide you to whatever you might need, and even parking is wonderful in a covered garage that connects directly to the theater. 
Red River Theatres Inc	231230	1	/users/profile/94358	Heather Ouellette-Cygan	General Member of the Public	5	10/31/2014	The Red River Theatres INC has been a fabulous addition to the city of Concord, NH. It is the best movie theatre in the state by far due to the combination of the films they show, the comfort and design of the theatre, and their public service. As a teacher and community activist, I have worked closely with the theatre to host field trips for my Film and Media Literacy students and to plan events for the LGBT organizations with which I work. No matter what the film, the Red River Theatres is always my first choice of venue.

I used to have to travel as far as Boston to see films that interested me, because no theater in New Hampshire was willing to play artistic or independent cinema. Red River has changed all that. Now, I can see great films near my home! In addition, I often tell people that RRT is a theatre for "grown ups" - meaning that it's a place where my family and I can relax, drink a glass of wine, enjoy delicious popcorn in comfortable seats and not have to worry about other audience members chatting away or texting on their cell phones, which seems to be the norm at most movie theaters these days.  Even the teenagers who frequent RRT, seem to care about watching and experiencing the film they're watching.  From Little Miss Sunshine, to For the Bible Tells Me So  and Whip-it, both followed up by great panel discussions, to Black Swan, I've experience all of my most recent favorite films at the Red River Theatres. 
Red River Theatres Inc	231224	1	/users/profile/294826	Ginnie P.	Volunteer	5	10/31/2014	Downtown Concord has a plethora of lovely venues: outdoor cafs, live theatres, specialty shops, organic and co-op shopping.  The jewel, though, of Concord is  Red River Theatres.  It manages to incorporate elements of all the community offerings.  The movies are selected for their entertainment and content and consequently the theatres become an arena for meeting and making friends.  The ambiance is welcoming and absent the noise of over the top hysteria that greets me at other multiplexes.  RRT is where I go to discover.  Sometimes it is through a panel and documentary, sometimes it is an international film that has no public face in our media, and sometimes it is in sharing a glass of wine or beer with friends. RRT allows me to share a couple of hours of escape into someone else's imagination sans CGI. The variety is incomparable, the events always clever, the the personnel inviting.  With the upcoming movies I am certain to spend most of my free time in one, two, or even all three rooms.  See you there!

Friendly staff, great service, good atmosphere, all the things you would expect of a for profit theater, but Red River goes so much farther. It's not just their selection of often under represented art movies, which in and of itself would be a great boon to our community. No, it's their events, that do more than evangelize great film, but help bring a community together in an age where it is all to easy to ignore those close by in favor of the isolation of the a luxury home life. Their Q&A sessions, quote and sing along movies, and Friday night film series all bring together lovers of cinema that we can talk and interact in the flesh and that service is much needed and unparalleled in anything else in Conord.

Red River Theatres Inc	227645		/users/profile/291376	kwbrandt	Volunteer	5	10/27/2014	Red River Theatres is a place of wondrous fun.  Apart from the fact that it provides opportunities to see movies that do not appear in the mainstream cinema, the atmosphere is also warm, colorful, and congenial.  Everyone is friendly and sociable; the movies present a nostalgic feel to the place; and the special events, such as annual screenings of 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show' and 'Casablanca', are out-of-this-world festive without veering out of control.  I may not be a paid employee but I would never want to stop working at this theatre.
Red River Theatres Inc	226018		/users/profile/289768	Ohi2u	Donor	5	10/24/2014	RRT as it is know, is THE reason I'll get in my car and drive about an hour to the 'city'.  It is the epitome of an independent theater, with the comfort of any luxury theater, and the small-town feel of a local cinema.  I've NEVER been a member of any community theater, yet after my first time at RRT, I wanted more! I felt compelled to become a member and have watched it flourish over the past few years.  The theater experience is ALWAYS a positive one, and the fact that every single worker there seems to LOVE their job speaks volumes about the management.  I love the 'feel' of community while I sit in the theater, and it's as if everyone in the theater is actually sharing the experience.patrons are friendly with each other, and unlike other theaters, people feel a sense of camaraderie while there.the shared experience seems like an event.  I LOVE being a member of Red River Theater!

I used to run a college film series, and for nearly 30 years since then I've lived in Atlanta, where we have always had a healthy selection of good "art house" venues for lesser-known movies; however, Red River seems to be doing everything even better. I'm usually green with envy when I get their weekly e-mailed schedules, and I always make a point of patronizing that wonderful cinema whenever I'm visiting up in NH again.

I heard about them in a news article featuring the sanctuary and their mission to help preserve the ponies. I did some research and decided to learn more. I have visited the farm, and watched and met the ponies, volunteers and Emily and George, who run the farm. Their love for these ponies reflect in every aspect of the ponies well being. The ponies are happy, and well taken care of. This farm is where I love to frequently visit, to see the ponies and the workings of everyday life on the farm. It trully is a wonderful experience.
Villi Poni Farm	313244	1	/users/profile/404612	Linda448	Donor	5	10/21/2016	Emily and George are so great with their ponies and the children who go to the different functions. They teach the children how to feed and water their pony, as well as mucking out stalls and keeping the animal clean by brushing them. They also teach them how to ride and to saddle up their ponies. Emily and her volunteers have done amazing work on the farm. They clean out stalls and keep the pens cleaned up among the many things they do.  Emily has fought to keep the animals from extinction. Not only has she fought other countries to keep them alive, she has brought some to her farm to breed and make sure the don't go extinct. If George and Emily had their way, every pony would be with them on their farm, but, they don't have the room for all of them. But, you couldn't ask for a better home than Poni Villi Farm. They do all they can to make sure that every pony is well taken care of and is loved!

I knew nothing about the Newfoundland pony, but quickly learned about their history and endangered status. The Board members work tirelessly to ensure the preservation of this unique line of ponies. They have helped place many Newfoundland ponies in good and loving homes. With my business and financial background I have been able to assist in these areas. Villi Poni Farm recently received a grant that is paying for fencing for the demonstration ring. With their new location in Jaffrey, NH, they have found a supportive community for the ponies. I look forward to working with Villi Poni Farm for years to come. The Sanctuary's 10 ponies are a joy to watch.

If help is needed or questions need to be answered she will be right there, no matter what time or how often. With the farm she helps to make people more aware of these wonderful creatures again and gives them another chance. Even Ponies who other people would have given up on, she won't give up. Through her help I was able to bring back one of my registered Newfies which I thought I would never see again. Many other Ponies found the best homes they could find, just because of her ongoing dedicated and commitment to them. It would not have been possible without her.If there would be more people around like her, there would be so many Newfies we would never have to worry about their numbers again and this world would be a better one for sure.

Villi Poni Farm	236513	1	/users/profile/320460	jdvanderwood	Volunteer	5	01/08/2015	The Villi Poni Farm sanctuary is a place of refuge for the Newfoundland horses and also a place of learning of the plight to save the breed from extinction. From the time I met Emily and George their generosity of heart was obvious. Their kindness towards the two volunteers I support from  Monadnock Worksource is  heartwarming and they are always grateful for any help they receive. Not only is the experience of volunteering for the farm one of being appreciated but it is also enriching, as well. Any question, any opportunity, any showing of interest is met with kindness and teaching. The farm's stewards weave a magical tale of the plight of these beautiful and gentle horses; their caring is palpable. I would recommend a visit for what would surely be an enjoyable and informative experience of a very worthwhile cause. It is my personal feeling that the sanctuary and those involved are making a difference in this world, and that the saving and support of these animals...a beautiful difference.  Jan Vanderwood

Preserving a breed of poni that most people have never even heard of while educating as many people as they meet seems to come naturally to Emily and George. They truly care for each and every animal they help whether or not they have physically met that animal or not. The patients with my two young boys is heart warming and refreshing.  My children are learning that the the value of a life is not measured in money but in love. Each one the the ponies, horses and donkeys that they interact with at the Villi Poni farm are calm, gentle and full of personality.  I am truly in awe of the newfoundland ponies versatile abilities and all that they have taught my children and myself.  I am looking forward to learning even more about these beautiful misunderstood ponies under gentle guidance from Emily and George.

Always something interfered. Sometimes the programs that were being offered on our available weekends didn't seem interesting and sometimes we figured our kids wouldn't like it. We finally were able to go for four days last July. We had a great great time and regret that we hadn't gone all these years. We went to programs that didn't actually look great on paper that turned out to be both interesting and fun. (And the kids seemed to be having a ball...) What's best is the welcoming atmosphere--a great community of friendly and intelligent people. So in addition to the natural beauty and physical activities, we really enjoyed the great, lively conversations with interesting people.

New Hampshire World Fellowship Center Inc	232616	2	/users/profile/296164	amador.rosi	Client Served	5	11/02/2014	My family has gone to World Fellowship yearly since 1986. It's an amazing and magical place in a remarkably beautiful nature sanctuary. In this beautiful venue are a number of buildings that are lovingly cared for by directors Andy Davis and Andrea Walsh and their engaged staff. Rustic, simple rooms are economical, clean and conveniently located near one of the most beautiful ponds that our family has ever had the pleasure of enjoying whether it's for a swim, a row boat or a canoe ride. The organic food that is mostly grown on the property is served family style, so that folks who join, whether they're first-timers or veterans, like our family, can always count on a mostly vegetarian deliciously flavored menu with occasional fish or the traditional turkey supper on Sundays. The speakers and special guests that the Davis/Walshes bring to WF are always fabulous, and all of them are committed to leaving the world a better place than they found it. My husband and I are the founders of a Latin music ensemble that performs there yearly and has stayed there even when we're not performing. Another thing we treasure about WF is that the attendees are truly multicultural, multiethnic and multigenerational. It is the very definition of the word "inclusive". That is exceptional in rural New Hampshire and is the result of a commitment to make this so. Our now 18 year old twins have gone to WF with us since before they were born and never want to miss our World Fellowship weekend! WF is one of the most special places in the U.S. for our family and we are always grateful that it exists. The people we meet there inspire us to be change makers in the world. There is no place like World Fellowship!  
New Hampshire World Fellowship Center Inc	232440	2	/users/profile/295978	Ashtad	Client Served	5	11/01/2014	It's hard to write a review of World Fellowship Center because there are so many wonderful things to do here--Art on the Porch, jigsaw puzzles, bike rides and hikes with Howie, swimming in Whitten pond, kayaking, rowing, canoeing, meeting new people at breakfast lunch and dinner, attending the Fun Night talent show...and on and on. Some people think "fellowship" means a religious organization, but it's not--it's just a "friendly association, especially with people who share one's interests." Many people from the nonprofit world come here because they can have a vacation while knowing that their money is going to support a worthwhile cause. The place has a large lawn interspersed with a lot of trees, so you can sit out in the sun or the shade. Children like to run around and play with other children at the "Children's Fellowship" or at the playground area. There's a little building at the back of the lawn (the Schmauch Center) where they often have yoga, meditation, folk music, and talks on social justice topics of the day.

Now my grown son is  married and with a young daughter.  He  flies  in every summer,  and my daughter, her husband, and soon new grandson, as well as My husband Ed and I  will  head up to WF.  It is a family ritual.It has become our second home for family time where we are fed, rested, and at ease.   Lots has changed.  Wonderful people have passed away, and so many have moved to other parts of the world,  but what remains consistent is the exquisite "Whitton Pond", where Loons tend to watch over us each summer as we canoe, swim, and spread ourselves like beached whales on the furthest dock for sun, and great conversations with whomever happens to  float by Catching up on  what we did all year, politics, world news, or what's for dinner in the community dining room that night.  People come for all sorts of reasons, bringing their interests, and passions for life to share, or just to be still.  It's not luxurious in the aesthetic sense, yet the luxury we feel is in its simple, yet hardy way of placing itself amongst those who are searching for a simple format to land for a weekend, or a week, or camping for the summer.  To Bike  or take a hike, or drive into North Conway which  becomes a 12 mile adventure to pick up candy at the Old Five and Dime store.  There is something for everyone if you are looking to have a really interesting, and relaxing time.

New Hampshire World Fellowship Center Inc	230958	1	/users/profile/294569	Jim_127	General Member of the Public	5	10/30/2014	I absolutely love the World Fellowship Center for short vacations.  It's like a camp for adults, who can also bring their children.  Everyone eats together  the same food in the dining hall.  There are many stimulating programs to attend if you want to--from lectures to music to writing workshops to exercise.  A walk down the trail takes you to what I consider the best swimming lake in New England.  And such interesting people who attend!  All this for a very reasonable price.

I have rarely visited since, partly because it has become more and more expensive and partly because the programs have gotten somewhat repetitive.  Having said this, it i still undoubtedly a great place to come with family.
New Hampshire World Fellowship Center Inc	230839	2	/users/profile/294461	IleneLe	General Member of the Public	5	10/30/2014	World Fellowship offers a unique and affordable vacation resort experience amidst the natural beauty of New Hampshire. Accommodations are modest, but comfortable and clean. The directors and staff are great and the food wonderful! One eats at long tables with 9 other guests giving one the opportunity to interact. If you like to swim, row and canoe, Whitton Pond is on site and Lake Chochurua is a short drive down Route 16. There are many interesting programs during the season. I have learned so much during the 34 years I have been attending WF. If you love liberal, progressive politics, this is the place to vacation! And the diverse community is composed of warm, intelligent and interesting  folk doing interesting work to improve the world. I love World Fellowship!

My husband and I have been going year after year and keep coming back. The delicious healthy meals, bike riding, and pristine pond are our favorite  parts. We also like the fact that folks of all ages and from all over the country  come there. We love it.

The buildings are old and rustic but the community is what makes World Fellowship a special place to spend some time. If you never got to go to camp as a kid or didn't appreciate camp in your younger years you are in for a treat.! All three, wonderful, healthy meals are eaten together with your new friends. Every night there is some kind of interesting lecture, art or musical event. There are post breakfast and post lunch hikes guided by Howie who knows many trails in the White Mountains and the geological science of the area so you always come back with some new and interesting information as well. If you want to take things at your own pace and just relax and read there are plenty of spaces on the large, screened in wrap around porch at Lloyd Lodge and if you need to cool off, you can take a dip in the serene waters of Whitten Pond. Once you have experienced some time in World Fellowship, you will come back at least once every summer!

World Fellowship is a find.  If you can envision one destination with swimming, rowing, mountain hiking,  biking, basketball, ping pong, timely, interesting workshops, evening entertainment and tons of socializing, exhilarating mountain air, loons and other wild life, flowers, and meeting delightful people of all ages and backgrounds you'd like to know for many years to come, this is the place.

Regardless of what the name may sound like this in not a religious retreat.  It is a a lodge.  It's; family friendly (our daughter loved it at 2 and continues to return),with wonderful outdoor activities including a most beautiful lake for swimming and boating (no motors allowed), hiking and biking (they have bikes to lend) and well prepared, healthy home cooked food served family style.  There are daily discussions for those who would like to partake, yoga, and organized entertainment on the weekend evenings.  This lodge and retreat is no "Club Med."  But if you'r looking to vacation with great people who have a progressive outlook on the world, if you're are not interested in spending you days and evenings watching TV but want to exchange ideas and engage with informed presenters,  play games indoors and out and experience nature, then the WFC may be right for you.  Most kids seem to love it (there are organized activities for children of all ages).  And it is truly affordable.

I have enjoyed returning to this incredibly inclusive and connected community as a young child, teenager, and now young adult. It is a great place to be active in the outdoors, learn about social responsibility by engaging with a diverse group of people, and develop life long friendships. There are multiple types of lodging (e.g. a room in a house, the main lodge, or camping) and 3 meals are included in the price. Meals are buffet style and dietary restrictions are accommodated. There is optional programming for kids and adults (e.g. child care and guided bike rides--with no extra charge). If you are not interested in the programming, you can take advantage of having easy access to a beautiful pond. World Fellowship provides row boats, canoes, and kayaks (again, no extra charge!). You could also go hiking, bike riding, or take in the gorgeous mountain view from the outside sitting area and dig into a good book (there is a library, if you forgot to pack one). If you will be out for the day, you can get a bagged lunch. If there is anything you are interested in doing (at or around World Fellowship), but not exactly sure how to do it, the staff and even other guests are always happy to help!

It's got a progressive vibe, and lots of interesting people, but the best part is that you don't have to participate in all that, if you don't want to.  You can go off by yourself and swim, hike or bikeride. It's your call if you want to get involved with the discussion or not. You don't have to spend your time finding things for your kids to do.  They can run around, make friends and you can relax all in the same area.  My daughter has been going there since she was 5 and at 24 comes back voluntarily with her son.    There are a lot of families that come and bring multiple generations.  I started going there in my 20's and it was the first place I ever met an older person who was a movement activist.  In those days, the only ones I knew were my generation.  You learn something from just being around people who have spent their lives doing things that you want to do. Now I'm the old timer.  And I still come back.

World Fellowship is located in one of the most beautiful spots on the planet.  Every morning I would get up and meet friends for a swim in the pond before breakfast.  My days were spent hiking, biking, reading on the porch, listening to the live music or attending one of the very interesting educational seminars provided.  The staff are fabulous and friendly as are the other guests who I have come to know well over the years.  There is something for everyone, families with kids, adults with no kids, and grandparents.

The organization provided in depth orientation, and information coupled with a demonstrated knowledge of the country's infrastructure and diligent care for those travelling abroad. The work they are doing in Uganda is exceptional, having witnessed the complexities of 3rd world developments and the challenges many non profits experience, ChildVoice is navigating those challenges and leading the way for sustainable program models. If you desire a life changing experience and a desire to view the world from a one of a kind vantage point, investing and partnering with ChildVoice will achieve that and more in your life.

Childvoice International	217757	1	/users/profile/281298	josh24	Volunteer	5	09/26/2014	ChildVoice International is a fantastic organization that empowers young women facing devastating social challenges resulting from the civil war in Northern Uganda.  CVI's goal to restore and rehabilitate shines through at every level through the Ugandan leadership presence in the organization, the commitment to helping the women thrive outside of CVI whether in the village or city context, the use of land and societal integration as the women volunteer in the local village of Lukodi, and the depth of emotional, psychological, spiritual, and physical care the women receive during their residence.  It is truly inspiring. CVI commits to caring for these women long after they leave the center.  They continue to maintain relationship, offer support, and even jobs if people feel called to work at the center for future "classes" of women entering the rehabilitation center. What is most impressive is the way that CVI comes alongside women with dignity, true resources, and  the phenomenal gift of love.

It was an honor to serve with them.
Childvoice International	121207	1	/users/profile/164920	taylorvw1	Volunteer	5	08/22/2012	I just returned from a summer internship with Child Voice. Rather than be a part of a large, established NGO, I really wanted to volunteer my time doing art therapy with a smaller grass-roots organization that deeply cared for the surrounding community and specifically worked with formerly-abducted individuals. Child Voice fit that bill perfectly and I can honestly say after 11 weeks of living in Gulu and visiting many different organizations and networks, that they are truly a unique operation. During my time there, Child Voice operated on a completely Ugandan based on-ground staff. Amazing! I had the privilege of meeting with girls who had graduated from Child Voice's program and I can't emphasize enough how much these girls' lives have been changed. Child Voice equips them with the life skills they need to provide for themselves and their children, but also to maintain their personal faith, hope, and dignity. This organization wants to give their girls a hand up and not a hand out. They strive to do what's best for the girls, community, and be culturally appropriate in every step they take instead of bringing in their western ideals and "do-it-our-way" attitude. I would definitely recommend volunteering your time with Child Voice, making a donation, or supporting them buy purchasing beads that the Child Voice bead women make.

I have been interested in the plight of East Africa and studied about what has happened and what is being done to help these countries.  ChildVoice is the only remaining NGO that is specifically there to help women and children who come back from life in the bush.  While the war has moved out of N. Uganda, people are still escaping and returning home.  The things they have been witness and participate in are beyond words.  Without ChildVoice and the program, these kids and their kids would be lost in a country that couldn't take care of them and that wasn't sure they could be trusted.  I have witnessed, first hand, the progress these girls make and the joy and excitement they have for life and the forgiveness they experience.  All are overwhelming and moving.  I have never witnessed such indomitable spirits and feel priviledged to have gotten to spend two weeks helping ChildVoice!

It's because of my involvement with ChildVoice that I have been blessed with this rich experience. I've been to northern Uganda with ChildVoice three times since 2007. The beauty of ChildVoice is that it's a young, grassroots effort. So working with the orgnanization takes you right into the heart of the matter...living in mud huts in rural Africa, interacting personally with precious Ugandans who are working to recover from years of rebel violence or time in captivity with the LRA, caring for babies and children who were born in the bush, etc. As much as I wanted to pour my compassion in to them, I left overflowing with all they had taught me. Seeing the transformation of young women from my first encounter in 2007 to subsequent encounters over the next few years was amazing and a true testament to the value of the work ChildVoice is doing in northern Uganda and preparing to do in war zones around the world. I am proud and blessed to have been able to participate in the mission of ChildVoice International.   www.childvoiceintl.org

The programs the organization offers to its beneficiaries are always expanding and I am honored to be a part of the team.

As a volunteer with ChildVoice, I had the opportunity to spend two weeks in Uganda, working with the girls and staff.  It was a life changing experience, spent in the African bush with people who have experienced the worst of mankind's inhumanity.  CVI is reforming former child soldiers, and providing them with the life skills and education necessary to reintegrate into their communities as productive citizens.  Not only has the circle of violence stopped for these girls, but it has stopped for their children as well.  Where there was once pain and hardship, there is now hope.

Volunteer	5	01/01/2011	I can think of only a handful of organizations that put their money where their mouth is and ChildVoice does just that.  While the need is great (i.e., poverty, war, lack of community infrastructure), there seems to be nothing more UNJUST than children who are abducted & forced to be soldiers. ChildVoice is working where the need is greatest, where the work is hardest, where the emotions are most raw; but the rewards are great.  Each young girl that enters the gate at the ChildVoice Centre is changed, not just rehabilitated, but loved into healing of body, mind and soul. What a privilege it has been to be a small part of this work!

I was lucky enough to interview not only girls that are currently in the program but graduates and a girl hoping to get into the program. I can honestly say that Child Voice is a necessary organization in Northern Uganda. These girls come from extremely desperate and traumatic situations and are transformed into loving, caring and productive women in their communities able to provide a better life for themselves and their children. The spiritual and psychological counseling these girls receive is truly a blessing from God. You must become a part this movement!

It was amazing the difference in the girls. The have grown so much and are now ready to go back to their communities.  At the centre they learn a trade so they are able to support themselves and their child. They receive counseling to help them with the trauma of the war and what happened to them. Most important they learn how much God loves them and they learn to love each other and be a family.  The centre also provides income to the community by making paper beads. Spending time at the Centre is a wonderful way to see what a difference Childvoice has made in the lives of these girls. 
Childvoice International	57571		/users/profile/60900	ChrisD4978	Volunteer	5	11/22/2010	In late October 2010 I spent one week at the ChildVoice center in Lukodi.  By all accounts I witnessed an incredible operation that both cared for and nurtured young women and their children who were affected by the war.  It was clear the leadership at Childvoice makes it their priority to redeem the lives of the young women under their care.
Childvoice International	57564		/users/profile/60891	nmandsager	Board Member	5	11/22/2010	As a Board Member since 2006, I've been privileged to watch ChildVoice grow from just an idea, to a functioning vibrant organization that is truly making a difference in the lives of children affected by war.  I've visited Northern Uganda each of 5 years, and have personally witnessed how the programs established by ChildVoice have been able to transform the lives of former child soldiers into strong and confident young women, now able to return to their communities fully capable of supporting themselves and their families.  ChildVoice is stepping in where many nonprofits are unwilling to go, and providing support at a level necessary to lift up the lives of women and children whom many have forgotten or abandoned.

Childvoice International	57345	1	/users/profile/60537	runningacrossthesky	Volunteer	5	11/18/2010	I spent time at CVI's Lukome Centre in Northern Uganda during June, 2010. I can't think of a more powerful experience in my life. ChildVoice is a Christian organization that works to rehabilitate former child soldiers - young women who were abducted at a very young age and forced to fight in Northern Uganda's war and bear children. Seeing the transformation of these young women and their kids was incredible. Whether I was spending time singing in morning chapel, farming alongside the young women who live at the Centre, playing with their toddlers, or talking with the girls around the campfire in the evening, none of the time was fruitless. It was such a joy to be at CVI.
Sharon Arts Center	147772		/users/profile/195523	pepbob1	General Member of the Public	1	01/07/2013	i was very disappointed last Sunday when i visited the Sharon Arts Center gallery that the exhibit that i wished to see had begun to be taken down, The exhibit, as stated on the sharon Arts Center web site said the exhibit ended on january 7th. When i mentioned this to some one in the Galllery i received a very curt response that the exhibit ended on the 5th and they were dismantling the exhibit i had gone to see, and had begun to replace it with the upcoming exhibit. I had traveled over an hour to get to see this exhibit and besides not being able to see it was treated in a not very nice way by whomever i spoke to. There were others in the gallery that were disappointed as well, that  had gone to see this particular exhibit.. i will think again as to whether i will want to waste my time traveling there...

It offers professional instruction at reasonable prices as well as opportunities to view/display art and learn about art as a technical and professional practice. I feel very lucky to have this organization in my community.

I feel truly fortunate to have access to an organization that is so committed to providing high-quality art, art education and artist support through its gallery and school programs. 
Sharon Arts Center	60860		/users/profile/66326	Lauryn W.	Volunteer	5	01/24/2011	I began my relationship with Sharon Arts as a student in the summer classes when I was a sophomore, but my real involvement began with their high school portfolio building class, ArtAccess. It was here that exposed me to the world of art beyond drawing and painting. Nome and Melanie, the leaders of the program, did everything in their power to give us a wonderful experience between taking us to artist studios and planning art events, and showing us how to use new mediums (like metal or chocolate!). I came back to ArtAccess a year later and worked as an intern for the class, and it was just as great, if not better! We did a 150 ft mural for the local hospital and hosted Art Attack which is this crazy open house party type event that lets young adults come to the school overnight and try their hand at a whole bunch of different mediums and art games. But basically, ArtAccess was a creative outlet, a guiding hand, and a type of home for me. I made so many artistic friends, and was exposed to opportunities I never would have found on my own. Sharon Arts is an incredible place, and a safe haven for artists. I'd recommend it to anyone with any type of interest in art in the New England area!
Sharon Arts Center	60854		/users/profile/66318	Karrie M.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/24/2011	The Sharon Arts Center is an amazing resource for all ages. Teen and children programs offer a multitude of artistic experiences. Classes provide instruction at beginner and advanced levels in a variety of mediums.  Staff, volunteers, and teachers are helpful and enthusiastic. 
Sharon Arts Center	60840		/users/profile/66300	jmitschmyer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/24/2011	Sharon Arts is the premier arts venue for the Monadnock region. I have been involved with the organization for many years and have enjoyed it immensely. The school of arts and crafts has top notch facilities and faculty. The craft shop has wonderful hand crafted work from local and regional artists. And the gallery space is on par with galleries from New York to L. A. I would recommend visiting the Sharon Arts Center's school and galleries to anyone visiting the Monadnock region. Sharon Arts serves local artists, students, and connoisseurs alike.   
Sharon Arts Center	60832		/users/profile/66290	Lucy B.	Volunteer	5	01/24/2011	I started at the Sharon Arts Center by taking classes. Then I started volunteering with the kids ArtVenture day camp. I loved it and I have been helping there for four years now. I love teaching kids how to express themselves with art and it helped me with my carrer choice of either art teaching or art therapy. It is a great and very welcoming enviornment that anyone can feel confortable in.

My child started attending their camps when she was in elementary school.  She is now in the 6th grade and still looks forward to attending their camps whenever they are offered. However the excitement of the Sharon Arts Center and staff extends beyond the camps to the various gallery shows, exhibits, and events they hold throughout the year.  My daughter has been able to use her growing art skills not for just her own enjoyment, but the enjoyment of others.  For example, she and other younger students worked with the Sharon Arts Center in conjunction with Crotched Mountain Rehabilitation Center to create a mural for their residents.  Another example is that my daughter and others were able to work with the staff at the Sharon Arts Center and the Monadnock Community Hospital to create a series of murals lining the walls of the emergency room entrance to the hospital to make it visually more appealing and soothing to patients while the space was undergoing extensive renovation.  The Sharon Arts Center and their staff care about my daughter, the other children and adults they serve, and the wider community in which they reside - what a wonderful group!
Sharon Arts Center	60824		/users/profile/66279	Ann Wilkins	Board Member	5	01/24/2011	I started taking classes at Sharon Arts after a 25-year career in marketing -- I was presented with the opportunity to start working from home, and I took advantage of my newly-flexible schedule.  I signed up for a watercolor class with a fantastic teacher and 9 - 10 other truly lovely people.... so peaceful and fulfilling -- what a gift to give yourself!!  It was amazing!! My next class was a drawing class; I signed up with my 16 year old step-daughter  and we sketched nude models.  My step-daughter was was unsure of her direction in life, but had strong artistic tendencies.  We had bonded over the 2 - 3 years we knew each other... but what better way to bond than to sketch nudes together??!!  This is a story we will tell forever!!! I then assisted with some fundraising for the organization, and ultimately found myself on the board... Sharon Arts is a gem in this community, and to the youngsters who may not "fit in a regular" school but have a chance at art school, to the housewife who need a creative outlet beyond folding laundry (that was ME once) to the seniors who need a past-time, both creatively and socially -- Sharon Arts is there -- and there are SO MANY MORE who benefit from this organization!  If you want to take art classes, if you are an established artist who wants to sell your art/craft, and if you are an artist who wants to display your work in an exhibit, then Sharon Arts is the place!   And if you want to live in a community that honors and fosters an artistic culture, then come to the Monadnock area... Sharon Arts, along with a long list of other organizations, makes this a lovely place to live and raise a family.  I thank everyone who makes the place tick, you are all amazing...

I have taken many more classes through the years and loved them all. We are so lucky to have this resource located in "Our Town" of Peterborough.I am excited about the new direction that Sharon is now taking, as it is opening up even more opportunities to the people in our communities. I had become somewhat disappointed in the last several years, especially with the higher pricing of goods for sale in he shop. But now Sharon is more competitive, which is good in this softer economic time. 
Sharon Arts Center	60638		/users/profile/66009	carol	General Member of the Public	5	01/21/2011	Sharon Arts is a community resource. Not only does it display lots of crafts and art works, many from NH, but it has more recently reached out to the community to make their gallery more inclusive. Not long ago there was an exhibition for those with visual impairments. What fun to be able to touch a work of art! The classes for all kinds of artistic efforts are exciting opportunities for anyone in the area. As a local resident, I find that I love taking my out-of-town visitors to Sharon Arts just to see the wide variety of gifts and works of art. 
Sharon Arts Center	60620		/users/profile/65986	GAWT	Client Served	5	01/21/2011	SAC came into my life maybe some 25 years ago when I took a jewelry making beginner class.  It was a great experience for a person who was very involved in a work/job and who had not allowed herself to be very creative.  After the class I unfortunately fell back into the work and lots of overtime work rut and did nothing more than drive by the studio and gallery in the woods of Sharon, stopping in to the store or to an exhibit when an ad or sign caught my eye.  My career changed and I found myself in real estate and loving it but working even more crazy hours with a passion and also joining the world of local town committees and organizations.  Again I would stop in now and then to SAC, but almost always in a rush.  Then my parents both became ill and the care-giving phase of my life took over.  Between bouncing back between MA and NH, trying to be a great daughter, a great wife, a great agent, a great board member/chairperson, member or volunteer, etc., I was so out of balance for who I was.  It was the true rollercoaster ride that so many others have gone through or are going through and a ride you don't even know about if you have never really been on it.  Somewhere in my time of stress I met Melanie from SAC and things changed.  She was positive, a great promoter of SAC and, most importantly, a great listener.  I started to bump into her at different meetings; she might be there if I stopped into SAC; she would pick up the phone and call me to ask how things were; a brochure or card would come in the mail.  Somehow, in the time of some of my deepest difficulties, she got through and I signed up for a Saturday workshop of 2 hours or so on glass bead making class, just to do something for myself for a short time.  It was amazing....I was having fun, doing something creative and I left hooked on that flame and that molten mass of fluid color that I twirled and spun.  I signed up for a series of classes and then another.  Yes, I missed a lot of classes because of what life was still doing, but I at least found some moments of peace, happiness and support in the fellow students, my teachers and staff, and of course, Melanie, who was always there to do what she could and be encouraging.  I am sure there are many more examples of what the people and spirit of SAC has done for others and I know SAC aspires to do much more in the community if given the financial support and opportunity.  I truly believe that Art, and those who have a passion for sharing Art, can help so many people at so many different levels to not only develop their talents but to build confidence, gain focus and even find moments of inner peace....often when you least expect it and may need it the most.

Years ago as an undergraduate, I attended one of the finest art schools in the country.  Forty years later, I am taking classes at the Sharon Arts Center in mediums I didn't study as an undergraduate and find that the level of instruction is as good as or better than the instruction I received as an undergraduate.  The teachers at the Sharon Arts Center are excellent, the atmosphere is friendly and welcoming, and the exciting opportunities to learn and explore one's creativity are endless.  Not only have the results of my efforts been rewarding, but also, I have made lasting friendships with wonderful people I would never have met otherwise.  My experience as a student at the Sharon Arts Center encouraged me to exhibit and sell my work as well as to volunteer and to ultimately join the Sharon Arts Center Board of Trustees.  I can't recommend the Sharon Arts Center highly enough and encourage anyone who is interested in the arts to take part.

It's a magic place that's free and open to the public. There's a new show opening every two months, and I wish everyone could spend an hour there to feel recharged. I also find fantastic gifts at their shop, mostly made by regional artists and craftspeople. The classes at the SAC school in Sharon welcome students of all ages, and many of the teachers are amazing professional artists. My favorite classes are in ceramics, but there's something for everyone.

Weaving, drawing, painting, self-publishing, and book making are only some of the classes I have taken. The school provides a small shop where your art work can be seen and sold.  I had never had a piece of my art work in an art show but was encourage to put a couple of pieces in the student show. One sold. It was such a positive experience that I will be entering a couple of more pieces in an upcoming local show.

No matter who you ask, everyone who had a part in this program will tell you how unique and amazing the experience is. I participated in 2011 and went to Portland, OR with my G/C partner Constantina. I still remember our very first day together. The interview process. When I first arrived, she was talking with another G/C. I was just standing and waiting for a T/C to come. Someone I know. There she was, sitting on the bench and saying 'ela re' which means come. She was telling me to go and sit with her. I knew what that word meant and started walking towards her. I told her that I am T/C and she looked so surprised. She told me that I look like a G/C. Even a Cypriot can not tell if a person is G/C or T/C by looking at their faces. We are almost identical.

Cyprus Friendship Program	148542	1	/users/profile/197781	constantina382	General Member of the Public	5	01/26/2013	 I cannot say enough about how amazing the experience was. I was a participant of CFP in 2011, my group visited Portland,OR. Recalling the experience after two years from when my involvement with CFP started, I have created such precious friendships, firstly the one  with my T/C pair, her name is Gizem, the teens I travelled with and all the other teens that I met and became friends with because of CFP.  We were received in a environment of such warmth and love by all the people involved, our host families, our coordinators in Cyprus and the US and every volunteer who did the slightest bit of work to make everything possible, the sentiment that everyone involved put in every activity we did is the real proof of how worthwhile this programme is. Other proof is the fact that no matter how much time passes a CFP  teen will describe the experience of being one with exactly the same enthusiasm everytime. We did peace building work, we got to know each other, we acquired knowledge, had so much fun, traveled to a foreign country where we were taken care of by lovely people with which we exchange emails, skype calls and make plans to visit each other's countries  and we became more sensitive to issues that exist in our life as Cypriots and as people. Through this review I'll take the chance to say thank you to every one who donated a single penny that contributed in getting me on a plane with those people to that place. I hope you see this because I am truly grateful for giving me the chance to live all that I lived through CFP. I now have great people as friends, great relationships tying me to a place so far away, and a much greater view on who I want to be as a person. Thank you, and I hope that anyone considering donating to this programme will make the decision to do it but not just that, watch it grow and stay close to it to see the amazing effects it has on the lives of people. 
Cyprus Friendship Program	148536	2	/users/profile/197775	Orla	Volunteer	5	01/26/2013	I'm a 15 year old Cypriot teenager that participated in the Cyprus Friendship Programme this summer and I have to say it is the best thing that has ever happened to me. The experience is life changing. My partner, Yagmur, and I got along very well and through this special experience got even closer.It is hard to form friendships between teenagers from the two communities because of the society we live in. We are strongly discouraged by many people to even acknowledge the presence of the other community, so CFP is a very special programme.Strong bonds were created between pairs, teenagers and families. For example, my parents and Yagmur's parents have become very good friends through the programme. Apart from that, the two families that hosted us - the Fish family and the Belvin family - are like our other parents. In fact, I am glad to say that one of the families is going to visit us soon! To sum up, I want to say once again what a life changing programme this is, I don't know where I would be without it.

These young people are full of life and love and are willing to open themselves up to new experiences and new people in a foreign country.  They bring fresh insights,  a vibrant culture and a lot of love and joy to our lives.  The more we open ourselves up to sharing time and experiences with these young courageous people and the other families in the program, the more fun we all have together.  The program is a wonderful opportunity for these teens to bond with each other as pairs, with their host families and as a young Cypriot community without borders.  The interpersonal connections they make and  experiences they share, will continue to influence them for years to come.
Cyprus Friendship Program	145426	1	/users/profile/191927	David129	Volunteer	5	11/30/2012	We hosted a couple of boys this past summer. They were a little shy at first, but unfailingly polite. As we got to know them (say, by the second day) we found them to be funny, friendly, intelligent, wry, engaging, always positive and personable.  We also got to see a very human side of them and share their disappointments in, and hopes for, themselves. We really got the feeling that these are individuals who won't be stopped by whatever artificial boundaries have been created on Cyprus between the Turkish Cypriots and the Greek Cypriots.  The organization is beautifully organized and run, doing a thorough job of vetting both the students and the host families, and staying right on top of any issues that may arise. By the end of the stay we felt close to the boys and would love one day to visit them and their families in their country.
Cyprus Friendship Program	144880	1	/users/profile/191429	novahosts	Donor	4	11/30/2012	     We hosted two young men in 2011.  We learned a lot about the Cyprus situation, which was good for us, and our guests learned they had a lot in common (music, grooming, life-goals) as well.  Both were unfailingly polite and appreciative.  Their "Americanization" was sometimes amusing (Orlando, the Grand Canyon, and NYC are not close to each other!), but their very good English ran rings around our limited, tourist Greek and non-existent Turkish!  We still treasure their observations of our lifestyle, particularly regarding how each culture handles extended-family challenges. Through the internet we hear from them occasionally, particularly when world events include Cyprus or our area.  Expanding both our and their worldwide experience is a lasting, wonderful benefit of the CFP.  And, you have to believe it's harder to "hate" after you've spent a month living in the same room with your "enemy".  This is "good deed doing" at the highest level for all involved. (All said and done, we probably spent several hundred dollars being part of the CFP, but truly, it was money so well spent.)
Cyprus Friendship Program	144855	1	/users/profile/191402	Jackb	Volunteer	5	11/30/2012	My wife and i had the wonderful privilege and experience of hosting a pari of Cypriot teens in the Summer of 2011. We were somewhat familiar with Cyprus, in terms of its location and its beauty, but had little knowledge in terms of the protracted conflict and the division of Cypriot people, literally and geographically since 1974. Once understanding the mission of the Cyprus Friendship Programme and our advocacy for youth in having a voice in their future around the world, we saw " a fite" and  we jumped in and became host parents for a month in July of 201l. From our perspective, we not only felt that we were helping these two teens build a relationship that they would take back home with them, but we were literally doing something to promote peace. These two young men are now members of our family as are there families in Cyprus. Upon there return, our two teen boys, on their own convinced there Turkish and Greek Cypriot families to meet together for dinner, which comprised more than thirty people. The evening was filled with talk, sharing food and story and meeting us via Skype, as a laptop was passed to all present for us to meet. These boys are making a difference, their families are now dialoguing with " the other", and we are once again have signed up to be a host family for 2013. Our lives are now more rich and fulfilled as a result!
Cyprus Friendship Program	144825		/users/profile/191368	Kim_67	Volunteer	5	11/30/2012	This was our second year hosting students from Cypres. It has proved to be a fantastic way to work for peace while enjoying the benefits of hosting foreign students in your home. We have children who are just a bit younger than the students we hosted. It was a great experience for our kids to see how teenagers can work to change the world. In choosing peace over hostility, as one Cypriot student put it, "we are the rebels". These Cypriot teens will have a big impact on their country as they work to find peaceful solutions to the thorny social and political issues their two peoples face. In the meantime, we had the pleasure of showing them the area, have interesting conversations, listen to Cypriot music and eat wonderful delicacies that our students brought as gifts. The first year we hosted two boys and the second year we hosted to girls. Both pairs were wonderful and it was interesting getting to know about the Turkish and Greek communities of Cypres from both male and female perspectives.

Volunteer	5	11/29/2012	My husband and I volunteered as hosts for Maria (Greek speaking Cypriot) and Buse (Turkish speaking Cypriot) in July of 2012.  We were impressed with the girls willingness to learn about each other's families and cultures, but also with their ability to truly befriend each other.        I am very impressed with the level of volunteer commitment of everyone involved as host families,  regional coordinators, the executive director and board.  All are volunteers, no paid staff.   I continue to volunteer working on public relations for the group.   Pegg Monahan                                                                \

Volunteer	5	11/29/2012	I am Stavriana, a Greek speaking Cypriot and together with my Turkish speaking Cypriot friend Melisa, we had the great opportunity to spend a month in America and be hosted by an amazing host family. The concept behind this was spending a month on neutral ground and share a room. Based on this idea a strong friendship was developed. We realised that what was connecting the youth of our country was far stronger than what was keeping us apart. Having the chance to explore America together with DiMicelli family was an amazing experience! The fact is that now I know that I have a family in America! Beyond that my family is now very close with Melisa's family and therefore I can say that CFP was really successful in all aspects! "WE ARE NOT FIGHTING EACH OTHER. WE ARE FIGHTING THE MASK OF THE DEVIL WE PAINTED ON EACH OTHER'S FACE"

We had a wonderful time showing them what American life is like and enjoyed taking care of them.  We especially enjoyed having them cook with us and travel to several places together to "show them the sights.

My favorite lesson was how we are all in this together.  They brought their very strong local coffee as a gift.  I asked about the coffee while we were enjoying it one morning. Gizem said "Maria calls it Greek coffee, we call it Turkish coffee, but it is the same."

Cyprus Friendship Program	144000		/users/profile/190459	Hatice E.	Volunteer	5	11/28/2012	I had the opportunity to be hosted by such a perfect family, Dimicelli family. It was an amazing opportunity for me to spend one month away from conflict in Cyprus with my Greek-Speaking Cypriot friend. We shared same room during one month. However, it is not just about sharing a room , we also shared our ideas, opinions, friendship and so on. Each day we found more chance to learn about each other to be able to build a sustainable friendship and peace between us.  During one month in America, we attend workshops and also rope climbing activity with our other friends from Cyprus. I believe that this activities strengthen our trust to each other. I feel lucky that I had chance to attend this program; meet and make friendship with Greek-Speaking Cypriot friends. This program is not just going to America and spent one month with a Greek-Speaking Cypriot friend. Our families also met with each other in Cyprus, came together and spend time. From my experiences with my Greek-Speaking Cypriot friends, I  can clearly see that we dont have that much difference and our cultures are similar to each other. Why we shouldnt united in a country divided!!!! I highly recommend this program to everyone. 
Cyprus Friendship Program	143994	1	/users/profile/74995	Diana	Volunteer	5	11/28/2012	Our family hosted a pair of teens this past summer.  I will be honest that I had trepidation based on friends' experiences with visiting teens in other programs.  My concerns were addressed beautifully by the Cyprus Friendship Program director and we took the leap of faith which resulted in one of the most enjoyable and meaningful experiences my family has ever had.  The teens were amazing people who taught us so much and soaked up the American experience with great respect and enthusiasm.  We stay in touch and I feel that they are a part of our family forever.  This program is brilliantly conceived and thoughtfully executed.  I know it will sustain and continue its success as it is truly a win-win on so many levels for all involved.   Thank you to the founders , administrators and participants for this amazing program.
Cyprus Friendship Program	143948	1	/users/profile/190446	Christina DiMicelli	Volunteer	5	11/28/2012	We hosted 2 teens in 2010 and another pair in 2011.  FANTASTIC experience for our family and for the visiting teens.  We truly feel that our family has expanded & we keep in touch with all the teens.  Coming from opposite sides of conflict in Cyprus, they learn about each other and work towards a future in which both sides come together in peace.   Being a part of this process is humbling as we watched the teens learn about each other and their stories.  Although we were unable to be a part of the program in 2012, we will certainly participate again in the future.  For now we are immensely proud of "our girls" who are all at university, keep in touch with one another, and have plans to meet up again one day!  
Cyprus Friendship Program	143110	1	/users/profile/189539	MRandolph	Volunteer	5	11/27/2012	I had a lovely experience this summer hosting 2 teens from the Cyprus Friendship Program (CFP). The teens participated in many program activities in Cyprus in the months prior to their visit to the US. They studied their nation's history, the issues leading up to the current Cypriot conflict, and types and methods of conflict resolution. They were thus ready to spend 4 weeks in (what is for them) neutral US territory, to build strong friendships with their pairs to take back to Cyprus and use as a foundation for future peace efforts in the island nation. The teens were smart, friendly, ready to try new things, meet new people, and have new experiences. They were thrilled to be in the US, and I was thrilled to show my country to them. It is quite an experience to see your country through someone else's eyes! The 12 teens in our region also got along well as a group, and we host families enjoyed having the kids together. When the group was ready to fly back to Cyprus, there were MANY tears at the airport! These wonderful kids will always be a part of our lives. I would encourage anyone to participate in the CFP.
Cyprus Friendship Program	139943	1	/users/profile/186091	Eugenoula C.	General Member of the Public	5	11/15/2012	My son had the opportunity last year to be hosted by an exceptional family in New Hampshire with a Turkish- speaking Cypriot. The two boys bonded over the month August and learned the values of peaceful co-existence and friendship. My son returned mature and capable of constructing a future without conflict. the program was very well organized and even though i was quite concerned with the idea of my child being away with some strangers for a month, he became close to the host family and gained a lot from their lifestyle.
Cyprus Friendship Program	138554	1	/users/profile/184624	Rosemary W.	Volunteer	5	11/13/2012	Last July, we hosted two teen boys from opposing sides of a National conflict in Cyprus. My family was sad for the time to end. My children will forever be changed by the experience of hearing first hand about what it is like growing up in an a country that requires peacekeeping forces to prevent war.  This coming from boys, the same age as my children, who had just a year or two before they were required to perform military duty for opposite sides of the conflict. Over family meals they shared their feelings of loss and regret, of hope, and of their dreams of the future that sounded almost identical. And when we said goodnight, they returned to their bedroom that they shared and talked some more. I like to think that alone they talked about the shared experience of being so far way from home, of the weird American customs our family had, of the thrill of learning baseball etc.  The point being that I feel the brilliant design of the program worked to promote peace as it was intended to: starting the process of  with teenagers who will be the future leaders of the their shared country.Watching the bond between these to boys grow, gave my family a sense of hope and the sense that in a small way we may have contributed to the larger task of world peace.
Cyprus Friendship Program	135119	1	/users/profile/180987	Stephaneee	Volunteer	5	11/07/2012	As a followup to the program that brought Catholic and Protestant teenagers from Ireland together so successfully, the Cyprus Friendship Program has a similar mission in joining Turkish and Greek-speaking Cypriot teens for a month's experience with host families in the U.S.  Students are selected for the program based on their commitment to peace and promoting the dream of a united Cyprus and for their proficiency in English, the common language among us all.  The Greeks don't understand the Turks, who don't understand the Greeks, and we do not speak either language.  Our students, two marvelous girls from either side of the division were not only skilled English speakers but enthusiastic participants in just about everything that came their way this past summer.  Our time with them was exciting, fun, educational, full of ethnic food and drink, shopping, sightseeing, college talk, and swimming.  They frequently said that it was like "a dream, a fairy tale, a movie" to be in America.  And through the friendship that blossomed with them, our feeling was the same.  We will travel to Cyprus one day to see again, and we continue to encourage them to apply to universities in the United States.  Now we feel we have another family nearly halfway around the world.  What an experience! 
Cyprus Friendship Program	135057	1	/users/profile/180923	Richard43	Volunteer	5	11/07/2012	The Cyprus Friendship Program is a very well run organization - they communicate expectations well and are available for questions along the way.

Cyprus Friendship Program	135021	1	/users/profile/180888	Sage W.	Volunteer	5	11/07/2012	We have been a host family  for this program that brings 2 teens from each side of the divided country of Cyprus (Turkish side and the Greek side) for 2 years.  The goal of the program is for the teens to spend 4 weeks in the USA in a neutral setting where they can connect with each other and realize that they are more alike than not despite their country's political divide.  It has been amazing to share our home with the teens as it brings all the benefits of travel right to our home - while supporting peace making efforts.  What's not to love?! :) The teens are smart, thoughtful and bring an international perspective to our dinner conversation while we get to share our everyday lives with them.  We will stay in touch with our Cyprus teens for years to come!  I highly recommend this program!

Prone-Papillon Rescue of the North East	281389		/users/profile/371435	Writer	Volunteer	5	03/01/2016	Prone has to be the most caring rescue I have ever worked with. As a foster Mom I have always received fast responses to the needs of those in my care. Prone has always listened when I see a dog in need I want to help and allowed me to save them. Together we have saved dogs labeled aggressive or unhealthy, and scheduled for euthinasia. It is an ongoing process, but we have been sucessful in healing,  rehabilitating, and placing these wonderful little gifts from god in wonderful homes.

I applied on line and received a response rather quickly even though they had an enormous amount of inquiries regarding this particular dog.

It took me three years before I could consider another papillon or even look at a picture. Westbrook Animal Shelter recommended contacting PRONE for a Papillon rescue. First, I joined a papillon group on FB and cried looking at all the precious pictures. When I felt ready, I contacted Kelly Arsenault at PRONE. We talked about several options, and after their screening process, I made a selection. I was very excited when I met Kelly in Portsmouth to pick up Teddy. He's been with me for a year now and is so much a part of our family. We have an English Bulldog, Maude, too. I won't say they are best buds...Maude tolerates Teddy and lets him think he is the boss. Teddy is never far from me and I love him. Thai you PRONE!

Prone-Papillon Rescue of the North East	270930	1	/users/profile/359690	Writer	Donor	5	11/03/2015	I first got involved with PRONE after seeing an adoptable dog on their site.  When talking with the volunteers they urged me to consider fostering.  I have a 7 year old Yorkie, Ava, who is very fortunate and we both wanted to share our blessings with a rescue pup.  I soon received a message from Kelly and Linda that when rescuing some darling Poms and Paps from a puppy mill up popped a little Yorkie face.  Everyone believed that this should be my first foster and Izzi headed to Maine.  No surprise, Izzi was a foster "fail" and is now a part of our family.  Since then we have helped to save other dogs for PRONE who have all gone on to happy homes.  There are three PRONE rescues living in Bar Harbor, Maine right now and we hope for many more.  The volunteers at PRONE are all about the dogs, the rescues come first.  I strongly suggest if you are looking for a rescue group to get involved with, check out PRONE.

The Walden School	187551	2	/users/profile/244573	David190	Board Member	5	11/02/2013	I attended the Walden School for 2 years while in my teens, returned later as a faculty member, then for a few years on the Board of Directors, and finally, recently as an adult, I returned once more to attend the first year's session of the Creative Musicians Retreat.  I can say without any doubt that Walden has and remains a positive force in my growth, outlook and world. At Walden, students routinely have life-changing creative experiences, make enduring friendships and participate in unforgettable summers. I consider many of the faculty some of the most accomplished and gifted teachers and musicians I've ever come into contact with. The dedication and intensity of learning at Walden is something one rarely if ever encounters. Over the years the world eventually discovered the school, and it is now a renowned institution. I hope that Walden will continue to change lives the way it changed mine.
The Walden School	185095	1	/users/profile/242046	lladd	Donor	5	10/30/2013	I have watched the Walden School change the lives of countless young adults and teachers alike. It's an amazing experience. 
The Walden School	184968	1	/users/profile/241904	Wesley S.	Client Served	5	10/29/2013	I wish I had spent more time at the Walden School. I attended the Walden School for one year as a 17 year-old, and instantly wished I had discovered the program earlier. Walden offers an innovative, challenging curriculum, while also providing a unique, comfortable atmosphere for kids to be themselves. I made some of my very best friends in one summer - we're still quite close to this day. Although my work with Walden has since been limited, I have never forgotten my summer spent in New Hampshire, nor the inspiration to pursue creativity every day that I discovered there.
The Walden School	184935	1	/users/profile/241870	sdrpolyphony	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/29/2013	I have worked at The Walden School for three years, and every summer has filled me with inspiration. While many other music camps involve competing for orchestra seats or winning awards, Walden is about opening your eyes to what music is and can be about. Students applaud each other's first compositions, sing rounds on the top of mountains, dress up in costumes to demonstrate musicianship drills in an entertaining way, share original songs, and learn how to listen to the sounds in their environment. They collaborate in chorus, play and sing each other's music, and turn everything into musical instruments. There is no other place like it!
The Walden School	184915	1	/users/profile/241849	GB82	Donor	5	10/29/2013	This is a truly great organization offering wonderful opportunities and programs to creative musicians both young and old. 
The Walden School	184871	1	/users/profile/241804	Obanoby	Volunteer	5	10/29/2013	I became a volunteer for The Walden School after my sisters many year of participation. Though I am far from a musician myself, I was inspired by the atmosphere and educational methods. I watched my sister grow from a thirteen year old plunking out her own creations on our piano to a grown adult graduating with a degree in Music Composition from New England Conservatory of Music. Each summer my sister would return home filled with excitement, enthusiasm and a backpack of staff paper.  Volunteering has allowed me to see the organization in action. I have seen the care and detail put into each summer and the top-notch staff make it happen. Each event is full of wonderful musicians, inspiring attitudes and a impressive alumni network. The Walden School fosters creativity, corporation, and, most importantly, a community students will use the rest of their lives.

It is inspiring to watch the young students thrive as the program allows cultivation of creativity while simultaneously urging participants to explore their own creativity. 
The Walden School	183973	1	/users/profile/240890	Alan S	Donor	5	10/29/2013	If I were to list the most formative, impactful activities of my youth, my years at the Junior Conservatory Camp (JCC) in the mid- and late 1960s would be right up at the top. When its foundress, Grace Newsom Cushman, died in 1971, I feared that her unique approach to music pedagogy, emphasizing creativity based on a solid theoretical foundation, along with that summer Shangri-La would soon be lost to the world. Fortunately, three of her protgs  Pamela Quist, David Hogan, and Lynn Hebden  decided to continue the tradition as the Walden School, so that not a summer lapsed. Despite the change in management, name, and location, the philosophy and spirit are the same, and many of the JCC traditions live on. JCC and Walden have produced countless award-winning young composers and have deeply enriched the lives of every student who passes through. The enthusiastic attendance at the periodic alumni reunions testifies to the great impact that this summer experience had, and continues to have, on the lives of young people. Places like Walden are the antidote to much that ails our society. I am thrilled to be closely connected to it and to support it with both time and money.

The Walden School	181540	1	/users/profile/238266	ianmunrobot	Donor	5	10/23/2013	I've been involved with the Walden School for the past six years, first as a participant in its Teacher Training Institute, learning Walden's unique approach to musicianship and music pedagogy. Since then, I have completed all three levels of the Teacher Training course; worked on the staff for the Teacher Training Institute, the Creative Musicians Retreat, and the flagship Young Musicians Program; taught at the Young Musicians Program for four summers; and donated to the student scholarship fund. Walden provides an amazing opportunity for students to not only expand and deepen their understanding of music fundamentals, but also to create their own music in a variety of styles and have it performed by professional musicians and their peers. One of my favorite parts of Walden is that students and faculty live in a very close-knit community, allowing a great exchange of ideas and a chance for students to learn how to work and live together as young adults. I think Walden works hard to maintain a sense of community throughout the year, hosting multiple events for alumni to get together, socialize, and hear each others' music.
The Walden School	181110		/users/profile/237821	Sky M.	Client Served	5	10/22/2013	I have taught at The Walden School Young Musicians Program every summer since 2010. Additionally, I attended Walden's Teacher Training Institute in 2009 and the Creative Musicians Retreat in 2011. The Walden School has helped me find my artistic voice, discover new musical materials, and meet outstanding colleagues, mentors, and friends. Walden has given me composing, teaching, and professional development opportunities that have engendered further success in my career. I have a deep and personal love for both the people of the Walden community and its mission, philosophy, and pedagogical methods. Walden provides its students (and faculty and staff) with a top-notch educational and residential experience and I donate because I want Walden to be able to offer more financial aid so that students of all socioeconomic levels can experience this life-changing organization.
The Walden School	175520		/users/profile/231869	CarrieM	Client Served	5	10/08/2013	The Walden School is an amazing place -- a place where creative people thrive, where musicians connect, where composers are encouraged and supported, where new music is made at every turn, where personal growth is a given, where community is built and lifelong friendships are formed.  For students in the Young Musicians Program and adult students at the Creative Musicians Retreat, the rewards reaped from a season of creative music making are great indeed.  
The Walden School	105195		/users/profile/141215	Steven K.	Client Served	5	01/31/2012	The five weeks I spent at the Walden School in 1974 stand out as one of the most important influences in my life.  For the first time, I realized that there were people who were just as excited about creating and performing music as I was, and were willing to help each other to achieve our goals.  I also appreciated the power of having friends whom I could rely on for sharing personal secrets and encouraging me to pursue my dreams.  Besides being highly knowledgeable, the staff consisted of energetic teachers and mentors.  One fellow was such a major factor in helping me to overcome my natural shyness that I continue to visit him even though he lives in Paris.
The Walden School	99353		/users/profile/119024	Danielle234	Client Served	5	10/16/2011	When I reflect on my greatest influences in life, The Walden School ranks at the top.  There are few places that offer such an intensive education and, beyond this, transformative experience than Walden. I was a student at Walden for 6 years, and in the nearly 20 years since my student years, continue to view Walden as one of the outstanding experiences of life.   I have never encountered an institution that combines such rigorous education with a supportive, inclusive environment.  Walden teaches not only music theory and composition at an advanced level, but inspires a love for the field that, in so many other settings has been lost or tarnished.

I've been working with non-profits professionally for 30 years, and I can say with certainty that Walden delivers a great program, is fiscally healthy and also is very prudent in its budget and expenses. The leadership shown by staff, board and faculty is at the very highest level.
The Walden School	60963		/users/profile/66477	emargolis	Donor	5	01/25/2011	The Walden School manages to create a quality of community every summer that is quite simply unparalleled.  As a donor and member of that community for over ten years, I cannot recommend support of this organization enough.  In a world that feels increasingly disconnected, It is wonderous to know that islands of authentic, supportive community such as the Walden School still exist.  Additionally, I can personally attest to the quality of the musical education offered.  As a student at both the Walden School Young Musicians Program and the Walden School Teacher Training Institute, I gained truly valuable knowledge in numerous areas of instruction covering a broad array of core musical skills that have proved invaluable.  As an appreciator and creator of music, I thank the excellent teachers of the Walden School for imparting an essential framework of fundamental musical concepts that I feel blessed to possess today.
The Walden School	60948		/users/profile/66460	mpff	Client Served	5	01/25/2011	The Walden School is an American musical treasure. I attended this summer camp for young composers in the New Hampshire woods in the late 1980s. I showed up with no previous composition experience and wrote a piece in my first summer that won a California state composition competition and was a runner up in a national competition.  Other summers produced more prize-winning competitions, but the best thing about Walden was the people and the experience.  Friends I made there as an awkward teenager remain some of the best friends of my life.  It's a wonderful family of diverse music lovers.  I've been back to visit in recent years and it's gotten even better.  I never became a serious musician, but I'd love to go back to another summer at Walden.

The role section of the review area needs more options, our children flourished in the pre-school and kindegarten, we have volunteered, made donations knowing it would be appreciated and used thoughtfully, and served on the Board. The early education here is top notch, each child is treated with respect, warmth and caring, and allowed to be themselves - curious, growing individuals. This is a place where not only did my children make friends, so did I. Although it has been several years since they were students there, it is still a place we all like to go to, a place that still comes up in conversation, a place we all feel welcome. I am thankful my children had this foundation, without this grounded beginning, public school would have been even more difficult to navigate. I am thankful for the connections made while at The Orchard School, a vast number of amazing, talented, kind, fun people, both youth and adults that are  always a joy to see.
Orchard School	144054		/users/profile/190549	riverelf77	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/28/2012	I have spent over ten years working in the field of early childhood education and no other school stands out in such an exceptional was as The Orchard School. The children and their families are supported here by a strong, dynamic and caring community that is committed to real people in real time. Three and four year olds develop a strong sense of belonging, ownership, responsibility and respect of self and others. Older children in the summer camp programs are provided with opportunities to expand their communities and sense of respect into other cultures and ways of learning. I cannot speak highly enough of the work this educational community does!

The play based curriculum allows children the opportunity to really enjoy learning which is a wonderful way to start out your educational journey.
Orchard School	143778		/users/profile/190257	StephanieT	Client Served	5	11/28/2012	My daughter was referred to the Orchard School at age 3 for preschool as part of her IEP. Along with receiving speech and OT services as part of her day, she also had the opportunity to interact with her peers and become more comfortable being away from home. Two years later her brother joined the preschool program, and continued through kindergarten. Their preschool and kindergarten years were filled with play, art, creativity, learning, stories, pretend, friends, and plenty of time outdoors in all seasons. Both of my children then graduated on to our nearby town public school for the elementary grades. Finishing the day programs at the Orchard School did not end our connection to them, however, They continued on with the summer camp programs that they had started attending in preschool. Over the years, they have grown up through the levels of the summer camp, from preschool Stars, to young elementary Suns, to themed weekly camps, and now to counselors in training! Over the years they have learned songs, crafts, drumming, comics, photography, rocket launching, swimming, woods and farm exploration, cooperating and sharing with others, cooking from the farm, and so much more. My daughter, who is now 14,  had her first counselor in training experience last summer with the elementary age drumming and mask making camp. The lead counselor told me at the end of camp that my daughter really found her voice during that week. She said, "At the beginning of the week she seemed shy and not sure what to do. By the end of the week she could look around, see what needed to happen, and took it upon herself to do what needed to be done." It was a tremendously proud moment for me! For the past several years, my two children (my son is now 13) have also participated in the after school Farmers and Foragers program. They have learned so much about farming, animal care, building, cooking, being in the forest, sustainability, care for the environment, and working to understand the greater earth systems that connect everything together. I have learned so much from them on our rides home on Monday afternoons when they share their adventures from the day. I cannot thank the Orchard School and the greater Orchard Hill community for the care, support and opportunities for learning and growing that they shared with our family. We are so lucky to be so close to this incredible organization.

When we came for our first visit I felt so overjoyed and relieved that a school like this exists that I actually cried.  We have been involved with The Orchard School for the past four years and in that time I have come to realize just how valuable this school is to families in our community.  This school that is intentionally focused on developmentally appropriate, nature based, and community oriented programming is unique and critical to the children and families it serves.   The school strengthens our community by creating community around the children.  This is a place where children thrive, and families grow.

Orchard School	139270		/users/profile/185374	Kellie G.	Volunteer	5	11/14/2012	During my junior year at Keene State College I was assigned to do my internship at The Orchard School.  I have never seen a better preschool program.  The staff and children were so inviting and I could't have been placed at a better place to learn and grow.  I decided to stay and work as a teacher during their summer camp. The summer camp allowed me to meet new children and make friends with staff that I know will be with me for the rest of my life. The Orchard School is the family I do not have in New Hampshire.  Whenever I have needed anything or wanted a smile on my face I have gone there and seen the staff and children.  During my time there I have seen inclusion at it's best.  Children can truly be children there and disabilities never get in the way.  Because of The Orchard School I decided to go on and get my Masters in Special Education.  I wanted to be as great of a teacher and mentor as their staff.  I know that The Orchard School will always be there for me and I will always keep them as a part of my life.  I would recommend their program to all families and encourage people to really look into their program because there is something there that fits every family and child's needs and strengths.

Womenstrust Inc	52480		/users/profile/53405	tami2	Volunteer	5	09/15/2010	Volunteering for WomensTrust truly made an impact on my life. I never thought Id travel to a far off country and be so profoundly moved and inspired. Meeting such wonderfully strong-willed, determined women and girls has left me with a sense of being involved in an organization thats moving forward with great strides for the progress of the community. Thanks to WomensTrust, my first hand experience in Pokuase, Ghana, gave me a once in a lifetime opportunity!I offered my services as a graphic designer, a social media enthusiastic and a photographer. Using my Twitter handle, @TamiFromMiami, I spread the word about WomensTrust. To gain hype in the social media realm, I used the hashtag #GoingGhana. Talking up my future trip with the organization, created a steady chatter, along with new followers for the their twitter account, @WomensTrust, and additional fans to their Facebook page.I couldnt wait to meet the people and all the wonderful staff members of WomensTrust in Pokuase, Ghana! The first person I met was Peggy Roy. Shes apart of G.E.E.C. and received a scholarship to continue her education in the states. Each staff member had their own unique way of providing a positive atmosphere for getting the job done. After meeting the staff, I knew Pokuase was lucky to have a dedicated team who were willing to go the extra mile to help.I also spent time with the educational side of WomensTrust. The after-school computer class provided a further opportunity for girls to expand their knowledge. I also got a chance to sit in on G.E.E.C and was equally impressed. They attend these classes every weekend, and go to better themselves in school.Returning home, a more refreshed and rejuvenated person, I was moved by the many strong and independent women and girls Id met there. This furthered my ideology that helping just one person can go a long way. One WomensTrust loan helps a mothers business improve. One donated laptop helps a girl succeed in education. One teacher volunteering on the weekends helps girls do better and stay in school. I came back with an even bigger question, what more can I do to help? One thing I know for sure, WomensTrust is a significant factor in what is helping that community grow, and I wish them further success.
Womenstrust Inc	43054	8	/users/profile/43817	mo2	Donor	5	06/05/2010	WomensTrust meets my desire to invest in microfinance initiatives for poor women in Ghana, one of Africa's most promising democraices.My philanthropy budget is very limited so it is important for me that any organization I give to is able to provide  solid evidence of accomplishment. WomensTrust has consistently impressed me with their communications to donors and the level of detail they provide on the small loans - and basic business skills - they extend to women that then allow them and their families to rise above bare subsistence for the first time in their lives through such enterprises as baking, textile sales, food kiosks etc. I am also pleased they cover school fees for many girls who otherwise would not be educated in Africa's male-oriented society.
Womenstrust Inc	42909	10	/users/profile/43651	susieq2	Donor	5	06/03/2010	Why I Give To WT:I am a person of modest means with a huge philanthropic spirit. A small donation to WomensTrust guarantees an enormously positive impact on the lives of others. In addition to that guarantee, I give to WomesTrust because I know the founder and her staff. In our small NH town, we all are very proud of their work. Dana and WT keeps our community connected to the world through this work. Knowing that my small, regular donation helps my fellow community members to live their mission is worth every penny. And I know this because Dana and her staff are real people, involved in our town, and willing to tell the story of their projects in Ghana to any audience.With my donations I know that a woman in Pokuase whom I may never meet will be able to set goals and achieve them, in turn changing her life and her community.
Womenstrust Inc	42417	10	/users/profile/43132	tbloch	Volunteer	5	06/01/2010	From the first that I've heard about WomensTrust, I have only been highly impressed. Locally, the organization enjoys an enormously good reputation. I heard about them through various friends and acquaintances in the area, all of whom were so complimentary of not only their cause but of their staff as well. While their cause is obviously a worthwhile one, I can tell you from personal experience that their staff is energetic, competent, and committed to realizing that cause. I look forward to continuing to be involved with this great organization for as long as I am able to, and I urge others to get involved as well.
Womenstrust Inc	42066	15	/users/profile/42814	marlis	Board Member	4	05/30/2010	I have known about WomensTrust since its founding and while I had always respected the mission, I didn't get deeply involved until 2006 when I first went to Pokuase, Ghana.   By spending time on the ground, I began to fully appreciate the challenges of the women in the town and the value of our programs in helping them rise above the limitations of poverty and lack of education.  WomensTrust has allowed hard-working, resourceful, determined women to see possibilities for improving themselves that they had never imagined.  And one "success" leads to another as they gain confidence that change is possible.  WomensTrust offers a hand-up instead of a hand-out, engaging each client as a partner, so that both parties have responsibilities and rights.  The process thus engenders pride and renewed commitment on all sides, as goals are met and progress is achieved.
Womenstrust Inc	41802	16	/users/profile/42595	erica5	Volunteer	5	05/29/2010	One of the best things about WomensTrust is what drew me to it--its American headquarters are a few doors down from mine in a small New Hampshire town.  This truly wonderful venture, which has made a real, quantifiable difference in Pokuase, is an enterprise that could be replicated by any number of motivated, far-sighted Americans.  By focusing on one village, by enabling the people of that one village to do what it is that they want to do, by hand-picking staff, volunteers, interns, and other supporters, and by sheer guts, Dana and the engine that is WomensTrust have done incredible things--both as an international aid program (Economist Bill Easterly says: "WomensTrust is probably the best project I've seen in Africa.") and as a model of how others can create effective aid projects.I also love the resolve of WomensTrust to stick with Pokuase.  Instead of doing a small bit in a number of villages, WT continues to show its committment to the village where they started--now by building a community center that will house among other things, a computer lab and meeting space for the villages many new entrepreneurs.  Finally, it has become clear to me through time spent with WT staffers that WT does its research and is smart and deliberate about its choices and actions.  Its early and continued focus on women and girls, on being "bottom up" and asking the people of Pokuase how they could help, and on providing loans to women and scholarships to girls according to a fair and structured way are all key components of highly rated and highly successful aid programs today--yet WomensTrust has been doing it this way for seven years.
Womenstrust Inc	41626	13	/users/profile/42431	pm	Donor	5	05/28/2010	I have been a donor since Women's Trust inception. Because I live and work in the same small town that Women's Trust is located I have had the good fortune to know and become friends with the founder and the staff. I can see the success that this small non-profit has had in the lives of the women and families in Poukwasi, Ghana. I know how hard working and committed the small staff is to the founder's original vision of women helping women thru microlending. I have seen the vision grow to the fields of health and education but stay within the scale of the possible. I know first hand that operating expenses are kept tight. And I have seen how one woman, Dana Dakin, has grown by  plunging in and starting this non-profit with the idea that  it was her time to Give Back.
Womenstrust Inc	41518	9	/users/profile/42331	hannahd0220	Volunteer	5	05/28/2010	I've been intimately involved with WomensTrust since 2007. What I appreciate most about the organization, besides the obvious impact that they're creating with their microlending program, is their constant desire to move forward, to strengthen themselves, to improve. WomensTrust is exploratory in both their work and in their goals, searching for innovative and sustainable solutions; they don't just follow the crowd. And the staff in both Ghana and the US are committed to helping make change.
Womenstrust Inc	41175	8	/users/profile/42051	slm	Volunteer	5	05/27/2010	Around the time Dana launched WomensTrust with proceeds from the sale of a used car, I grew interested in a program highly focused on improving the lives of women and girls in single African village: Pokuase, Ghana. Ive stayed in touch as time has passed, with a big leap this year. In contrast with bubbling controversy over misspent aid and the way big banks have horned in on micro financing for the wrong reasons, WomensTrust sets a lofty standard. Micro finance forms just the base of a community-building program that now encompasses scholarships that keep girls in high school, computer training, new room added to a public school and a resource center - and thats not the whole list. WomensTrust is helping Pokuase villagers escape poverty and I welcome a chance to assist this outstanding, humble effort. It's not just my opinion that WomensTrust has something special going. Ask economist Bill Easterly, a tough critic of aid programs. He calls WomensTrust a rare blueprint for the right way to fight poverty in Africa.
Womenstrust Inc	41110	8	/users/profile/41945	jhm	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/27/2010	I have supported WomensTrust since learning about it over 5 years ago. I had met Mohammad Yunus at the Beijing Women's Conference '95 and was impressed that Womenstrust was successfully using the Grameen model for microlending in Ghana. And I was specially struck by the way they were building from that base to integrate education and health care issues into their outreach in the community of Pokuase. As a Rotarian and as a grants writer, I saw ways to help WomensTrust meet its humanitarian mission through grants from Rotary, which has a strong international mission. Our Rotary club has provided grants for a generator to keep their databases accessible during frequest power outages, supplemental vitamins with iron for pregnant women with anemia and high blood pressure, textbooks and computers for a support program for their scholarship students armed at keeping girls in school. I recently spent three weeks in Ghana as a volunteer with WomensTrust working with the founder, Dana Dakin, and others to assess the educational and health needs of the community and develop further strategies with input from local leaders for addressing those needs. I have seen what this organization has done--- and will continue to do---to make a difference in people's lives and I strongly support it with both my time and treasure.
Womenstrust Inc	41030	8	/users/profile/41930	lynnk0809	Donor	5	05/27/2010	Micro finance became a passion for me ignited when I heard for the first time, Dana Dakin, founder of WomensTrust, tell the story of how and why she started this now successful, growing micro-finance organization in Ghana. It changed forever how I looked at charitable giving.  Realizing that many times I had not given anything because I felt I couldnt give enough, I became a firm believer that no amount of money, or effort, is too little. I believe that every act of kindness or generosity leaves a positive seed from which other good deeds will blossom. The garden created by Dana and WomensTrust will flourish and bring happiness to many for years to come.
Womenstrust Inc	41018	8	/users/profile/41918	yogini-nan	Donor	5	05/27/2010	I believe that most women are smart, capable and care for their families and the planet.  Womenstrust helps Ghanian women earn their livlihood thru micro loans; helps educate girls, and provides health care.  It is an "on the ground" organization;  Womenstrust staff, interns and volunteers work in Ghana with their clients; stay in modest lodgings, and understand the mission.  Women who receive micro loans pay them back!  This is empowerment, not charity.
Womenstrust Inc	40850	8	/users/profile/41739	mary221	Former staff	4	05/26/2010	I had not heard of microlending before coming to work for WomensTrust. The idea of helping women help themselves is a fabulous idea. The addition of health services and education makes the program a complete recipe for success.If the world is going to be changed, women will be the movers and shakers. Because we are living in a global world, we have to think about supporting women in other nations who need our help to overcome poverty. WomensTrust is doing just that.
Womenstrust Inc	40763	8	/users/profile/41658	mutabilis2	Donor	5	05/26/2010	I support WomensTrust for two reasons: the first is because it was started by a woman, Dana Dakin, who I have known for a "scary" 50 years, who I admire and like and whose judgement I trust.   The second reason is the program itself.  WomensTrust is about the women....it is only as successful as the women who it loans to and helps. Supporting WomensTrust is my way of helping to facilitate economic change for women in Ghana which becomes a building block for aiding women worldwide.
Womenstrust Inc	40220	8	/users/profile/41141	bw	Donor	5	05/24/2010	Womens Trust is an inspiration! Its programs are pulling enterprising women out of poverty, keeping girls in school, and giving villagers life-saving information about AIDS, malaria, diabetes, and high blood pressure.  When you make a donation, you know it isnt disappearing into layers of bureaucracy, but going straight to work to make a huge difference in individual lives. The "before and after" photos tell the story of a village being transformed. Women have turned modest pushcarts into permanent stores; office headquarters have been built, and an addition put on the local school.
Womenstrust Inc	39531	9	/users/profile/40486	lindy2	Volunteer	5	05/19/2010	WomensTrust Inc is a wonderful but barebones organization.  Staff are pressed for time. I was able to see a need to celebrate a recent cash award given to the founder by another women's organization in NYC.  I showed up with pen and pad and pressed the staff for details.  Kristen Ash, WT's well organized administrator, gave me valuable background material and a copy of the founder's speech upon accepting the award, I contacted another volunteer who is a gifted writer to compose the press release, and got help with a photo to accompany it. I used my contact list to insure publishing success with followup calls and emails.  Low and behold, free publicity was the result.

The island works at improving sustainability, and generates all of its own power, produces its own drinking water and treats its own sewage.  
Star Island Corporation	193037	1	/users/profile/252119	billgilesstar	Volunteer	5	01/23/2014	We started going to Star Island 33 years ago and found it our spirits home. It is a magical place about 10 miles off the coast of Rye and Portsmouth, NH. It is one of the Isles of Shoals part of which is in NH and part in ME. there used to be a fishing village here and some of the buildings remain including the chapel. A hotel with a large porch and lots of rocking chairs overlook the harbor and views back to the mainland. It is now a vibrant conference center with a variety of conferences every summer. We have attended one of two weeks that are set aside every summer for UCC family and youth conferences.  There are many activities you can participate in every day or you can just relax on the porch or explore the Island. A wonderful staff sees to all of your needs and I am particularly impressed with the Islands efforts to go green.

Our children at the time were 14 and 5.  It is the one place I must go to at least once every summer.  I go to intentionally develop my spirituality and deepen friendships with other conferees.  It is one of two organizations to which we give most of our charitable gift money.
Star Island Corporation	191157	1	/users/profile/249535	jnbush	Board Member	5	12/18/2013	Star is a charming place with rustic living accommodations.  If you looking for a stunning views, interesting discussions on a variety of subject matters and great programs for kids in a liberal environment, this is the place for you. My wife and I were married in the lovely chapel on the island.  We have been coming back ever since.

I am also a former employee/citizen of this place.  It is hard to put into words what draws people to Star Island because the pull is different for everyone....the environment, the people, the peace, the music, the fellowship, the rest and restoration...  I believe that Star Island is on the cusp of a real renaissance with the leadership team that's in place....these folks, as well as all of us who hold Star dear, are real stewards and caretakers of this tiny place that is so huge to so many.  Star Island is in my bones and my heart.
Star Island Corporation	189146	1	/users/profile/246897	NickD	Board Member	5	11/23/2013	I first came to Star Island eleven years ago at the invitation of friends to attend the International Affairs Conference.  As a new shoaler I was quite taken with the beauty of the island and very impressed with the friendly, intellegent, and compassionate persons that I met.  I have returned to Star Island each summer to enjoy the beauty of the island, the simple living, the chance to disconnect from the modern pace of life and recharge my spirit, and the intelletual and creative stimulus of International Affairs. I have volunteered in support of International Affairs, served on the International Affairs Committee, Chaired International Affairs one summer and served on Star Island's Facilities Committee and its Board.  Throughout my years of working with shoalers and island staff I have met and worked with a great number of dedicated persons who strongly believe in the island mission and is positive role in our society.  I would encourage you to check out Star Island and its shoalers to see why this is a truely unique community.
Star Island Corporation	189129	1	/users/profile/246876	Deborah83	Board Member	5	11/23/2013	We first came to Star with a two year old and two teenagers.  We were looking for a family vacation where our multi-age group family could be together yet spend some time enjoying things on their own.  It's been twenty years now and we cannot imagine a summer without Star.  It is a magical place, a place that meets us wherever we are each year, a place that all three of my children call their "spirit's home".   I can not imagine a better gift to give your child than a trip to Star Island.

Star Island Corporation	188488	1	/users/profile/245964	Sharon102	Board Member	5	11/13/2013	My family and I have been going to conferences on Star Island since 1982; we all love it and go back every summer. We get our fill of fun, relaxing, renewal, friends, natural beauty, workshops, speakers, and a total change from our over-connected, over-scheduled lives. The community of people who work and play there is one we have come to treasure year round; we are already thinking about next summer. We all try to contribute in some way to ensure that Star Island is there for our children and grandchildren, financially and/or by volunteering our time and expertise on a committee, or on island reweaving a chair seat.
Star Island Corporation	188459	2	/users/profile/245923	Diane99	Volunteer	5	11/13/2013	I have been both a staff member and a volunteer for the Star Island Corporation. My first trip to the island was in 1975; I then returned from 1976-1979 and 1997-2001 as a member of the staff. Since 2002 I have been a volunteer in a number of ways. So, why do I volunteer? I can't write big checks for the island, but I can help control costs by being a volunteer. The island has given me many gifts by teaching me how to be an adult, a worker and a member of a community. The icing on the cake is that I have received this gift at the most amazing location in the world!
Seacoast Outright	314159		/users/profile/405523	Aiyana D.	Client Served	5	10/25/2016	Seacoast Outright is an amazing nonprofit organization that teaches and supports not only the youth, but also the facilitators and the public. They make everyone who comes to the Friday night meetings feel welcome and safe to share as much or as little as they feel comfortable. The facilitators also keep materials handy for educational purposes,  such as sexuality and gender identity, STD safety/prevention, and birth control, not to be used during meetings of course.  Seacoast Outright is awesome and I can think of no better group for the job.

If I knew I had a choice and would be supported, I would have lived life differently. Seacoast offers that support and network to youth  so that you are not alone in their journey. As part of this non-profit I am glad to be able to give back and let all the youth struggling with self-acceptance know that they have a choice and they are worth it!

As a Seacoast Outright facilitator, I am thrilled to be a part of this amazing organization. It brings me great joy to see the camaraderie of the youth in the weekly meetings. To have a safe space to share openly their thoughts, visions, struggles, hopes, humor, pain, dreams, laughter... and much more... is very much needed for our youth.

Adult groups are not an option for teens, and our non hetero confonforming kids have questions and needs! We know LBGTQ+ youth are at risk without support- Seacoast Outright is offering  free, accessible, friendly, adult supervised, safe  activities to be part of the solution. It is one of a kind in the area filling the void with just the right tone.  Outright  provides a safe, supportive gathering spot every week that our young people seek and deserve. Dedicated adults facilitate groups for teens to explore  gender and sexulaity issues in a comfortable, safe, non judgemental way.  .  Well done Seacoast Outright!

Global Grassroots	125785		/users/profile/170975	B123	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/16/2012	Global Grassroots should serve as an example of how development work should be done.  Their programs teach and inspire all of us that have worked in the development field.  Thanks for your great work. 
Global Grassroots	39627	2	/users/profile/40575	Maria Spoon	Volunteer	5	05/20/2010	As part of a masters program I recently spent two months in Rwanda during which time I talked with, interviewed and observed many organizations, both local and international, working on improving every area of life for the Rwandese people.  I was deeply inspired and impressed when I learned about the work Global Grassroots is doing to educate and empower women to become their own powerful social change agents.  Whereas I became leery of the charity-oriented mentality of many other international organizations working in Rwanda (and doubtful about the effectiveness of the actual work on the ground) a closer look at Global Grassroots offered an example of positive work from a paradigm I can stand firmly behind. You can read about the organizations firm beliefs about the paramount necessity of the conscious piece of social change, and their other ideals on their website.  I want to tell you what I saw on the ground.  Picture a market, bustling daily with the everyday commerce of mostly women selling vegetables, cloth, offering their seamstress services.  In the corner of the market, every afternoon from 3:30-5:30, a small door opens up and market sellers and other village women shuffle in for their daily lessons in literacy organized by their other friends from the village.  The literacy skills the women gain empower them to be more assertive in their households, make better decisions for their families, and be more engaged in society.  The same women have gotten together to learn math skills so that they can run their market businesses better.  This is progress - for women, by women, sustained by the community.  When the literacy class files out the classroom becomes a stage for another womans project.  She is also a graduate of the Global Grassroots Academy of Conscious Change and is creating community theatre as a way to initiate community discussions about gender roles.  The classroom is packed deep with people observing skits depicting different common interactions between women and men.  Amongst the riots of laughter generated, there are also important dialogues starting and seeds being planted to show women and men another way to be in their village.  Truly inspired by all of this I observed on the ground, I contacted the director of Global Grassroots to see how I could be involved.  What developed was a project in which I got to explore my own passions- alternative healing techniques- in conjunction with helping Global Grassroots get a sense of the alternative healing field in Rwanda.  By both the in-country coordinator, and the director who was busy working in other parts of the world, I have never felt more supported and empowered as I embarked on this journey to explore some of the inner healing work happening in Rwanda.  Global Grassroots need for research before starting any new project paralleled the papers I was writing in graduate school about culturally appropriate and sustainable international development work.  Again and again I saw Global Grassroots investing its energy and resources into carrying out their intentions for sustainable, proactively conscious work that empowers the local community and builds the capacity among women to change their own lives.   It has been a gift to discover the commitment, passion, and intentionality behind the work Global Grassroots in doing in Rwanda.  My desire to be continue to be involved in international development work is renewed as long as I can work for organizations like this one.
Global Grassroots	38670	1	/users/profile/39561	lthomas	Former staff	5	05/12/2010	Gretchen Wallace graciously reached out to allow our organization to begin as a project of her group. Our mission fit perfectly into their work on advocacy around genocide and it was a wonderful way to be nurtured in a very professionally run organization. Her thoughtful management style and highly ethical practices raise the bar for all who come into contact with her.
Global Grassroots	38669	5	/users/profile/39559	ed-s	Donor	5	05/12/2010	Even as an observer and contributor, I have been amazed by the level of energy that Global Grassroots pours into every project.  This is an organization that goes far beyond trying to treat the symptoms of social ills, and instead focuses on education to enact fundamental change.  From teaching basic business practices to women in Rwanda to providing stress management classes in Haiti, Global Grassroots cultivates a spirit of social entrepreneurship to, quite simply, make people's lives better.
Global Grassroots	38630	5	/users/profile/39514	jiwells	Donor	5	05/11/2010	I have been a donor to Global Grassroots for several years and have had the opportunity to travel abroad to see their Conscious Change Academy in action in Rwanda. Their work in Rwanda was impressive to behold: the women served had created real change in their lives. The work of Global Grassroots seeks to help women solve problems they have themselves identified in their communities: they fulfill the promise of change for the women they serve and they do so through the model of empowerment. Global Grassroots is a small, but supremely well-run and effective charity. I am convinced of the integrity of their work and their personnel.
Global Grassroots	38605	4	/users/profile/39488	mcollum	Volunteer	5	05/11/2010	Global Grassroots is one of the greatest champions of people in developing nations. Their impact is multifaceted in training women to become agents of social change, aiding in the development of social change and supplying the funds necessary to implement the social change. One of the greatest aspects of GG is that its work focuses on the empowerment of the social change agent by creating a network of support, multidimensional training and friendship. Having worked with GG in Rwanda the summer of 2009, I have witnessed first hand the impact of GG on the ground. The empowerment it gives  to individuals and communities is truly impressive.  There are not enough words of praise for Gretchen Wallace and the organization she has created.
Global Grassroots	38590	8	/users/profile/39471	becky5	Volunteer	5	05/11/2010	Gretchen Wallace has been a fantastic boss and mentor. The way she runs the Global Grassroots office is how she runs the organization-- with the vision of a true leader, and with an open heart. Her passion for the projects established by the graduates of the Academy for Conscience Change is truly inspirational, and her unflagging enthusiasm and commitment to constantly improve the organization is a quality that every change agent in this world should strive for. Gretchen is a wonderful listener, and that comes across both in her interactions with people and in the success of Global Grassroots. If someone offers a suggestion to improve the organization-- regardless of whether it's an established board member, an illiterate woman in Rwanda, or a student intern-- she always seriously considers the feedback. This collaborative spirit, willingness to learn from others, and openness to (societal, organizational, and personal) transformation has permeated the organization and is at its core. My personal experience with the organization has been extremely positive. I have interned with Global Grassroots for nearly a year, and I feel very fortunate to work with a team that has visible impact in people's lives.
Global Grassroots	38571	9	/users/profile/39455	b2	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/11/2010	I have been tracking GG since it's beginning.  It is an amazing organization that helps people in the right way.  It teaches Women and Men to be self sufficient and how they can help themselves.  They gain necessary skills to help entire communities.  Gretchen does this  work in a unique way.  She is trying to work herself out of a job instead of continuing to hand out aid and make populations aid dependent.  She is most definitely part of the solution.

Global Grassroots	38553	10	/users/profile/39431	lydia2	Former Volunteer	5	05/11/2010	The summer of 2009, I worked with Gretchen Steidle Wallace, founder of Global Grassroots, to evaluate the impact this wonderful organization had made in the lives of thousands of Rwandan women and men through its work in finding and developing social change agents.  I was deeply touched by the courage of Global Grassroots leadership, the integrity of the Global Grassroots curriculum, and the dedication, heart, and spirit of the many community leaders Gretchen and her team found in urban and rural Rwanda.  In two short months, I watched as Global Grassroots supported these leaders social start-ups, encouraging them to grown into beautiful operations that touched on a diverse range of issues from literacy to domestic violence.  Many were well on their way to sustainability, some were in the process of learning how to keep their organization afloat while meeting their social mission, and others were just starting to carve out their dreams.  No matter what the stage, Gretchen and her team always found the right way of giving these new community leaders the necessary tools, resources, and encouragement for success.  I cannot wait to see the impact Global Grassroots will have in Rwanda 10 years from now!

Nashua Center	161594		/users/profile/214341	E81983	Volunteer	5	06/27/2013	I fell in love with Nashua Center in 2010 at their Annual "Taste of the Towns" Fundraising event. I was new to NH & expressed an interest in getting involved w/the community, so a friend introduced me & I became a volunteer about 1 month prior to the event.  Everyone I met was pretty terrific from the start, but it was the presentation given at the event by Exec Dir - Brian Young that touched my heart, made me cry (along w/hundreds of other grown men & women sitting in the crowd that night) & ultimately reinforced that I found a very cool place to spend my time. Brian told a story about how a Dr of a local hospital was outraged when he learned that one of his sick patients did not have a DNR "Do Not Resuscitate" attached to their record. This was a young woman, who wasn't terminally ill, why on earth would she have a DNR?! The answer was simply b/c she was born with disabilities. That's all. The Dr who was suppose to treat her & help her feel better, publicly expressed his dismay for her disability! He felt that b/c she required a helping hand to accomplish her daily tasks, she was nothing more than a drain on society & shouldn't be given the dignity of life.  It was 2010, not 1950!  It was truly eye-opening!   Nashua Center educates the community about the value all people are able to make in the world. The person is seen first & the disability second. Every staff member I've met lives this philosophy & it's refreshing to be among people who treat other people with REAL dignity. I highly recommend everyone get to know this organization.

Nashua Center	141512	1	/users/profile/187850	mikebnh	Board Member	5	11/20/2012	I had experience with the Nashua Center in a casual relationship for several years. Friends I knew were involved with the Center for years and invited me to local events (annual Taste of the Town, and Golf tournaments). Because of my very intensive global travel schedule, i could not seem to make time to do more, or be involved more. That is until i met the clients and employees of the center. I could not conceive, of this much compassion and professionalism blended so seamlessly into a service organization, and yet here it was. Men and women working above and beyond the scope of their respective job descriptions to provide the finest quality service of its kind. Then there is the clients, happy, productive and alive! It is clear that the cooperation between the clients and the Nashua Center produces a quality of life for each that elevates the community around it. I asked for the privilege of serving the clients on the Board of Directors and Immediately upgraded our contribution investment with the center. The Nashua Center is not the hope of making life better for human society they are the promise!

QED Foundation Inc	317821		/users/profile/408955	keithlorencarter	General Member of the Public	5	10/31/2016	Over the last ten years I have watched QED educate students and make a positive difference in their lives, providing them with an environment of discovery and learning that best prepares them not only for their future careers, but also for leadership roles in our society. It has been wonderful the transformation of children into young men and women who are ready to go out and tackle the problems of our society.  Kim Carter has assembled a talented and dedicated group of educators and staff who are dedicated to creating a dynamic and challenging learning experience for all students, no matter what their abilities, interests, or backgrounds.
QED Foundation Inc	317798	1	/users/profile/408933	Melinda35	General Member of the Public	5	10/31/2016	QED's vision is one that should be widespread. Embracing each individual for their unique skills and creating student-focused collaborative learning are things that we desperately need more of in American education. Thank you for leading by stupendous example.
QED Foundation Inc	317772	1	/users/profile/408907	Marcea G.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/31/2016	I have worked with the people from QED for many years and am always amazed at the depth of knowledge they have, and their ability to synthesize the most current pieces of research and transfer that synthesis of understanding into manageable practice for schools.  I've never met more knowledgeable educators in my 30 years as an educator.
QED Foundation Inc	317216	2	/users/profile/408392	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/31/2016	I've worked with Q.E.D. on various aspects of developing extended learning opportunities (ELOs) in New Hampshire high schools for several years. They have a deep understanding of both the philosophical underpinnings and practical realities of ELOs. They are big thinkers and I greatly value their perspective in both project planning and project evaluation meetings. Their particular gift is to haul conversations out of the weeds and remind a group of original intents, long term transformative goals, and sometimes, useful reframing of an issue. They have a vast bag of strategies and tools, and an unflagging passion for student learning. We also collaborated (Keene State College and Q.E.D.) on an ELO reference website and they were very generous in sharing all the tools they'd developed over time.

QED Foundation Inc	314077	3	/users/profile/405435	sdreyerleon	Board Member	5	10/24/2016	The New Hampshire-based QED foundation is quietly in the process of building the next revolution in American education. QED  and their powerful demonstration schools (Making Community Connections ) are realizing the full potential of democratic, learner centered, and community-based education.   In this age of test-prep and scripted curriculum, QED is a breath of fresh air.   The U.S desperately needs outstanding models for 21st century progressive schools and QED is leading the way.  QED is also at the forefront of applying the principles of neurodiversity to help every student construct an educational experience that is tailored to their real learning needs and designed to help them work from their strengths to address their challenges.  From their remarkable Learner Sketch Tool to the more in-depth training of  the Neurodevelopmental Framework for Learning,  QED is focused on a student's passions and assets which are then leveraged to help them address areas of challenge that may be preventing them from reaching their highest potential.  
QED Foundation Inc	313151	3	/users/profile/404522	Erin122	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/21/2016	The director of QED, Kim Carter, has helped move our district, in California, forward in the area of Competency-Based Learning.

QED Foundation Inc	313093	3	/users/profile/404466	Writer	Client Served	5	10/21/2016	QED is a remarkable organization! If it weren't for QED and the wisdom of Kim Carter and Elizabeth Cardine, I could have never started the Expanded Learning Opportunities program at Central Falls High School in Rhode Island.

QED Foundation Inc	312967	4	/users/profile/404337	JasonFlom	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/21/2016	I first became aware of the work of QED in the summer of 2010 at an education leadership conference where I met Kim Carter, the founder and executive director. Since then, I've had opportunities to collaborate with them on projects that range from learner variability to school transformation to technology platforms. Throughout this work is a mission that informs everything they do. The term transformational learning, isn't one that they just throw around -- it is central to how they approach problems of practice. This is true at every scope and scale of their work. District wide organizational challenges? Check. Classroom practices? Check. Professional learning programs for teachers and education leaders? Check. Digital platform to empower students and teachers alike? Check. And because they have built and run schools from the ground up, transformed existing programs, and collaborated with numerous other organizations, they have the experience to inform their processes. Words I might use to describe Kim and QED? Dynamic. Strategic. Intellectually curious. Empowering. Learner and learning focused. Thoughtful. Dedicated. And, at the heart of it all, compassionate.

Moose Mountains Regional Greenways	109791		/users/profile/36160	steve-panish	Board Member	5	04/12/2012	Moose Mountains Regional Greenways is a grassroots organization founded and maintained by citizens dedicated to maintaining the rural character of the southern lakes region of NH.  It has a unique model of aiding landowners who are interested in preserving their land.  I was one of the founding members in 1999.   Shortly after being founded , we succesfully obtained a Forest Legacy grant which initiated the preservation of 2000 acres of the eponymous Moose Mountains.  This was a difficult process with many obstacles.  Since then we have helped to place over 2000 additional acres under conservation easement, and presented many educational programs with conservation-based themes.  MMRG is powered by dedicated and energetic volunteers and a small staff, but it can always use more involvement at every level.  We particularly would like to attract youthful members and volunteers to carry on the effort.
Moose Mountains Regional Greenways	109763		/users/profile/149529	afslocumjr	Board Member	5	04/12/2012	Moose Mountains Regional Greenways is a wonderful land conservation and enviromental organization that serves seven towns in east central New Hampshire.  In just 10 years they have conserved over 4000 acres created wildlife corridors, preserved water quality, educated landowners on proper land management and educated young and old on the environment around them.  They host the annual Woods Water & Wildlife Festival that is great fun for the local families while it helps educate people on how to take care of their areas.  
Moose Mountains Regional Greenways	109759		/users/profile/149524	joycee	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/12/2012	I'm always amazed by how much this small, regional land conservation organization accomplishes with such limited resources.

Families First of the Greater Seacoast	291464	1	/users/profile/381887	CPrien	General Member of the Public	5	05/31/2016	We join the Monday morning playgroup with Parkie and have been coming for almost a year. My daughter gets so excited when she knows its the day to go sing with Miss Parkie and all the kids. The structure of the group has allowed her to show her personality more and more, and the familiar faces of the children feel like friends to her. I appreciate the developmentally appropriate aspects of the group, Miss Parkie's welcoming and inclusive nature (how does she remember everyone?!), the crafts I never want to take on at home because of the mess, and the healthy snacks. I've made great mom friends here and find this weekly group invaluable.
Families First of the Greater Seacoast	291449		/users/profile/381864	rj86	Client Served	5	05/31/2016	The staff is absolutely welcoming and supportive. It's always wonderful to learn different skills and techniques for parenting so that we can be better parents. No matter how many classes a person attends there is always something to learn, a different skill for parenting. They run an educational but fun atmosphere and it makes families feel comfortable to share their struggles as parents.

I don't know what we'd do without you guys.
Families First of the Greater Seacoast	156842		/users/profile/202673	nhman53045	General Member of the Public	5	05/01/2013	On 3/28/2013 I wrote a review of Families First, based on a phone call I had placed to them.  For some reason the information I got over the phone was completely wrong, and at odds with everything in the website for Familes First.  This led me to write a terrible review.  My review was followed up (here) with a request that I check back with them in regard to the information I was given in my phone conversation with Families First.   I contacted Familes First again, explained what had happened, and they asked me to get in touch again.  On my second contact with them I found that the info I had been given was completely wrong, and that Families First was doing all it could to make sure that kind of thing never happens again.  Also, the situation that I had originally contacted them about was taken care of by Families First in a professional way by a very polite, and most importantly, a caring group of people!  I wish to thank everyone there, especially Terri, for getting back to me and allowing me to find out about the REAL Families First. 
Families First of the Greater Seacoast	151783		/users/profile/202673	nhman53045	Client Served	1	03/28/2013	I contacted Families First on 3/28/13. I was looking for information about a physical exam for a child in order for her to be admitted to the school system.  The child is in a nuclear family that has only been in the USA for three weeks; the family has few resources.  I was told that Families First does not treat children who are not covered by medical insurance.  So much for " affordable primary health for all ages".   This family "won" a Green Card Lottery, sponsored by the US Dept. of State.  It seems to me that we invite people to the USA, take their money, tell them "thanks a lot, now go home!"  After trying and trying to find a place to assist this family, I find myself a bit ashamed of the way this particular family has been treated, by the USA, as well as by Families First.
Families First of the Greater Seacoast	109024		/users/profile/94127	JackJamison	Client Served	5	04/05/2012	About 7 years ago Families First offered a free Men's Health screening and I attended.  I hadn't been to a doctor i decades because I thought I was healthy if not particularly fit. I was very seldom ill and in those rare occasions I quickly recovered.  Well they determined that I had a Lipid problem and had type II diabetes. I was impressed with that encounter; i received excellent  treatment and the staff was pleasant; so they became my medical home.  Years later I became a dental patient as well.  They offer care "regardless of ability to pay": a siding self pay scale, medicaid, medicare, and most private insurance.  I have medicare and private insurance.  When I retired I became a child care volunteer and later a board member.

I've come to know the agency in great detail and am impressed with its mission, breadth of services, quality of care, and efficiency. Their success is the product of a capable and dedicated staff and the generosity of its donors. 
Families First of the Greater Seacoast	86740		/users/profile/97201	johnf	Advisor	5	04/22/2011	My association with Families First began several years ago, when I joined the Board.  Later, I became Board Treasurer, and, when my Board term expired, I joined the Board of Advisors.  In these capacities, I have watched the organization at work and have participated in its development.  I continue to be impressed by the professionalism and dedication of the staff and volunteers, and by the quality of service they provide  and especially by their care and concern for each individual.  The feedback received from those to whom Families First provides services confirms this view, as does its high reputation in the community.
Families First of the Greater Seacoast	54589		/users/profile/56128	hannah98	Donor	5	10/06/2010	I started volunteering in the office at Families First about 4 years ago.  I maintained client files and was able to get a glimpse of the lives some of the consummers  live - many families were experiencing multiple challenges - job loss, chronic health problems, death, children with physical and mental disabilities - enough to overwhelm anyone, regardless of their financial stability.  These folks had stress. I would watch the staff at FF interact with them in such a non-judgmental, caring way. They are an extraordinary group of individuals. I was fortunate to stick around long enough to see how FF changed some of these peoples' lives for the better, and how FF enabled them to get back on the road to an independent, fruitful life. I don't work in the office anymore (and I miss it) - I now devote all my time at FF to raising money to support healthcare services.  I can't imagine where our community would be without it - there is nowhere else for the uninsured to go. FF does an excellent job of managing how the money is spent, and their state of the art facility and staff physicians rival that of any reputable private practice.
Families First of the Greater Seacoast	54547		/users/profile/56069	barbara-henry	Donor	5	10/06/2010	"Families First provides much-needed medical and dental care to people who might not otherwise receive it.  The agency does this in a very efficient manner, serving 5,500 people annually on a budget of about $4 million.  Those who can pay for the services do so on a sliding scale. I donate to Families First for those three very important reasons which prove Familes First is fiscally responsible. But I also give  because I realize how fortunate I have been in life and many people, through no fault of their own, have not been as fortunate."

New Hampshire Association For The Blind	100047		/users/profile/121528	Andrew L.	Client Served	5	10/31/2011	Most nonprofits serving persons with disabilities talk of helping clients to live fuller livers. The New Hampshire Association for the Blind is one of the few that succeeds. The Association does this through tireless outreach and a one-on-one approach that matches a persons needs with practical solutions. In my case, a low-vision exam yielded useful reading aids, its local office found volunteers to provide transportation, and through the NHAB, I learned about other resources and got to try daily living aids. NHAB provides home visits, seeks my feedback on their services, and always makes me feel that everything they do stems from my needs, rather than any dispassionate process or policy.
New Hampshire Association For The Blind	100044		/users/profile/121523	carolinepmoore	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/31/2011	The New Hampshire Association for the Blind, under the exceptional leadership of George Theriault, is an invaluable resource for those with vision loss and their family members in NH. The Dartmouth Centers for Health and Aging was honored to collaborate with this organization on a public education event about blindness and vision loss. We were extremely impressed by the professionalism of the NH Association for the Blind in pulling off this event, and are eager to partner on future endeavors.

That George has chosen to dedicate his efforts to the New Hampshire Association of the Blind speaks volumes about the worth of that most fortunate organization.

Obviously, I work closely with senior staff and I am impressed with their professionalism and dedication.  But I am even more impressed with -- and proud of -- the professionalism and passion that is evident throughout the organization.  At various events, consumers give glowing reviews of the services they have received from the Association's rehabilitation specialists, and it is clear that the services were not only competently provided but they were also provided in a personal and caring manner.   Even more important, however, is that it is clear that the Association has been able to change lives by giving consumers the skills and confidence they need to lead independent and full lives.

My mother's vision is limited due to age-related macular degeneration ("AMD") and I was therefore very interested to learn more about NHAB.   The President of the Association personally provided me with a tour of the Sight Center and has spent a considerable amount of time with me, providing valuable information on AMD and the aids and services available through NHAB.  Because of my personal experience, I was honored to be asked to join the board of the association and continue to be amazed at the dedication of all involved.

Live And Let Live Farm Inc	206548		/users/profile/268991	Loraine R.	Donor	1	07/18/2014	I would not trust this rescue to care for a senior horse or any horse with special needs. While most animals seem to do okay there, their approach to specialty care leaves others with little hope. A mare surrendered to them in decent weight and with a clean bill of health was dead in under 4 months. They blamed heaves - which they knew the horse had before intake - yet posted a picture of the horse being ridden in a dirt arena. That alone means they were NOT taking proper steps to care for  the horse. When questioned about it they became defensive and nasty. I made the decision to halt all donations to them. They took in another TB mare and then put her down when they determined she had cancer, but took almost two weeks to say so, and only did so after I posted a RIP post on their Facebook wall.  If the horse had cancer then why the secrecy? There are just too many red flags with this rescue for me to feel comfortable supporting them. 
Live And Let Live Farm Inc	163775	3	/users/profile/184561	Sandra W.	General Member of the Public	1	07/28/2013	Live and Let Live Farm has no doubt helped a lot of horses over the years.  However, they seem to take a "one size fits all" approach to equine care as evidenced by the death of Pride only 3 1/2 months after arrival.  Pride was a Saddlebred cross mare, in her early 20's, who was surrendered to LLLF because her owner suffered hardships that prevented her caring for her horse any longer.  Pride was given a clean bill of health by her vet when the Coggins was done;  only health condition was a mild case of heaves for which she needed daily medication and soaked hay. Pride arrived at LLLF on March 3 and was euthanized around the middle of June.  Not a lot is known about her time at this rescue except that a picture taken in late March shows Pride looking over a fence, noticeably thinner than her intake photos, blanketless in the cold even though she clearly did not have enough fat to keep herself warm.  Whatever she was fed was not sufficient to maintain her weight and the conditions to which Pride was subjected caused her health to fail.
Live And Let Live Farm Inc	103636	1	/users/profile/138590	catsandb	Volunteer	5	01/17/2012	I have a lot of health problems and was looking for someplace I could just go and actually feel like I was making a difference. I started at a different shelter but feel like I was making a difference. Then I found the Live and Let Live Farm. It has changed my life so completely, not only do I feel like I am actually making a difference when I go, but the farm makes a difference in my life as well. It has made me so much happier and given me something to look forward to. I don't know what I would have done if I hadn't found the Live and Let Live Farm; and I don't know how I got along before I found the farm! The farm has become an important part of my life I am so glad I found it! 
Live And Let Live Farm Inc	94714	1	/users/profile/109619	Debbi M.	Volunteer	5	07/30/2011	I have been a volunteer at Live and Let Live Farm for over a year now, and it's such a rewarding experience to help the animals that come here: mostly horses, but also goats, sheep, pigs, cows, all different kinds of birds and fowl, bunnies, kittens, cats, puppies, and dogs.  If it weren't for Teresa taking these animals in, some of them would be in the most horrid condition, if not dead.  We've had horses come to the farm on the verge of death, so emaciated and starved they can barely stand up, and thanks to the tireless work of the innumerable volunteers, now the horses are healthy, happy, and loved.  My fondest dream would be to see as many horses as possible in forever homes with experienced horse people, so they can all have all the attention they need every day.

CARRIAGE BARN EQUESTRIAN CENTER THERAPEUTIC RIDING PROGRAM INC	322111	1	/users/profile/415734	Writer	Volunteer	5	01/25/2017	I am a proud volunteer at The Carriage Barn.  My 'barn day'  is my favorite day of the week!  I started volunteering at the Barn in August 2016.  My goal was simply to help somewhere... and to hang out with horses!I had no idea how this would work out.  My children like horses, so I've been around a number of barns.  This one is different.  It is special.   The barn rules are simple: respect and love these incredible horses, accept one another, and above all - be safe.  That explains this barn and its programs to a 'T'.   It's a growing family.My job is to do whatever Ann asks me to do - as long as I am comfortable with the task.  I have walked alongside quadriplegics to ensure their safety.  I have ridden in carriages to be the hands that some don't have use of... I have mucked stalls, groomed, and turned out horses.   If I need help, it is always there.I am thrilled.  I get to do everything that I had hoped to do - and more!!The Carriage Barn is home.  Everyone is welcomed at the door, and is on equal footing (no matter if it be feet, wheels, etc.!). It is the epitome of a judgement-free zone!I am so thankful to have found such a welcoming haven ...
CARRIAGE BARN EQUESTRIAN CENTER THERAPEUTIC RIDING PROGRAM INC	321961	2	/users/profile/415525	nrieder	Board Member	5	01/23/2017	I started out as a volunteer for The Carriage Barn a little over two years ago and imidiately felt welcomed and accepted as an important part of this organization. The staffs dedication to both clients, volunteers and their family members made me realize what an incredible place this is. No matter what is going on in an individual's life The Carriage Barn is committed to improving it. I have seen many clients make great strides in their goals. I myself have benifeited greatly and developed many professional skills and advanced my own career thanks to the expirence I have received here. 
CARRIAGE BARN EQUESTRIAN CENTER THERAPEUTIC RIDING PROGRAM INC	321960	1	/users/profile/415524	CBEATP	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/23/2017	Over a year and a half I started my internship at The Carriage Barn. At the time I had no idea where accepting that position would take me, but it has been quite the journey. In that time I have met and worked with some incredible people who have taught me so much. The stories and experiences they have shared with me have inspired me to live each day to the fullest and to find joy whenever and wherever I can. Some days are long, difficult, and exhausting but it is all worth it for the moments when I witness the joy that being around horses and working with them brings to these amazing people.Now I am proud to say that I work for The Carriage Barn and get to continue working with some extraordinary people and horses doing something I truly love. I can never thank Ann enough for taking me on as her intern and teaching me so much. She has been a fantastic mentor who continues to teach and motivate me every single day.
CARRIAGE BARN EQUESTRIAN CENTER THERAPEUTIC RIDING PROGRAM INC	321871	2	/users/profile/415408	CBVolunteer	Volunteer	5	01/22/2017	I have been working at the Carriage Barn for several months now. I do whatever is needed  sometimes cleaning out the stalls,  opening big bales of wood shavings to replenish the ground cover in the stalls, filling the water buckets for the horses, putting hay in the feeding bags  things like that.Sometimes I am present and assist when patrons come to ride in the arena. It is gratifying to see children, many of them with some kind of problem, verbal or physical, enjoy getting into the carriages and being driven around the arena. While their normal life may be any but normal in their home situations, while they are at the Barn, they laugh and have and good time.I am most touched when I assist in the arena when a very handicapped woman  lets call her Shelley  about fifty years old - comes to ride in a carriage a couple of times a week.  Shelley was an avid horse woman but had a terrible accident a few years ago that left her, after many agonizing operations, paralyzed from waist on down. She was depressed with her situation for a long time but then she discovered the Carriage Barn, that caters to people like herself, offers them a new path to renewed enjoyment of life.Shelley drives up in her van, wheels her automatic wheelchair away from the drivers spot and lets herself down a ramp, grabs her helmet, and comes wheeling into the barn.  There, her favorite horse K.C. is being readied for the riding.  Once in the arena, volunteers  transfer Shelley, via a hoist,  from her wheelchair into a carriage. Her hands are so crippled that she cannot open them  they are curled up but there is just enough room to pull the reins through.  She enjoys herself driving around for an hour, making K. C.  go through various configurations which we, the helpers, set up for her.I did not know her in her depression phases.  I see a lovely, spirited and cheerful woman doing what she loves to do.  Did I see nail polish on her fingers??  I think the experience at the Carriage Barn has brought some kind of normalcy back to her life. I leave the Carriage Barn humbled and grateful and with great sense of peace.

As a volunteer for over two years, I have experienced firsthand the incredible impact that the programs have on participants and those in their lives. At many points during my time there, I have been left speechless, in awe of not only the kindness shown by people involved, but the amazing healing power of horses and the team at the Barn. The programs and care provided are of a caliber unlike any that I have seen or experienced before, even at other Therapeutic Riding programs; it is a very special place.
CARRIAGE BARN EQUESTRIAN CENTER THERAPEUTIC RIDING PROGRAM INC	321566	1	/users/profile/414991	CBFriend	General Member of the Public	5	01/19/2017	The phrase "it takes a village" comes to mind when describing the Carriage Barn. From the caring and knowledgeable staff to the dedicated volunteers they work together treating clients and students with respect while making their experience a positive one that could be anything from just spending time with one of the well mannered horses to driving a carriage in an intricate dressage pattern. Spend any time there you and realize why they have many longtime clients as well as volunteers. 
CARRIAGE BARN EQUESTRIAN CENTER THERAPEUTIC RIDING PROGRAM INC	308611	2	/users/profile/399979	Writer	Client Served	5	10/07/2016	The Carriage Barn came to my rescue just when I needed it.  I was taking carriage driving lessons, when my instructor moved to a new site 1 1/2 hrs. away.  A friend showed me the Portsmouth newsletter that listed a beginner senior carriage driving class.  I signed up and the rest is history.  The class has been on-going for 4+ years and is a wonderful addition to my activities.  In addition, with the help of Ann Miles,  I have since purchased a driving pony, harness and cart and they are housed at the Carriage Barn, and I go for twice weekly instruction there.  I have seen the enjoyment and improvement of many handicapped adults and children there, and participate in many of the inclusive activities and field trips sponsored by the Carriage Barn.  It is a wonderful facility and I hope it continues forever!

Half Moon Sober Festival Incorporated	109543		/users/profile/149259	R U Okay	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/10/2012	My first experience with this non-profit was that of a patron. I attended my first festival in 1996 and have had the pleasure to return every year since in different capacities. After attending in "96" I sought out those responsible for event with the purpose of volunteering in any capacity needed. From that meeting with representatives of the organization I became one of the festivals ticket outlets for a period of two years. Soon thereafter I relocated, a move which brought me closer to the organizations "hub", affording me the ability to do more with this non-profit and further it's worthwhile mission. After more than a decade of serving side by side with wonderful individuals I found it necessary to separate from the organization due to relocating once again. My professional experience in the field of Substance Abuse has provided me with unique insight and perspective as it relates to this organization and those it serves. I would encourage any and all who wish to attend to do so, for a day or the entire weekend. Those that wish to get involved, do not hesitate. Carpe diem!
Half Moon Sober Festival Incorporated	109378		/users/profile/149021	Terry15	Volunteer	5	04/09/2012	My first festival was back in 2010 and I have to say that I had a great time.  I volunteered for the event and got to spend the weekend with old friends and got to meet some new friends.  I loved how organized the event was and how comfortable I felt from the time that I got there, until the time I left. I was kind of bummed to have to leave, but I had to get back to my regular daily routine.  The workshops that I attended were outstanding and the sense of fellowship was undeniable. Today I am a volunteer on the board and it was because of that experience a couple of years ago, that I decided to get active with Half Moon. 
Half Moon Sober Festival Incorporated	108784		/users/profile/148062	Curtis2	Board Member	4	04/02/2012	Four star's as they're always trying to get better. My first Half Moon was 2001, 3 months sober and hateing life. Work, meetings and home( an '89 van) then studio Apt. Was so bummed that this was sobriety, then got a ticket to the Half Moon Sober Festival. From the moment I arrived my view of being sober started to change, by the end of the four days I was convinced that I could stay sober and that events like this were going to be a part of my sobriety maintenance, well that was 11 years ago. I've never missed a Half Moon in all that time and now I'm the President of Half Moon Sober Festival, Inc. Come on out and join us this 2012 Memorial day weekend.
Half Moon Sober Festival Incorporated	108783		/users/profile/148061	ChrissyO	Client Served	4	04/02/2012	The first time I went to Half Moon Sober Festival I was 'living' in a shelter for homeless, newly-sober women. I had to get special permission to be gone for the weekend and be able to return and have a bed when I came back. Being that it was a sober event, I was allowed to go. I had only camped a few times in my life before this. My friends and I piled into a car and drove up. We got lost on the way and got there very late at night. The gentleman at the gate set up his own tent for us to sleep in because ours was borrowed and none of us knew how. When we woke up and asked our neighbors about grocery stores nearby, they instead shared their food with us. Every person we met that weekend had a smile on their face and a kind word to say. We enjoyed music and danced in the rain. It was the first time in my life I felt like I could be myself and let loose (even just a bit) without being under the influence. Every year since this, I have made a point of looking out for new campers nearby to help, I make sure we have extra food for those in need, there is always an invitation to join us at our fire, I invite shy people to get up and dance with me. I was so inspired by the kindness strangers showed me that I make sure others see that in me. This event truly changed my life and I recommend it to everyone who is trying to enjoy life sober one day at a time.

Half Moon Sober Festival Incorporated	28909	1	/users/profile/29956	diane4	Volunteer	5	02/18/2010	Half moon festival is my favorite event of the year. A kick off to summer with a weekend of dedicated volunteers providing warm welcomes and a safe and nurturing atmosphere to all ages with one rule no drugs or alcohol, plenty of music, educational workshops from 12 step recovery to yoga and spiritual topics, Kids activites, hiking, horseshoes, you name it there is a possibility its there. Don't feel like cooking? The main stage has food venders, and always unique items and services. I have attended solo, in small gruops and with my family. I have vended, taught workshops and learned how to dance. My favorite music performer is Leroy White with his inspiration of love and light and helping each other and all those suffering thruogh out the world to those willing to make a difference. The festival is a camping adventure I have attended 11 staright years I have been at 4 or more locations from race tracks, boy scount camps, to now being in the heart of the white mountains. The weather is the only thing they can't control been in rain storms, wind storms and heat waves. The endurance of the staff all volunteer don't quit.

Adaptive Sports Partners of the North Country Inc	188190		/users/profile/245471	CNKMOM	Client Served	5	11/08/2013	My multi-handicapped son has been with ASPNC since early 2009! He has autism/epilepsy/gastroparesis and tibial torsion. In Oct. of 2008 he became critically ill and was inpatient at Boston Children's Hospital for an extended period of time. When released, I was told to get him moving! Due to the extent of his needs ASPNC was the ONLY organization willing to bring him on board no questions asked!!!! By January of 2009 he was on Cannon Mountain! It didn't matter that he had a feeding pump and that it took 3 volunteers to hold him up. He was skiiing!! I look back on the pictures of that day amazed at how things have changed. Since that time he has been able to cut his medications and feeding formula in half! His leg strength has improved so that a year ago he was able to lose his leg braces. Most importantly, his confidence has grown exponentially! He bikes, hikes, kayaks, swims snow shoes etc year round. He's also a 3 time Special Olympic gold medalist. He also climbed Mount Washington during ASPNC'S Sunrise Ascent. His health is dependent on their services. He is doing things with this organization I only dreamed possible. He is again struggling with his health yet they adapt week by week to his needs. The volunteers make this organization. Many have become my extended family!
Adaptive Sports Partners of the North Country Inc	188145		/users/profile/245416	Praveen B.	Volunteer	5	11/08/2013	I had this amazing volunteering experience through ASPNC this summer. Along with the team members, I helped the disable people reach the summit of Mt. Washington, NH (the place known for world's extreme weather and recorded highest wind speed in US) pushing and pulling the custom made wheel chair in a 7 miles journey. This experience was far beyond my expectation and the support from people was overwhelming. I also had an opportunity to go on a bike ride with various groups to help disable people enjoy nature and promote healthy life. All these work/activity wouldn't be possible without a non-profit organizations like ASPNC. You guys rock and keep up the good work!

Adaptive Sports Partners of the North Country Inc	187841	7	/users/profile/244948	Lucy Golden	General Member of the Public	5	11/05/2013	As a member of the community that is served by Adaptive Sports Partners of the North Country, I cannot say enough about what this organization has brought to us. In addition to providing great year-round sports and activity opportunities to disabled individuals, it has effectively introduced an awareness of what it means to be disabled, and thus expanded the consciousness of us all. ASPNC has become a face in and of our community. Two weeks ago my teen-age son and I attended a presentation that featured a Paralympic skier, Chris Devlin-Young, who told the story of his disability, and how he has dealt with it. At this same presentation, a film called, "Movement" was shown, that followed several disabled individuals who have used adaptive skiing as a tool for dealing with their disability. The understanding of what it means to live with a disability that is communicated through programs such as this, as well as through having an active and effective adaptive organization present is important to the health and psyche of our community.      My son, who is a senior in high school,  has volunteered for ASPNC for four years. During that time, he has received very thorough training, and has had an active role in enabling disabled individuals to participate in active pursuits. I know that his involvement and experience in this amazing group of individuals; participants, leaders and volunteers, has expanded his horizons and given him a layer that he will always have. I am grateful that we have such a great resource here that does so much for so many.
Animal Rescue Veterinary Services	104801	1	/users/profile/140635	psasma	Volunteer	4	01/28/2012	ARVS neutered/spayed three of my foster kittens in 2011.  The cost for surgery, vaccines, and testing was extremely reasonable and made it possible for me to adopt out these kittens, knowing that they would not be contriibuting to pet overpopulation.  The ARVS crew is made up of some of the most dedicated animal welfare people that I have ever met.  They help a number of rescue organizations by providing  valuable services at moderate cost.

They provide spay/neuter, vaccinations, felv/fiv testing, de-flea, deworm, ear and eye, and respiratory care for all rescued cats, kittens, dogs and puppies.  Their medical services are top of the line I have not had any medical complications with any animals I have brought there and the services are very affordable.  They provide an essential service for the animals in Massachusetts and Southern New Hampshire.  I am aware of at least ten rescue leagues that use and depend on their services.

Student Conservation Association, Inc.	146810	3	/users/profile/91168	jneuberg9	Volunteer	5	12/16/2012	As a high school student, I went from the South Side of Chicago to Olympic National Park to do conservation work in the wilderness.  The experience of being given adult responsibilities and doing hard physical labor under difficult conditions (it rained constantly) with teenagers from all over the U.S. changed my life.  I subsequently served two years in the Peace Corps, chose career paths in education and conservation, and eventually worked as an administrator for this non-profit.  SCA's fifty-five year history puts it in the top rank of outdoor programs for high school and college students.
Student Conservation Association, Inc.	146803	3	/users/profile/193801	friend.sarah.a	Volunteer	5	12/16/2012	When I was in college, the SCA presented an excellent opportunity to explore the USA by the exact means that fit the typical college student. Those means being that we generally have no money, no place to live,  and are free as a bird for the summer. The SCA didn't improve my finances but they ensured stasis - providing a roof over my head and an stipend for food. Now, for the work. The best way to explore a culture is to be a part of that community and that is exactly what the SCA did for me. By allowing and encouraging me to give my time and sweat I became immersed in the life and history of the sage brush desert, the oregon trail, beef cattle farmers, and the Bureau of Land Management. All of those things completely foreign to a northeastern suburban girl. I was pleasantly surprised at the diversity our country has to offer. The knowledge, growth, and acceptance I gained from that experience also gave me more pride and confidence in who I am today. I am forever grateful to how the SCA changed my life. [The only reason I would not volunteer for this organization again is because I can no longer drop my daily responsibilities for the extended periods of time that the SCA specializes in. I applaud their approach and work.]
Student Conservation Association, Inc.	145754	2	/users/profile/192308	Nathan8	Donor	5	12/03/2012	I had my first and only encounter with SCA in the Great Sand Dunes National Preserve in the summer of 2012.  I was a couple miles into the wilderness when  I stopped to chat with a few young people with hard hats, picks, and shovels working on the trail I was using.  I barely caught the name of their organization (SCA), but ran into them again the next two days as I hiked the area looking for bighorn sheep (I had an archery tag).  On my last day, I ended up camping close to their camp and they were packing up to leave the same day.  I stopped by to offer my thanks for all their hard work on the trails and had a nice discussion with several of them.  Turns out, they had been out there for 4 weeks!  The Park Service had dropped them off with equipment and supplies, and they had worked on their own for a month, and without pay!  I thought, wow, it must be a pretty amazing organization that can find young people (early 20s?) to make that kind of commitment.  I found the group on-line and made a small donation that day.

Although UVLT is only about twenty years old it now ranks amongst the largest in the country in terms of acreage persevered.  The amount of work that is done each year by a small dedicated staff, a very active Board of Trustees and a large number of unpaid volunteers is quite extraordinary.  Careful attention is focused on every proposed and current easement to see that each is created and maintained in keeping with the highest standards individually appropriate to each piece of property.

Upper Valley Land Trust Inc	35836	5	/users/profile/36622	rick71	Board Member	5	04/15/2010	The UVLT has an incredible, creative staff that is helping individuals and communities preserve the wonderful farmlands, waterways and animal habitats that make our region such a special place to live and visit. A recent example is the conservation of a wetlands area which was being used by several nearby schools for nature studies but was up for sale to be developed - the UVLT folks persevered in arranging part of the funds to acquire the land - and their determination sparked a community response that raised the remainder, part of which was a heartwarming  Christmas activity by the students, who asked their parents to give their gift to the conservation effort so they and the students who followed could continue to learn and enjoy the many aspects of the wetland. With the power of learning outside the classroom being increasingly recognized, the benefits of this effort are important and lasting!

The Little Nature Museum	84322		/users/profile/93508	Olin	Professional with expertise in this field	4	03/30/2011	The Little Nature Museum was established in the early 1950's.  I became familiar with it through my girl friend who became my wife.  It was established in Winthrop, MA as that was where Sandy was living.  She went to the University of New Hampshire where she kept some animals in her dorm room.  Later she married my fraternity roommate.  When she got married, she was able to expand the museum.   I think the museum's present location is excellent and the museum has collection that has grown with the space she now has.  She has alos arranged for presentations to be made by experts in their fields, which I think is worthwhile.  Sandy has put her soul into the museum, and it shows.   Olin C.

Toddlers squeal with delight to be able to touch and handle nature's finest treasures., School age  students share their knowledge and return time and again to continue their interest, and adults discover new activities and displays, as well as a fun, family outing.

The Little Nature Museum	82306		/users/profile/90623	janet ward	General Member of the Public	4	03/15/2011	The Little Nature Museum was the best kind of learning opportunity for my grandchildren who were visiting from Washington State.  They had so much fun browsing through the thoughtfully prepared exhibits, enjoying the specimens and playing nature games, they learned about nature "naturally." In my opinion, that is the best and most effective way for children to develop their interest in and appreciation of the natural world. Sandra Martin and her dedicated volunteers work hard to provide opportunities for children to grow in their knowledge of the natural world.  Such opportunities are becoming all too rare.  This is a "little" museum in name only.  It makes a big and important impact on children.

They had so much fun that when my youngest son became a Cub Scout and was looking for an opportunity to do some community service, he and the others in his Den asked if they could do something for the Museum.  They ended up doing some trail work and making some trail signs.  A few years ago while visiting the Museum I offered a program idea, which was a program to teach children what to do if they should get lost in the woods.  Since that time, five years ago, the Little Nature Museum has offered this program to over 100 children and is the only source for this program in the entire State of NH.

The progams offered at the Seymore Osman Community Center are invaluable to me and many other families in this small community. There is little for our youth to do after school and the Quantum program has provided so much for so many young people who need guidance. We have been fortunate to have such a wonderful program with its wonderful directors and personnel in our lives. The Quantum program has met and exceeded any expectations I have had in everyway.

My daughter was an actor in two plays (one when she was six years old and one when she was eight) put on by the playground.  She learned to memorize lines, work with older and younger children, how to do make up and about costuming.  She also learned how to stay with a project until the end.  As a family we thoroughly enjoyed the performances and were grateful for the time and energy the devoted people of Performers Playground  invested in my child and the other children as well.    We still attend the performances and they are still pretty good and a lot of fun. Although my child was younger at the time of her involvement, I was really impressed at how the director and other adult mentors worked with sometimes struggling middle and high school students and kept their interest and really taught them skills they could use in the theater as well as outside the theater too.  I know the kids build the sets and run the lighting and work backstage as well as act.

I hesitated at first because I worked full time at a bank nearly 45 minutes from the drama studio and was basically giving up my entire evening 5 days a week from 5:00 p.m. until 9:00 p.m. to chaperone my daughter.  I did  finally agree and held up my part of the bargain by getting her to all her practices. Without a doubt, all the extra gas money, mileage on my car, and hours spent biding my time while my daughter rehearsed with the talented, friendly, and motivated staff and members of the Performer's Playground was well worth it. The art direction is excellent (nurturing, but firm) and the kids fast became friends and skilled in most facets of live theater.  At the performances, the general audience was repeatedly and consistently rewarded with excellent acting and family members got to see their relatives on stage, happy, talented and productive. Each production had overall excellence with respect to acting, costumes, makeup, stage set, sound, and lights.  Each production was uniquely different from other productions of the same shows by other local theater groups.  it was always a guaranteed good time for all involved.

I am proud of this company and talk it up every chance I can and especially when there's an upcoming production!  I feel that in this world where children can fall victim to all manner of bad choices that the opportunity to develop self confidence, and poise that the Performers Playground offers our youth is a veritable gift!

Education For All Children	233282		/users/profile/297013	JayD24	Board Member	5	11/09/2014	EFAC provides both education and mentoring opportunities for some of Kenya's brightest and most deserving youth.  Not only does this generate scholars who are prepared for careers in their country, but can establish lasting connections between the students and their sponsors.  When one becomes a sponsor, they are given the opportunity to communicate through letter writing with their student. This provides a link for both student in sponsor that can last forever. A sponsor can get a true understanding of their effect on the scholar's road to education, and feel great pride in helping them achieve it Perhaps one of the organization's greatest strengths, however, are the EFAC Kenyan Volunteers who ensure that the students have appropriate support and guidance through their educational pursuits. This is a critical and time consuming activity that is The primary reason that EFAC scholars perform so well in comparison to many of their peers.  When we visited Kenya in 2013, we learned just how well organized and thorough this support was, primarily coordinated by the dedicated folks at African Nazarine University. Without that critical component, this would simply be another scholarship fund. EFAC is so much more.
Education For All Children	227097		/users/profile/290829	blairdemers	Donor	5	10/27/2014	Participating as a sponsor and mentor for an EFAC student has been one of my most rewarding nonprofit experiences to date. This organization is doing an extraordinary job of educating and supporting young people in Kenya in order that they may achieve personal and professional success despite the challenging circumstances in which they live. By providing scholarships and supplemental support systems like a comprehensive mentoring program and developmental workshops, EFAC is seeing dramatic results for its students, and in turn, for their families and their communities. While EFAC may be a small organization by NGO standards, it is poised to contribute to systemic change in Kenya one student at a time. I am honored to be a participant in this program - I know that my time and money are going to an organization that is effective and highly professional, yet simultaneously provides an experience that is intimate and meaningful for the donor/volunteer.  Five stars for EFAC! 
Education For All Children	225201		/users/profile/288971	Jancro	Board Member	5	10/22/2014	I am so happy to be a part of EFAC because the work they are doing in Kenya with bright, financially challenged students is first class.  Not only do they give educational scholarships, they see these children all the way through high school, college and into the job  market.  They use mentoring workshops to enhance the educational program of each student, reinforcing the computer skills and the life skills they need to become the future leaders in their country.  I have been several times to Kenya and have met students and the Kenyan Board.  I have seen the schools first hand and talked with teachers and heads of schools.  I am always impressed with with the quality of this program and the gratitude the students feel for their sponsors.  I feel a huge strength of this program lies with the founders and the wonderful Kenyan board which makes sure all the money goes where directed, the students are vetted and the schools are providing students an appropriate education.  I support EFAC because, in a global society, educating the poor in emerging nations is our best hope for a peaceful world.

I lost my sight 4 years ago, and have connected with the volunteers on many an occasion.  Carol Gulla, the Executive Director, runs a well-oiled machine comprised of fantastic volunteers.  They have helped my children, my guide dog, and I get to many doctors appointments, physical therapy appointments,  and important school meetings.  There have even been two occasions when a volunteer has been able to help me get to the ocean for an assistive surfing lesson !  I would be lost without their help.  Thanks millions TASC !

TASC volunteers caringly and carefully transport my older, non-driving neighbors to and from critical appointments.  They are able to access the healthcare they need while making new friends. And the volunteers tell me that they enjoy helping and hearing the stories and experiences these new friends have had.  It's a wonderful service that benefits the entire community by: lessening the impact on town services; lessening the number of emergency room visits; dramatically upping the quality of life for citizens, and helping to keep an important population active in their communities.
Peruvian Childrens Fund	308384		/users/profile/367739	Jim_159	Professional with expertise in this field	1	10/06/2016	Update: According to Nashua New Hampshire police, John Wang president of Peruvian Childrens Fund is currently (as of this date) wanted for failing to appear on a shoplifting charge. This is a repeated offense for which Wang has been convicted on more than one occasion. He apparently has graduated to charity fraud. His revocation of his medical license more than 25 years ago from both Massachusetts ad New Hampshire Boards of Registration of Medicine means that his claim of being a doctor of medicine on a "christian" medical mission in Peru is utterly fraudulent. 
Peruvian Childrens Fund	277893	7	/users/profile/367739	Jim_159	Volunteer	1	01/24/2016	John Wang, founder of Peruvian Childrens Fund continues to claim that he is a medical doctor even though his medical license was permanently revoked over 30 years ago for gross incompetence, gross negligence and medical misconduct. After promising 43 microscopes to several hospitals, clinics and schools in return for their support, he reneged. Neither the microscopes nor the $30,000 worth of medicine for children infected with parasites were ever seen. It is doubtful that they ever existed but were merely used as bait to entice supporters. After many in Huaraz realized Wang was a fraud, he fled to another town of Caraz to set up shop there. Promising microscopes and medicines in return for their support. The hospital and university embraced him until they too, learned of his fraud and manipulations. The fiscalia (Peruvian states attorney office) has filed criminal charges against Wang for practicing medicine without a license and fraud. It is beyond comprehension how a man who is clearly a documented liar and fraud can continue to blatantly claim he is and has been a doctor of 50 years. By his own admission on printed proposals, Wang has gathered over $240,000 in cash and materials through his nefarious efforts.

Gross negligence, gross incompetence and medical misconduct are serious charges. In Huaraz Peru, the discovery of his fraud as a doctor has enraged many who he has lured to trust him. His Peruvian Childrens Fund is doing nothing these days, his ambulance is parked and has never even been registered, collecting dust in a garage. The thousands of children he was supposed to be helping, have never seen him. Why would he claim to be a doctor when he clearly and evidently is not? Those who supported him, have been duped unfortunately.He has actually told people in Huaraz Peru that God himself sent him to Peru as a doctor to help the children. Hiding behind the cross of Jesus for instant credibility is shameless. We hope that accountability and appropriate consequences are soon served upon the ex-doctor, fraud and charlatan, John Wang.

My occasional encounters with Society staff over a 15-yr. period have left me impressed with their professionalism, dedication, and commitment to mission.  As someone who works in the land trust field elsewhere, I have the utmost respect for the Society's consistent ability to facilitate and complete large-scale land projects that have resulted in the preservation of many of NH's most cherished landscapes.  The Society also does great work in the advocacy and education areas, and seeks to advance the art and science of forestry--but without its demonstrated commitment to land conservation, these other pursuits wouldn't mean much.
Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests	35325	7	/users/profile/36160	steve-panish	Volunteer	5	04/09/2010	SPNF has been a great partner for conservation projects I have worked on for Moose Mountains Regional Greenways.  The staff has considerable expertise, and is a top choice to handle all aspects of complex projects, including fundraising.Since the organization is large, the focus is on larger projects, and stewardship costs will be excessive for small projects (nor will SPNF likely be interested in small projects (under 200 acres or so.)I would like to see more focus on  reestablishing a core area of "old growth", which is extremely underrepresented in NH.  Since virtually all mature and over-mature forests were cut before 1920 or so, I doubt the ecology of old growth ecosystems is well understood.  I think it would be good to make getting a significant amount back a priority, in areas where currently the focus would be more on working forest.

My mom, stepdad, and siblings all helped build the house every weekend. Their house took a little over a year to build, but the wait was well worth it! Even though I do not live in the house with them, I feel so blessed to know that they now have a permanent place to call home. The wonderful volunteers that helped build the house, help with paperwork, there for any question, they all were amazing. So supportive and always willing to help a hand when ever needed. All the volunteers would help when ever help was needed. Knowing that there is a program such as habitat for humanity that is there to help a family in need is just amazing. I can not Thank them enough. My family has lived in their new beautiful home for a little over a year and they can not be more thankful.

It took almost a year to build our home and we moved in on August 8th 2015. That was one of the happiest days of our lives. Building our home was one of the best experiences we will ever have. We got to meet to many kind and generous volunteers every week who would put hours into building our home, and the steady Eddies who made sure they came every Thursday and Friday were amazing. They became more than just volunteers but part of our family. Working for Douglas Gregorey the construction manager was so much fun. He had so much patience to work with so many people that may have never picked up a hammer before, such as myself. He took the time to make sure we safely used the tools appropriately and that whatever job we were doing was done right, if it wasn't there was always fix it Thursdays! He was always appreciative to everyone who showed up. The generosity from everyone was truly outstanding, from the volunteers, everyone who donated supplies, the different builds we had such as the woman's build and the bikers build. Lowes coming out for a day and doing so much planting, spreading grass seed, building gardens. From the very first step to putting in the application to being told your accepted for a home, to the ground breaking, building your home and doing your hours, it's a wonderful feeling, and a huge thank you to Marcie Bergeron the executive director for all that you do for Habitat.  This wouldn't be possible if it weren't for you and all the hard work and efforts you and your amazing staff do such as fundraisers  and grants to keep SENH Habitat going. We are very thankful you all came into our lives and have this opportunity and a beautiful new home.The Shavor Family

As a chef and cooking instructor I have been looking for an organization whose goals mesh with my interest in helping improve the nutritional value of the foods kids eat.  The BGCN had been working to enhance their meal program and the timing was perfect for me to join in that endeavor.   I was invited to evaluate the program, help set goals, and work with the chef to create healthy, made from scratch recipes that the kids would enjoy.    The chef has done an outstanding job at accomplishing the goals and continues to move the food program above and beyond our expectations.     The staff has been so supportive of the chef's efforts and the kids have been happy to join as he meets his goals.   I commend both the administration and the board of trustees who offer unending encouragement and support. The Boys & Girls Club of Greater Nashua provides a positive volunteer opportunity that offers personal growth in addition to a sense of accomplishment.

Patricia Casey opened my eyes to the world of giving in a way I was unaware of understanding until then right there in Nashua...the community right next door!

David's House, Inc.	136569		/users/profile/182497	colleennarvaez	Client Served	5	11/09/2012	My husband and I received the wonderful news that we were going to be having twins at 9 weeks.  But this came with some concern.  Our twins were a very rare type of twin.  They were in the same sac, and therefore very high risk for survival, and would need to be delivered no later than 34 weeks.  Thank God, our boys made it to 32 weeks, but this meant a stay in the ICN (intensive care nursery) at Dartmouth.  We lived a little over an hour from the hospital, and I had no clue how I was going to be able to afford to stay near my boys.  Then a friend told me about David's house.  What an amazing place!  It is a home away from home.  The staff always had a smile on their face.  The community had volunteers making dinners for the weary parents that spent countless hours with their child/children.  A comfortable place to sleep, a hot shower helped us to ready for the long days at the hospital.  We are very thankful for David's house.  If it weren't for David's house, I don't even want to imagine how the experience would have been.  To top it off, we made friends that will last a lifetime.  This organization founded by a little boy with a selfless dream, has helped so many people and has touched many lives.  Thank you David's house!

I stayed at David's House during the 9 weeks that my son was in the ICN.  Though it was extremely difficult being away from my husband and older daughter for this time, David's House was definitely a home away from home for me.  My husband and daughter came up on weekends to stay with me and the staff was always accomodating to provide me with the needed cot for my daughter.   This organization helps so many people and provides a warm inviting place to decompress after a long day at the hospital.

We live 2 hours north and Davids House saved us, time, money and wear & tear on us. Minutes from the Hospital was a God send- it allowed us to be able to help to care for our son and our other kids could come and visit/stay with us. It was a safe haven for them while their brother took most of our time and attention. The staff and volunteers were caring and understanding.Gabriel returned monthly for stays to see his doctors the next day in clinc. We and all his medical equipment( vent, oxygen, suction machine etc) have been welcomed with open arms and never ever any stares or unkind words.. We also stayed there exactly 8 mos after checking out of Davids House from the NICU for another 4 mos - during my sons Leukemia stay. He was diagnosed at one year old with AML m-7. During that stay he almost lost his his battle and the staff/volunteers were so kind. We to this day need to call and ask for a room and we truely feel apart of a family.

Tails To Freedom Inc	107481		/users/profile/145600	Holly Pearson	General Member of the Public	5	03/03/2012	I was told about this nonprofit, "Tails to Freedom", by a friend.  I first visited it's thrift shop, "Lucky Dog" about a year ago and I've made multiple trips there since.  The shop itself is large, immaculate, and always has a treasure or two to find.  Purchase an item, and the money goes to help animals - what better combination could there be!                                                                                                The shop is also a resource for people to learn more about issues related to all animals and to the environment.  You will find educational displays and a lending library.  Preventing suffering before it begins is key; spaying and neutering is promoted including info about low-cost services; financial aid is given when necessary. The people who work at Lucky Dog are knowledgeable, pleasant and devoted to the cause.

Tails To Freedom Inc	58717	1	/users/profile/62751	Lucky Dog	General Member of the Public	1	12/12/2010	Were getting Stiffed by Lucky Dog Thrift (AKA Tails to freedom) Lucky Dog Grooming, did the necessary research, before choosing the name Lucky Dog, to make sure no one in our area (The state of NH)was using the same name for a related business. This is the proper procedure and very easy to do with the business name look up on-line.   Regretfully, Lucky Dog grooming salon has been drawn into a controversy over the rights and title to our business name. Lucky Dog, Grooming Salon is not, nor ever has been, affiliated with the Lucky Dog, Thrift shop(aka tails to freedom). Lucky Dog, thrift shop has caused a public controversy by marketing and advertisement designed to cause consumer confusion. Now we are forced to defend ourselves and inform the public. The confusion started right from the beginning when Katherine, the owner of the thrift shop, opened a business with the same name and on the same street name also, only a couple of towns over from my business and the thrift shop is in an area, the grooming shop owner frequented and has many friends.  We were in business a year before the thrift shop and the grooming business was a cumulation of years of planning and sacrifice. Starting my business was a big financial and emotional commitment. As one can imagine, starting a business in a bad economy, and  it generally takes years to make a profit anyway and we started during one of the worst financial  crises since the great depression.  My first notification of the thrift shop began when an acquaintance came to me and asked me if Id seen the Lucky Dog shop across the street from our meeting, I said, My name is Lucky Dog, looking at him perplexed. Then others  started to come to me about this woman, doing things for the animals. You can imagine my shock that someone would do this. Now, someone was trying to home in on my hard work by taking the thunder away from me in my community of friends.  Many of my friends are our customers and also, we consider our customers as our friends, so, this was immediately effecting our business. Then of course my phone starts ringing for the thrift shop. Next thing you know the same acquaintance comes to me, after running back to her, and comes to me again saying, Kat had no idea of my existence and was so shocked and wanted to have me leave my card with her? Really?   She took the same name and didnt bother to do the research before hand, and wanted me to leave my card in her shop? Do you think we believe that? Personally, I found this very insulting that Kat feels she can take my business name, home in on my business game and then wants to manage me and she doesnt bother to contact me professionally? Does that not smack of communism. http://blog.thenarcissistinyourlife.com/2010/09/28/narcissistidentity-theft.aspx Her sense of entitlement is astonishing. As can be seen from the original plans of  Tails to freedom they have a conflict of interest with my dreams and business plans. She wants to do dog day care, a dog boutique and do dog charity work, all things we do? When we did go into meet her personally, and not telling her who I was, she immediately started with her spiel of being a non-profit organization.   We only think about giving to our customers and keeping them satisfied with affordable services and not having them throw free money and items at us. I wasnt going to have anything in common with her.  We just tried to ignore the whole thing, as these type of people dont last, until of course, they crossed the line further. We will not support a questionable organization with questionable agendas that may conflict with our own and especially one who is taking my name. She isnt being upfront with the public. My first interest is to protect the public from fraud and scams. She isnt filling out the paper work for the Non profit correctly and we dont want Lucky Dog Grooming to be associated with an organization that may end up in legal issues and in trouble for tax evasion, unless of course we are the ones instituting the law suit, for our own protection, and that is not out of the question. So, this is why we are dissociating publicly from them, for our own protection. This is the state of NH letting this happen. Who is protecting the public from this?  http://tailstofreedom.org/links.php Lucky Dog thrift shop is not a non-profit organization, nor a dog business and yet she crawled and slithered in the back window, taking the name Lucky Dog claiming to be a thrift shop, as Tails for freedom, an animal rights organization, focusing on dog causes. They wouldnt have given her the name Lucky Dog , if they knew she was a dog business, because someone else was using it for a dog business, me. They cross the line further, trying to get the jump on me for my move to Nashua The groomer, me, has discussed with several people including my sister, mother and husband, and many close friends, my idea of using the dog and butterfly as a logo as this is based on spiritual experiences. Now, soon after my move to Nashua and that was always my goal to be in Nashua, suddenly she has a huge marketing campaign with a dog and butterfly logo, what I had been talking about. Apparently, copy Kat, feels my business was a charitable donation to hers, in all the great ideas she has taken. Kat has someone calling himself her boyfriend, come in my shop and contacting me in public places and this is just way to creepy for me. She started using the dog logo and advertising with the fancy hand writing fonts similar to what we have been using on my sign and also, she has been using dog prints like on my sign. She doesnt seem to realize she is a thrift shop. Is it so possible to be so completely talent less as to neglect to come up with your own ideas? Soon after this, the guy calling himself Kats boyfriend, calls again wanting to bring their dog in my shop and so, we ignored the call, why would we do business with these people? Then, several weeks later, he meets me in a public place and wants to know why we dont call him? Maybe its  like out of a fatal attraction movie! If they think they will take from us with out a fight they got something new coming! You will see a one woman, higher powered, little human rights organization in action. The groomer/owner of this grooming shop, has worked very, very hard, at creating a business, in developing a skill, acquiring knowledge, buying equipment, maintaining equipment, challenging financial investments, insurance, many, many hours, at least Seven years of commitment and charity work in going to grooming school, purchasing literature and the development of a clientele. All my life decisions, for the last 7 years, have been centered around creating and providing a necessary service for the community of dogs, and dog people. I work nights, weekends and Sundays. A groomer must work for years without profit to develop a business and clientele. We network with veterinarians and we particularly, have taken classes in veterinary medicine. Ditto for all my education in the medical field. For another business, to come and try to skim the cream off of my hard work, is hardly what is called humanitarianism and definitely not considered ethical to those with a conscious or with good critical thinking skills. Apparently, female, small business entrepreneurs, are not on copy Kats list of endangered species. We think that starting our own charitable organization dedicated to the ethical, and humane treatment of dog groomers and dog related workers, is an awesome idea. This controversy has all been very discouraging for me, we even thought of changing our name, however, there are obstacles in life and it is still all very rewarding to me, when my customers, human and dog alike are happy and satisfied. My pay and reward has been and still is, the look of reassurance the dogs and customers give me, when they know they are safe and in good hands. If we did change our name, me, actually being creative, would come up with something others would covet also, and so, it could happen again. So, we choose not to run from this.

Each animal gets individual attention and lots of love. 3 of my donkeys were in bad shape when they came into the rescue but thanks to Ann and SYA, they are now thriving.  
Save Your Ass Long Ear Rescue	27141	1	/users/profile/28183	bonnie2	Donor	5	02/05/2010	Save Your Ass Long Ear Rescue is a great organization that rescues, cares for, and finds good home for donkeys and mules that have been abused, neglected, or are just no longer wanted.  These beautiful animals come to the farm in pretty bad shape, many never having been handled with kindness.  The women who 'run' this organization are very much hands on experienced donkey & mule owners who know how to provide these wonderful animals with the environment, care, and training they so desperately need.
New Hampshire Rivers Council	169099		/users/profile/224117	Burklister	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/11/2013	River Network has had a strong partnership with New Hampshire Rivers Council for nearly 20 years. Over that time, we have seen them become the leading advocate for the protection and restoration of all water resources throughout the state.  As the corporate engagement director at River Network, I contacted NHRC four years ago to see if they would be interested in developing a volunteer event in conjunction with local Anheuser-Busch brewery employees. Not only did they enthusiastically take on this new task, they since have annually grown the scale, scope and involvement of other local agencies and organizations in this project. This on-going effort has led to better water quality in McQuesten Brook, which supports one of the states highest quality populations of self-sustaining wild brook trout.  River Network is proud to work with New Hampshire Rivers Council, and if you care about the rivers in NH, please contact them to see how you can get involved. 
New Hampshire Rivers Council	167899		/users/profile/179447	naturesource	Volunteer	5	09/06/2013	What can you say about an organization that formed nearly thirty years ago a a grassroots, bottom-up group to get state  legislation passed to protect its rivers and then kept at it by being a watchdog and steward. This organization represents its members by reaching out to them with training and to get their feedback on its priorities. While other organizations might be there for its board members' or staffs' agendas, this one really represents its members and does so much with so little.

Since playing my first show there last fall, I have turned 18 and started playing at bars in Boston, such as the Middle East.  It is not easy to get shows like this, but using the Sad Cafe as a stepping stone gave me the confidence to persevere and pursue my passion of music.  The adults in charge are exceptionally friendly and willing to give advice to help young musicians.  It would be a shame to see them go. I became familiar with them very recently, and I have just become aware of how vast their impact has been on the arts for young people in the area.  Yes, I encourage everyone to donate what they can, but the best donation you can make is the price of admission to a show there.  It benefits the organization and also the young musicians who will have a bigger audience!

I was very impressed with the layout of the indoor clinic. It was obvious that every comfort and need was addressed for specific animals. Being a veterinary technician, Deb knew exactly what to do for the raccoon from pain management, antibiotics to dietary and housing needs. She is so educated and follows it up with a glowing personality. I have a sanctuary/rescue for horses and poultry and know the dedication it takes to give all of yourself at all times for the animals. Deb does this with grace and wisdom. It is a blessing that we have this facility with Deb Gode who devotes her passion into this desperately needed rehabilitation center.

Rolling Dog Farm	156543		/users/profile/200533	Cathy47	General Member of the Public	5	04/28/2013	Several years ago I worked for a horse farm in SC. One of the mares had a baby girl, and she had no eyes. The owner and the vet were going to put her down, but I checked online and found Rolling Dog Ranch in Montana. I wrote them to see if they could help, although I thought it would go nowhere. I did get an email back and contacted them. They were willing to come get the baby, even though she was so young. They sent supplies and had a trailer there soon after. It was hard separating the baby from her mom, but there was another horse on the trailer and that helped. She made it to Montana and they named her Destiny. Ever since then, Rolling Dog Farm has had my support. I kept up with details on Destiny, and even after she was gone with news on their dogs, cats, and other horses. This charity is wonderful, and I would recommend it to all! It gives hope and joy to animals who would otherwise be put down, and to see them and keep up with their stories is so wonderful.  They have my full support!

What the staff have done and continue to do toward the caring of my children is such a relief of stress and burden for me and my wife, since we must have the dual incomes in today's economy. The Wolfeboro Area Children's Center is unique in that they offer more than just child care in the typical sense of the term. The people there  care for kids from infancy to school age. They offer meals. They offer a learning environment. The Center has tuition assistance, an onsite social worker, a preschool-special needs program, a before-and-after school program for school-age children, and so much more. Our community is better because of this wonderful place.
Vision International Mission	275432	1	/users/profile/365052	Writer	Volunteer	5	01/03/2016	I have gone on mission trips to Guatemala and Haiti through this volunteer organization so I write this review having first-hand, direct experience.  This is a volunteer organization headed by Ken Whitten who has been traveling on missions around the world for 30 years.  With a Haitian-born pastor, Ken opened an orphanage on the island of LaGonave, Haiti, in 2011 which currently provides housing, food and education for 28 children.  Most of the children have been at the TiPalmiste Community Orphange since it opened.  They are all healthier, well nourished and educated.  Every penny donated is stretched to provide services, medicines, clothing, etc needed for the orphange or any of the other missions in Guatemala, Honduras, Romania, and right here at home in Manchester, NH or Dorchester, MA.  They reach out to the homeless, the poor and the orphaned bringing much needed food, meds and supplies and the word of Jesus.  I promise your donation will go far.  Only a very small percentage goes to overhead of having a small office & storage room in a warehouse facility, electric, internet and office supplies.  God bless Ken and his family for their efforts and God bless you for donating.  Jeanie Gorski

We stopped at the Citizens's for a Seacoast Aquarium booth where he picked one duck and won a bottle of bubbles. I paid for the duck with a $20 bill and inadvertently left without my change. I hurried right back to the booth, which was manned by 2 males and explained I had not received my change. They both were very sarcastic and replied "we only had 1 $20 bill and don't remember anyone coming by with a child in a wagon."  I replied "I left here not 1 minute ago." The males repled "well you're wrong" and wouldn't refund me the change. Nasty, rude, sarcastic people manning the booth and I didn't get any change back.

Epilogos Charities Inc	112997		/users/profile/153775	Edward7	Board Member	5	05/25/2012	There are so many good causes! I chose to be on the board of Epilogos Charities because I felt it was an organization that made a lasting difference in a third world community. I had heard too many stories of "Santa Claus" organizations which made no lasting change in a community they served. With Epilogos there is a year round presence and accountability of how money is spent.  The community of San Jose Villanueva(SJV) has a strong sense that they must have some "ownership" of projects. This can be through sweat equity or a monthly payment from their $5 a day salary.                                                                           My first introduction to the community was by participating in a scholarship program. For $180 per year I could send someone to a year of high school. I received a photograph of my student and three report cards each year. The student I had been assigned walked 2 1/2 hours to school in the morning and 2 1/2 hours back in the evening. I know this to be a fact because when I went to her graduation I drove the road she walked everyday so that I could attend a graduation party at her home.                                                                                                            Then there is Mike and Susie Jenkins. They are retired Peace Corp workers who have "retired" to El Salvador.  They have been in SJV for 10 years and have gained the respect and trust of the community.  When I send money for anything I know it will be spent wisely because Mike and Susie are there on a full-time basis overseeing things. As part of their staff they have hired the town's first college graduate, Graciela. She is someone who has a "give back the place where you come from" mentality.  This is a rare quality in a third world country.      Please visit the Epilogos website (www.epilogos.org) to learn much more about  this unique and selfless organization.  Ed Warreh
End 68 Hours Of Hunger	286730		/users/profile/376800	Melani_T	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	I learned of the End 68 Hours of Hunger program back in October of 2014 while having lunch with a friend.  She mentioned the program was attempted to launch in Newmarket NH a few times without success.  I asked her to tell me more about the program.  End 68 Hours of Hunger is a private, not-for-profit, effort to confront the approximately 68 hours of hunger that some school children experience between the free lunch they receive in school on Friday afternoon and the free breakfast they receive in school on Monday morning.  The program is 100% made up of volunteers and 100% of funds go towards the purchase of foods.  These children are food insecure children in our communities whose families perhaps do not have the monies or means to support the children as they would like to or there may be other circumstances preventing the support.When I learned of the program, I knew I had to get this off the ground in my community.  Why?  because I was one of these children for about 5 years of my childhood.  I was also a teen mom and with the support of my children's father, we made it but it wasn't easy.  This program would have helped greatly during our early years of parenthood.  There are children who need the support for a variety of reasons and this really hit home for me.  With the help of that friend from lunch and my incredibly supportive husband, along with the Newmarket Community Church who allows us to house our program at their Thrift Store in a 100 square foot room, we launched End 68 Hours of Hunger Newmarket in February 2015.  We provide backpacks on a weekly basis to 27 food insecure children.  In these backpacks are meals containing 2 breakfasts, 2 lunches, 3 dinners, snacks, fresh fruit, and sometimes a donated surprise and we could not do this without the help from our amazing volunteers and the support of our wondrous community.  We have food drop off locations around our town which has a population total of approx. 9,300.  My husband and I have lived in this quaint New England town for 11 years.  Our town folk have been incredibly supportive with food drives, monetary donations, school supplies donations etc.End 68 Hours of Hunger is in 35 communities across the country but this is why End 68 Hours of Hunger Newmarket is so meaningful to me.http://end68hoursofhunger.org/newmarket-nh/

Granite State Independent Living	280630	1	/users/profile/370555	Writer	Former staff	1	02/21/2016	I worked for GSIL for two years. And was let go or fired a week before Christmas of 2015. Due to be written up for being what they stated I was missing work too much, and not dependable. And wanted me to sign a paper stating this. I thought it was so unfair. As I have been suffering with an medical or health illness that is out of my control. I have been suffering on and off with for a few months. Which could have been spread to the elderly, younger children or people with weak immune systems. I had doctor's notes for every time I had to be out of work, and the reason why, and how long. It isn't some thing I wanted to have to suffer with. As I am sure others with medical or health issues. Don't stand in the front of the line and when they call out, Shingles, Long Term MRSA or any other sort of illness. I don't stand in front of the line so to speak and raise my hand to be sick and miss work. As I am sure no one else does either. And people have no control of what they are dealt with through out their lives. They have to handle it the best they can. I understand NH. has no rules or regulations, they can fire at will. Which I think is awful if a company lets some one go, do to medical or health problems or even mental health issues, again out of some ones control. And GSIL is a CONSUMER BASED ORGANIZATIONS: WHICH MEANS THE PERSON OR PATIENT OR THEIR FAMILY WHO HIRES YOU, IS THE ONE THAT HAS THE RIGHT TO LET YOU GO. And I know the person I worked for two years very well. And this person liked me, thought I was a good worker, hard worker, was pleased with my work and the care I gave to them.  And was expecting me back to work along with my fellow co-workers as my doctor's note had stated. And this person or patient that hired me, before they would have fired me or let me go, would have spoken to me, asked why I was missing so much work, and would have given me a warning, or said that my hours had to be filled, as this person needed their care meet also, so my hours would have been given to others who wanted and could do more hours. And when I returned to work, it could have been just fill in, until hours opened back up. And I would have understood. But for GSIL, a home health agency, a consumer based home health agency, with nursing staff, helping and taking care of patients or people that can not do to some reason or other. You think being a home health agency, they would understand, and take into consideration that workers or human also, and get sick too. And if they have a doctor's note, and do every thing by procedure to make sure the patient and that the company knows what is going on. Letting go, firing a worker or saying they are not a dependable or a good worker do to missing work, because of a medical or health problem out of the persons control. THE GSIL, HOME HEALTH AGENCY, SHOULD BE ASHAMED, EMBARRASSED ON WHAT THEY DID TO ME, AND HOW THEY MAY TREAT OTHERS. THEY SHOULD RETHINK THEIR EXPATATIONS ON WHAT MAKES A WORKER, A DEPENDABLE PERSON, A GOOD WORKER, A HARD WORKER. A WORKER SHOULDN'T BE BASED ON NOT BEING DEPENDABLE, OR NOT A GOOD WORKER DO TO MEDICAL, HEALTH OR MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS OUT OF THE PERSONS CONTROL. SO I FIND THIS TO BE AWFUL, THEY SHOULD BE EMBARRASSED AND ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES FOR WHAT THEY DID TO ME. AND HOW THEY CONDUCT THEIR HOME HEALTH AGENCY. AS IF THEY DO THIS OR TREAT THEIR WORKERS LIKE THIS. AS A PATIENT SEEKING HOME HEALTH CARE OR A LOVED ONE LOOKING FOR HOME HEALTH CARE FOR A LOVED ONE, IS REALLY A HOME HEALTH AGENCY YOU WANT CARING FOR SOME ONE YOU LOVE, IF THEY HAVE THAT LITTLE VALUES IN THEIR COMPANY????? SOME THING GOOD TO THINK ABOUT BEFORE CHOOSING GSIL FOR LOVED ONES. 
Back In The Saddle Equine Therapy Center	99436		/users/profile/119488	Jeannette C	Volunteer	5	10/18/2011	Hunter, who is on the Autism spectrum, had his first lesson.  A handsome, 6-yr old, he fought getting on the horse and in only two minutes, signed all done. Through it all he covered his ears and was very resistant to any activity at all. He would not touch or brush the horse.     At his 8th lesson, he mounted the horse with almost no help; held the reins, sat up straight -  posted 5x times in each direction! smiling, totally engaged. He brushed his horse, helped put the saddle away and thanked everyone! Hunter arrives in Nanas lap at BITS. (She needs a wheelchair.) Grampa drives them as he no longer can work, but helps his wife raise their Grandson. He used to just watch.  But on this day, the volunteer, who sidewalks with the client, was late, Grampa was asked to sidewalk.  It was hard to tell which person received the most joy from the lesson, Hunter or Grampa!  And a new volunteer was born. Many retired volunteers are working to raise funds to help BITS - financially. The Center wants to offer scholarships to parents. BITS ETCs goal is to have everyone ride free or for a nominal payment  scholarships picking up the real costs.  Now the veterans program begins.  A chance for our heroes to experience the healing power of horses.  Not just the veterans, but their families will take part in care and handling of our equine therapists.   Im very grateful that I can participate as a 69 year old volunteer! Jeannette Cagle Learn more at: www.bitsetc.org

Share Outreach Incorporated	120055	1	/users/profile/163224	spage	Donor	1	08/05/2012	The website was not user friendly I had to enter my donation five times before it went through starting over at the beginning each time which was very frustrating I almost gave up and wanted to mail a check.  I finally figured out that I needed to click back on the "Basket" but there was no easy link to that.  The card option only had part of the word "sympathy" printed which made me wonder if that is how the email would be sent to the recipient  When I received my receipt I would have liked to have seen my note and the system of delivery to the recipient noted.  This is no reflection on the work done by "Share Outreach, Inc." which is amazing but a comment on the donor platform designed which is poor and not at all intuitive. Suzanne Page

What I liked best was the format of hearing from experts in the field, and then hearing from the callers who are just parents like myself.  I think this combination works extremely well for this type of show. Childhool Matters went off the air for some time, and I missed it. Several years later, I gave birth to identical twins boys.  When my twins were 4 yrs old, my marriage fell apart just around the time I was trying to convince my husband that something wasn't right with them.  It was such a difficult and emotional time.  I remembered one of Rona's shows from years before because I remembered how interesting it was:  about Autism.  I did my own computer research and decided "that's what my twins have!" and this eventually led to a successful diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder.  Since they are high-functioning, it looked like just a language delay and difficult behavior, but finally I was relieved to know it was a real disorder and that I could now work on the treatments.  I was working with Contra Costa Child Care Council and went to one of their events one day, and there was Rona at a booth.  I went over and met her, and my tears just wouldn't hold back because it was due to her show that I realized as a parent, I should follow my gut no matter what everyone else said.  Basically I was the only one show believed there was something wrong with my twins.  And I give that credit to Childhood Matters, because this show really advocates for children.  It was because of this show, that I even suspected Autism.  Before that, I knew nothing about this disorder.  I have been an avid listener, and when I can't listen to the show live I listen later on podcast. I have also been a regular participant because I feel with my experiences I have a lot to offer.  This show is truly about giving valuable information to caregivers (not only parents) in our community.  They say it takes a village to raise a child, and Childhood Matters is exactly about bringing us all together for that purpose.  To me, this show is a valuable resource and has touched on so many topics that are relevent to my family.
Lil Iguanas Childrens Saftey Foundation	42345	6	/users/profile/43062	amethyst	Client Served	5	05/31/2010	My son was only 3 years old when Lil Iguana came in to his preschool to teach the little ones about stranger danger, stop drop and roll and run yell and tell.  When I picked him up from school that day I was really surprised that they were teaching about these things at such a tender young age - however - three months later when he was at a home daycare - he was sexually assaulted by the 14 year old boy who had been left for a couple of hours to watch him and the other child there during their nap time.  Thank GOD he had learned to TELL from the Lil Iguana - within a few days he told us about the "bad boy" who touched his "pickle" and "put his pickle in my mouth".  Because he was EDUCATED - and in a way that he could understand as a three year old by the BEAUTIFUL Lil Iguana program - we were able to not only find out about the incident but were also able to successfully get the young man prosecuted so that he could receive the help he needed and were able to take the action to get my child into therapy right away so that there has been no long term damage to him and his psyche.  I would NEVER wish this experience on anyone - you can imagine it was one of the most horrific experiences of my life.  Thank GOD that the Lil Iguana program was there for us.  We brought the Lil Iguana right over to the house after my son told us so that he could be validated directly that he had done the right thing by telling.  I have since volunteered to serve on the Board and this foundation will have my life long support I can tell you that - this non-profit is better than GREAT!  They work miracles and plant the seeds of wisdom and personal protection for children every day in every way!
School Kids In Peterborough	294038		/users/profile/384746	sbevans	General Member of the Public	1	06/28/2016	The office staff are rude and very snarky to the children. I dropped my son off and he didn't want to stay. He said he had a bad feeling and so did I. I had to go to work so I had a friend pick him up early. The very first thing they did was to threaten legal action. Not what can we do to make this better. They refused to give a refund. After I had told them not to cash my check for the following week, they did anyway. Maria is impossible. READ THE CONTRACT COMPLETELY. Even if you are unsatisfied, there is NO REFUND. Please don't make the same mistake I did. Or at the very least, tour the facility beforehand. I wish I had.

FAMILIES IN TRANSITION	112325	2	/users/profile/152854	rebecca421	Client Served	5	05/17/2012	I would just like to let everyone kknow what this organization has done for me and my family. I moved into their housing program in may of 2008 into their family willows building, it was built for women, and women with children who are facing issues with addiction and/or trauma. Not only did they give me and my family a place to call home, they providied me with a treatment cooridinater, therapist, intensive outpatient program and many groups along with childcare. They also opened The family place therapeutic pre-school for three and four year old children whose parents are participants in fit programming, my youngest daughter has been in the pre-school for two years and loves it, she is going to kindergarten in September and I willl miss the preschool and the staff dearly. They have done so much for my daughter and have given her oppurtunityies that I could never have afforded to give her right now. This program has saved my life and because of them I went from being a homless drug addicted parent to being clean and sober for over four years and I am one year away from my bachelor's degree in human services. I no longer live in their program, I have since graduated successfully in April of 2012, and live in the community, but i remain committed to giving back to this wonderful organization and I love everything they stand for., so I volunteer as a peer advocate leader and recovery coach for families in transition and remain in close contact with the organization. I truly believe they helped me to go from just barely surviving, to being a productive and functioning member of society. I live each day with so much gratitude for what I have, and I have learned that with the right support nothing is out my reach, They also taught me that it is never to late to turn my life around regardless of the mistakes I have made. I can achieve anything I put my mind to and become a better person for myself and my children. I have gained my independance and my self esteem with the help of Families in Transition and one day I only hope I can work for a non-profit such as families in transition and give back all the knowledge I was given to others who feel helpless and hopeless too.

Concord Family Ymca	108238		/users/profile/147315	Bert Cooper	Client Served	5	03/23/2012	This is a terrific community organization.  It really is a "core organization" for the Concord community.  Socially, people of all economic backgrounds interact, and people of all ages can be found using the facilities.  In an era when finances are tight, the availability of free babysitting makes it possible to use the good facilities, and the monthly "Family Fun Fridays" is a great program for families with children, whether members or not.  We have friends who take advantage of the opportunities to donate their time to the Y in exchange for membership, which makes it possible for people who would find it a financial stretch to actually join, and to benefit from all the wonderful programs.  It is hard to go to the Y without meeting your friends and neighbors, or your children's friends and parents. I could go on, but as far as an organization which contributes to the social fabric and physical health of a community, the Concord Y rates at the top.  Thank you to all the sponsors and donors to this great organization!

I now have a beautiful baby boy that has brought the greatest joy to my life. Thank you Birthright and to all the donors that make such a service possible, thank you. God bless.

Seacoast Ski Club	200552		/users/profile/261810	cWELLS	General Member of the Public	1	05/19/2014	This is a ski club that should not be a non-profit organization. It collects money from members and has a Board. The Board as well as Trip Leaders go on FREE TRIPS at the expense of the members. 80% of the Trip Leaders or members are middle-age, divorced, self-absorbed, narcisistic alchoholic women. If you are looking to ski, forget it. This club is about drinking and paying for Free trips for the Trip Leaders and Board. The Trip Leaders ask members to sign up for Trips, the Board chooses the trips, NOT THE CLUB MEMBERS, even though they say they do.  Based on the number of members that sign up for trips, escorted by Trip Leaders, the Trip Leaders get free air fare and hotels. That's what they do with the non-profit money. Also, if you pay over $2,000 for a trip, you are not allowed to get a receipt. There are no receipts, so what happens if you can't take the trip, lose the money, unless you have insurance.

Computer Technology Assistance Corps	219576		/users/profile/283171	JALore	Volunteer	5	10/03/2014	I started with CTAC-NH.org, shortly after it's opening over 3 years ago.  I mostly work as a tech on Saturdays , but also have represented them at fairs, and have collected used computers from various sources for them, and have even sold some of heir products as well. They do a good job of making sure the system functions properly and works to keep the costs as low as possible for it's customer.  We securely wipe all hard drives as the 1st procedure when they come in the door.  We even offer a certificate of that fact if needed for the donars records.  Most often anything you donate can be written off as a tax deduction.  That is something you need to check with your tax preparer on.   We install Windows 7 and do all the updates, as well as add some verfy good, free, working programs that help maintain the operation of the system.  We also do repairs, and we will do the repairs that most other places will not, and at a cost well below anyone else may charge you. We service both the regular consumer and corporate customer, and the special circumstnces indiviual and other non profits and schools.  Is it free, no!  Is it cheap, not really!  But it is relativly inexpenssive and helpful to the community. If you have any older IT equipment, of any type, plase bring to us so we can repurpose and recycle it so those who can't aford a brand new are not left behind. we are now located at 100 willow st.  manchester, NH
Ladies Aid Society Of Hillsborough Lower Village	234080		/users/profile/298175	Chamber_Admin	General Member of the Public	5	11/20/2014	This is a terrific charity that has been in operation for over 100 years. Their primary purpose as I understand it is to preserve the Union Chapel located in the lower village. I am sure there is more they do. A few years ago, they worked hard to get this building on the National Historic Register. 100 years ago the members of the Ladies Aid Society paid 25 in membership dues. The dues today are still 25.
Wildlife Heritage Foundation Of New Hampshire	8607	1	/users/profile/10337	woonsie@juno.com	General Member of the Public	1	08/04/2009	In my experience with the officers and staff of the Wildlife Heritage Foundation of New Hampshire, I found that they are mis-representing themselves with the IRS and with Guidestar, and therefore, the public, as an organization that does wildlife preservation and protection. The truth, however, is that the Foundation's sole mission is to raise funds for the New Hampshire Fish & Game Department. In August 2009 it is in fact auctioning to the highest bidder 5 moose hunting permits to raise money. The Foundation is not about "preservation" of wildlife, and they are not protecting these 5 moose from the gun. The Foundation needs to begin to reveal its true mission, which is to provide financial support for NH Fish & Game's programs that otherwise would go unfunded. This organization needs to treat the public honestly and fairly.

Healing Rooms Of Southern Vermont	234332		/users/profile/298491	justbe	General Member of the Public	5	11/23/2014	I was brought to The Healing  Rooms of Sothern Vt  Several months ago by a friend whom had been there many times before and simply loved Pastor Todd and his wife Dawn.  I went along bringing only my curiosity and my belief in something greater than myself, oh yes , and my ever so painful lower back. You see I had had surgery some 30 years earlier on my spine to remove a bone tumor (non cancerous) and had been in pain ever sense.  Those of you who have had a bone hacked into you know what I mean...Its never the same... It hurts when its cold it hurts when it rains, it hurts when its foggy, it hurts when it snows, it hurts when...Pastor Todd came over to me with his mighty band of healers andwellwhat can I say...They layed there hands upon me!At first the pain became unbearable,  He encouraged me to breath thru it,  I did, I did and I did some more.  Just when I thought I was going to drop to the ground from the pain, it  completely stopped hurting.  Just like that.  It stopped.  I can honestly say, I was with out pain for the better part of 6mo.  no joke.  6mo of no pain from my lower back?!?!?!??!!!! It has come back,  the pain, but perhaps our pain is pealed away in layers, the layers in which it was layed upon us to begin with.I know I will Keep going back and going back and going back...until all my layers are peeled away and gone for good!  I highly recommend this to anyone who has the courage to be healed- I mean really Healed!!!!!  Its not recommended for people who need to hang on to there pain for what ever reason.Jaye Foster
Regional Services And Education Center Inc	204570		/users/profile/266594	faczme	General Member of the Public	2	06/29/2014	I certainly would not recommend this school at all. They are not who they say they are.  They proclaim to be a "therapeutic" school that focuses on self esteem  and compassion, that's a total joke... If there so compassionate, and care so much about the students, tell me why a member of my child's IEP team thought it was more important to take a leisurely jog around the school, rather than attend my the IEP meeting?   They did not like my child for some reason, and had every intention of getting rid of him, by writing him up for every insignificant move he made, might I add my son was an honor roll student.Also, if your child is involved in an incident, the staff doesn't take the time to notify you right away, your lucky if your told about it 1-2 weeks after it happened.   Horrible communication between staff and faculty.....When we interviewed the school, one of the staff members boasted how he had a military background and had experience and was successful dealing with a multitude of kids in that school who had come in with complicated issues.  Really? If that's the case why was my child out the door, without the common courtesy of being told why they no longer wanted him there.This school  grossly traumatized my child, now he thinks less of himself and has a hard time trusting anyone.  They never prepared him for this, or took I to consideration how this would affect him mentally, and emotionally.   This is a school who raves self esteem, and compassion. So if your considering this school, best beware.. They'll come across very charming and compassionate, and make you think they are the ultimate answer to your child's problems. Don't believe them, don't get reeled in like we did.   It's just a smoke screen to get you in the door, they are extremely pretentious, play favorites with the students, and if they don't like yours for whatever reason, they'll embellish all sorts of incidences just to get your child out the door....In my opinion the entire staff and faculty needs to be re- trained in self esteem, compassion, patience, and dealing  with kids that have complicated issues, because they are certainly lacking in these skills PLEASE DO YOUR HOMEWORK IF CONSIDERING  THIS SCHOOL, AND KEEP YOUR OPTIONS OPENED!

FRIENDS OF THE OGLALA LAKOTA	102701	1	/users/profile/135226	Bruce8	Donor	5	12/29/2011	This organization does a wonderful job of informing the public about the issues and challenges faced by the Oglala Lakota people, most of who live on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota.  At least here in the East, most people have completely forgotten about Native Americans (unless they own casinos) and have no idea about the conditions in which many of them live.  The organization is also working to improve their lives through such things as book donations and scholarships.  In the organization's newsletter you can follow the stories of individual Lakota that are being helped.   These volunteers are doing important work on a tight budget and deserve your support!

The Concord Community Music School	108245		/users/profile/147315	Bert Cooper	Client Served	5	03/23/2012	As a parent of two young children who enjoyed a wonderful singing program ("Purple Finches") at the school, I can say that they really have dedicated, passionate teachers who love what they do, and the students pick up that vibe.  While my young children are "over-committed" and we haven't taken advantage of the opportunity to learn a musical instrument at the school, the school's reputation is excellent.  The music teachers are well-respected musicians and performers in their own right (e.g. we had Paul Dysktra and Gregg Pauley as piano soloists for the Granite State Symphony Orchestra) and my daughter's friends have learned amazingly fast with the Suzuki violin program.  We've enjoyed listening to the students and faculty perform at different times - just beautiful music!  To look at the breadth and scope of the activities at the school gives some sense of the dedication, drive, and ability of the President, Peggy Senter, who stands out in the Concord nonprofit (and business) community for her ability to "make things happen" and grow the school to its present size and importance in the community.  Not only do they have an incredible breadth in their programs, but they also offer possibilities for students who might not be financially able to attend.  They help anchor a culture of performing arts in the capital region.

Lisbon Regional School Education Foundation	54987		/users/profile/56962	guest	General Member of the Public	1	10/21/2010	This is a sham organization created by New England Wire Technologies in an attempt to purloin the assets of a California Corporation.  A 2003 arbitration panel ruled to this affect, and nullified the sale of New England Wire Technologies interest in the California corporation to the Lisbon Regional School Education Foundation, but due to a California judge who was suffering a degenerative brain disease the arbitration was thrown out resulting in a new arbitration ruling that was diametrically opposed to the 2003 award. In February 2008 the California Appeals court reversed the trial courts order and reinstated the 2003 arbitration award. The California Supreme Court refused to here New England Electric Wire Corporation's appeal to reverse the California Appellate courts ruling. Many of the members who sit on the board of this organization are either lifetime friends of the Chairman of New England Wire technologies, an employee of the company, or a close relative of a company employee.

Marguerites Place Inc	46348	1	/users/profile/47213	pamme-boutselis	Volunteer	5	06/29/2010	I have known of and supported Marguerite's Place since its inception many years ago. Initially, my Girl Scout troop baked goodies for the children in the daycare and also donated children's books that the kids living at Marguerite's Place would be able to personally own since many arrived at there without their own personal items due to whatever situation they had been in prior to their arrival at Marguerite's Place. We went on to donate to the moms on occasion, trying to come up with special items that they wouldn't be able to obtain for themselves and would appreciate having. As the years went by, I became involved with Marguerite's Place on both a professional and personal level and have assisted with marketing and PR efforts as well as special event and fundraisers. I currently head up the Friends of Marguerite's Place, which is a supportive group that raises funds for programming and helps out wherever asked, from clean up efforts to maintenance and on site assistance in the daycare and preschool. The staff at Marguerite's Place is so dedicated and caring, and the work they accomplish with these women and their children is amazing as are the families themselves. There is a saying at Marguerite's Place, which is this: "We like to give a hand up, not a hand out," and it is completely apt. With its extensive programs, including a five year aftercare program, the results are both impressive and humbling. The staff truly cares about the residents of Marguerite's Place and becomes an extended family to all who live there. I continue to volunteer and recommend Marguerite's Place to others who are looking to give back and help others because I have seen firsthand what a difference its mission makes in the lives of so many women and children.
TLC Family Resource Center previously know as GOOD BEGINNINGS OF SULLIVAN COUNTY	150659	1	/users/profile/200908	GBadmin	Board Member	5	03/07/2013	Good Beginnings of Sullivan County is a safety net for families that need/want to find ways to improve interpersonal relationships with family members.  Our staff of well trained caring women go into homes or help at the office.  Our thrift store provides reasonably priced access to quality gently used clothing, toys, and  household goods. It has been an honor and a pleasure to  volunteer for GBSC since 1995.  It was fun going into homes and helping new mothers, transporting folks to doctors' appointments, trips to the store, or to the park for a play day.  My time has been a gift to the community which has in turn made my life richer. I treasure the friendships of the staff for each other and for me.  No finer women exist. Char Delabar
HANDICAPPED PETS FOUNDATION	88373		/users/profile/99402	Leslie DG	Professional with expertise in this field	1	05/04/2011	I am the owner of Eddie's Wheels for Pets,  Handicapped Pets Foundation was formed as a means of marketing Walkin Wheels, a canine wheelchair company owned by the director of  Handicapped Pets. I had the company investigated by the attorney general of NH because altho they purport to assist people in need of mobility aids for disabled pets, the only ones they are willing to provide are the ones they directly profit from - contributions to this foundation assist in the healthy profit margin for a one-size fits all dog wheelchair mass produced in China.

Coalition For Open Democracy	311408		/users/profile/402757	doreend01	Volunteer	5	10/17/2016	i have volunteered with Coalition for Open Democracy for several years.  The organization has worked tirelessly to bring attention to the matter of Big Money in Politics and the need for campaign finance reform to the voters of America.  I believe that was accomplished with their NH Rebellion project.  Consistently bird-dogging presidential candidates during the NH primary forced the issue to the forefront of political discussions. Every single candidate addressed it at least one time.

Big Brothers Big Sisters Of New Hampshire	286499		/users/profile/376569	Kimberly_Y	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	Childhood is where it all begins. We're always hearing about how children are the future, but so few step up to try and shape this future. That's why I became a Big Sister. After a few short months, I saw my Little Sister blossom in ways that she never dreamed possible. One of the greatest moments in my life was the first time I actually saw her smile. That's why I donate my time to Big Brothers Big Sisters of New Hampshire. I don't have much money, but giving my time is such a rewarding experience. Every day, I see young people who are in desperate need of someone to care about; someone to change their lives for the better, forever. Some of them have parents in prison. Many of them are living in poverty. All of them want nothing more than to have a caring adult in their lives. It's amazing what a few hours each month can do for one of these children. There are still so many on the waiting list, just hoping every day that they will be matched with a Big who will care about them. It takes $1,200 to sustain a match for one year, so Big Brothers Big Sisters of New Hampshire could use every penny they can get to continue changing lives.http://www.bbbsnh.org/site/c.8oLHKNPmE6LQH/b.8965789/k.F13D/Home_Page.htm
Child Development Council Inc	282097		/users/profile/372212	Spunky1	Client Served	5	03/10/2016	CDC does business as Kingston Children's Center in Kingston.  It is a wonderful daycare and summer camp open from 6am to 6pm.  The staff are well-trained, experienced and very caring to all the children.  They also accept children with special needs, which is why my daughters have gone there for over 10 years.  My younger daughter has Down syndrome, and she has been nurtured and loved there from the start.  You can't ask for anything more.
Concord Area Trust For Community Housing	47733	1	/users/profile/48468	cgerhan	Volunteer	5	07/03/2010	CATCH Community Housing works to provide quality affordable housing for those in the Concord, NH area who seek a safe place to live on a limited budget, usually as employed family raisers or retired people. CATCH also provides financial counseling and guidance for those seeking to buy their home and stabilize their finances. CATCH currently has 239 affordable rental apartments and houses 559 adults and children. More are in the planning, development and/or construction process.My experience with CATCH has been as a volunteer Board and Committee leader and member in a variety of working, managing, and administrative functions, including financial, developmental and personnel oversight.For a period of over fifteen years of involvement, I have been pleasantly and positively impressed with the quality of CATCH's efforts and the success of its results in meeting a significant part of the housing need locally. While much remains to be done, and the continued support and involvement of every local citizen is urgently needed, it is clear that CATCH is on the right path to making a safe, quality home available to all.
Peace And Paws	104237		/users/profile/139745	Caitlin N.	Client Served	5	01/23/2012	Peace And Paws brought me my Best Friend, Nicki. They literally brought him to me. I found This little border collie mix pup on Petfinder and i went to the website for the rescue that had him, Peace and paws, and even though i realized they were located in New Hampshire and i myself live in Virginia, i asked if it would be possible for me to adopt the puppy.  They approved my application, they  were very nice and  worked with me and my special situation. We worked out a way that i could meet the transport somewhere closer to where i live, since the puppy was being rescued from a kill shelter in Mississippi.  I met the transport only an hour or so away from where i live and they handed me complete medical records and my wonderful and healthy baby boy who has given me nothing but love ever since. Thank you Peace ad Paws! 
Draft Gratitude	286831		/users/profile/376901	Rebecca_R	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	Draft Gratitude Saves Lives.Finding a horse with an injury tied at an auction barn is heart-wrenching.Captain was tied, waiting for someone to save him. He had a badly irritated eye with tears draining down his face.  An otherwise healthy and well trained horse was about to be sold for slaughter. Draft Gratitude stepped up and rescued Captain!Captains eye tested positive for Squamous Cell Carcinoma. Draft Gratitude had his eye removed to prevent the cancer from spreading to his skull and to provide him with comfort.  He was an absolute trooper throughout the process.  He has had his hooves trimmed, his teeth floated, his vaccines updated, and is microchipped.  He is provided with quality feed, care, and love each and every day. He has since stolen many of our hearts!  Captain is grateful, kind, and forgiving even after all that he has been though.Captain is just one of many draft horses that has been saved by Draft Gratitude. There are tens of thousands more out there that need saving.There is a steady supply of draft horses that end up being sold for slaughter every day.  Many of these are experienced farm horses that still have a lot of life to live.  They are often quiet, well trained, and able to perform light work. These horses have worked tirelessly their entire lives.  They have earned the right to have a safe retirement.These kind and forgiving souls deserve to be safe.  This is why I support Draft Gratitude.
Union Village Community Association	241652		/users/profile/328257	Lawyerlady49	Volunteer	5	04/24/2015	Union Village Community Association started out with a wish for more community, and we held our first block party several years ago, down by the resource center, and complete with lots of music, a cake-walk and games. Now UVCA owns the historic mill dam and the mill building beside it and is in the process of renovating both.  We could really use your help - attend a function, donate, or help with one of the work days.
NEW HAMPSHIRE CHILDRENS TRUST INC	129163		/users/profile/174521	Monique H.	Board Member	5	10/25/2012	Being a board member of the NH Childrens Trust, has opened my eyes to the need of helping children and families in NH.  This organization far exceeds expectations for nonprofits.  They really are able to use every last resource available to reach as many families and children throughout the entire state.  Their help with programs around the state make a huge impact to improving the community and welfare of children and families.  Their goal to eliminate child abuse and neglect by developing and implementing strategies.                                                                                                                                                            The New Hampshire Childrens Trust (NHCT) is mandated as the Governors Designated Statewide Prevention Agency under CBCAP , as the New Hampshire Chapter of Prevent Child Abuse America (PCAA), and as a member of the National Alliance of Childrens Trust & Prevention Funds (The Alliance).  Founded in 1986 as the New Hampshire Childrens Trust Fund, a quasi-governmental organization, the agency transitioned to the New Hampshire Childrens Trust, Inc., a 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation in 2011.   Last year close to 1000 children were victims of substantiated child abuse and neglect in New Hampshire. Of particular concern, are the nearly 300 who were infants and toddlers. The long term consequences of such abuse are unacceptable. The New Hampshire Childrens Trust is committed to reducing the number of young victims to zero by reaching them early! We are focusing our resources on this most vulnerable population with strategies designed to break the cycle of abuse and neglect and create a generation of children free from harm:  Period of PURPLE Crying program in all maternity hospitals: educating parents about understanding and safely managing normal infant crying and the dangers of shaking an infant. Healthy Families America home visiting program: striving to provide expectant and new parents with the education and support they need.Strengthening Families Approach: building a familys strengths, resilience and skills to prevent child abuse and neglect.Child Abuse & Neglect Prevention: training and support for Early Childhood Educators, Social Workers, Parent Educators and other child & family providers.Advocacy and public policy work around child abuse and neglect.State Leadership to coordinate a state child abuse and neglect prevention plan. http://nhctf.org/About/index.html

Weathervane Theatre Players Inc	194014		/users/profile/253454	amirah	General Member of the Public	5	02/09/2014	I was truly blown away by the performance RACE.  It was controversial but it made you think.  I applaud all the actors who were brave enough to take the roles on.  It took an unbias look at racism in many forms and on different levels i.e. professional, personal and public perception.  I will be back.  Thank you so much.  Fran Ransom, Canal Fulton,OH  p.s.  Thank you Rebecca Vujanov for inviting me to attend.

Tom Lantos Foundation For Human Rights And Justice	276968		/users/profile/241055	rnswett	Board Member	5	01/18/2016	The Lantos Foundation was established to continue Tom Lantos' proud legacy as an ardent champion for human rights by carrying, in his words, "the noble banner of human rights to every corner of the world." The Lantos Foundation proudly celebrates Religious Freedom as one of our core principles. We believe that all people must be allowed to practice and express their own religious view, or lack thereof, with impunity. As a Holocaust survivor, Tom Lantos knew that one's religion is integral to their being and the ability to practice that religion freely is a basic human right that must be vigilantly protected. While our work aims to protect people of all faiths, a good deal of our Religious Freedom efforts are focused on stemming the tide of anti-Semitism, particularly across the Middle East and Europe.  In 2015, the Lantos Foundation launched our signature Religious Freedom event, the Solidarity Sabbath. In its inaugural year, the Solidarity Sabbath brought together world leaders from 24 countries on a single day to express their support for the fight against anti-Semitism in Europe and North America. We envision the Solidarity Sabbath evolving each year to highlight the plights of other persecuted religions around the world.  The Lantos Foundation is committed to giving voice to global citizens living under brutal regimes that ignore basic rights and use ruthless tactics to maintain their power. By working to promote fairness, justice, and basic citizen protections, we believe that human rights at large are better protected and advanced. To date, our work has focused largely on China and Russia, providing platforms to prisoners and activists in both countries that help tell their stories in an unfiltered way and provide the attention necessary to exact change.  In the near future, the Lantos Foundation plans to launch an annual Rule of Law Lecture, where we intend to provide a prominent political dissident a safe, global platform to offer perspective on Rule of Law issues in his or her home country, the challenges those citizens face, and what can be done to bring productive change. Given the role the global corporations play in modern society's everyday lives, the Lantos Foundation feels strongly that those entities be held accountable for the impact their operations have on citizens around the world and their basic human rights. It is no longer enough to hold only governments responsible for their citizens well-being when corporations can often hold the same amount of influence. We seek to encourage all businesses and business leaders to fully consider the human impact of their work, especially as it relates to basic human rights.  The idea of Corporate Responsibility grew out of a 2007 Congressional hearing in which then House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Tom Lantos scolded Internet executives for violating user privacy rights in authoritarian countries. These practices often resulted in the imprisonment of citizens seeking to use their voices to enact change. Given that background, the Lantos Foundation has a special focus on Internet freedom issues. We also desire to recognize good corporate actors and expose bad corporate actors in a public way. The Lantos Foundation was formed to preserve the incredible legacy of the late Congressman Tom Lantos. His extraordinary life story saw his transformation from a precocious child, to a Holocaust survivor, to an outspoken voice against communism and economics professor, and finally, to a leading voice in Congress. Those experiences gave Tom a vision that shaped generations through his work in education, human rights, and public service. See below to learn more about the projects that further the legacy that Tom so boldy and bravely put forth: www.lantosfoundation.org.
THE WINNIPESAUKEE PLAYHOUSE	198948		/users/profile/259774	NiniBean	Volunteer	5	04/25/2014	Gorgeous new theatre in Meredith NH.  They put on wonderful shows all year round, professional actors in the summer season and community theatre in the off-season.

FRIENDS OF THE MILTON FREE PUBLIC LIBRARY INC	182545		/users/profile/239368	Betty Ann B.	Volunteer	5	10/25/2013	I joined this small nonprofit group 6 months ago because I felt very fortunate to have such a wonderful resource in our small town. The building the Library is housed in was originally the town's only schoolhouse. It was built 137 years ago in a Second French Empire style which makes it very unique compared to other historic buildings in town. The fact that the building is still serving a useful purpose after all these years, while many other comparable structures statewide are empty and abandoned is a tribute to a forward thinking township. The Library serves citizens in neighboring rural communities as well. There is no charge to obtain a library card if you are a U.S. citizen. This makes our Library unique as the emphasis is placed on reading and discovery, not exclusion. " The Friends" is a small but devoted group of volunteers who support the mission of the Library. We are confident that out Library is serving current patron needs and we are committed to insuring the Library's relevance in the future.
New England Grassroots Environment Fund Inc	100504	1	/users/profile/122824	Elaine23	Client Served	5	11/10/2011	I've been a fan of NEGEF for many years - their niche in helping small and informal grassroots groups get organized and be effective on issues they identify themselves is unique and resonates with my deep value for community self determination.  However it was only recently that I became a beneficiary. As a new resident in a town not organized on energy issues but with plenty of community, I with a few others have been trying to crack the nut on building momentum on energy efficiency. We had some good ideas but when Ginny called up regarding our grant application she gave us plenty more. Her and NEGEF's deep roots and networks in local communities here makes their guidance practical and energizing. We're still trying to hit cruising altitude but I feel stronger knowing they've got our back.
