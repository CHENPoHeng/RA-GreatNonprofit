They do counseling if you ask, and give a lot of support (emotional, advocacy, etc.) for all kinds of victims.
Micronesian Legal Services Corp	321907		/users/profile/415460	Jane125	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/23/2017	MLSC does a good job providing legal help to poor people. They have nice people working there who are very competent. They don't take every case, so not everyone gets helped; but if they take your case, you get free legal representation to address your legal problem. Legal work takes time, and they do a good job of sticking to the case until it is finished. They don't take criminal cases, only civil.  They prepare general powers of attorney and affidavits when you need them. They also provide free notary service.
