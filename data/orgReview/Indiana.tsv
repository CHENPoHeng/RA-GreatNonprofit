Mission Guatemala Inc	323568	1	/users/profile/417964	Stephanie287	Volunteer	5	02/21/2017	Mission Guatemala is a world-class organization and I would recommend them to everyone. My husband, 13 year old daughter and I got so much out of the experience and plan on doing it again in the future. It was nice to not only work the mission site but also to learn more about the culture.
Mission Guatemala Inc	323544		/users/profile/254960	Ralston	Volunteer	5	02/21/2017	Mission Guatemala has been a blessing to the Mayan people in San Andres and the surrounding communities.  Most of the MG staff are from the local community and are paid to provide services to the mission team members.  This is my 4th year to work a week on community school projects (concrete play area, classrooms, and 2 school bathrooms).  We work alongside local skilled personnel who are very willing to teach us their construction methods.  The school children are so much fun to play with on breaks.  The MG feeding programs provide healthy food for school lunches.  Hosting more than 40 mission teams a year, MG can complete large projects that benefit the whole community.  The medical, pharmacy, and vision programs at the MG clinic serve many families from San Andres and the surrounding Mayan communities.  
Mission Guatemala Inc	280241		/users/profile/254960	Ralston	Volunteer	5	02/15/2016	Mission Guatemala hires local staff to identify community needs and then helps provide resources and people to meet those needs.  I recently returned from my third trip to work on schools in small communities.  We worked on all-weather play area (2014), bathrooms to replace a pit toilets (2015), and new classrooms this year.  By combining multiple volunteer teams over several months, MG has also built school kitchens and other facilities that Mayan community leaders have deemed their highest priority.  MG also provides medical, dental, eye care, and inexpensive medicines to serve people in these communities.   Housing, food, and transportation are provided so volunteers can totally focus on serving Mayan people in the Guatemalan communities.    
Mission Guatemala Inc	238298		/users/profile/254960	Ralston	Volunteer	5	02/20/2015	Mission Guatemala does amazing work with the people of Guatemala who live in small rural communities.  Their clinic in San Andres Semetabaj provides inexpensive medical with pharamacy, dental, and eye care to whoever needs help.  Some ride the bus up to 2 hours to get low cost health care at the clinic.  The MG staff is mostly native to Guatemala, which helps the communication with those being served.   Our church helped MG build an all-weather soccer/basketball court at Sucun last year and with constructing a new restroom for students at Marie Del Carmen school this year.  The restroom replaces the current pit toilet being used by the students.  The MG team provides good construction supervision and uses local materials that are purchased by the volunteers.  Working at 8.000 feet in small mountain communities can be a challenge building things, but the MG team always found ways to overcome or work around every construction problem we encountered.  I plan to return again next year to serve the wonderful people of Guatemala, and I thank God that Mission Guatemala provides us this opportunity to "go into all the world" for mission work.
Mission Guatemala Inc	195056		/users/profile/254960	Ralston	Volunteer	5	03/02/2014	Mission Guatemala provides a bridge of hope that allowed our church to connect with Native Guatemalans and help meet their needs all while making new friends.  MG is well organized and works hard to focus on projects requested by leaders in the rural communities.  Interpreters provided by MG allowed good communication with the children and adults in the communities being served.  I grew in my faith through serving the wonderful people of Guatemala.  The MG team members worked hard to make certain that all our needs were met, regardless of the hour of the night when a run to the pharmacy was needed.  I will return again next year.
Mission Guatemala Inc	323511		/users/profile/417892	cobalt	Volunteer	4	02/21/2017	this non-profit was well-organized and focused on the vision of helping rural. indigenous Guatemalan communities. I would make this short-term International Mission destination a top priority for our church back in Ohio.
Mission Guatemala Inc	323484		/users/profile/254974	Hawkeye853	Volunteer	5	02/20/2017	Just spent 8 days with Mission Guatemala working on restrooms for the school in Caliaj Tecpan. This was my fourth trip with MG and I will keep coming as long as I am able. The staff of MG have become family to me. The joy of the children, the hard working, friendly Mayan workers, the accommodations, the healthy, delicious meals, and the fellowship are impossible to adequately describe. My experiences have changed my life and renewed my spirit. 
Mission Guatemala Inc	238277		/users/profile/254974	Hawkeye853	Volunteer	5	02/20/2015	Mission Guatemala is outstanding because of how integrated they have become in the communities they serve. Involvement of Mayan staff and the requirement of involvement of the community who benefits in the selection, planning, and construction of projects is critical to their success and the level of trust that has developed for Mission Guatemala. We were warmly welcomed by the community and developed lasting relationships with those with whom we worked. In addition, the accommodations and food for the teams make serving on a team a real pleasure. This trip was my second to Mission Guatemala and I look forward to doing it again next year. It is a time each year that I can truly say I am the person God created me to be.
Mission Guatemala Inc	195066		/users/profile/254974	Hawkeye853	Volunteer	5	03/02/2014	Mission Guatemala is  helping people in the best way; they are fulfilling basic needs such as food and medical in a way that allows the dignity and active participation of those being served. I felt like my time and resources were more efficiently used than by any other charity I have been involved. I got to see and experience the benefits firsthand in Mayan communities in desperate circumstances. The organization and leadership of Mission Guatemala is simply the best!
Mission Guatemala Inc	323474		/users/profile/255069	muttmanblue	Volunteer	5	02/20/2017	We had another great experience at Mission Guatemala.  There were 16 on our team, all but two had been there before.  The staff, accommodations, food, transportation, project, and children again exceeded our expectations.  Everything very well organized.  We worked on bathrooms for a remote Mayan village school.  You do not have to be experienced in construction, the local construction team is good at showing you what to do.  There are several nice surprise activities during the week.
Mission Guatemala Inc	279693		/users/profile/255069	muttmanblue	Volunteer	5	02/10/2016	My 4th year at Mission Guatemala.  The staff and support people are great.  The housing facility is very comfortable, the food wonderful, the location beautiful.  The relationship between MG and the Mayan people is very close and the projects are definitely worthwhile.  Our team worked on a two classroom school addition in a village.  The existing classroom is corrugated metal with little light and not a conducive environment for learning.  The people are very appreciative and friendly.  It is very safe.  MG has a couple of surprises during the week which really are fun.
Mission Guatemala Inc	238293		/users/profile/255069	muttmanblue	Volunteer	5	02/20/2015	My 3rd year at MG.  Very well run mission for very needy and appreciative Mayan people.  As a volunteer you will work on projects that make a real difference in lives while getting to know the local children, seeing how they live, and enjoying the beautiful and safe area of Lake Attilan.  The MG personnel, facilities and food are great.  The local workers that MG hires to help the volunteers are knowledgeable and hard working.  The city of Panajachel is delightful and there are some nice surprises during your mission week.  Guatemala City is only a 3 hour flight from Atlanta, Panajachel is a 3 hour drive after that. 
Mission Guatemala Inc	195142		/users/profile/255069	muttmanblue	Volunteer	5	03/03/2014	Mission Guatemala is very well run and organized in helping in many ways the very poor Mayan people in the area of Panajachel on Lake Atitulan.  The projects are important and you can see your progress.  The facilities and food are very good.  The staff is extremely helpful and flexible.  The area is beautiful and the Mayan's are warm and very appreciative.   Very highly recommended.
Mission Guatemala Inc	323348		/users/profile/417668	Writer	Volunteer	4	02/17/2017	The people and the project where very good for our team and more importantly, great for the children on the community served.
Mission Guatemala Inc	323083	2	/users/profile/417277	Perry H.	Volunteer	5	02/13/2017	Spent an incredible week with Mission Guatemala!  Great staff, Great accommodations, and an overall excellent experience.    If you are looking for a well organized mission experience, then Mission Guatemala is the organization for you.  May God Bless Mission Guatemala and the people of this great country!
Mission Guatemala Inc	323082	1	/users/profile/417276	ew1950	Volunteer	5	02/13/2017	 I have been on six international mission trips. This mission trip to Guatemala was by far the best mission trip I have ever been on . The  staff at mission Guatemala was absolutely fabulous.  They make you feel like you are part of their family. They have the love of God and fellow man in their hearts.  I will go back again!!!  Elmer Wallace first united Methodist church new Philadelphia Ohio
Mission Guatemala Inc	323073	2	/users/profile/417258	tcejoe	Volunteer	5	02/13/2017	This was my 4th Central American mission, but the first to Guatemala.  This was by far the best organized as to work, accomodations, scheduling,  etc.  I left feeling like our group had made at least some difference.Very good organization, and ALL the people we dealt with were good!
Mission Guatemala Inc	322726	1	/users/profile/416728	jott11	Volunteer	5	02/06/2017	Mission Guatemala's approach to partnering with surrounding communities resonated my group.  Too many organizations don't do their homework and simply provide "help" that the org thinks people "need".  Mission Guatemala's facilities are top notch, the crew was patient with us non-professionals and was a pleasure to work beside, and Mission Guatemala was very organized throughout the week of service.  Our team would highly recommend them and would go again!
Mission Guatemala Inc	321290		/users/profile/414582	Writer	Volunteer	5	01/15/2017	Ive been able to be a part of two very different yet amazing trips to Guatemala. Mission Guatemala does so much more for the people in the Lake Atitlan area than one could ever imagine. They do the obvious things such as providing medical, dental, & vision services at low costs, providing feeding programs to schools & communities, providing free water filtration systems, building hand washing stations & kitchens at area schools, providing safer wood burning stoves, and running a child sponsorship program, but they also do much more than that. By bringing mission teams in to help with their programs, they are creating revenue for the local vendors in Panajachel, Chichicastenango, & San Juan. Through their multiple programs, they provide employment to many local people at the medical clinic, at the worksites, and at Casa del Rio  the team housing site. They have begun providing sewing classes to the community with plans to offer classes in other specialties also. There is so much that can be said of the wonderful people who are employed by Mission Guatemala. They make everyone feel at ease and welcome. The food is amazing. The housing is beautiful. The views are unlike anything Ive seen before. Because of my experience during these two trips, Ive learned to see the beauty in everything around me also. Just because I dont have those spectacular mountain, lake, & volcano views here doesnt mean that I can find beauty in the farm land, forests, and other things around me here in Indiana. I cant wait to return to Guatemala again!
Mission Guatemala Inc	321250		/users/profile/366656	Chris Verona	Volunteer	5	01/14/2017	Great experience organized by an outstanding organization.  This is my second year on a trip with Mission Guatemala.  The staff was very helpful and the projects directly benefit the communities of San Andres.  They also run medical, dentist, and eye clinics.
Mission Guatemala Inc	276836		/users/profile/366656	Chris Verona	Volunteer	5	01/17/2016	Outstanding mission trip.  Great community interaction and involvement.  
Mission Guatemala Inc	321248		/users/profile/414532	pjm2	Volunteer	5	01/14/2017	Wonderful experience as always!!! So organized and fun!
Mission Guatemala Inc	321247		/users/profile/414531	bhookbiochem	Volunteer	5	01/14/2017	Great experience!  I will be coming back again.  Excellent staff and great organization. 
Mission Guatemala Inc	319580		/users/profile/411244	Kali L.	Volunteer	5	11/29/2016	I went into this trip with an open mind. This was our 1st mission trip & I knew I had nothing to compare it to plus I wanted to be open to see what God had in store for me. I was almost overwhelmed with the "Wow" factory each and every day!  The land is breathe taking! The staff were very helpful & truly kind.  They were also very educated not only with the work of Mission Guatemala but with the country, the people, the communities, the culture. You can tell they have their whole hearts poured into what they do and where God has led them.  The staff are truly an inspiration to me & my family and I are looking forward to returning to Guatemala and working with Mission Guatemala again! What stole my heart were the kids we were able to interact with at the job site and in the different communities.  A lot of times, we go into places like this thinking we are bringing Hope to a lot of people, and we do but the reality is; at least for me is they give us Hope we never knew we needed. Guatemala will forever have a place in my heart and a piece of my heart will forever be in Guatemala :) 
Mission Guatemala Inc	319319		/users/profile/410730	sandyandsteve	Volunteer	5	11/21/2016	Our time with Mission Guatemala was very meaningful and productive.  Everything was very well organized, and because of this, everything flowed very smoothly.  The food was great, the people we worked with were most helpful, and the time went very quickly.  This was a most memorable week, and we would recommend spending time at Mission Guatemala on a work project to anyone.  If you can't go to Guatemala, any contributions you could make to the organization would truly be going to a good cause.
Mission Guatemala Inc	318988		/users/profile/410315	Writer	Volunteer	5	11/16/2016	This was my second mission trip with Mission Guatemala.  I was able to bring my teen-age daughter with me on this trip and we both had a wonderful experience.  The trip is a perfect balance between experiencing the local culture (tourism) and working on a project.  Every adventure is well organized, the food and accomodations are outstanding, and the work was very gratifying.  My daughter has plans to return in 20 months and she wants to bring her sister.  
Mission Guatemala Inc	318742		/users/profile/160836	dmjw1	Volunteer	5	11/11/2016	I just returned from my third mission trip with Mission Guatemala.   Each trip I make I experience  and see first hand the wonderful influence and growth that this organization has had on the San Andreas area.  This organization has gained the utmost respect from the surrounding communities and is now an institution in the Guatemala Highlands in and around the Lake Atitlan region.  I am always impressed with the organization and commitment that Mission Guatemala has to the Mayan communities it serves.  They also do a tremendous job organizing our volunteer mission teams and provide us with superb transfers, accommodations and meals.   I highly recommend them to volunteers who are thinking about mission work for their first time.  You will definitely be in the best of care while accomplishing great good for the communities that you serve.  Mission Guatemala is a safe and caring nonprofit that definitely lives up to their motto, "Do All the Good You Can."  I am definitely a repeat volunteer who will be returning many more times.

Mission Guatemala Inc	118245		/users/profile/160836	dmjw1	Volunteer	5	07/12/2012	 I just returned from my first mission trip with Mission Guatemala.  I was so impressed with what Tom and his staff are doing for the people of Guatemala.  They provided such wonderful support to us as we went out to the communities near San Andreas Semetabaj.  Our team installed several stoves near Panamiche and built water storage tanks at Chuti Estancia.   It was a joy to be totally immersed in the beautiful Gautemala culture for one week.  The people are so friendly and express such a beautiful faith and love of family.  You actually feel apart of the Guatemala people as you work beside them and help them enrich their lives through meaningful projects that Mission Guatemala provides.  I was so impressed with the offerings of Tom's clinic near San Andreas and the feeding center and school at Nueva Esperanza.  There are certainly great things happening each day in this area of Guatemala thanks to Mission Guatemala.  I hope to return many more times and be apart of this exciting program.   Duane Martin, Evansville Indiana
Mission Guatemala Inc	318645		/users/profile/409876	jeffreyt	Volunteer	5	11/10/2016	This was my first experience with Mission Guatemala. To say that it was a life changing experience would be a huge under statement. The Mission Guatemala staff aide us throughout the week making the work experience outstanding. There was also the opportunity to enjoy some local culture, cuisine, and shopping. Our group enjoyed our trip and experience so much that we signed up for another trip while completing this one. Thanks again for the most excellent experience. Jeff Whitaker
Mission Guatemala Inc	318505		/users/profile/409690	befjaf	Volunteer	5	11/07/2016	We have been involved with Mission Guatemala for 4 years and served on 3 mission trips. We totally agree with Mission Guatemala's  philosophy and vision.  They are committed to improving Guatemalan lives through education and nutrition.  Our experience has shown that they involve the local community in their decisions and expect participation from them not just hand outs.  They have developed a medical, dental and eye clinic to provide those services to Guatemalans who would otherwise not have it available.
Mission Guatemala Inc	318479		/users/profile/409662	Maria168	Volunteer	5	11/07/2016	Mission Guatemala provided a wonderful place to stay and delicious food. The staff is amazing, kind, and personable. They allowed me to experience the true culture of Guatemala, Panajachel specifically.  Over all, they are doing a great job in helping and connecting to the local communites and they are extremely flexible. They are always striving toward better and greater ways to accomplish their goal, do all the good you can. I love Mission Guatemala. 
Mission Guatemala Inc	318442		/users/profile/409618	Writer	Volunteer	5	11/07/2016	Just returned from a week with our mission team. Good work, good food, good people on the team and in Guatemala. Mission Guatemala is the finest or at least one of the finest groups helping others with whom I have been associated.
Mission Guatemala Inc	318406		/users/profile/409576	James213	Volunteer	5	11/06/2016	I just spent an awesome week with this organization. Very cool to see the many facets of this ministry. 
Mission Guatemala Inc	318391		/users/profile/409559	Annaleisha G.	Volunteer	5	11/06/2016	This was the greatest experience I have ever experienced. What Mission Guatemala does for the surrounding communities is astounding. If it wasn't for Mission Guatemala, kids wouldn't have schools, food or healthcare. I definitely recommend people help Mission Guatemala as often as possible. I definitely want to come back to help out Mission Guatemala 
Mission Guatemala Inc	317164		/users/profile/408345	jtothamo	Volunteer	5	10/31/2016	As I reflect on my 5th trip with Mission Guatemala, I find myself amazed by the incredible ministry of this organization. Mission Guatemala has put together a fantastic opportunity for mission teams to join our efforts together to have a positive impact in the greater San Andreas community. While we may not complete a project on our own, we can see follow the progress and know that we have played a role in improving the health, nutrition, and education of the beautiful people of Guatemala. The staff do a tremendous job of walking alongside teams to make us comfortable in our work  and stay. The construction team does an incredible job making sure each team member, no matter their experience and abilities, have a meaningful task at the worksite. Mission Guatemala does not miss a beat when it comes to providing teams with a life-transforming experience. Not only are teams able to accomplish a great deal of work, the cultural experiences built into the week add a wonderful element. The accommodations at the River House exceed expectations! The rooms are clean, comfortable, and provide a great place for fellowship and rest. The meals provided at the River House and work site are tasty and filling. I have worked with other mission organizations in the states and abroad. Mission Guatemala sets the bar much higher and exceeds my expectations in regards to providing a meaningful mission experience. 
Mission Guatemala Inc	312233		/users/profile/403589	cwestbury87	Volunteer	5	10/19/2016	This was my first time volunteering with Mission Guatemala, and I would highly recommend this organization to anybody looking to do service-focused mission work in the Central America region! The timing of this trip was perfect, as I was going through several transitions in my personal life and this opportunity allowed me time to reflect on the direction I wanted to take once I returned back home . The week went by way too fast, and I wish I could have stayed longer. The staff is wonderful, and I know that I will develop several life-long friendships with the staff. Shout out to Max and Shannon, hearing your love story made me excited to plan my own wedding. When I return, my goal is to have better knowledge of Spanish as that would have been helpful in communicating with the construction crew. Thank you, Mission Guatemala! 
Mission Guatemala Inc	312132		/users/profile/403489	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/19/2016	The Mayan people are lovely people even though by American standards they have nothing. They love the Lord their family and they are happy. We helped Mission Guatemala construct a third floor to Tat Loi a substance abuse treatment center in San Lucas.  
Mission Guatemala Inc	311587		/users/profile/257462	cwestbury	Volunteer	5	10/18/2016	I just led a team to engage in a building project with Mission Guatemala. To say we blessed the Mayan people of Guatemala is a bit misleading as they more than blessed our team.  Not one member of the team left without being changed in BIG ways.  Mission Guatemala does an amazing job of balancing play with work, hiring the indigent Mayans to lead us, thus giving them dignity.  I love the emphasis they have on building relationships.  They go to great lengths to preserve their connections in the community.  Everybody is happy and  it is easy to form deep connections.
Mission Guatemala Inc	196961		/users/profile/257462	cwestbury	Volunteer	5	04/03/2014	Our team helped build a basketball/soccer court during our week in Guatemala.  Not only did we put in long hours to see the work completed so that children in the community could compete with other schools , but Mission Guatemala basically planned a surprise a day for us it seemed.  One of those days was spent visiting a school where a similar court was built and watching students have a fun PE class on it and then got to see the trophies they'd earned as a community on display.  Bringing pride to the community isn't a bad way to go.  Mission Guatemala's focus on relationships first as they listen to community leaders describe their needs......extends to learning about individual team members.  It's just the way they roll.  What's become of that investment in relationships is simply mind boggling.  They are making a difference in these Guatemalan villages....relationship by relationship!  
Mission Guatemala Inc	311247		/users/profile/402590	sonnyourai	Volunteer	5	10/17/2016	This has been the greatest experience of a life time. It all started with the staffs, the mission became a life altering. The joy of unloading 40k lbs. of food to mixing cement by hand. The construction crew was very accommodating to some of us that was not used to working with our hands. Daniele and Orlando made everyone felt like their own family. Went to Guatemala as a stranger left there as a brother.  
Mission Guatemala Inc	300040		/users/profile/390877	Marianna P.	Volunteer	5	08/10/2016	The accommodations were much better than most, as we had hot water and could flush the toilets. Our meals were prepared on site, which probably helped with the expense.The staff of Mission Guatemala were very gracious and friendly, and made it a point to put us in touch with many of the Guatemalan people. The Mission Guatemala staff were accommodating and made themselves available to help us take care of some of the necessary functions, like taking us to the bank to exchange money, allowing us to shop in the markets and assisted us so we got value for our monies spent, had persons to translate, since Mayan dialects were spoken in many of the markets, took us on tours to help us get a feel for the culture, took us out to hear some of the history and lore of Guatemala.The best thing they did was taught us about some of the biggest challenges the people in developing Guatemala face. They constantly are surveying the needs of the native people and adjusting their plans accordingly. They began by opening a medical clinic to treat people, have expanded with an eye clinic where glasses prescriptions can be obtained, have huge nutrition programs (feeding 800+ children each Wednesday), providing nutritional products to moms for preschoolers and providing education scholarships and vocational programs to enable more people to learn a sustainable trade to provide for themselves and their families. And the list goes on...I would not only recommend Mission Guatemala, but hope to return soon to be a part of this amazing mission!

Very good food and comfortable accommodations (with beautiful grounds and views)  Leaders werehelpful, interesting,  organized and hard-working.

Mission Guatemala Inc	298856	2	/users/profile/389744	clorch	Volunteer	5	08/01/2016	They are fantastic! I was so impressed by how organized and resourceful they are. They meet with community leaders to hear about their needs and then partner with them to meet those needs. I was there for a week working with a group on a school bathroom, and the crew from Mission Guatemala was wonderful. They worked with us and with each other really well. It was an amazing experience.
Mission Guatemala Inc	298811	2	/users/profile/389697	Writer	Volunteer	5	08/01/2016	So impressed! The Mission Guatemala team is not only highly organized, friendly, helpful and patient with skills-challenged volunteers, they are extremely aware of the surrounding communities' actual needs. Our team was well cared for and almost pampered when not being blessed to put a little sweat equity into the Tat Loy Drug & Alcohol Rehab facility's expansion. Accommodations at the River House in Panajachel were quite nice and transportation to all "excursions" and the worksite were comfortable. I plan to return...and in the meantime encourage our congregation to continue financially supporting Mission Guatemala!

Mission Guatemala Inc	298856	2	/users/profile/389744	clorch	Volunteer	5	08/01/2016	They are fantastic! I was so impressed by how organized and resourceful they are. They meet with community leaders to hear about their needs and then partner with them to meet those needs. I was there for a week working with a group on a school bathroom, and the crew from Mission Guatemala was wonderful. They worked with us and with each other really well. It was an amazing experience.
Mission Guatemala Inc	298811	2	/users/profile/389697	Writer	Volunteer	5	08/01/2016	So impressed! The Mission Guatemala team is not only highly organized, friendly, helpful and patient with skills-challenged volunteers, they are extremely aware of the surrounding communities' actual needs. Our team was well cared for and almost pampered when not being blessed to put a little sweat equity into the Tat Loy Drug & Alcohol Rehab facility's expansion. Accommodations at the River House in Panajachel were quite nice and transportation to all "excursions" and the worksite were comfortable. I plan to return...and in the meantime encourage our congregation to continue financially supporting Mission Guatemala!
Mission Guatemala Inc	298591		/users/profile/389474	pampango	Volunteer	5	07/30/2016	We were impressed with the staff of Mission Guatemala and the overall organization.  This is our first time to join an oversea mission trip, which was coordinated by Faith United Methodist Church in Xenia, Ohio and the experience in terms of accommodations, work load and schedule was just right for first timers.  Mission Guatemala has accomplished significant achievements in their six years of existence in improving the living conditions of the residents in the San Andres area.  
Mission Guatemala Inc	298262	1	/users/profile/338169	jwhembree	Volunteer	5	07/27/2016	I have been going on short term mission trips for over 30 years. Mission Guatemala offers one of the best all around mission experiences that I have had the opportunity to be involved with. Can't wait to return again next year!
Mission Guatemala Inc	250330	1	/users/profile/338169	jwhembree	Volunteer	5	07/28/2015	Tom Heaton, Dave Burns, and their team do a fantastic job! Excellent understanding of the people, communities, and accessing the needs.  I have done volunteer work on short term mission trips for over 30 years and this organization is one of the best!
Mission Guatemala Inc	298204		/users/profile/389051	Nita3	Volunteer	5	07/26/2016	This was my 6th mission trip to Guatemala, my first with Mission Guatemala. I really liked the team facilities...this allowed us to become friends with the other teams working the same week. I like the concept of construction projects that align with the MG goals of health care and improved nutrition. Last year my team worked on a cafeteria for a school, this year we worked on building restrooms at the primary  school in Godinez.  As a retired teacher, I know how important both of these projects are to the success of student learning. Our team has reserved the same time frame for next year and I hope very much to return to work with the MG staff and the wonderful folks of Guatemala!!!
Mission Guatemala Inc	298129		/users/profile/388975	katmangione	Volunteer	5	07/26/2016	Spent just over a week at Mission Guatemala working on a bathroom for a school in Godinez. What an awesome opportunity.  The staff at M.G. took great care of us during our stay!  Meals and accommodations were outstanding.  Loved making new friends and strengthening relationships with old friends! 
Mission Guatemala Inc	298104	1	/users/profile/388942	LeighWWW	Volunteer	5	07/26/2016	Mission Guatemala fills real needs, rather than imposing its own agenda on the people of Guatemala.  It values all people and respects local customs and traditions while helping to better the lives of others.  I have participated in two mission trips with Mission Guatemala.  In the first (2013), a group from my local (Texas) church helped build a bathroom for a school in Caliaj.  In the afternoons, we did VBS type activities with the children.  We also changed water filters for a community dependent on filters for clean water.   In the second trip (2016), we helped add on a floor to Tat-Loy Drug and Alcohol Rehabilitation center.  In both trips, we had very comfortable accommodations, were fed very well, and were given opportunities to learn more about the Mayan culture.  There was a nice mix of work and leisure time.  Most importantly to me, the people involved--cooks, translators, drivers, construction workers, staff, etc.--were all SO kind and engaging.  I feel like I have friends in Guatemala now, and I'm looking forward to my next trip!
Mission Guatemala Inc	297895		/users/profile/388717	jodicjernigan	Volunteer	5	07/24/2016	Mission Guatemala is well organized and runs smoothly by dedicated Christians. The lodging is the best for mission work with 3 meals a day. Best mission experience ever. I am totally commuted now to Mission Guatemala and will be returning.
Mission Guatemala Inc	297234		/users/profile/388014	Writer	Volunteer	5	07/19/2016	Best stay yet after two other trips. Hotel stay was great and work projects were well organized.
Mission Guatemala Inc	297051		/users/profile/387824	J.E.S.	Volunteer	5	07/18/2016	Mission Guatemala is set in the beautiful Lake Atitlan  area familiar to many as a tourist destination. But, beyond what most tourists see are the lives of many Mayan people who work day to day in their towns and villages overcoming poverty. Mission Guatemala not only steps in to help these people, but connects the volunteers who participate with the real people and their real lives. 
Mission Guatemala Inc	296076		/users/profile/386842	Writer	Volunteer	4	07/13/2016	I'm the pastor of a church that brought a work team to Mission Guatemala, and I was very impressed, not only with how they worked with our team (providing instruction, materials, hospitality, and such), but also with how they work with the communities in which they serve -- not telling the communities what they need, but LISTENING to the communities and working with the local people to assess and address the needs.  If there was any disappointment for me as a pastor, it was the apparent lack of intentionality when it comes to addressing SPIRITUAL needs in the communities.  However, this is not to take anything away from the excellent work they do in addressing issues of health, education, and such.  And it would certainly not keep us from returning to Mission Guatemala with another team.
Mission Guatemala Inc	295601		/users/profile/386385	Lisa559	Volunteer	5	07/12/2016	Very well organized.  The people running Mission Guatemala care about their work, their volunteers, and the people of Guatemala.  They run a wonderful program allowing the volunteers to work with native Guatemalans on projects, educating the volunteers about the Mayan culture and allowing the volunteers some free time to see Panajachel and San Juan del Lago.  I would recommend this nonprofit to everyone with a heart for service.
Mission Guatemala Inc	294671		/users/profile/385412	jkanthony92	Volunteer	5	07/04/2016	Mission Guatemala is making a real impact on the communities it serves.  Their projects are relevant and meaningful and they equip volunteers with the knowledge and tools necessary to successfully deliver them.  The in country staff is wonderfully patient and supportive.  
Mission Guatemala Inc	293963		/users/profile/384652	Megan120	Volunteer	5	06/27/2016	Mission Guatemala provided us with an outstanding week long immersive experience. We were able to work alongside amazing people doing construction at Tat Loy rehabilitation center but also getting to experience the culture of Guatemala and the Mayan people.  Trips to Panajachel and San Juan were fantastic. Learning about the medical clinic, school feeding programs, educational scholarship opportunities, and other great work of Mission Guatemala was inspiring.  Accommodations and food were excellent. Travel and scheduling were easy and well planned. Most importantly, the people were wonderful to work with. I will definitely be going back to Mission Guatemala! 
Mission Guatemala Inc	293958		/users/profile/384642	Janette F	Volunteer	5	06/27/2016	Just finished my second trip to Mission Guatemala, and all I can say is - amazing week!  Mission Guatemala embodies all that a missions organization should be!!  They provide a safe, comfortable place for teams to reside during their week and are staffed by a wonderful group of people.  Mission Guatemala works with communities to give them a hand up, not a hand out.  MG staff are careful to build relationships with the local communities they work with.  The Mayan workers at our site were patient and kind as they provided us with the skills we needed to complete our project.  Our worksite was a fun, productive place for everyone.  Diego, our team leader, was extremely thoughtful and organized.  He made sure we were provided with the tools we needed to complete our project while making sure we had time to build relationships and learn about the culture of Guatemala.  We can't wait to return for another trip.
Mission Guatemala Inc	293917		/users/profile/384592	Susan469	Volunteer	5	06/26/2016	A great organization that asks the communities it serves what is needed and works hard to invest volunteers in the culture and work of the mission. Thank you for all the good you do, and for letting us be a small part of it.
Mission Guatemala Inc	293908		/users/profile/384582	Mary433	Volunteer	5	06/26/2016	Mission Guatemala does missions right!!  They work with communities doing projects that the communities need that won't be accomplished any other way ( i.e. government).  The communities all play some part in the project completion.  MG has an amazing team of Mayan leaders who head up the projects and patiently work with the many different levels of skilled and unskilled mission teams that come to help.
Mission Guatemala Inc	293874		/users/profile/118979	Rebecca234567	Volunteer	5	06/25/2016	Love the love, thoughtfulness and efficiency with which they carry out their mission!!
Mission Guatemala Inc	99335		/users/profile/118979	Rebecca234567	Volunteer	5	10/15/2011	Our team just finished a fabulous week of service. Our original mission project was installing efficient vented stoves for families who had been cooking indoors obev open fires. We were able to install 5 before we were hindered by heavy rain. Even when we were not able to build stoves Tom Heaton and his staff were able to use their local connections to find ways for us to help another NGO in town. Mission Guatemala is run by compassionate, organized, efficient people who truly care about the Guatemalan people. We felt safe, comfortable, well informed and really got to experience the joys and challenges of the local families. 
Mission Guatemala Inc	293366		/users/profile/383962	Writer	Volunteer	5	06/20/2016	We have been to mission trips in Cuba and Bolivia and they were both great experiences but Mission Guatemala was far better.  They are so well organized the whole experience was wonderful.  The work projects were very worthwhile, the local workers so nice to learn to know  and gracious to work with.  The local leader of the project was Diego and  he had the rare combined qualities of being a people person but also well organized.The housing was very comfortable and conducive to group bonding and fun interaction. It was clear the organization is oriented toward development of local leaders, meeting genuine locally identified needs, and very efficient with the use of contributions. 
Mission Guatemala Inc	293262		/users/profile/383870	sdyer	Volunteer	5	06/18/2016	Mission Guatemala was a wonderful experience due to the loving people we worked with and who guided us through our week there.  They  have  accomplished many needed projects for their community and are still striving to improve lives of the people there.  I also highly recommend the organization for the food, accommodations and taking us to see the natural beauty of its location .  Loved the side trips and special restaurants we ate and of course a little shopping.  Special thanks to Diego who was the best helping our group each and every day!
Mission Guatemala Inc	293175		/users/profile/383760	thomp2291	Volunteer	5	06/16/2016	SEVERAL GROUPS ARE HEARING BECAUSE I cannot stop talking about this mission.  Thank you all!     
Mission Guatemala Inc	293150		/users/profile/383728	lindbucco	Volunteer	5	06/16/2016	The singular best mission experience our group has enjoyed.  First class in every way.
Mission Guatemala Inc	292774		/users/profile/383330	Mikayla S.	Volunteer	5	06/12/2016	Mission Guatemala does absolutely amazing work and I cannot wait to go back. 
Mission Guatemala Inc	292773		/users/profile/383328	samischweiger	Volunteer	5	06/12/2016	Amazing organization! My third year here and I will definitely be coming back for more! 
Mission Guatemala Inc	292383		/users/profile/336827	momsnm	Volunteer	4	06/07/2016	Another wonderful experience in Pannajachel with Mission Guatemala. After going last year we couldn't wait to go back. The beautiful surroundings of the River House and the excellent food and care were welcomed at the end of a hard days work. We were so pleased to see the new programs at the Clinic and hear of all that is being done in the surrounding communities. We will continue to support and pray for the work and people involved with this fine organization.
Mission Guatemala Inc	249012		/users/profile/336827	momsnm	Volunteer	4	07/21/2015	This was my first experience on a mission trip out of the US. I was impressed by how smoothly it was run.  The punctuality of meals, leaving for work site and other events was nice.  The men assigned to help us at the site were some of the nicest I have ever met. They were so patient and helpful. I enjoyed interacting with them about their families. One was so eager to learn any English word he could and I loved being able to help him.
Mission Guatemala Inc	291452		/users/profile/381867	Writer	Volunteer	5	05/31/2016	I stayed with Mission Guatemala for a week in April 2016 as part of a group of United Methodist Pastors. What a wonderful experience! The "River House" in Panajachel was a dream of hospitality--AMAZING home-cooked food, an appropriate amount of first-world comforts, and stunning landscaping. Each day offered a new opportunity to discover God's work at a different site served by this organization. I felt consistently safe, engaged, and challenged during my trip. I would absolutely go again and bring others with me.
Mission Guatemala Inc	291150		/users/profile/381525	Writer	Volunteer	5	05/26/2016	Mission Guatemala is an excellent organization. Its operations are beneficial and draw extensively from local personnel who help to facilitate integration with the communities it helps. The clinic and the feeding programs it operates for students, among other things, seem to have very positive effects on the communities it serves. 
Mission Guatemala Inc	290871		/users/profile/381210	Writer	Volunteer	5	05/24/2016	The people at Mission Guatemala were some of the kindest and most passionate people I have ever met. I could tell that the mission of this organization is close to their hearts and they do all the good they can. I came back so inspired to help and more educated about Guatemala and I am very glad that I had the opportunity to work with them.
Mission Guatemala Inc	290857		/users/profile/381193	BWYay	Volunteer	5	05/24/2016	At first I was a little wary of Mission Guatemala's work for the same reasons listed in comments below. But they truly do amazing work in the Lake Atitlan region and strive to integrate themselves into the community in the most beneficial and culturally appropriate way possible. I was lucky enough to spend a week and a half with them, meeting community leaders, visiting schools, helping out at Casa Tat Loy, and learning about the environmental, health, and educational issues in the region. 
Mission Guatemala Inc	290856		/users/profile/381191	littlemissauthor	Volunteer	5	05/24/2016	A group of us students from Baldwin Wallace University went to Panajachel to learn about the culture and problems affecting the people and also volunteer through Mission Guatemala. We had a wonderful experience there; Mission Guatemala taught us about the traditional customs and allowed us to learn how we can best serve, including changing daily habits at home in the United States. Mission Guatemala is a great organization that is doing a lot of good for the people in Panajachel and the surrounding communities.
Mission Guatemala Inc	290851		/users/profile/381185	leshunter78	Volunteer	5	05/24/2016	I am by nature skeptical  of "helping" organizations, especially ones that come from the so-called "first world," work in the so called "third world," and rely on some sort of religious institution--that can on occasion have a conflict of interest in that their primary goal is to proselytize the population. Misguided notions of "help" particularly hold true  in Guatemala, where the US has a long history of intervention--most of it negative and highly detrimental to the indigenous population, which only 30 years ago experienced a genocide that was in part funded by the US military. So I was very careful in my first forays with Mission Guatemala, and it was a happy surprise to find how wrong I was about their work. Mission Guatemala works carefully with the people in the Solola region of Guatemala. They listen to their concerns, they treat them with respect, and they plan long-term, sustainable projects where they are partners with the locals. They make every attempt to reverse already-existing hierarchies that are the long and present histories of colonialism, racism, and imperialism. The truly make every effort to follow their motto, supplied by early Methodist minister John Wesley to, "do all the good you can. By all the means you can. In all the ways you can."
Mission Guatemala Inc	290651		/users/profile/381014	bosinski	Volunteer	5	05/23/2016	A wonderful organization. The people were all extremely kind and the mission leaders always kept the needs of the volunteers in mind. They also did a great job of ensuring we got a good mix of work and cultural experiences. This was a wonderful growing experience with Christ that helped all the members of my group recognize how blessed we are. 
Mission Guatemala Inc	287888		/users/profile/378013	Writer	Volunteer	5	05/01/2016	I am thankful for such a ministry of compassion that respects the people served and the community, promoting partnership!
Mission Guatemala Inc	286091	1	/users/profile/376153	Writer	Volunteer	5	04/18/2016	I traveled to Guatemala to see firsthand, the Mayan Culture, the surroundings, and the good that Mission Guatemala, Inc is doing in the Panajachel area.  I am awed by the experience, the grace, the knowledge and care that Mission Guatemala has for the area, the people, including the indigenous culture.In learning about the history, the present, and the challenges that nature presents to this area, I am amazed at the fortitude, the strength, and the beauty of the people.  We were able to help our new-found friends with some building and construction.  We were able to communicate, laugh, ask questions, and become friends.
Mission Guatemala Inc	286051		/users/profile/376103	Sam_41	Volunteer	5	04/17/2016	Absolutely wonderful ministry! God is glorified and so much good work is done there!
Mission Guatemala Inc	286028		/users/profile/376080	Writer	Volunteer	5	04/16/2016	 This is an excellent ministry to be the hands and feet of Christ. As Christ representative I find Christ there. His spirit is in the hearts of the people. I am humbled to help give them a hand up not a handout .
Mission Guatemala Inc	285197		/users/profile/375187	Writer	Volunteer	5	04/07/2016	Mission Guatemala was our first experience with a non-domestic mission trip.  Our family of four attended.  It was amazing.  The team they have took great care of us every day.  The work that they are providing to the community around them is incredible.  Mission Guatemala is making a difference.  We loved how safe and comfortable our family felt during our entire stay.  It was a great mix of hard work and time to explore the culture.
Mission Guatemala Inc	285177		/users/profile/375164	Jon_34	Volunteer	5	04/07/2016	We loved our week with Mission Guatemala! From a missional standpoint they have done a tremendous job of going into an area and partnering with other people and organizations. By no means have they entered into the area with an idea of what people need and are going to force something upon the people.From a preparation and hospitality standpoint, Mission Guatemala has their act together! Tom, Diego, and Dave are the perfect hosts both beforehand and while our group served with them. Our accommodations were outstanding and our group felt cared for while we were finding our places to serve.Thanks for creating a wonderful opportunity and partnership for our group!
Mission Guatemala Inc	285173		/users/profile/375158	Valerie77	Client Served	5	04/07/2016	Mission guatemala was such an amazing place! Beautiful, spacious rooms, incredible meals and a super helpful staff created the perfect setting for us to serve from. Every detail was handled, so we could just focus on the work we came to do. The relationships they have formed and fostered with the community added so much to the experience. I was initially nervous about traveling to Guatemala, and this ended up being a life changing experience. I can't wait to go back-thanks Dave, Tom and Diego!!!!
Mission Guatemala Inc	284998		/users/profile/375053	Writer	Volunteer	5	04/06/2016	I participated with a larger group as a last minute substitute. I found all activities organized to the greatest degree. I was never without multiple translators so did not feel alone or isolated. The work was to my capabilities and well paced. Many watched over me for my welfare. Devotions and a well prepared breakfast started us for the day. We worked right beside the Guatemalans. I never heard a bad word from them as they considered us friends and family. Half of the workers in our group that traveled were teenagers or younger. They worked just as hard as the adults. I was the oldest in the group and by the end of the week they were all calling me grandpa, a term of endearment. I consider the experience life changing. I plan to return.
Mission Guatemala Inc	284924		/users/profile/374976	Writer	Volunteer	5	04/06/2016	Mission Guatemala is exactly what every mission should be: a not-for-profit run by people who understand how to humbly help those who need the most help while maintaining their dignity.  It is the perfect way for Americans to help others in a completely different world.
Mission Guatemala Inc	284856		/users/profile/374911	Dawn136	Volunteer	5	04/06/2016	I am amazed at all of the things Mission Guatemala is doing to support those around them: A medical clinic that also has a pharmacy, an eye clinic, a sewing class, a keyboarding class for children, nutrition and meal programs for children, plus they invite groups like mine to come along side them and help build a kitchen and stoves at a local school and help add on to a rehabilitation center in a town nearby.  They are a caring, committed, very well run nonprofit.  I'm glad to have been a small part of their mission this past week.
Mission Guatemala Inc	284855	1	/users/profile/374910	Writer	Volunteer	5	04/06/2016	Amazing organization, friendly and helpful staff doing all the good they possibly can in Guatemala.  Clearly embraced by local community leaders, Mission Guatemala is making a real difference by mobilizing volunteers and investing in both infrastructure and human capital.
Mission Guatemala Inc	284414		/users/profile/374459	Jill87	Volunteer	5	04/02/2016	Mission Guatemala is a fantastic organization that is doing amazing things in rural Guatemala. It is an honor and a privilege to work with them and their competent and inspiring Guatemalan staff!Over the past 3 years, our students at the University of Evansville have had the opportunity to work with Mission Guatemala on numerous projects related to education, inventory management, art therapy, nutrition assessment, and financial literacy. The high quality, professional manner in which Mission Guatemala supports our students and conducts their work in the community in Guatemala is remarkable.  
Mission Guatemala Inc	283042		/users/profile/373226	Jimmoore	Volunteer	5	03/21/2016	We took eleven people from St. Mark's UMC in Bloomington, Indiana to Guatemala. I can say very easily that this was a wonderful experience for our group, and that we were afforded a great experience by the staff at MG. First, they accommodated our out of the ordinary travel plans at some inconvenience to themselves. Second, they insured that we had a very cool opportunities to see different parts of the country, allowing us to dine, shop, and see some of the beauty of Guatemala. The jaunts we made into town, especially the night we had dinner at Jose Pinguino's, where we were treated to a delicious meal, and a presentation about Mayan Culture, were as intriguing as they were enjoyable.  They took care to our safety, and also to our experience and knowledge of the country. Third, the accommodations at the River House were far better than anything I could have imagined. The food was really good, the rooms quite comfortable and the space was very attractive. We also had a decent Internet connection which allowed us to stay in touch with those at home. We took several youth, and their parents appreciated that.  Finally, and most importantly, we are allowed to learn about and connect vitally with the important work Mission Guatemala is doing. We toured the primary campus in San Andres, where there is a medical clinic, a dental clinic, a computer lab and classes that teach commercial sewing. In our volunteering, we worked with MG's educational outreach to schools in the region. Our group did some work laying tile at a school in Xecotoj, and although we did not have many skilled workers, we were  guided well by our Guatemalan "supervisors". It was really good working with them...they are patient, and very kind. And at the end of the week, in our farewell, they told us why it did matter to them that we were doing something to help the children of their country. And on breaks at the school, and some days after school, we had a chance to connect with the children. They were delightful, and gave some greater meaning to the work we were doing. I highly recommend MG. And would be happy to discuss this with anyone with questions.  Jimmy MooreSt. Mark's United Methodist ChurchBloomington, IN 812-332-5788
Mission Guatemala Inc	283010		/users/profile/334006	poewaga1	Volunteer	5	03/21/2016	Great local team.  Very well organized and structured.  Food and accommodations were very good. A great mix of work and cultural education.  This was my second trip with this Mission group and I am looking forward to many more trips to and with Mission Guatemala.
Mission Guatemala Inc	246619	1	/users/profile/334006	poewaga1	Volunteer	5	06/29/2015	Great organization and very well run.  Living facilities and food were excellent.

Mission Guatemala Inc	282972		/users/profile/373147	Writer	Volunteer	5	03/20/2016	Mission Guatemala provided more than just the opportunity to make improvements in a school in a small community served by this mission.  Working with a local team of construction workers put me in touch with the natives of Guatemala and to learn from them as we went about the job that we were assigned.  Interacting with the school children during their morning break allowed us to  see the genuineness of the children of this country.Tom Heaton, director of the organization, did an amazing job of coordinating a week of work and exposure to life in that part of Central America.  Participants in this mission trip were provided a comprehensive overview of the mission's work, including visits to different sites, before beginning their specific job.  This was very helpful in understanding how Mission Guatemala serves the people in that part of the country.The week also included an evening meal in town at a Mayan restaurant and an opportunity to do some shopping.  An additional activity on another day introduced us to a women's textile cooperative.Tom is sensitive to the visiting mission team participants' well-being. Throughout the entire experience, his commitment to Mission Guatemala and the people it serves was evident and inspiring.  
Mission Guatemala Inc	282963		/users/profile/373138	Writer	Volunteer	5	03/20/2016	Hands down one of my greatest life experiences.Guatemala is a beautiful country and to help its people is so rewarding.
Mission Guatemala Inc	282952		/users/profile/373128	Writer	Volunteer	5	03/20/2016	Mission Guatemala, administrated through Tom Heaton and staff, are doing tremendous work throughout the villages of Panajachel. Their focus has been the areas of health, education, and nutrition for these communities, especially the children. In the past 6 years the mission projects have had great growth and continue to be of service to the Guatemalan people. I am glad to have served the mission in a small way to help build a classroom for a week and learn the culture and needs of its people. I will return for such satisfying work. 
Mission Guatemala Inc	282944	1	/users/profile/373116	Writer	Volunteer	5	03/20/2016	I had an amazing experience with Mission Guatemala. The staff and crew are so incredible and the week was truly life changing. 
Mission Guatemala Inc	282681		/users/profile/372845	Fred32	Volunteer	5	03/17/2016	I was fortunate to work the staff at Mission Guatemala, along with students from the University of Evansville.  Their professionalism, work ethic, and commitment to bettering the lives of the people in Panajachel, Guatemala was outstanding!  They provided a home for us, cooked for us, and let us help facilitate facets of their charitable contribution to the people.  They took the time to explain what their mission was and how they go about implementing their services.  I am astounded by their generosity and will go back to visit them soon.
Mission Guatemala Inc	282614		/users/profile/372772	liv_russ	Volunteer	5	03/17/2016	This organization exceeded my expectations because it did not try to go into another country and tell them what is best for the people. Everyone on Mission Guatemala's team went into this country to give people the resources and help to make their country better. Very good organization with an amazing goal. 
Mission Guatemala Inc	282530		/users/profile/154021	Janelle Walter	Professional with expertise in this field	5	03/16/2016	Mission Guatemala always exceeds my expectations.  The staff is so service oriented that we want for nothing. Plus, they helped my students gain invaluable experience with food preparation and cultural exposure during our week in Solola'.  The heart of Christ is present in this program.
Mission Guatemala Inc	113181		/users/profile/154021	Janelle Walter	Volunteer	5	05/29/2012	A team of nutrition students traveled to Mission Guatemala last week and delivered nutrition lessons to the children at four different schools.  WE painted a playground and were there to see the grand opening of the playground as well as attend a ceremony of a one year anniversary of a feeding center for children in a village school.  Missions Guatemala now has two feeding centers for children and ready to add another. What better way to insure a good future for these children than to see that they have the nutrients to grown strong and healthy.  Our hosts was very hospitable and helped us learn about the culture of these people.

On top of servings the community, we got to explore some nice areas and get tons of opportunities to shop in different markets. I went with a nutrition team and we spent the week hosting cooking classes for the Jr. High and the kids really loved it. Mission Guatemala is great!

The Riverhouse was nice and the food was amazing. Mission Guatemala's purpose is to help the people of that area help themselves.  I would go back tomorrow if I could. God is certainly there.

It often happens that you go on a missions trip to give however I this case I think I received more then I gave.  Largely in part of the amazing leg work, research and preparation done by mission Guatemala before we arrived.  I can't wait to go back.  
Mission Guatemala Inc	281302		/users/profile/371337	tfuller	Volunteer	5	03/01/2016	I  was with a group of men on a work mission trip to Mission Guatemala.  It was readily apparent that they did much good.  As we drove to our worksite, we spotted several incomplete projects.  There is a history of other mission groups starting and then not finishing projects.  Mission Guatemala has established a reputation for finishing  projects it starts.  In addition to building projects, the mission supports a medical and dental clinic that serves the very poor at nominal cost.  They also have a vocational school teaching typing skills and were in the process of starting a sewing school using commercial grade new sewing machines to teach the people skills they could use to sew at home to generate income.   I was impressed with the expanding program to feed children.  They feed children lunch and snacks in one school and, using a kitchen expanded by mission volunteers, plan to start the lunch program in another school as well.  The mission supplies food and equipment and the mothers of the children take turns cooking the meals.  They do lots of good.
Mission Guatemala Inc	281118		/users/profile/371143	Writer	Volunteer	5	02/29/2016	This was my first mission trip outside the US.  Mission Guatemala couldn't have been a finer experience.  The facility is clean, the food is great, and the staff were knowledgeable and attentive.

Mission Guatemala Inc	278770		/users/profile/368759	Braille97	Volunteer	5	02/02/2016	January 16-24, 2016 I went on my third mission trip to Guatemala. I so enjoy going and this time was extra special, I went with my daughter, son and daughter-in-law. The work we do is labor intensive but I don't mind it's all worth it because God has allowed me to let His light shine through me. Whether it's building a kitchen, bathroom or classrooms it's so awesome to help our brothers and sisters from a different part of the world. The team that lead us on the worksite are wonderful individuals who are able to make it an enjoyable and memorial time. Everyone is so nice and helpful and where we stayed, I never once felt unsafe. They took very good care of us. Thank you for inviting us to come and help and have memories that will last a life time.
Mission Guatemala Inc	277170		/users/profile/366959	Writer	Volunteer	5	01/19/2016	I was a short-term, one (1) week, missionary team member.  This organization is superb!  Our 'assignments' were well-defined and well-supervised.  There was a refreshing mix of 'work' and cultural experiences that left me with a realistic appreciation and understanding of the people and the country.  I was encouraged/pleased to see a substantial use/hiring of local talent.  Mission Guatemala is a program for and OF the people it has been designed to serve.  ...  I will participate in this program again.

Mission Guatemala does a terrific job of leveraging mission teams and the communities in which they work. The partnerships and the level of trust they have established in the communities in San Andreas are truly wonderful. Great trip,  great week. 
Mission Guatemala Inc	276824		/users/profile/366644	Writer	Volunteer	5	01/17/2016	Wonderful time! Wonderful experience! The perfect mix of work and fun. Mission Guatemala does so much for the people of San Andres area and we were right there in the middle of it. They are also committed to showing you the Mayan culture and traditions. I felt safe and well-cared for the entire time. 
Mission Guatemala Inc	276823		/users/profile/366643	Writer	Volunteer	5	01/17/2016	Welcoming staff and also got to learn a lot about the culture too! I would highly recommend it!

Mission Guatemala Inc	273150	1	/users/profile/362348	Writer	Volunteer	5	11/30/2015	Mission Guatemala provided us with an unbelievable experience.  I was the leader of the group and prior to our arrival Tom & Diego were very helpful with information, answering questions and just helping us through the process.  Once there Dave, Diego,Josh, Balam and others gave us the opportunity to get to know their program and the Guatemalan culture and people who benefit from it.  Their program with Medical, Dental and Optometry Care is amazing.  Also the school and meal program is fantastic.   The River House was more than what I expected.  The grounds were beautiful with all the flowers and other plants.  The Guatemalan women who prepared our food did a great job.  They prepared food like to what the local people would eat. We were there over Thanksgiving and the special meal they prepared was fantastic!  The staff was very friendly.  It was a nice combination of Guatemalan and US people.  We were able to work side by side with them.  The language barrier was not a problem with the interpreters and  just old fashion communication methods.  We were also taken to different Market places to shop, given the opportunity to worship at a church there, went on a boat ride and visited a beautiful Bed and Breakfast for breakfast.   This was my first mission trip and Mission Guatemala has set the standard bar high.    God bless them and all they do. 
Mission Guatemala Inc	271244	1	/users/profile/360052	Writer	Volunteer	5	11/05/2015	Mission Guatemala is an organization with a remarkable staff of dedicated, caring workers doing great work for people who are in dire need of assistance.  I think it's extremely deserving!

Mission Guatemala Inc	267251	1	/users/profile/108150	Jason M.	Volunteer	5	10/26/2015	I recently returned from an incredible mission experience with Mission Guatemala. This was my fourth trip with Mission Guatemala.  Tom Heaton, Dave Burns and the entire staff make the process of planning for and participating   on the trip extremely user friendly. I have never had an easier, and yet detailed, mission trip planning experience. The progress that Mission Guatemala has made in 5 years is incredible. The growth of the clinic and various ministries of the mission is awe-inspiring. It is extremely humbling and rewarding to play a small role in the ministry of Mission Guatemala through a week of service. The Mission Guatemala staff were extremely kind, patient, and compassionate during our trip. The contractors took their time to teach us how to do the work (which most of us had never done) and lovingly and gently would help correct any errors we made. They also made sure that, no matter the skill level of our volunteers, each person had an important role and shared the responsibilities of the work. Our team coordinators and translators were extremely professional, kind, patient, and a lot of fun to be around. The food was incredible throughout the trip as well! The accommodations at the River House are outstanding and extremely comfortable. While we worked hard, Mission Guatemala also takes the time to make sure the trip is not just about work, but also give participants an immersive cultural experience. Trips to the market, a local restaurant (where a presentation about Mayan culture is given), and a journey across the lake to a weaving co-op help paint a clearer picture of the history and daily life of our Guatemalan brothers and sisters. The ministry of Mission Guatemala is amazing. Our week was awesome! I encourage anyone looking for a week of meaningful service to consider Mission Guatemala.
Mission Guatemala Inc	153575	1	/users/profile/108150	Jason M.	Volunteer	5	04/08/2013	I have been on two trips to Mission Guatemala and will return in September for a third. Our church is now sending two groups per year to partner with the ministry of Mission Guatemala. Tom, Dave, and the entire staff have provided excellent service opportunities, interactions with the local culture, and life-changing experiences. The amazing impact that Mission Guatemala has made on its local community in just a short amount of time is incredible. We look forward to continuing our partnership with Mission Guatemala.
Mission Guatemala Inc	93800	1	/users/profile/108150	Jason M.	Volunteer	5	07/13/2011	My experience with Mission Guatemala was extremely positive. Rev. Tom Heaton, along with Dave Burns, did an amazing job of making our time in Guatemala one of the most incredible mission experiences I've ever experienced. The advanced planning and preparation provided by Mission Guatemala was extremely helpful. Once on site, we were graciously hosted by the Mission Guatemala team. The hospitality extended by all associated with Mission Guatemala was amazing. Our work projects were also extremely well planned. We had three projects going on at the same time. The projects spanned a range of skill levels, so all member of our team had a place to plug in and feel great about accomplishing the tasks before us. It is apparent that Mission Guatemala, Rev. Heaton, and Dave Burns are well respected by the people in the greater San Andres community and Panajachel. Every thing was amazing...from travel arrangements (our drivers were great), to food (excellent), to lodging (comfortable, nice, clean), to our interactions with the local community, and to our ability to experience a bit of the Guatemalan culture (lots of fun in addition to lots of hard work). I would definitely give Mission Guatemala my highest praise and refer anyone interested in an international mission trip to consider making Mission Guatemala a top choice. 
Mission Guatemala Inc	267247	1	/users/profile/355977	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/26/2015	Our team of seven spent a week in Panajachel working side-by-side with native Guatemalans to build a cafeteria for a local elementary school.  What we were really building, however, were relationships - relationships that foster hope in the lives of the Guatemalan people.  Mission Guatemala does ministry the right way.
Mission Guatemala Inc	266499	1	/users/profile/355259	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/22/2015	Very good experience overall. Lots of good people, staff, cooks
Mission Guatemala Inc	266094	1	/users/profile/354849	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/21/2015	Mission Guatemala is fantastic. The leaders are completely passionate about serving the community and helping people of Guatemala. They provide the volunteers with an unforgettable experience. They educating their volunteers about Guatemalan people, community and the missions' history and responsibility. Mission Guatemala knows what it means to love and serve others. They make it possible.
Mission Guatemala Inc	265998	1	/users/profile/354747	TrudyDiane	Volunteer	5	10/21/2015	We were able to work with the peoples of Guatemala to improve their school and to offer them dental care.  We enjoyed the beauty of the country and the culture of their country. We enjoyed the experience to learn that people everywhere are the same. We saw children playing, a parade that looked much like ours at home, families struggling to make a living  and we were able to worship our Lord with them.

As a volunteer, I was impressed with the organization of my week in Guatemala with my church group.  We were able to maximize our efforts to achieve results we could see and appreciate.  We worked hard and were well taken care of outside our work day.  The accommodations at the River House are comfortable and the meals are delicious, nutritious and filling.  We were able to spend some time exploring the area to get a better appreciation of the country and culture.  Mission Guatemala is an organization worth supporting!
Mission Guatemala Inc	262935		/users/profile/351633	Writer	Client Served	5	10/11/2015	To whom it may concern:  Our team had the specific mission to assist an Alcohol Treatment facility in San Lucas Toliman , Guatemala.  Mission Guatemala, an NGO located in the Lake Atitlan Basin hosted our visit.  Their staff were as professional as we have ever met.  Services provided included translation , transportation, room and board,  food service, technical assistance, and program evaluation.  The above services far exceeded our expectations.   We anticipate an on-going relationship with this NGO.
Mission Guatemala Inc	260740	1	/users/profile/349328	Pamelia	Volunteer	5	10/01/2015	Mission Guatemala Inc is an amazing organization.  They are only 5 years old and have done so much for the Guatemalan communities.  A medical, dental, and eye clinic have been established, feeding programs in various communities, snack programs, water filter buckets in schools.  Kitchens have been built so children could have food cooked at school.  Additional classrooms are being built.I have been on 12 mission trips and this by far is the best one yet!

Mission Guatemala Inc	257868		/users/profile/346338	susanstuebe	Volunteer	5	09/16/2015	It has been over a month since we visited Mission Guatemala, and I think about our time there everyday. The sense of giving and living among the people we were helping left a life long impression on my heart. I look forward to seeing the finished school ready to  go and furnished for these kids. The people in Guatemala taught me to be patient and content with what I have. I feel  blessed to be someone that was able to join the teams at the mission to do good. They were such an appreciative group and I would love to return someday.I would recommend working with the team at Mission Guatemala because they care for you while you are there. They teach you about the culture and the needs of these people. They provide you a wonderful experience as travelers and people of God helping those less fortunate. Thank you all at Mission Guatemala. You're pretty special!Susan
Mission Guatemala Inc	254250	4	/users/profile/342575	FrQuincy	Volunteer	5	08/28/2015	Over the course of 20+ years of youth ministry, my wife and I (both youth directors) have been on nearly a dozen mission trips. Our experience with Mission Guatemala has, hands down, exceeded them all! Tom and Dave have developed a top-tier organization. It is expertly run, well-organized, and provides the perfect combination of work and cultural experiences. The staff are friendly, proficient, easy to be with, and feel "part of the family." Our team left with tears in their eyes and a longing to return soon (which we are working on!)  We were so impressed with what Mission Guatemala has accomplished in such a short time - eye clinics, water purification, dentists, doctors, schools, classrooms... we were blown away! What an incredible nonprofit, and what amazing people!
Mission Guatemala Inc	253328	2	/users/profile/341506	Oliviacarper1	Volunteer	5	08/18/2015	Love everyone at Mission Guatemala! Diego, josh, Elmer, Laura and everyone on staff is so kind and helpful. I have been to mission Guatemala 2 years in a row and this year brought my son. The week is always so well planned and I feel safe and secure at all times. The work they do is unbelievable and I will continue to support this group! 
Mission Guatemala Inc	253325	2	/users/profile/341502	anonymous_methodist	Volunteer	5	08/18/2015	Before hearing about an opportunity to join a group from church on a mission trip, my husband and I had recently finished reading Robert Lupton's book "Toxic Charity."  We asked many questions before signing up to make sure we were not about to head down to Guatemala to do unnecessary work.  Upon our return, we could not be happier with the way Mission Guatemala is serving their surrounding communities.  They are very intentional about helping and empowering communities in Guatemala.  They hire the right people to run the charity and the work sites. They immerse themselves in the culture and the people. They have a great reputation among the locals, and they treat all of their mission teams as very important guests.  This is a very well supported and productive organization. Thanks for the great experience and memories Mission Guatemala team! 
Mission Guatemala Inc	253101	1	/users/profile/341251	jcstevens	Volunteer	5	08/16/2015	Although I have been on other mission trips in the past, this was my first with Mission Guatemala. I was incredibly impressed with all of the work that they have been able to achieve in only ~5 years of operation. I really appreciated the time devoted during this trip to educating us on the work they are doing and feel so blessed to be working with such an amazing organization. What stood out to me the most is how much effort they put into developing relationships within the communities they serve and finding out from community leaders what the needs are and how they can help address those needs instead of just coming in and doing work that they think might be needed. I think Mission Guatemala is a great example of what a mission organization should look like.
Mission Guatemala Inc	252854		/users/profile/340972	Gerilynn	Volunteer	5	08/13/2015	Mission Guatemala far exceeded my expectations for our first international youth mission trip.  As a leader who was responsible for preparing our team of 18 youth and adults of the expectations the week we served, Mission Guatemala made it easy.  They are very organized and have everything down to a "t".   Throughout the year of planning, any question I had, was answered happily and promptly.   Tom, Dave, Diego, Josh and Laura have been such a great help and were always looking out for us and a pleasure to work with.  The River House was amazing and very safe.  The staff was always available and eager to help out in any way they could.  The local workers at our worksite were very friendly and patient and became one of the family.  Our youth especially enjoyed communicating with them in Spanish and teaching them a little English.  Our team also enjoyed interacting and playing with the children at the worksite.---Most importantly, Mission Guatemala's focus is what the local people of Guatemala need, not what we may "think" they need.  With the priority of building relationships with the local communities in Guatemala, I can see firsthand how this organization has a strong foundation of faith with the people of Guatemala and the mission teams.   As someone who has been on other mission trips in Central America, I would highly recommend to support Mission Guatemala through donations, mission trips and prayers.  
Mission Guatemala Inc	252299		/users/profile/124247	David23456789	Volunteer	5	08/09/2015	Mission Guatemala did a great job of hosting our church's team. They provided valuable service projects that would best serve the neediest people. The accommodations, food, and hosts were all top notch. 
Mission Guatemala Inc	100718		/users/profile/124247	David23456789	Volunteer	5	11/16/2011	The mission serves some of the poorest folks in the world.   While there I installed wood burning stoves for families living in concrete and adobe houses with dirt floors who have been cooking over an open fire inside the house.  There were other very worthwhile projects that others in our group participated in.  This is one of the best run missions that I have served.  They were very well organized and made sure everyone had meaningful work to do.  They even were able to respond quickly with additional meaningful work for one person in our group who sprained her ankle and couldn't continue serving on one of the planned projects.They obviously love the folks they are serving and care deeply for the volunteers as well.  Thanks Mission Guatemala.
Mission Guatemala Inc	252293		/users/profile/89025	Maurya	Volunteer	5	08/09/2015	Mission Guatemala is strategic and thoughtful in the way that they support and encourage healthcare, nutrition, and education in Guatemala.  They are excellent stewards of the financial donations that they receive, and they are impacting Guatemala in an amazingly positive way.  Thank you for another incredible week!
Mission Guatemala Inc	81343		/users/profile/89025	Maurya	Donor	5	03/07/2011	Mission Guatemala is providing much-needed support for the poorest of the poor in Guatemala.  With a newly-opened clinic and day care center, this organization is providing Christ-centered care by meeting physical and day-to-day needs.  Tom Heaton and his group are truly acting as the hands and feet of Jesus on a daily basis.  My home church recently held a medicine drive to collect over-the-counter medications to help stock the clinic's pharmacy.  We can't wait to see how God uses and multiplies these gifts for the people Mission Guatemala is serving.
Mission Guatemala Inc	251620		/users/profile/339581	Locknan	Volunteer	5	08/04/2015	Mission Guatemala is an incredibly organized, we'll run organization. They provided my group with purposeful work.

Thank you for the incredible opportunity to serve with your organization. 
Mission Guatemala Inc	251531		/users/profile/339486	LynetteECUMC	Volunteer	5	08/04/2015	Mission Guatemala was a perfect organization to host our church's first International Mission trip for youth. With a group of 18 people, my expectations were far exceeded. Their knowledge of the area, relationships they have developed with the people, staff support and submergence in the culture was evident. There was security in knowing that the work you were doing in the communities was necessary, wanted and pleasing to God.  I highly suggest this organization to others and I am looking forward to returning. 
Mission Guatemala Inc	251412		/users/profile/339358	leighrand	Volunteer	5	08/03/2015	I have had the blessing of serving at Mission Guatemala for 3 years. This is an incredibly well organized mission that has at its heart the Guatemalan people.  They invest in the lives of people who live in communities of rural Guatemala through education, nutrition and medical care.  We take our graduating seniors each year to serve at Mission Guatemala.  Through their experiences, they see the world through a better set of eyes after serving with Mission Guatemala and are better prepared to continue their journey post high school.  I highly recommend serving with Mission Guatemala!
Mission Guatemala Inc	251298	1	/users/profile/339220	aweiland	Volunteer	5	08/03/2015	Mission Guatemala exceeded our expectations for our most recent youth mission trip.  First, they are a mission based upon relationships with the communities they serve and responsive to needs expressed rather than pre-conceived notions of what North Americans think is needed.  They are well organized and maintained excellent communications before, during and after our trip.  The accommodations, food and excursions were excellent.  As a veteran of numerous mission trips in Latin America, i believe this is a mission  that is absolutely worthy of our support.
Mission Guatemala Inc	251297		/users/profile/339219	willrandall	Volunteer	5	08/03/2015	Wonderful trip and organization. This was my third mission trip through Mission Guatemala, and I have been thoroughly and increasingly impressed each time. They truly exemplify the words "Do all the good you can...", and are making a tangible difference in the lives and communities of the Guatemalan people.
Mission Guatemala Inc	251226		/users/profile/109179	Brenda F.	Volunteer	5	08/02/2015	Last week I returned home from my fifth trip to Guatemala to serve with Mission Guatemala.  For this trip, my team and I worked on the expansion of the kitchen at the primary school in Xepec.  Mission Guatemala continues to work to help the families in the San Andres area.  With their focus on education and nutrition for the children, they have made great strides in improving the futures for these children.  It is also impressive the way Mission Guatemala strives to partner with the communities so they can help them with the areas of true need. 
Mission Guatemala Inc	119148		/users/profile/109179	Brenda F.	Volunteer	5	07/23/2012	I've recently returned from my 2nd trip to Guatemala to assist Mission Guatemala.  My 2nd trip was as amazing as my first, and I look forward to many more.  This year, I worked on 4 different projects:  1)  installation of fuel-efficient stoves in the homes 2) construction of water collection tanks at one of the schools 3) family pictures for families at 3 local schools and 4) preparation of soccer fields at Nueva Esperanza school.  Tom and Dave are so dedicated to improving the lives of these families.  I feel so blessed to be a part of this.
Mission Guatemala Inc	94423		/users/profile/109179	Brenda F.	Volunteer	5	07/26/2011	I spent July 9 - July 17 in Guatemala with my mission team from JCUMC.  Mission Guatemala is amazing.  Rev. Tom Heaton is such an inspiration with all that he has allowed God to do through him in such a short time.  I was privileged to work on 3 different projects during my week there:  1)  Mission Guatemala is building a house for a family that was displaced, so I was able to work a couple of days helping on the house construction; 2)  our team constructed 6 cabinets & 3 teacher desks for the Nueva Esperanza school;  3)  Mission Guatemala is installing efficient stoves into homes that either don't have a stove or homes that have an inadequate stove.  I was able to visit a couple of the homes that had received these stoves.  Mission Guatemala's first accomplishments were the clinic with Doctor's office, Dentist's office and Pharmacy, and the Preschool.  These are now in full swing.   They also built a feeding center which is a partnership with Nueva Esperanza school.  Our team had the special privilege of attending the recognition ceremony for the opening of this center.   Although there was much work to be done, Tom did not want our experience to just be about the work.  He planned our itinerary such that we were able to experience the culture of Guatemala.  We spent a day at Chichicastenango at the beginning of our week, we had a special dinner one night during our trip in which our host shared his Mayan culture with us, and a trip across the lake to a weaving coop at the end of our week.  This really helped us to better understand the people and the impact of the work we did.  
Mission Guatemala Inc	250858		/users/profile/338755	GFloyd	Volunteer	5	07/31/2015	The staff provides the perfect mix of logistics, safety, accommodations and cultural opportunities to allow a team to fully experience all the beauty and richness that is Guatemala. They stress that it is more important to make relationships within the communities than to "finish" a work project. You will work hard, lean new skills, make new friends & they allow sufficient leisure time for teams to either relax or reflect upon being the "hands and feet of Christ." It is also so rewarding to know that their sole purpose of being in Guatemala is to positively impact the lives of children and families in the communities in which you serve. This was my 4th trip with Mission Guatemala and I cannot wait until my 5th!
Mission Guatemala Inc	250435		/users/profile/338279	homanga	Volunteer	5	07/28/2015	I just finished my 2nd trip to Guatemala and hope to make many more.   The Mission Guatemala are special people whose focus on education, health, and nutrition is designed to meet the unique needs of each community they support.  Volunteers not only provide "helping hands" working alongside talented Guatemalan workers but spend time with children of the local communities.  They also get to visit some of beautiful and interesting sites in the area and leave with an appreciation for the land and people of Guatemala.  A trip here is truly a life changing experience.  
Mission Guatemala Inc	250283	1	/users/profile/338119	jhawk428	Volunteer	5	07/27/2015	I have just returned from another week of working with Mission Guatemala - my fifth in five years.  We have developed what we expect to be a long term relationship with Mission Guatemala.  The visions and goals of Tom Heaton and Dave Burns are in strong agreement with ours.  Mission Guatemala is working towards making long term differences in areas of nutrition, health and education.  An important part of every visit is the development of relationships - within the community, with the staff, within your own teams and with other teams serving at the same time.  There is never any question that mission teams will be treated  well and kept safe.  The staff have always been extremely friendly and professional.  As a team leader for a number of years, I never hesitate to recommend Mission Guatemala as a mission opportunity.   
Mission Guatemala Inc	250279	1	/users/profile/338115	Brittney04	Volunteer	5	07/27/2015	This was such a blessing to my life. I love the way in which they run the program, where they did more than help individuals, but strove to develop a community. The people in charge are phenomenal, creating projects for teams in a foreign environment, but then feeling welcomed and safe at every meal and at the place of residency. Best trip I've ever been on, I can't wait to go back.
Mission Guatemala Inc	250226		/users/profile/338058	Haefer	Volunteer	5	07/27/2015	I just returned from my first mission trip and it was to Mission Guatemala.  The organization reaches their people by using their input to determine where they most need help.  The lives they are able to touch is so great.  I fell in love with the Guatemalan people.
Mission Guatemala Inc	250216	1	/users/profile/338051	Ashley.Swoape97	Volunteer	5	07/27/2015	Mission Guatemala........there are no words at all to describe the love, laughter, and pure hope that this amazing organization pumps out of its system each and every day I was there. Dave, Tom, Laura, Josh, and Diego are  awesome and amazing in their own ways and I can't wait to go back year after year. 
Mission Guatemala Inc	250183	1	/users/profile/338015	Eric.Robinson	Volunteer	5	07/27/2015	Details -- every detail was planned to perfection.    I just spent the past 8 days with Mission Guatemala and the trip was everything I hoped for and more.   The staff was exceptional in planning every detail of work and non-work time.   The work was VERY rewarding ... the food was excellent and the sleeping arrangements were excellent as well -- WAY beyond my expectations.  I can't say enough good things about Mission Guatemala !!!   I will definitely be returning.   
Mission Guatemala Inc	249527		/users/profile/337352	Mission_Guatemala	Volunteer	5	07/23/2015	What a wonderful experience! This was my second ever mission trip. The first was to Brazil. I thought Brazil prepared me what to expect in Guatemala but while I benefitted from both experiences, I learned that people react and adjust to their poor living conditions  differently in different geographic regions. Mission Guatemala provided the perfect environment for us to work within. The housing, transportation back and forth to the work sites, meals and staff were outstanding. I never interacted with a single person that was not cheerful, helpful and supportive. I am sure we created headaches for them but we never knew it. The mission work itself was demanding but rewarding. While on the work site, we worked hard at our tasks but there was time to play with the school children when they were at recess (and a little mission team soccer as well). Although we were not able to complete the kitchen/dining areas expansion, we made a lot of progress and I saw it would benefit many, many children in the years to come. Mission Guatemala has made tremendous strides in improving lives in some of the mountain villages. They have a medical/dental/pharmacy center, school programs for feeding and teaching, play grounds and many other activities underway. They are thrifty with their funds and I never saw anything being wasted. In fact, since I returned to the USA, have started thinking twice before I throw anything away and am trying to be a little less wasteful. I am so thankful that you guys allowed me the opportunity to participate in a small way this past week and hope to do it again next year. I am looking forward to seeing how much more Mission Guatemala has accomplished when I return. I am sure I will be very pleasantly surprised and thrilled. 
Mission Guatemala Inc	249502		/users/profile/337324	Olivia18	Volunteer	5	07/23/2015	Our experience with Mission Guatemala rates a five star. All of the people were extremely helpful and very knowledgeable   Our team was very well taken care of  during our stay there and our mission experience was well planned and we were able to accomplish a lot in our short time there .
Mission Guatemala Inc	249011		/users/profile/336826	kirku	Volunteer	5	07/21/2015	I worked with Mission Guatemala as an adult chaperone for the LOUMC youth group in July, 2015.  The staff was very helpful in providing everything we needed to make our stay pleasant and hassle free.  I was particularly impressed by the vision of this organization.  They are trying to change the future of an entire generation in the area they serve.We spent 5 days working with a local crew to help double the size of an elementary school. The crew taught me a lot about how to build a solid structure without all the tools and materials we have readily available in the US.  Our kids also got the chance to interact with the local students and it made a deep impression on all of them.I would highly recommend this organization to any faith community that is looking to get involved in meaningful mission work.
Mission Guatemala Inc	248998		/users/profile/336811	USCgirl	Volunteer	5	07/21/2015	Mission Guatemala is a fantastic organization. I have done twoisdion projects with them and I look forward to doing more in the future. They are organized. The accommodations are nice. The food is fantastic. The trip includes 2 fun days where you can truly see the beauty of the country. The work sites allow you an opportunity to work alongside the people you are serving. Very rewarding. 
Mission Guatemala Inc	248991		/users/profile/336801	kbruner16	Volunteer	5	07/21/2015	I had a great time assisting Mission Guatemala with their current projects. We mostly helped build onto a new school, and those helping us learn how to construct were extremely patient and kind. The compound we stayed at was kept up well, and I felt very safe and secure throughout the entire trip. I especially thought it was nice how they balance out the work with fun, such as boat trips across the lake and a night out to dinner.
Mission Guatemala Inc	248982		/users/profile/336789	budsuz	Volunteer	5	07/21/2015	Our church group has just returned from Mission Guatemala and this was our second trip.  That alone should tell you something.  From the time you are riding from Guatemala City until your return to the airport, you are well taken care of.  The lodging is wonderful; the food is excellent; and all of the staff members do their best to help teams feel welcome.  PLUS, I loved hearing the story of how all of this work began and it is evident that God has blessed this mission.  It's hard to leave once you learn the folks in Guatemala.

Mission Guatemala Inc	248917		/users/profile/336709	jg39	Volunteer	5	07/20/2015	Mission Guatemala was an incredible experience which I will cherish for a lifetime. The organization is very well run with top notch people running the organization. The staff has built a long standing relationships in Guatemala which was apparent everywhere we visited in Guatemala.  Mission Guatemala also helped organize  local events that allowed us to experience local culture. I recommend this organization for anybody who is looking to make a real difference in the lives of less fortunate children in Guatemala.
Mission Guatemala Inc	248867		/users/profile/336656	Drew_Tyrrell	Volunteer	5	07/19/2015	Mission Guatemala is doing amazing things down in Guatemala and deserves all the recognition it gets, and even more than that. The way they work with the communities and use their gifts to help others is something special. My trip to Guatemala couldn't have been what it was without Mission Guatemala, and they have helped to change my perception of my life and how I go about it.
Mission Guatemala Inc	248396		/users/profile/336115	kSmS	Volunteer	5	07/14/2015	Our week serving at Mission Guatemala  was a wonderful experience! At the work site, everything was ready for us and working alongside the Guatemalan workers was a time for building friendships. At the River House, the accommodations were much more than I expected. The food was excellent, the beds comfortable and all was clean and beautiful.They provided sightseeing and introductions to the Guatemalan culture during free time that  were truly amazing.
Mission Guatemala Inc	248177		/users/profile/163447	joediane244	Volunteer	5	07/12/2015	It's amazing what Tom Heaton and his great staff have accomplished with God's help, such as  medical/dental/eye clinics, preschool, feeding centers, clean water project, stove project and various construction projects in the municipality of San Andres.  They are very thoughtful and prayerful before they start something new.  If they can't do it "right", they don't do it!  If you are looking to support a mission in Guatemala with hands-on or funding, this is the place.  We have served here 3 weeks out of the last 4 years. God has blessed us through this mission and the people of Guatemala!
Mission Guatemala Inc	120200		/users/profile/163447	joediane244	Volunteer	5	08/08/2012	Looking for a great non-profit  to serve or support?  Here's a GREAT opportunity for you....Mission Guatemala!   Tom Heaton, a UMC pastor, started this mission in 2009. In September 2010 Dave Burns also joined the staff.   The Mission is being very effective in meeting the needs of the communities. On July 21-29 my husband and I  were on a work team for Mission Guatemala. Our work team was building a soccer field for a community, Nueva Esperanza, which was displaced by an earthquake.  The men of the community worked for 2 weeks getting the area ready for the teams.  They also helped as we worked on the project. The men of the village expressed their gratitude for our helping their community.  This gives their children a place to play, makes it really feel like home, and gives them HOPE!  Tom and Dave  have so many projects that are helping make life better in Guatemala.  Emphasis is on basic needs like preschool,  low cost medical and dental clinics, nutrition center and feeding programs.  My team members and I were blessed to be able to serve the people of Guatemala under the supervision of Tom and Dave at Mission Guatemala!
Mission Guatemala Inc	247750		/users/profile/335368	amy.crabtree	Volunteer	5	07/08/2015	What an honor it was to serve with Mission Guatemala.  They linked me with such beautiful, genuine people!  I learned the importance of building relationships like never before while working on building a kitchen for a school.  Sure, I was almost five feet underground digging ditches, but I was uplifted by the work ethic and love provided by the staff of Mission Guatemala.  Thank you for all your hard work and dedication to God.  Thank you for the opportunity to serve with you.  Mission Guatemala provided a comfortable and beautiful place to stay, amazing meals (in fact, I scored some recipes from the women before leaving!), and safe transportation while serving.  Again, thank you.

It was very organized and the the food, housing, and work project was great.  We put in the foundation for a very much needed two classroom addition to a school.  The logistics were all planned out and there were no surprises. I would highly recommend this mission to anyone from a beginner to the expert.  I will be going back, I am hooked. And last but not least I felt the local folks were so appreciative of your work, effort and presence.  I give them an A+.

I was expecting to get to be a part of a work team and to visit the mission site, but that was only part of the experience. Trips to nearby places were planned to enrich our understanding of local culture. The people of Guatemala are so friendly and generous and I made friendships that I know will change me forever. Thank you to Tom Heaton and staff for answering God's call.

We were building additional rooms onto a small school. It was a wonderful and rewarding week of hardwork. The River House where we stayed was beautiful,the food was great and the staff was kind and helpful. The greatest thing for me is that it has inspired my 18 year olds to want to do more mission work. Mission Guatemala is a wonderful organization,

He raved about the care the staff gave to his group from Ann Arbor, the quality of the work site jobs, and the general feeling that radiated from the whole experience.  He was very hesitant to go on this trip, but returned with wonderful things to say about the whole experience provided by Mission Guatemala.  Thank you!
Mission Guatemala Inc	245890	2	/users/profile/333116	Dave755	Volunteer	5	06/22/2015	Our group of 40 people worked with Mission Guatemala for 8 days in June 2015. They were great. The living arrangements were clean, spacious, comfortable, and attractive. The food was tasty and plentiful.  Lots of clean drinking water was provided everywhere we went. The work was meaningful to the communities and there was more than enough to occupy our large group. The local people hired to work with us were skilled, friendly, and patient. Transportation was safe and reliable. Overall - fabulous. I've been on many mission trips and would definitely recommend Mission Guatemala.

The living space was excellent and all the work was very organized. We were always able to find jobs on the worksite and there was never any "busy work." Our group was larger than most, with 40 people, but everyone was taken care of and accounted for throughout the trip. I would highly recommend Mission Guatemala because the people that they are helping are truly in need of it.

Mission Guatemala has the most amazing people helping them help such as Dieguito Xirum who is top notch.  I felt Jesus working through him in the way he cares for the people of Guatemala. And the rest of the crew at the river house are pretty great too, I was blessed to be a part of this mission even if it was only for a week.

Very knowledgeable, helpful and a joy to work with.  They were very organized, had great projects for us to do and had alternate projects in place in case of inclement weather. We kept very busy working but were also given the opportunity to explore and learn about the culture of Guatemala, and its people.   We had a great time and look forward to working with Mission Guatemala in the future!
Mission Guatemala Inc	245306	1	/users/profile/332437	thaehnle	Volunteer	5	06/15/2015	Mission Guatemala is a greatly organized operation.  They are well respected in the community.  Our youth had a wonderful experience working alongside the construction workers and mission team.  Everything was taken care of for us from housing to meals, transportation and sightseeing.   Mission Guatemala has their own "compound" in which we stayed for the duration of our trip.  They provided apartments for us to stay in with amenities such as a full kitchen, separate bedrooms, a common area and there was even a pool onsite.  Meals native to the area were prepared for us in the morning and evening and lunch (american and native combined) was provided at the worksite.  We were given chances to learn the culture by sightseeing and eating in various restaurants.   Enough cannot be said of Mission Guatemala.  I recommend this experience for any group.

Mission Guatemala Inc	243760		/users/profile/330593	smcdermid	Volunteer	5	05/28/2015	My experience at Mission Guatemala was wonderful!  I was the leader of our team of 10 college students and we could not have been more pleased at the work we did (finished a sanitary restroom facility for a rural school) and the quality of the organization that Mission Guatemala provided us.  Our whole team felt safe, well taken care of, and always knew what to expect.  Because of the high caliber of the staff we were able to do incredibly important work as well as experience the culture and people of this beautiful land.I would not hesitate to recommend Mission Gautama to other groups looking to serve in the future.

Mission Guatemala Inc	243256		/users/profile/329951	Mandi B.	Volunteer	5	05/19/2015	It is clear that the love of Christ is demonstrated through the people who work with Mission Guatemala. We were incredibly well fed (the food was great and I have food allergies and they went above and beyond for me!) and the team was so open to teaching us as much as possible. They do a lot of research to make sure that the work they do ACTUALLY benefits the communities they serve, which I respect a lot. My team went into the mountains and worked on walls and the floor of a bathroom we were building for a school, and all the workers were very patient as we messed up over and over again. They never once made us feel inadequate, but instead thanked us for taking time to come down and help, even when we knew the people who worked there could have done the job 100x better than us. Its amazing to see the heart they have for the country, the communities, and the people coming in to help them. I will never forget the people I met and the generosity I've seen!

Mission Guatemala Inc	240296		/users/profile/326403	IrishUprising	Volunteer	5	03/31/2015	Well organized, meaningful projects, and community involvement. Mission Guatemala does an amazing job of organizing the work for the volunteers to complete, overseeing that work, and ensuring that the communities that are receiving the help have a stake in what is done and provide aid themselves, so there is a team effort for the work. Mission Guatemala also teaches the volunteers about the culture and history of the area they working.  After volunteering for Mission Guatemala, I can firmly say that I would easily return and work for them again. As a matter of fact, I am trying to plan when I can bring my three children to volunteer as well.  
Mission Guatemala Inc	240257		/users/profile/326350	Taylor D.	Volunteer	5	03/31/2015	All of the people that worked for Mission Guatemala are very passionate, informative and helpful.

Mission Guatemala Inc	240221		/users/profile/326305	drumcudi11	Volunteer	5	03/30/2015	Mission Guatemala is a great operation. It does everything in its power to not only help communities in Guatemala, but to do it in a respectful way while building lasting bonds with those communities. Additionally it operates very smoothly with the help of everyone that works for mission Guatemala. As a volunteer I feel like our time there was used very efficiently, as we got a lot of work done in only five days. Lastly mission Guatemala encouraged us to bond with the communities and learn about the diverse cultures with ing Guatemala. 10/10 this organization is a fantastic one!
Mission Guatemala Inc	239959		/users/profile/325958	pastorpam	Volunteer	5	03/26/2015	my trip to Mission Guatemala in January 2015 was an outstanding trip.  The accomodations exceeded my expectations.  The staff was wonderful to work with and we were always treated with respect.  Our days were well planned and we were able to do many volunteer jobs while there for two weeks.  Mission Guatemala arranged sight seeing trips for us that allowed us to learn more about the culture and the people we were there to serve.  My husband and I were not ready to come back to the states. We would have gladly stayed another two weeks and hope to make a trip back there within a year.  Mission Guatemala is doing great things for the people in the small communities that they work with. I could also see how much the people appreciate all the hard work that Mission Guatemala does along with the teams that come to work.   I would recommend this organization to anyone looking to go on a mission trip
Mission Guatemala Inc	239138		/users/profile/324771	Revbev1053	Volunteer	5	03/11/2015	Tom Heaton and Co.  are wonderful hosts who unfold the story of Mission Guatemala and the many God-interventions that have brought the work to its current scope and efficiency.  Tom and David see needs so clearly, and offer to meet the needs of the Guatemalan poor with great love, no judgment, and a standard of excellence which glorifies God and makes me as a fellow United Methodist very proud.  This country and the people are beautiful!
Mission Guatemala Inc	238930		/users/profile/324448	IowaMarsha	Volunteer	4	03/06/2015	This mission in Pana, Guatemala is focused on helping the local population by supporting the schools, providing medical, dental, and eye care as  well as providing safe water and nutrient food.  I think what makes it clear that they have the people, especially the children, as a focus group is whatever school we visited, and whatever mission representative was with us, the children, teachers and parents all not only knew the mission employees but welcomed them with smiles!  I particularly liked how when Dave visited a school, the kids lined up to be lifted up and hugged, they took turns, and each gave him a big hug.  They appreciate the school supplies, food and medical help, but really enjoy the love that is shared.  This is a mission focused on what the community needs!
Mission Guatemala Inc	238909	2	/users/profile/324414	Katherine37	Volunteer	5	03/06/2015	Mission Guatemala Inc is a very productive organization reaching out to several communities with a wide variety of needs. The communities that we were able to help and spend time with are very grateful and humble people. Their years of revolutions, poverty and natural disaster have not dampened the cheerful spirit. We need more organizations who are willing to assure the money donated is placed where it is intended. These servants truly are selfless and live on a minimum while passing on their gifts to others. I am very blessed to have been a part of their helping hand.  May His Spirit continue to bring you joy.  Katherine Howell
Mission Guatemala Inc	238903	2	/users/profile/324406	VIMBev	Volunteer	5	03/06/2015	A group of us from Iowa spent 2 weeks with Mission Guatemala in January 2015.  We were very impressed with the organization, its mission and goals, the amount of work that is accomplished, the basic services provided to the village people and the efficiency with which all is completed on few monetary resources!  The medical clinic staffed by Guatemalan doctors, dentists, and pharmacists meets the needs of families who do not have the opportunity or resources to get those services.  The meals and school supplies given to poor children in the area are meeting basic needs of nutrition and education!  We saw the smiles on the faces of children when they received the school bags.   Mission Guatemala appears to be always looking for ways to improve the lives and opportunities of the disadvantaged.  For instance, I helped teach sewing to women with the hope that they will make things to sell to earn some income as well as be able to teach others to sew.  The organization is planning to develop a technical training program to teach skills that can be used in the work force.  And they're going to open an optometry clinic. I was very impressed with the staff, their caring attitudes, and their commitment to improving the lives of the poor in the area.  I would definitely like to return and be involved with their program again.  It is well organized!  Bev Kruempel
Mission Guatemala Inc	238872	1	/users/profile/324353	VIMJane	Volunteer	5	03/05/2015	Mission Guatemala is a highly-ethical, reputable, well-run organization that is truly making a positive difference in the lives of impoverished Guatemalans.   I was so impressed with the efficiency of the organization.    They are providing medical services (including dental, optometric, pharmaceutical), jobs, nutritious food, clean water, fuel-efficient stoves, school supplies, and much more, to people in need, and all within a minimal administrative budget.   The staff are caring, talented, delightful people who are passionate about their work, and their passion is contagious.     Rather than imposing improvements based upon first-world perceptions, Mission Guatemala is driven by the needs and the culture of those whom they serve.  Because of this, the program is highly respected and trusted by the communities served and the entire country.   Our mission team of 20 volunteers spent 2 weeks serving with Mission Guatemala.   Due in large part to their being well-organized and having lots of connections within the communities, we were able to maximize the use of our varied talents and accomplish more than I would have dreamed possible in such a short time.    We had a wonderful time working there.   In addition to the work, we were treated to a few delightful excursions to experience the culture of Guatemala.   The lodgings provided are safe and comfortable, far better than what I would expect on a mission trip, and the food extraordinary! I truly hope to return someday on another mission trip!

This is a well planned program staffed by reliable and knowledgeable people who are very helpful.  A variety  of work was accomplished because of the advance preparation of the staff and the willingness of our team to get the job done but not at the expense of building relationships.  I highly recommend this mission project for potential teams wanting a place where significant and meaningful work can be done for the Glory of God. 
Mission Guatemala Inc	238581		/users/profile/323919	JenniferRG	Volunteer	5	02/26/2015	We visited Mission Guatemala in January, 2015.  It was a transformational experience for both my husband and I.  This ministry does not just go out and try to "fix" people and their situations, they are in dialogue with the communities to hear what their needs are and then they provide assistance and support to meet the needs of the community.  Tom and Dave are providing great leadership to a stellar group of people they have recruited to work with.  The combination of both people that originate from the communities they serve as well as people working in their fields of expertise is what makes this such an amazing ministry.  Observing and experiencing how Mission Guatemala  engages their communities to participate and invest in their own change was truly inspiring!   Upon returning to the organization I serve, I felt there was a lot to be learned from the Mission Guatemala model.  Jennifer, Indiana USA
Mission Guatemala Inc	238320		/users/profile/107977	Ruth	Volunteer	4	02/20/2015	I have worked with Mission Guatemala several years, and I am always learning something new.  Working on projects that are needed in the rural areas are always satisfying and rewarding.  Tom and Dave maintain their focus on education , health, and nutrition, and it shows.  I like that they involve people of the areas to be involved in the projects as this gives ownership to the people and not to us  outsiders.  
Mission Guatemala Inc	93703		/users/profile/107977	Ruth	Volunteer	4	07/11/2011	Our group cleaned & painted at a clinic and preschool facility;  built tables and benches for a feeding center; and started building a house for a Mayan family.  We were also able to participate in presenting water filtration systems to displaced families that have lived in tents since last fall (2010) when they had to leave their village because of mud slides.  The best part of the experience was that we were working side by side with the people we were trying to help.  We were learning from each other.  It was a lot of manual labor that took a lot of time and many hands.  Tom and David have their hands full managing the groups that come in to do projects, but I think that is why they have gotten so much done in the short time since the mission work began.  Not many organizations can get a building, doctor, dentist, and preschool going in less than a year.  They keep a handle on what needs to be done to add positive quality to community life inspite of the difficulties the people face.
Mission Guatemala Inc	238311		/users/profile/323493	RickPaul	Volunteer	5	02/20/2015	Mission Guatemala is truly a wonderful organization that does mission work in the right way.  They have deep respect for the communities and people they work with.  First class all the way!

Mission Guatemala Inc	232833		/users/profile/296438	Jonah628	Volunteer	5	11/04/2014	Mission Guatemala is doing a great job of affecting the lives of children in Guatemala, well organized. The week we had building a new cafeteria was rewording, the crew waste nothing.  
Mission Guatemala Inc	232801		/users/profile/296393	befjr	Volunteer	5	11/03/2014	Mission Guatemala is an amazing organization. Tom Heaton has developed a staff that is dedicated and proficient in their jobs. They are continuing to serve more and more needs in the area. The project our team worked on was well organized.  With the help of the MG staff and workers we were able to do more than we ever thought possible at the beginning of our stay. The accommodations and meals were exceptional, especially for the area. We were given tours of the clinic and area to better understand the real needs of the people. Overall I think MG is one of the finest organizations with which I have been associated.

Mission Guatemala Inc	134061		/users/profile/179830	Vince A.	Volunteer	5	11/06/2012	Mission Guatemala does an awesome job of managing work teams.  They line up meaningful work to be done.  They pay attention to the details of accomodations.  And most importantly they are intentional about giving team members opportunities to meet Guatemalans and learn about their culture and conditions.  I have been on many mission trips over the last 20 years, several outside the US, and this trip was definitely the best.
Mission Guatemala Inc	232770		/users/profile/296365	Terri52	Volunteer	4	11/03/2014	Volunteering with Mission Guatemala was a great experience. It was exciting to be a part of a continuing construction project to make a kitchen for a school. I like being able to help others and being a part of the many people and activities that have been and will be part of the project. Mission Guatemala is doing many different good things. In addition, the River House provided nice housing and the cooks made great meals.
Mission Guatemala Inc	232766		/users/profile/179647	margoborre1	Volunteer	5	11/03/2014	This is our second trip to volunteer with Mission Guatemala! And we'd go again in a heartbeat. The projects are extremely well organized and the staff and other workers are just great. The passion for the work they do is written all over them! Great balance of work and downtime. We were blessed far more than we blessed others I'm sure!
Mission Guatemala Inc	133886		/users/profile/179647	margoborre1	Volunteer	5	11/05/2012	What an amazing week we had with Mission Guatemala! The projects (helping to build an office for the teachers at the Jr. High School and installing efficient stoves); the beautiful children; the amazing way God blessed us while we were there. We've already scheduled our return trip for next year! Thank You Mission Guatemala for all you are doing for the people of Guatemala!
Mission Guatemala Inc	232761	3	/users/profile/296355	demartin	Volunteer	5	11/03/2014	  This was my second trip to volunteer for Mission Guatemala.   This is an outstanding organization that has great respect in the San Andreas Semetebaj and Panajachel areas.  They are very organized and consistently  develop  programs that exceed similar mission progams.  From the staff, cooks, interpreters. drivers, and work leaders, Mission Guatemala does an excellent job of  coordinating a true cultural emersion experience.  The accommodations and food are excellent and you are well taken care of during your stay. Your experience includes the opportunity to work with the native people and explore areas that the normal tourist would never get to see on a regular tour.   Mission Guatemala goes beyond being just a mission trip.  They have developed trust and respect from the local people as well as creating a true international bond of friendship between the United States and Guatemala.  They include cultural experiences to accompany the actual mission experience.  I encourage anyone thinking about doing mission work abroad for their first time to give Mission Guatemala a try.   It is amazing to observe the growth of this organization in such a short amount of time.   I know that they will go far in the future doing all the good they can for the wonderful people of Guatemala.    D. Martin, Evansville, IN
Mission Guatemala Inc	232754		/users/profile/179654	dpaisacpa	Volunteer	5	11/03/2014	This was my second trip to Mission Guatemala.  It was such a blessing!  Very well organized.  It was a great mix of work, education and fun!  
Mission Guatemala Inc	133893		/users/profile/179654	dpaisacpa	Volunteer	5	11/05/2012	I and 12 others from my church spent last week in Guatemala working with Mission Guatemala.  It was a simply wonderful experience all the way around.  We worked hard and felt a great deal of satisfaction with the work we did.  Our accommodations were better than any other mission trip I have been on and Tom and Dave were always there to answer any questions we had.  A fabulous experience!!
Mission Guatemala Inc	231265		/users/profile/121699	madmarsha	Volunteer	5	10/31/2014	This was  my second trip to Mission Guatemala.  Tom and his team do a remarkable job.  We learned the history of Mission Guatemala, visited the clinic, preschool, and feeding center.  We worked all week on stuccoing a school kitchen.  We were just part of a team effort of many volunteer groups to help build this kitchen for the children in the area.  We enjoyed the people, culture and beautiful surroundings.  We had gracious hosts, cooks, bus drivers, guide, construction crew, and interpreter.  Thank you for a wonderful week.
Mission Guatemala Inc	100138		/users/profile/121699	madmarsha	Volunteer	5	11/01/2011	I just spent the last week with Mission Guatemala and I'm still thinking about the wonderful experiences I had.  Tom, David and Noah made the week of hard work, fun and meaningful.  Tom has said  he is all about developing relationships and we definitely did that with the friendly and appreciative natives.I painted a house and fence, delivered and helped assemble fuel efficient stoves and  played with the adorable preschoolers.   Throughout the week a staff member was working along with us and helping us.  Tom made sure that the volunteers needs were met while making sure that we had worthwhile projects to do to help the people of the villages.Before Mission Guatemala existed these people had no one they could depend on to help them.  Within a year's time there is a health and dental clinic and a preschool which is available to them.  Plus a feeding center was built for children in another area.  Many great things have been accomplished in such a short time.I am so glad that I was able to be a part of this wonderful organization.  I'm hoping to return and help Mission Guatemala improve the lives of their neighbors.
Mission Guatemala Inc	229058		/users/profile/292728	EPalmer	Volunteer	5	10/28/2014	Mission Guatemala is a well-organized, high-functioning organization that engages local participation from the Guatemalan community in determining the most urgent needs and building trust in the communities they serve.  They give hard-working, appreciative people a hand up, not a handout that will have a dramatic impact on future generations!  I just completed a 9 day mission trip there.  I truly feel that I took away more than I gave. Elaine Palmer
Mission Guatemala Inc	228863		/users/profile/292540	Paulina Rubio	Volunteer	5	10/28/2014	This was my first experience with Mission Guatemala. The time spent was remarkable. Our team worked on a kitchen that will feed 500 Mayan children a substantial daily meal. The work was hard but rewarding. We were able to see first hand the benefits these feeding centers make during our visit to an existing center. We spent time in their medical and dental clinic. The organization provided an well rounded program for our 15 member team that included teens to us middle age folk and we all were useful in the construction project. Not only will this experience change the lives of Mayan children in this area of desperate need, it changed my life. 
Mission Guatemala Inc	228665		/users/profile/120682	Charlie D.	Volunteer	5	10/28/2014	My second trip to Mission Guatemala.  It was very rewarding to see the cumulative effect of many groups over time having a generational impact on the loving people of Guatemala.  The entire trip was organized from the time we landed in Guatemala City until we left.  We experienced an incredible week of working with the local people on a kitchen for the middle school.  We visited the market in Chi Chi, the medical clinic, kindergarten and feeding center.  We took the tuc-tuc to into Panajachel for dinner and market.  Mission Guatemala lets you be part of the community with the people.  I hope to go again.
Mission Guatemala Inc	99735	1	/users/profile/120682	Charlie D.	Volunteer	5	10/25/2011	With some missions I have questioned what percentage of my giving gets to the people in need.  After my trip to Panajachel, I was absolutely amazed how gifts were multiplied by Tom and his staff.  The things they can do, the lives they touch with one dollar was astounding.  And the projects don't just effect those receiving, but impact generations: teaching the children Spanish, feeding them, dental care, medical care, and clean efficient stoves for their homes.  Doesn't get any more basic than that.  I plan to go back.  I will give.  And I will pray for Mission Guatemala.
Mission Guatemala Inc	227187		/users/profile/290917	Jim_125	Volunteer	5	10/27/2014	We just completed a 9 day trip in Guatemala and have a great deal of positives to share. The staff was extremely helpful in assisting us thru the culture the mission and our impact to helping Mission Guatemala meet its vision. From the transportation and the drivers to and from Guatemala City to Panajachel, to the accomidations, food and preparations, to the onsite translators and staff everyone involved was deeply passionate about their role and purpose. The love of God and people is evident in the many interactions we had all along the way. We will be back and intend to bring other new volunteers with us. I am greatful for the opportunity they have provided us and the impact on those they are serving. 
Mission Guatemala Inc	227168		/users/profile/290898	Russell A.	Volunteer	5	10/27/2014	This mission provide much needed help to the grossly under served in the highlands of Guatemala.

Mission Guatemala Inc	227062		/users/profile/290793	T.D.	Volunteer	5	10/27/2014	Having volunteered in many U.S. based and out of country mission trips, Mission Guatemala was by far the most organized. We had a large team and the interaction with the local people and the facilities were first class. Thank you for the experience. 
Mission Guatemala Inc	226038	1	/users/profile/289790	Support222	Volunteer	5	10/24/2014	My experience with Mission Guatemala  far exceeded my expectations.  This was my first international  experience.  The relationship between Team Guatemala and the community seemed to be one of trust and cooperation.  The program was exceptional in that it clearly paralleled the goals that the team shared.  I will always remember the special relationships and  the community experience I had with Mission Guatemala.  God bless:)
Mission Guatemala Inc	226023		/users/profile/289774	Support123	Volunteer	5	10/24/2014	Tom and his team certainly exceeded my anticipations.  They are well organized, respected in the communities in which they serve and attentive to their guest's needs.  They have accomplished much in the short time they have been working along with the Mayan people of Guatemala.  Please research them and support their work.  Tom's team is joyfully sharing God's love with the local Mayan people through programs to help them improve their health, nutrition and education.
Mission Guatemala Inc	225667		/users/profile/289427	Vicki56	Volunteer	5	10/23/2014	I have participated in several U.S. based mission opportunities before, but Mission Guatemala was by far the most organized group I 've been associated with!  They have created a comfortable, safe  home base for team members to return to each day.  The Mission keeps clear their vision as a viable contributor to the culture of Guatemala and the Guatemalan people with whom they work and serve.  The Mission Guatemala staff exhibited knowledge of the people and communities they are serving and obviously have given much thought and planning to the programs they have implemented.  It was great getting to know the staff and seeing how they integrated themselves into our group and made us feel at home. The opportunities were endless for us to get to experience the Guatemalan people in their own environments and communities and to interact with the school children and adults alike.  This was a great experience, and I am very thankful for the opportunity to serve with all our group and be a part of the medical team.       
Mission Guatemala Inc	225302		/users/profile/289076	Loi_M	Volunteer	5	10/23/2014	I had such a wonderful experience on this, my first, mission trip.  We worked alongside the wonderful and warm Mayan men as we prepared the walls and ceiling of the new kitchen for stucco to be applied.  Our teens played games and made crafts with the happy, engaged children at a school while wellness checks were done by the medical team. It was a joy to see a culture proud of their heritage and preserving the traditional dress of the women and girls (the men stopped wearing their traditional  clothing as it made them an easy target during the 20 year civil war).  Our work was balanced with fun as  we experienced local maket day, a cultural dinner, and a visit to a local artisan community in our free time.  Not only did we accomplish tasks, we made relationships and carried cherished memories back with us.Mission Guatemala was well organized, is staying targeted to its' goals, and  is doing a marvelous job on so many levels for this area!
Mission Guatemala Inc	225233		/users/profile/289002	ColeenA	Volunteer	5	10/22/2014	I was very impressed with the entire staff at Mission Guatemala. Each person had a true love for the Guatemalan people and had their best interest at heart. The desire to serve the people within their culture was evident. Because of the relationships the staff of Mission Guatemala have built, we were welcomed and able to interact with adults and children in spite of the language difference.  Our accommodations were comfortable and the food was tasty. 
Mission Guatemala Inc	225020		/users/profile/288792	Kevin106	Volunteer	5	10/22/2014	We had a great and fulfilling time in Guatemala.  The Mission Guatemala team has their act together and a great connection to the community.  I would love to go again sometime.
Mission Guatemala Inc	224751		/users/profile/288510	jmeats	Volunteer	5	10/21/2014	I served on the medical team with Mission Guatemala.  The accomodations were wonderful, the staff were so fantastic, helpful, caring, and informative.  I never felt unsafe.  I trusted the staff and believed that they always were well prepared for any and all tasks.  My experience with the medical team was so rewarding.  Knowing that I had a small part in helping the children and recovering alcoholics of Guatemala was very heartwarming.  Being a part of the first organized medical team to go to the schools and rehabilitation center was incredible.  I am humbled and blessed to be a part of this mission trip.  I really believe that I received so much more than I gave.  The people of Guatemala understand hospitality.  We were welcomed everywhere we visited.  I would enjoy going back to Guatemala to serve again.  Blessings to all who make this journey.
Mission Guatemala Inc	224687		/users/profile/288448	SteveP.	Volunteer	5	10/21/2014	This was our first mission trip and I am very impressed by all aspects of Mission Guatemala's program. We had a good stay at River House, worked well as a  team, helping build the new kitchen,  learned about the local culture and the challenges facing daily life.  Mission Guatemala has a sound model of helping improve the lives of Guatemalans with medical, nutrition and education programs.   I will be going again and plan on helping gain materials here in the USA to help Mission Guatemala further its mission. It was a true blessing to be a part of this program for a short time. I will look at my life in a different way now.

Mission Guatemala Inc	205259		/users/profile/267388	boblouisville	Volunteer	5	07/06/2014	This was my first mission trip.  It won't be my last.  Mission Guatemala was well organized.  They had our activities well planned.  their staff was dedicated and knowledgeable. they guided us through and exposed us to the culture.   their mission objectives were concrete and achievable.  they are making a real difference to the people of Guatemala.  They challenged us and educated us.  I just wish we had more time to spend with this great group of people.   the accommodations were better than I had expected and the food was great.  I will never forget the people however.  So friendly!    I feel so very blessed that my first mission trip was with such a wonder group.  i plan to go back - God willing.

Mission Guatemala Inc	205189		/users/profile/267302	momfingerson	Volunteer	5	07/05/2014	I was part of an inter-generational mission trip that was indeed a great experience.  Mission Guatemala accommodated all ages and found meaningful work for us.  Their  mission is clear - lifting up the lives of Guatemalans through their medical clinic, education, and child nutrition.  Our group dug the foundation for a school kitchen, and we will be eager to see how the next teams will progress!  We worked hard, but the Mission also saw that we enjoyed our stay by introducing us to the people and culture of the gracious Mayans.
Mission Guatemala Inc	205109		/users/profile/267203	Hegele	Volunteer	5	07/03/2014	Our week at Mission Guatemala was outstanding.  As a veteran of dozens of mission trips this was perhaps the best I have experienced -- clear mission, warm hospitality from staff and the Mayans, good accommodations, hard work, happy workers on our team.

Mission Guatemala Inc	205078		/users/profile/267169	Lisa361	Volunteer	5	07/03/2014	What a great experience i had with my first mission trip.  Mission Guatemala is a wonderful organization that helps so many people in their area.  We worked hard in San Andres by breaking ground on a new school kitchen.  We were able to meet the teachers and principal of the school, as well as some children,  and they were so thankful for what we were doing.  Everyone associated with this organization were God loving people and that's why they do what they do.  Tom, Dave, Tricia, Whitney, Laura, Raul, Diego, Elias, Carlos and the cooks were absolutely wonderful people. Thank you for this wonderful opportunity!  God Bless Mission Guatemala!
Mission Guatemala Inc	205077		/users/profile/267168	Sandramooners	Volunteer	5	07/03/2014	I took an intergenerational group to Guatemala through Mission Guatemala.  I was very impressed with the organization of M-G, the professionalism and friendliness of the staff, and the ethos of M-G.  Their mission of working with local leaders to determine the needs of the people they serve is evident the in the projects they undertake.  I'm leery of many organizations that offer mission service trips, but I whole-heartedly recommended Mission Guatemala.  I would recommend this organization to anyone, and I hope to bring another group on a trip through M-G in the future!

Mission Guatemala Inc	203517		/users/profile/265479	Ron_2014	Volunteer	5	06/23/2014	WOW !My trip with Mission Guatemala was fantastic.I had a great time getting to know the people in my group as well as getting to know the people of Guatemala. The trip was well divided into times of work as well as opportunities to see the arts of the people of Guatemala, enjoy the local community, and spend time with our group getting to know each other. The accommodations were great. The rooms were clean and bright, comfortable beds, hot running water, huge bathrooms as well as space to relax in the evenings.If you go hungry at Mission Guatemala it is your own fault. The cooks Angelina and Delia went above and beyond to be sure we were well fed. The grounds and lodgings are well kept by Me Me and Dennis. We had the opportunity to work on a community kitchen in the community of Nueva Victoria .This town is one that was displaced by a hurricane and moved by the government to a new site. I learned how to lay block ,tie rebar, and pour concrete columns. I had the joy of being able to work with the interpreters Diego and Raul and learned many things from them. I also had the chance to work on my Spanish with the workers Victor and Elias. I also had the opportunity to go see the feeding program that they have at one of the schools. It was great to see the joy on the faces of the children as they ate the food. It was great to know that part of the food they were eating was provided through a packing event with Kids Against Hunger -Greenwood and the community of Hagerstown, IN.  Many thanks to Tom Heaton and his vision, as well as to David, Tricia, Whitney, and Laura. Thanks for opening your hearts to us and helping us to grow in our walk. A Mission Guatemala trip is a "Must Do" in my book!I can't wait to come back again and bring my family to experience this trip.Ron Pierce6/14-22/14

Mission Guatemala Inc	196983		/users/profile/257492	katafatik	Volunteer	5	04/03/2014	Totally impressed with Mission Guatemala.  They were organized and we were able to accomplish a lot of work.  They were also very fun to be around and supportive of our ideas to connect with the people we worked with.  The accommodations were also very good.
Mission Guatemala Inc	196955		/users/profile/257457	BrianSmith	Volunteer	5	04/02/2014	When I signed up to go on the trip to Guatemala I was a little nervous. While I'd been on mission trips before it was my first time out of the country on a mission trip or otherwise. I was expecting something like humanitarian commercials on TV showing everyone being sad, wasn't expecting much in the way of food either. When we got out of the airport we met our leader for the week, she seemed like a nice person and was dressed nicely. When we got to Panajachel, the place we were to stay didn't look at all how I pictured it. It was beautiful, it had electricity, hot showers, and a bathroom as good as my own. Throughout the week we learned a lot. Whenever we had a question out leader, interpreter, or even drivers were happy to answer as best they could or find out if they didn't know. The food was incredible, way better than what I had pictured and the ladies who made it were so nice. The people I met while there were always smiling and new the names of all the Mission Guatemala people and most of our groups by the end of the week.When we were leaving everyone was sad to go because we had made so many friends. Mission Guatemala has a great  operation going and their team leaders are outstanding. They look nice, work hard, and love god. 
Mission Guatemala Inc	196700		/users/profile/257103	gervasio.becca	Volunteer	5	03/29/2014	I want to go back. My experience at Mission Guatemala changed my world view entirely. I'm a student at the University of Evansville who initially went down by chance on a Spring Break trip and now they have me thinking about the Peace Corps. Getting to work so closely with the team as well as the people we were serving was especially moving for me. Our work in Guatemala wasn't about the projects or donations, it was about changing us as people who will go back to our communities and make a difference because we see things differently now, with a more international perspective. Also, the leaders we amazing. They took so much personal time to make sure our questions were answered and needs met - it was inspiring and contagious to see people so passionate about what they were doing. Like I said, I'm planning when I can go down again.
Mission Guatemala Inc	196674		/users/profile/257065	sg78	Volunteer	5	03/28/2014	I spent a week with Mission Guatemala and it was fabulous!  The people at Mission Guatemala and the people of Guatemala are great!  I spent the week with a group of university students and we had many great experiences in the local schools.  Would highly recommend this organization to others!
Mission Guatemala Inc	196654		/users/profile/257039	tiffaniemery	Volunteer	5	03/28/2014	I would recommend Mission Guatemala to anyone interested in serving a mission abroad.  It is very well organized and thrives within the communities they serve.  I was very impressed with the connections and positive relationships that Mission Guatemala has made with the people of Guatemala. The Mission Guatemala Team is dedicated to helping the communities of San Andres, but also committed to helping the team members grow in the process.  I am very blessed to have had the opportunity to work with Mission Guatemala. 
Mission Guatemala Inc	196640		/users/profile/257020	RICHLUDW	Client Served	5	03/28/2014	Mission Guatemala creates an unrivaled mission experience. From administration to personnel involved in daily operations, the MG team is unrivaled in their ability to interact with the San Andres community and accommodate diverse mission groups. Their dedication to serve permeates the surrounding communities and is further evidenced in post-return lives of missionaries. I am excited at the prospect of returning; Guatemala is a beautiful country filled with the most benevolent people I have seen. Mission Guatemala truly goes above and beyond to make positive change in many lives.
Mission Guatemala Inc	196632		/users/profile/257011	bk98	Volunteer	5	03/28/2014	MIssion Guatemala has a great relationship with the community. They choose to work with the people of Guatemala in a truly inspiring manner. The organization thinks through the impact it has on the community and listens to the community needs before committing to a project. The accommodations are great and the people are better. It's a great place to really examine your life while giving a helping hand to others. It was a life-changing experience. 
Mission Guatemala Inc	196456		/users/profile/256785	mprifogl	Volunteer	5	03/25/2014	Extraordinarily well organized mission organization. Our trip was flawlessly executed by the Mission Guatemala staff during our recent short term mission project. This is a great opportunity for neophyte or seasoned missionaries to serve prequalified communities in a safe and coordinated way. The staff in Panajachel at the mission, Dave, Tricia, Whitney and the culinary artists, Dalia,  Angelina and Evelyn, went above and beyond any expectation to ensure our group's needs were met. We had an incredible experience doing God's work and felt His presence permeating the space and outreach.I would strongly recommend this organization and look forward to a return trip. Best regards,Mark PrifogleChief Executive Officer and Group PresidentGrandView Health ServicesBrownsburg, IN
Mission Guatemala Inc	196412		/users/profile/256733	ricpaul1	Volunteer	5	03/25/2014	We were extremely impressed with the work of Mission Guatemala.  They seem to approach helping communities from a really great place - they want to truly partner with the community and the individuals to help them help themselves.  We were blessed in the time we spent with Mission Guatemala.  Their staff are all very professional and caring people.
Mission Guatemala Inc	196342		/users/profile/256659	don-sharon	Volunteer	5	03/24/2014	 First, we would say that we had the opportunity to share a truly loving and joyous time in Guatemala with the staff of Mission Guatemala, our 12 other volunteers representing Calvary U. M. church, and the Guatemalan people. Mission Guatemala is doing great things, and we think that one very important aspect of their approach is that they require the local Guatemalan people to work alongside us in their desired village projects. Like the old saying "We are giving them a hand up - not just a hand-out".
Mission Guatemala Inc	196311		/users/profile/256631	jenblake	Volunteer	5	03/24/2014	The most important part of Mission Guatemala is that they make sure the community you are serving is invested themselves in the service you are providing. The volunteer accommodations and food is excellent. I always felt safe.
Mission Guatemala Inc	196179		/users/profile/256477	holly718	Volunteer	5	03/22/2014	Personally seeing Mission Guatemala at work in numerous villages confirmed for me that supporting them through volunteer and monetary means is definitely worthwhile. By having folks embedded in Guatemala they are able to partner with the different communities to ensure their mission has the best possible impact on those in need. We just returned from serving at the school in Secune and are already planning another trip. A wonderful experience was had by our entire team!
Mission Guatemala Inc	196030		/users/profile/256306	SouthernBismarck	Volunteer	5	03/20/2014	Thank you for the opportunity to work as a team with Mission Guatemala. We believe our work will help the children and community of the area. The staff at Mission Guatemala was great to direct us in the work and helped to clarify the needs of the people and better understand the culture. I would definitely recommend this experience to others and would be personally  blessed to participate in another venture with Mission Guatemala in the future. 
Mission Guatemala Inc	195894		/users/profile/256157	roxieclb	Volunteer	5	03/19/2014	Participating with the Calvary United Methodist Church group at Mission Guatemala was the most important and spiritual experience of my life.  It is difficult to explain to others what working with the Mayans meant--sharing love, being uplifted by the mission staff and the group; feeling the spirit of God throughout the week are all part of the experience.  Great job Mission Guatemala!
Mission Guatemala Inc	195888		/users/profile/256152	darla51743	Volunteer	5	03/19/2014	I recently traveled with a group from Calvary United Methodist Church, in Brownsburg, Indiana.  We worked at a school in a mayan village in Secune (sic). via Tom Heaton's Mission Guatemala. Our task was to do cement work on a basketball/soccer court at the school. This was a wonderful experience.  The staff of Mission Guatemala are very dedicated and hard-working.  We saw children being educated, fed, and well-cared for at another village.  I was very impressed with his medical/dental clinic at La Mission.  Our group feels that Tom Heaton's mission Guatemala is making a difference in the lives of the villages he serves.  Our group is going to be sponsoring some of the children so that they can continue their education.  We are definitely willing to return in the future.  Not only did we work at the school, but we learned history and culture of the mayan people.  Mission Guatemala-Tom Heaton by Darla Franklin

The people of Guatemala have beautiful hearts. The work we did met the needs of the community. I have been changed by this mission trip. Gracias a Mission Guatemala!
Mission Guatemala Inc	195830	1	/users/profile/256095	Harold7	Volunteer	5	03/19/2014	My eyes were really opened by my experience with Mission Guatemala.  I know that every penny sent their way is well-spent and meets a specific need in the community that has been assessed by the members of the community themselves and not assumed by the Mission.
Mission Guatemala Inc	195808		/users/profile/256070	fish61	Volunteer	5	03/19/2014	I would like to say , Praise God for MG.  It was such a wonderful God filled experience. The staff there , Dave , Tricia, and Whitney ,do such a wonderful job. You go thinking you are making a difference in the people and you do to some degree , but the real change is the difference the people make in you. For what they have , they are the most wonderful , thankful , loving people in the world. All I can say is THANK YOU MG ! Jim Sebree
Mission Guatemala Inc	195578		/users/profile/255690	shr317	Volunteer	5	03/12/2014	Seeing the face of Christ in those we served was easy when working with MG.  The Mayan people are so warm and welcoming and so proud--rightfully--of their heritage.  Our construction work on a school/community area was physically demanding, but the opportunity it afforded us to interact with the locals--especially the adorable children--made it all worthwhile.  Back at MG's home base, we were well taken care of with lots of good food, comfortable but not lavish accommodations, and a spirit of concern that we get to know and appreciation the Guatemalan people.  
Mission Guatemala Inc	195302		/users/profile/255297	dplawrence2012	Volunteer	5	03/06/2014	The Mission Guatemala experience opened my eyes to the great need of the beautiful people of Guatemala.  The mission is doing much needed work in the areas of nutrition, medical care and medicine, helping schools and children, and building loving relationships with the people.
Mission Guatemala Inc	195171		/users/profile/255106	Rspalding50	Volunteer	5	03/04/2014	The many experiences of Mission Guatemala and how they serve the communities around their areas was amazing to see. Mayan people are very grateful for the work being done on their behalf. Very pleased how we were able to help and experience all the different ways the mission supports the people.
Mission Guatemala Inc	195144		/users/profile/255072	dennisarndt	Volunteer	5	03/03/2014	Mission Guatemala is a great experience. I believe that missions are just one way that God speaks to us. I believe that missions have a way of changing people and humbling us. Honestly, in my own life I have needed to be humbled now and then. It seems to me that mission work is not about projects or money. It has been said Why dont you just send them money? Well, if throwing money alone, at a problem would work, welfare would be more successful than it is. Look at it this way. If you had 2 feet of snow on the ground, would rather have a neighbor help you shovel snow or have someone knock at the door and had you money for a shovel. There is also a problem with handing out money to nameless, faceless, people when some charity goes into undeserving pockets. Another question might be: why travel to another country while there are people in this county and this country who are in need? Well, for the most part, our poor have many forms of charity and welfare.  I believe that most Mayans survive and a few dollars per day.  I dont know of anyone who cooks on a dirt floor over an open fire. Not very people in the area we visited have running water or electricity. I think that missions are all about caring for and helping other people who are less fortunate than we are. Its all about walking in another persons shoes. Generally speaking the Mayans of Guatemala are treated the way Americans have treated our Native Americans. Their culture is 1,000 years old and has 19 separate and distinct languages. The Mayans are generally mistreated, ignored, and discriminated against by their government. We have sent our Native Americans to Reservations. Mayans seem to settle in mountain like, community / reservations. Mission Guatemala helps the Mayans. Our hosts were the kindest, most generous people I have ever met.  
Mission Guatemala Inc	195113		/users/profile/255032	Susanna16	Volunteer	5	03/03/2014	Spent 10 days in Guatemala.  Worked very hard but also got time to learn and see the people, play and get to know the kids and also developed deeper relationships with the people we were with.  Felt safe, got to observe how happy the people were yet how hard working they were.  They really appreciated the things that we did for them and did participate in the activities when possible.  They are very talented there with their weaving, embroidery, terrific gardens in spite of having to plant in rocky steep areas of the mountain area in which they live. We stayed in a Methodist Mission lodging which was clean and provided us a safe, healthy place to be.  They saw that the food was safe and we had lots of bottled water so we did not fear drinking something that might get us ill.
Mission Guatemala Inc	195107		/users/profile/255024	peggyjo	Volunteer	5	03/03/2014	Having never been on an international mission before, I was a bit anxious about what this trip.  However, I soon learned I had nothing to be concerned about.  The staff at Mission Guatemala had everything very well organized and planned.  All our team needed to do was show up and get to work!  We were provided with local skilled workers who were very patient and helpful to lead us in our project.  We also were able to see and learn more about some of the other projects MG is involved with.  
Mission Guatemala Inc	195100		/users/profile/255012	cnunley	Volunteer	5	03/03/2014	MG has carved out a great position in the center of Guatemala as an organization that cares and provides the right kind of help to people and their communities. Tom and his team (Dave, Tricia and Whitney, et. al.) are providing hand-ups over hand-outs and by sharing in this work with servants and partners from local churches from the US creating opportunities for transformation for all involved. I'm grateful to have served and know that my team and I have been changed forever, by falling in love with the people of Guatemala.
Mission Guatemala Inc	195098		/users/profile/255010	callie88	Volunteer	5	03/03/2014	Mission Guatemala was a wonderful experience for my first time and I look forward to other trips. The staff took excellent care of all our needs even after our volunteer time was complete. The work being done by Mission Guatemala has made an impact in many lives and I am honored to have been a small part this past week. I could write a novel on the hospitality of the staff and community families we met while there. The children LOVE the MG staff and it showed on their faces that they loved the children too. The clinic, feeding program, stove projects, pharmacy program are just a sample of wht this wonderful organization provides for many communities and families. Thank you for all that you do. 
Mission Guatemala Inc	195094		/users/profile/160593	Ken H.	Volunteer	5	03/03/2014	This was my fourth experience with Mission Guatemala and I cannot say enough great things about our latest trip with them.  This was the first adult team I have taken and they all want to go back.  The heart the staff has to serve the people of Guatemala is contagious.  I have been to many countries on mission trips and this is certainly one of my favorites.  We have two trips scheduled for 2015!
Mission Guatemala Inc	118078		/users/profile/160593	Ken H.	Volunteer	5	07/11/2012	We had an amazing experience as we worked at the school in Chuti Estancia! The staff at Mission Guatemala were very prepared for our team and provided everything we needed. They have such a heart for the people of Guatemala,  We have already scheduled our return for 2013!
Mission Guatemala Inc	195068		/users/profile/254976	Darleneover60	Volunteer	5	03/02/2014	This is my 3rd mission trip with a variety of agencies.  Everything was outstanding.  The accommodations were beyond my expectations.  It met our needs and allowed us a beautiful place to relax and gather after our workday.  The leaders were well-organized, hardworking and friendly.  Our mission was well received by the community and met its needs.  Our work was hard but everyone joined in--the Mission Guatemala leaders, our team, our translator, and members of the community.  We also were allowed to see other projects including a medical facility, a feeding and help program at a school and love and support to a displaced community.  The area is beautiful, the children more beautiful and the mission is a success.
Mission Guatemala Inc	195061		/users/profile/254965	jburgy	Volunteer	5	03/02/2014	Great time in Guatemala.  Staff was great, very friendly and accommodating.The work was hard but a very worthwhile project.  Visiting and playing with the children was a wonderful experience.  I also enjoyed getting to know the Guatemalian staff.I would come back again.
Mission Guatemala Inc	195060		/users/profile/254964	crspa5000	Volunteer	5	03/02/2014	 This was my first visit to Mission Guatemala. It opened my eyes to how important this mission is to this area of the world.  I saw many areas of the community that have been helped through the work this mission has provided. With the development of the clinics, schools, nutrition centers and services provided to the community  the people of this area are learning how they can make their lives better.I was very impressed with the staff at Mission Guatemala.  Each one of them has an important part in the continued development of this mission.Each day that we were there we were able to witness how the mission works throughout the entire area. It helped me to understand the importance of people helping people and the wide impact mission Guatemala has on this area.I will continue to pray for the continued growth of Mission Guatemala.
Mission Guatemala Inc	195057		/users/profile/254961	chad.menser	Volunteer	5	03/02/2014	This is a great organization. I have been on many mission trips throughout my life and they truly are doing Gods work. From planning every detail these guys do it right. They go into these communities and ask them how they can help them. Many other organizations plan a project based on what they think the community needs. Mission Guatemala is truly investing their resources to benefit these communities.     
Mission Guatemala Inc	195055		/users/profile/254958	DWinstead	Volunteer	5	03/02/2014	This was my first mission trip.  I was so impressed with the team from Mission Guatemala .

This team was professional but maintained a home like feel like family.  
Mission Guatemala Inc	165524		/users/profile/220007	Tristan C.	Volunteer	4	08/20/2013	Coming from an urban area in the States, and having never been to a third world country, I expected Guatemala to be very different from what I am used to. And it is, but not at all in a bad way. Panajachel is one of the most beautiful places I have ever been, and Ive been to Spain, Germany and Italy more than once. The Guatemalan people are outstandingly kind and open to visitors, and very thankful for the work Mission Guatemala helps provide. The organization itself is amazingly organized and operates with an efficiency unexpected by myself or others in my group. Having spent 10 days with this organization I can honestly say that it is positively impacting the lives of people in Guatemala and is an experience worth every penny.
Mission Guatemala Inc	165317		/users/profile/219765	madresan	Volunteer	5	08/19/2013	Mission Guatemala is a great, well organized, friendly, nonprofit!

Mission Guatemala Inc	163757		/users/profile/217454	Hollylynn	Volunteer	5	07/28/2013	Everyone is so helpfully and willing to help you learn about the culture and all the people. They make sure everyone can be involved whether that be working or being with the kids and making them happy. These people are so great and wonderful you just know they love their job and love helping others. 
Mission Guatemala Inc	162652		/users/profile/215880	allen.woodruff23	Volunteer	5	07/15/2013	Mission Guatemala was an absolute joy to work with. The team was beyond friendly and helpful. The construction crew didn't get upset or impatient with our lack of construction skills, but helped us to learn and grow. We also had an accident on the site, and the doctor and staff at the medical clinic were awesome. They were able to help us with our issue and prevent us from having a much bigger issue. I couldn't be more pleased with how Mission Guatemala runs and operates. 
Mission Guatemala Inc	162605		/users/profile/215813	Rebecca75	Volunteer	4	07/14/2013	Mission Guatemala is an amazing nonprofit. I greatly appreciate what they are doing. Mission Guatemala hits every type of assistance that could be needed  whether it be with food, homes, health, or even child care.
Mission Guatemala Inc	162391		/users/profile/215541	PKin	Volunteer	5	07/11/2013	Mission Guatemala helps the communities in and around Panajachel, Guatemala.  One of my favorite things about Mission Guatemala is the way they develop relationships within the communities.  Everything they do is done with the thought of giving back to the community (buying their food in the local markets, hiring local women to cook for their teams, hiring local construction workers to work alongside the teams, etc.). The time we spent there was productive and we were VERY well taken care of.  Excellent experience, excellent organization!
Mission Guatemala Inc	162364		/users/profile/215492	danweddle20	Volunteer	5	07/10/2013	My experience with Mission Guatemala was perfect. There was a highly skilled team of experts covering all fields from construction to translation to interpersonal relations. I highly recommend Mission Guatemala for your mission needs.
Mission Guatemala Inc	162336		/users/profile/215457	Michael180	Volunteer	5	07/10/2013	Mission Guatemala is making a difference in the lives of many in small villages near Panajachel. In less then 3 years they have established a low cost clinic that treats people who may not have access to doctors or dentists. They have created a feeding center that provides lunches to students who may not get enough to eat.  Their stove project is improving lives by giving families a safe way to make meals in their own homes without the hazard of excess smoke and harm to the children with an open fire. God is leading Tom Heaton and his staff to great things!
Mission Guatemala Inc	162247		/users/profile/215367	DAllen4522	Volunteer	5	07/09/2013	I really feel the mix of the translators and drivers was excellent and very engaging.  In addition the people that were hired to help train us on the technical pieces of work (block laying, doing similar work to stucco and laying tiles) were so patient and really took their time to make make sure we had the chance to do the work.  I would figure a way to hire Carlos as he was a super individual on the technical piece and was so very patient (especially with some of our younger team).  Another exciting opportunity was having the chance tow work with the children.  They were always excited to see us and made every effort to learn some English as well as to work on learning our names.  The experience we had just makes you want to come back for more mission trips and also figure out how to be an ambassador for getting other monetary and non-monetary donations.
Mission Guatemala Inc	162238		/users/profile/215357	CalebWKinsey	Volunteer	5	07/09/2013	My time with Mission Guatemala was an absolute joy! The staff of Mission Guatemala showed tremendous passion for mission and the organization they have acheived is remarkable. Their ability to involve the Guatemalan community with their projects shows their commitment to the sustainability of mission work. This is what mission work is supposed to look like and it is exactly what developing communities/nations require -stainable growth. Tom Heaton and Dave Burns are doing outstanding work and it shows that they have devoted a large amount of thought and patience to this project. I will definitely be staying in touch with this group in the future. 
Mission Guatemala Inc	162236		/users/profile/215355	eagamboa	Volunteer	5	07/09/2013	"For GOD so LOVED He GAVE"  I know that is not the full quote, but what I experienced in working with MIssion Guatamala was true Love for the people of Guatamala that compels us to GIVE ourselves to service in God's name.  Our team built a hand-washing station for a school and painted their dual use basketball/soccer court.  We came to know the children and got to spend a lot of time with them.  Everyone from the "boss man" (construction foreman  ) to the last volunteer gave of their time to not only complete the project, but to complete it as well as we could in professional manner.  Mission Guatamala is also concerned with building relationship in the community and encouraging members of the community to take ownerhip and pride in where they live and become a part of the work of the Mission.
Mission Guatemala Inc	162233		/users/profile/215352	joepsanford	Volunteer	5	07/09/2013	I have never seen faith or the gospel in action the way I saw it through the work of Mission Guatemala.  The vision and incredible thorough strategy the leadership has in this mission effort is unlike anything I've ever seen or heard of.  The entire focus is on the community they are there to help.  Our team was deeply involved with the community we worked for and felt incredible love and acceptance by everyone we encountered thanks to the wonderful efforts Mission Guatemala has given to establish and nurture relationships.  Truly unbelievable how this organization works.  Words cannot fully express what I wish to convey.  You must see it to believe it.
Mission Guatemala Inc	161455		/users/profile/214137	Laust	Volunteer	5	06/26/2013	My experience with Mission Guatemala was a great one! My team worked at two different locations building "flush toilets" and "hand-washing stations" for school children in rural communities. Tom, Dave, and other staff members were passionate about the work of the mission. And the locals were so welcoming and appreciative of the work being done in their communities.  Having been on another international mission trip to Mexico, I had an idea of what this trip would be like; however, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the accommodations, the food, and the cultural experiences provided by Mission Guatemala. 
Mission Guatemala Inc	161336		/users/profile/213956	Doug18	Volunteer	5	06/24/2013	Mission Guatemala is a well-organized and highly functioning ministry. Once you see and hear their story, you know God is at work in a mighty way. It is a joy to participate in such an effective and growing ministry that is so highly honored in every community in which they work.  The Mission makes it easy to travel to their location so that you can serve in meaningful work. The accommodations are outstanding. The food is terrific. The scenery is beyond amazing. Expect to have your life impacted in many wonderful ways. If you're looking to travel to serve, you won't find a more accommodating and meaningful experience.

Mission Guatemala Inc	161228		/users/profile/213792	Laura138	Volunteer	5	06/22/2013	My Mission Guatemala experience was what I expected it would be, but also so much more. I have been on missions in the past and I had expected it to be fun, rewarding, and enjoyable, but I never expected to get so much back from it. There are so many things I loved about this trip, but I will try to condense it into a few points. First of all, the country Guatemala itself is amazing and worth going just because of that. We had awesome weather, the most amazing drives everyday, and beautiful scenery to look at. Second, the people we got to interact with at each work site were welcoming, loving, and grateful. In fact, I can definitely say that I saw God in all of them through their kind and unconditional love. Finally, Mission Guatemala was so organized and we rarely had any road blocks during the week. The only road blocks we had were not their fault and just things that happen sometimes. I highly recommend going on a mission trip with them in the future. 
Mission Guatemala Inc	161220		/users/profile/213783	Melody W.	Volunteer	5	06/22/2013	Mission Guatemala far exceeds any expectation you may have when going on a mission trip.   I was blown away by this group.  This is an amazing organization that I was able to see firsthand how they help those in need in impoverished areas of Guatemala. It was my first mission trip overseas and you won't find a better or well organized organization for your team. Not only do they treat your team well, they also give you the opportunities to really get to know the culture while you're there. Nothing but A+++++! 
Mission Guatemala Inc	153931		/users/profile/204748	e_johnson	Volunteer	5	04/09/2013	I had an amazing week with Mission Guatemala! I came with a group from my church (First UMC, Mt. Vernon, IN) and we worked on continuing the construction of bathrooms at the school in Caliaj and also did maintenance work around the clinic. Tom, Max, and Dave were wonderful, patient, and informative hosts during our stay in Guatemala and showed a real compassion and love for the people they worked with. Mission Guatemala is a wonderful organization and I would recommend it wholeheartedly to anyone who is interested in mission work in Guatemala.
Mission Guatemala Inc	153529		/users/profile/204328	tkend	Volunteer	5	04/08/2013	I came with a group of people from church. The main projects we worked on during our week were building bathrooms (that will have flush toilets) for a school and some projects at the clinic. From getting off the plane in Guatemala City to getting back to the airport at the end of the week, everying was very well planned and prepared. Our transportation, housing, food, supplies for the projects, and local people to provide translation and direction for the project were taken care of. The week was a productive and enjoyable experience.
Mission Guatemala Inc	153267		/users/profile/204095	Lynn50	Volunteer	5	04/07/2013	What a great week we spent with Tom,Dave, Max and all the Mission Guatemala staff! They did an outstanding job of helping us understand the culture and the people of Guatemala, from the Mayan educational dinner, to the weaving demonstrations and time to interact in the markets. Our time spent volunteering was well coordinated, and our time spent interacting with the people of Guatemala was a gift. I truly received more than I gave.

I have learned so much from just putting my hands to work. Tom and everyone who is a part of this mission all took great care of us, and also the privilege of learning Guatemala's culture. Everyone you met was kind and just wanted to share God's love. I will never forget this experience. 
Mission Guatemala Inc	153139		/users/profile/203989	jlpfister	Volunteer	5	04/07/2013	Mission Guatemala does a great job of taking care of it's volunteers. From the time we arrived in the Guatemala City airport to when they delivered us back there a week later we had no worries.  Our accommidations and food were very good.  When we arrived at the work site all materials needed were there waiting for us. We were able to interact with the children from the school where we were helping to build a bathroom.  This was an awesome experience and I would recommend it to anyone.

The opportunities Mission Guatemala Inc. gave our group was life changing.  They are truly spreading God's word and giving blessings back to the volunteers. Tom's whole team was ever-attentive and very helpful.

Mission Guatemala goes above and beyond to accommodate everyone. We felt safe and comfortable in everything we did while in the country. We soon found out we weren't just there to help. We were also there to give hope, to learn, to teach and to enjoy in Gods amazing love. I recommend this trip to anyone who hears the call to do Gods will. 
Mission Guatemala Inc	151321		/users/profile/201992	vsportgirl	Volunteer	5	03/19/2013	mission Guatemala inc does not just bring in mission teams to work on a project, they also teach you the culture of the country/area, show why the work that is done is so important and the impact it has for individuals, a school , or an entire community.  This is not just a 'mission team trip'... it's an experience that will stay with you a lifetime and make you want to come back and continue the relationships and connections you made.  mission Guatemala Inc utilizes their money/donations received for the best impact of the most people.  It's obvious their staff have heart and compassion in everything they do! 
Mission Guatemala Inc	151299		/users/profile/201958	John153	Volunteer	5	03/19/2013	Mission Guatemala has put together a GREAT mission trip - well organized, well executed, a wonderful staff, great food, and a great mix of fun and hard work.  I have been on other mission trips - to Appalachia and Juarez - the contrast between those trips and this trip is stark.  Mission Guatemala has developed a great rapport with the kids in the villages they serves - they were excited to see us, and we spent a great week getting to know them and helping build better living conditions for them.  THANK YOU Tom and David and Max and your staff - we now have a lifetime of warm, wonderful memories which only service to God can provide.   
Mission Guatemala Inc	150783		/users/profile/201074	Mark85	Volunteer	5	03/08/2013	Great week at Mission Guatemala! Tom and his group met us at the airport and took great care of us all week. "Attention to detail" by Tom and his group was a strength on lodging, meals, transportation, and mission work. This mission trip opportunity is perfect for anyone wanting a 3rd world country mission experience. Our lodging was at a nice, clean motel in Panajachel. This town is at 5,250' elevation and sets on beautiful Lake Atitlan. Weather in February was low 70s and blue sky. Guatemalan people and their children were very friendly and most appreciative for our being there. We look forward to a return trip to Mission Guatemala! 
Mission Guatemala Inc	149789	1	/users/profile/199750	Ckeneipp	Volunteer	5	02/21/2013	What a blessing to see and experience the work that Tom, Dave and their humble staff at Mission Guatemala are doing.    This is a Christ centered mission who are focusing on the poorest of the poor in rural Guatemala.  The focus of our team was to learn about the clinic and to see how we can best serve their pharmacy needs.  What we found was a licensed medical facility which employed a medical physician and dentist who served around 6,000 patients last year.   The networking and resourcing already in place are perfect and we are excited to be a part of the amazing opportunities that are waiting for our church at the medical clinic.  We fell in love with the people  - it was a wonderful experience!
Mission Guatemala Inc	149296		/users/profile/198940	bobp.coleman	Volunteer	5	02/13/2013	From preparation to final departure, Mission Guatemala provided a safe, informative and helpful experiences of working with people first hand and becoming more aware of the local community.  Rev. Heaton and the staff were knowledgeable, gracious and dedicated.  We felt were were helpful to representing Christ's love in action.
Mission Guatemala Inc	149274		/users/profile/198899	pjeno	Volunteer	5	02/12/2013	I was struck by the integrity with which Mission Guatemala approaches its outreach, ministry and service.  It doesn't take long to realize the people they work with and come into contact with have a deep sense of love, trust and gratitude for how they are being helped, empowered, listened too, and encouraged.  I spent 8 days with a work team.  Everyday I returned to our hotel worn out, yet everyday I was more and more inspired by what I saw, experienced, and participated in.  Mission Guatemala deserves our applause, respect, support and prayers for the awesome work God is doing through them! 
Mission Guatemala Inc	149250		/users/profile/198857	tgile	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/11/2013	Mission Guatemala is an doing some exciting ministry.  Their school feeding program, water purification project and dental/ medical clinic all exceeded my expectations. The people of Guatemala are dearly loved.What an example of true Christian love as defined in Matthew 25.
Mission Guatemala Inc	149217		/users/profile/198804	aott	Volunteer	5	02/11/2013	I had no expectations going into the trip.  I received more from Mission Guatemala than they did from me.  We helped around the clinic with repairs and at a playground in one of the villages.  All the people of the villages are so thankful and inviting and the staff are very helpful and friendly.   I would go back in a heartbeat.  Mission Guatemala is helping those that have been forgotten, those that need the most and are helping them with their most basic needs.    Our accommodations were safe and very nice.  I felt extremely safe.  I just can't say enough about the people of Guatemala and the team at Mission Guatemala. 
Mission Guatemala Inc	142224		/users/profile/188674	Indiana	Volunteer	5	11/23/2012	I just returned from my 2nd trip to Mission Guatemala, and once again it was a life changing experience!  The programs supported by Mission Guatemala reach the heart and needs of the people.  The leaders at Mission Guatemala are passionate about each project, and they are there to support the volunteers as they experience the culture, the people and the work.  I will never forget the children, and especially the little girl (at the school) who ran her fingers through my white hair, down my face and arms, and then gave me the biggest hug I had ever received.  That is love!
Mission Guatemala Inc	142141		/users/profile/188578	joflinn	Volunteer	5	11/23/2012	I had the great experience of volunteering at Mission Quatemala in early November.  Fifteen very diverse folks from our church were a mission team for this organization.  I was very touched by the way we were introduced to the area and the people.  Most of the people who are employed by the mission are local and helped us understand the difficulty and joy of living in that beautiful country.  The best part of any trip for me is meeting the people and we found them to be open, charming and very thankful that we visited thier country.  We built an office for teachers at a very humble school and installed 8 wood burning stoves at native homes.  The United Methodist Church is a sponser of this mission and they are know world wide for the cost effective, helpful work they do.  Any group that is willing to work, friendly and truly missiomal would love to work with the humble, dedicated group at Mission Guatemala.  Jo Flinn
Mission Guatemala Inc	141773		/users/profile/188156	espinli	Volunteer	5	11/20/2012	Well organized , meaningful work and great integration with the culture. 
Mission Guatemala Inc	141491		/users/profile/187824	mmweddle	Volunteer	5	11/20/2012	The passion and dedication shown by the leaders of Mission Guatemala is infectious.  Their mission of "do all you can" is simple but life changing.  Regardless of your background, age, or skillset, any volunteer can be a part of this group and contribute.  It is clear that doing all you can, with the help of the organization, really does help the lives of the Guatemalan people.  Tom Heaton takes the time to share the people, the beautiful country, their history and their culture in a way that ensures they remain in our hearts. 
Mission Guatemala Inc	141123		/users/profile/187367	PISCES	Volunteer	5	11/19/2012	What a great life experience! A group of 15 of us from ZUMC.

The accommodations, meals and service projects exceeded our expectations.  The country and the people of Guatemala were beautiful.  We have already scheduled our date for 2013!
Mission Guatemala Inc	134274		/users/profile/180084	FranA	Volunteer	5	11/06/2012	As part of a 13 member team, I was thrilled to see the work being done by Mission Guatemala.  It is truly a wonderful organization with a caring and loving staff.  The improvements being made in the lives of the Guatemalan people -- health care access, educational opportunities, better living conditions -- are amazing.  They are extremely well-organized in determining meaningful projects for the work teams to do. Again, an amazing experience and one not to be forgotten!!
Mission Guatemala Inc	134255		/users/profile/180044	Juanita Guatemala	Volunteer	5	11/06/2012	I was part of a 13 member mission team from Indiana.  We spent last week with Mission Guatemala.  It was an unforgettable week!  Mission Guatemala does a great job setting up work that truly helps the people there in a way  that will improve their quality of life without being intrusive and changing their traditional way of life.  We were blessed to be able to help and get to know some of the people.  Mission Guatemala is very efficient in there use of funds and in how they assign jobs to the work teams.  Tom and Dave work very hard to make it an amazing experience for the volunteers and for the recipients of the work being accomplished.
Mission Guatemala Inc	134079		/users/profile/179849	jessmgerlach	Volunteer	5	11/06/2012	Last week I was a part of a 13 person team from Indiana. Our time with Mission Guatemala will always remain in our hearts. Every volunteer on the team felt appreciated and utilized, as well as humbled to be a part of the work Mission Guatemala is doing. I was truly moved by the passion and care of the staff. This organization has worked to become a part of the everyday life in Guatemala. The projects meet the needs of the communities they serve in a sensitive and culturally appropriate way. I witnessed first-hand the impact of feeding centers, stove projects, and the medical/dental clinic. I highly recommend supporting Mission Guatemala through work teams and through resources/finances. They truly demonstrate Christ through their work in word and deed.
Mission Guatemala Inc	133891		/users/profile/179652	bef90jaf	Volunteer	5	11/05/2012	Mission Guatemala uses its gifts and talents extremely well.  The staff is very courteous and efffcient.  They have become well-known and respected in the communities they serve.  They truly serve the Guatemalan people physically and spiritually.  They give hope for a brighter future through their support of the educational system, the daily meal program in two communities and the installation of stoves.  This trip was rewarding and eye-opening, as well as enjoyable  
Mission Guatemala Inc	129043	1	/users/profile/174369	debbiewalker	Volunteer	5	10/25/2012	What an amazing experience I had during my week with Mission Guatemala!  I took my 18 year-old daughter and it was wonderful for her as well.  Not only did we work hard delivering and installing stoves, but we had great fun playing with the beautiful children.  I look forward to another trip with Dave and Tom and Mission Guatemala!
Mission Guatemala Inc	122005		/users/profile/166087	pkyamamoto	Volunteer	5	09/07/2012	Being on a team lead by Mission Guatemala was an extraordinary experience.  Their organization was great for having only a couple of years experience leading teams of volunteers.  The Guatemalan people are a joy to work with and the children were very enthusiastic.
Mission Guatemala Inc	121968		/users/profile/166030	lsokura	Volunteer	5	09/06/2012	This is the first time our mission team has worked with Mission Guatemala and found Tom and Dave to be exceptional in their organizational skills, flexibility and time management. I personally find this extremely important because as a team member I want to concentrate on the tasks, outreach and Christian fellowship. The accommodations, meals, transportation, volunteer care and local presentations/visits were tailored for us. The village, Nueva Esperanza, was a perfect fit. Our dental team and construction teams were energized with the contribution of the people, and more importantly the children. During construction, village children just pitched in without complaint--there was a whole lot of enthusiasm!  It was heart-warming, charming and so different from a typical reaction at home. As a dental team member also, there is so much need and so little time. I have to know that God has given me the opportunity to do as much as I can with the passion I have to serve his people.  We are truly blessed to be able to share our gifts with the people of Guatemala.  Excellent experience all around and highly recommend working with Mission Guatemala.
Mission Guatemala Inc	121488	1	/users/profile/165297	kelong	Volunteer	5	08/27/2012	I had the wonderful opportunity to work with Tom and Dave from Mission Guatemala this past summer. To say that this was an enjoyable experience would be a huge understatement. Seeing all the work that these two men are doing in the areas of Guatemala that they work in was something that I will never forget. I hope to go back next summer and would recommend it to anyone considering going to help this organization!
Mission Guatemala Inc	120992		/users/profile/164626	ropir	Volunteer	5	08/18/2012	I spent a week in late July with Mission Guatemala as part of a team from two churches in Central Indiana.  The work project was to build a concrete soccer field in a Mayan village near Panajachel.  While incredible progress was made on the soccer field, the most important part of the time there, was getting to know the people of the village, especially the children!  I am not a young woman but found tasks to support the "heavy" work of the project, however, the highlight was time spent each afternoon with the children's program.  The children were enthusiastic, happy, and busy with the activities we provided.  We had lunch at the Clinic each day and I was pleasantly surprised with the facilities for health care and the abundance of medicines.  So much has been done with little resources and it is amazing all that has been accomplished by Tom Heaton and Dave.  It is obvious that they are much loved and respected by everyone there.  They certainly have my admiration and respect. I have had the privilege of participating in many mission trips to developing countries in the last several years, and if ever an entity deserved support, it is Mission Guatemala.  Please include them in your giving and make a trip to help with their work, if that is possible.
Mission Guatemala Inc	120874		/users/profile/164471	wiseguy	Volunteer	5	08/17/2012	My trip to Guatemala was pretty incredible.  The beauty of the country side and the mayan people were genuine, kind and caring.  It was a great experience in terms of culture and personal growth.  We worked hard and accomplished a lot in a short week; but just as important was the opportunity to work along side the people from the village- working towards a common goal.  Our translators were right there with us sharing their stories and helping us communicate with the village children and adults- that personal bond that took place over the week of working together set the stage for my cultural experience and personal growth.  The people in the village face so many challenges but they continued to work hard and maintain a positive attitude and high level of appreciation.  Mission Guatemala with Tom Heaton and his team were a great host to us.  They had a balanced schedule and provided us all of the basics of what we needed.  I personally recommend this trip to everyone who wants to try to help a group of people in continuing to improve the lives of the village.  It also provides an opportunity to personally grow and experience another culture and country.  I thank Tom and his team for a wonderful time and experience
Mission Guatemala Inc	120491		/users/profile/163877	Carolyn21	Volunteer	5	08/12/2012	I spent a week with my family and my church working at Mission Guatemala, Inc. in August, 2012.  The program included meaningful work in the community, wonderful interaction with the local families and especially the children, and some fascinating and enriching cultural activities. We were provided delicious and nutritious meals, lovingly prepared by two local women. We were also provided with clean, safe drinking water at our meals and throughout our work days. My daughter and I were treated by the mission doctor, as we both had respiratory illnesses that we brought with us from home. We felt very well cared for, and were able to enjoy the work, the food, and the cultural enrichment. 
Mission Guatemala Inc	120392	1	/users/profile/163745	panp	Volunteer	5	08/10/2012	This is my second trip with Mission Guatemala. The first I was a volunteer with a team and now this year I brought two teams down to work. Tom and Dave as leaders of Mission Guatemala do a tremendous job of communicating before arrival and supporting the team once present. They do a wonderful job orienting team members to the community that is served and to the culture of the area so that relationships may be developed. The accommodations and meals were amazing. I would recommend this connection for international mission to anyone but because of the tremendous job that they do in supporting a team, it is a great and safe experience for those who are doing international missions for the first time. 
Mission Guatemala Inc	120251		/users/profile/163525	kylelong	Volunteer	5	08/08/2012	I had the opportunity to work with Mission Guatemala for a week in the summer of 2012. My time serving the people of Guatemala through the work of Mission Guatemala was truly one of the most significant experiences of my life. Mission Guatemala is unlike any other organization I have worked with because it is explicitly centered on building relationships and living in community with others. My time working with Mission Guatemala gave me a new perspective on who I call my neighbor and allowed me to experience the Kingdom of Christ in a radically new way that has changed my life forever.
Mission Guatemala Inc	120237		/users/profile/163500	Jacob2	Volunteer	5	08/08/2012	I am going into my junior year of college at Ball State University with a double major in Social Studies Education and Spanish. Mission Guatemala provided me with an amazing way to experience the culture and language of Guatemala while facilitating deep and meaningful interaction with other brothers and sisters in Christ who live there. One thing that really stood out to me was the manner in which Mission Guatemala was definitely *not* just a charity. The goal of the organization is not to provide handouts, but rather to develop ongoing relationships with various communities. With these established relationships, real, lasting change can be enacted as a product of this mutual cooperation. This approach has drastic impacts, not only on a materialistic level, but deeper into the spirit of the community as Mission Guatemala helps kindle sparks of hope in the lives of individuals.
Mission Guatemala Inc	120225		/users/profile/163479	BarbbMarshall	Volunteer	5	08/08/2012	Mission Guatemala offered a great experience for us to witness the Mayan culture in food, music, faith, and community life.  We connected with a small Mayan community as we helped to construct a multi-sport field for their use.  Our team mixed and laid 51 of the 112 concrete squares needed for the playing field.  It was a wonderful opportunity to witness to God's love and presence in the strength and vitality of that community.  The lake views around Lake Atitlan where we stayed were stunningly beautiful.  
Mission Guatemala Inc	120100		/users/profile/163303	ErinMeyer	Volunteer	5	08/06/2012	I had the opportunity to travel to Nueva Esperanza and be apart of a team that built a soccer field for a school. I was able to work hard, but also play hard (with the kids that is!) the kids at the school were so happy and friendly, their attitudes were infectious. While staying in Guatemala we had wonderful accommodations as well as guides, drivers and translators. I feel as though I built strong relationships with many people over the week I spent in Guatemala. I also feel as though I made as much of an impact in the lives of the people in the village as they did in mine. 
Mission Guatemala Inc	120067		/users/profile/163243	ttillett	Volunteer	5	08/06/2012	My wife and I recently returned from a work team week in Guatemala on a Mission Guatemala (MG) project.  The MG staff took good care of us.  Food, lodging, transportation and work site organization was very good.  Lodging was better than any lodging we have experienced on our 3rd world (African) work team mission trips.  Interpreters assigned to the work team were very personable, helpful and worked with us and the Mayan villagers.  Local shopping & sightseeing were interesting. MG shared their story and organizational needs.  Good experience that we will tell others about.
Mission Guatemala Inc	119402		/users/profile/162343	dougherbert	Volunteer	5	07/27/2012	I was a member of a team who traveled from the US to Panajachel Guatemala to work with Mission Guatemala building a soccer field / basketball court for a village that was displaced by hurricane Stan.  Members of our team also worked with the children of the village.  I felt that overall Mission Guatemala did an excellent job organizing prior to our arrival, and we had very few "issues" during the trip.  Two translators stayed with our group at our hotel, and were very friendly and knowledgeable in both the language and the construction tasks we were performing.  The arrangements that Tom had made with locals to cook both lunch near the job site, and breakfast / dinner near the hotel helped ensure we were eating nutritious and safe food, and helped reduce the cost of the trip, while providing much needed jobs in the area.
Mission Guatemala Inc	119056		/users/profile/161874	jhawk	Volunteer	5	07/22/2012	I just completed another week with Mission Guatemala on July 15, 2012.  My first experience was last year and  I was so impressed with the work of this organization that there was no doubt that I wanted to come back.  The work that has been done and is being done by Tom, Dave and the staff and volunteers is  amazing.   We had seven of our 13 team members from last year that returned this year, along with eight new members.  (The others from last yeat would have returned also, but were unable to due to other committments.)  I was a team leader this year and felt very comfortable in that role after having worked with this organization last year.  They are very organized, communicate well and take great care of their visiting teams.  Between the two years - we have worked on a number of projects where we could see the physical results of what we did, but also felt that when we left - we left some hope for the people of Guatemala.  The opportunities to interact with the people of Guatemala is one of the highlights of working with this organization.   It is hard when it comes time to go home as this group feels like family and you feel that you are taking away more then you left.  I made sure that our church was on the schedule for next year before we left.

She was the youngest in our group and I was the oldest at 69 years old. Mission Guatemala is organized so well that we can all do our part with success and great feelings of helping the people we came there to share love, grace and perform the manual work that is needed.  Thanks Tom and Dave for making it possible!
Mission Guatemala Inc	118555		/users/profile/161229	Melaniemc	Volunteer	5	07/16/2012	I just returned from a mission trip to Guatemala and I believe it will change my life.  The team at Mission Guatemala, including Tom, Dave, Vanessa, etc, were just awesome.  We installed vented stoves in peoples homes to improve their air quality and also fuel efficiency.  We installed a gutter system so rainwater can be used for children to wash their hands and brush their teeth at school.  We took family pictures and gave them to the people, which could be their only family picture ever.  There is no doubt that Mission Guatemala Inc is improving quality of life for the poor people of Guatemala.  What an organization!  Blessings to them all.

It was an incredible experience.  I did things I never thought I would be doing like mixing concrete, carrying heavy cinder blocks, assembling stoves (honestly!) and hanging gutters.  I have never felt so good about myself in all my life.  Mission Guatemala is an awesome organization doing an awesome amount of good for the poor people of Guatemala.  
Mission Guatemala Inc	118086		/users/profile/160602	Penny K.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/11/2012	July 2011- I organized a team of 25 volunteers. I am the Indiana VIM team leader trainer. This mission site was the most organized mission site that I have been to. The team worked at 3 locations (not an easy task for the on site coordinators). One team provided medical care at various locations. This is my speciality as an RN. Tom Heaton and staff did a great job with everything. Everything from transportation in country, lodging, food, sight seeing and building relationships with local people was done with EXCELLENCE.  I highly recommend this mission site for first time or experienced missioners. Penny Krug, RN, Deaconess UMC

I would not take back a single thing that happened; both Tom and Dave were very nice and helped all of us on the trip feel safe and comfortable. The work that they are doing in Guatemala is amazing, the clinic they have is impressive and their effect on the communities in the area is fascinating. I am proud to say that I was apart of an amazing mission, that truley cares about the people of Guatemala. Like their mission statement says, "do all the good you can." God Bless.
Mission Guatemala Inc	118051		/users/profile/160562	Craig13	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/10/2012	Mission Guatemala INC is a great mission organization on the front life of poverty in that country.  Tom Heaton has been a speaker at church camps that I have directed and he is a member of my home conference of the United Methodist Church.  Work teams return with testimonies of the impact that mission has had on their lives.

It was a fabulous experience where God used each person's individual strengths to provide for the Mayan people who are so desperately needy.  It was an eye opening opportunity to not only see the horrific conditions they live in but also the heroic efforts of the missionaries dedicating their lives to helping the people of the Mayan culture.

Mission Guatemala Inc	117685		/users/profile/160002	Susan104	Volunteer	5	07/04/2012	I traveled to Panaechele, Guatemala in June of 2012.  We worked in the mountain community of Chuti Estancia.  The people there are very poor and lovely.  I found the community completly charming in every way.  the county is like a beautiful garden with beautiful views everywhere you look.  My group of teenagers, young adults and older adults built two water retention tanks for the local elementary school there.  They had no water supply for washing hands and brushing thier teeth.  We also did a Bible school each afternoon from 2:00 til 3:30.  Between 150 to 190 children came each day.  On sunny days not as many children attended  because they were required to work in the feilds with thier families.  I feel out group made an impact that will be felt in the years to come.  The men we worked with from Mission Guatemala were a delight.  They were always asking for feed back, kept us busy, well taken care of in a foreign country and at appropriate times entertained us.  They also helped us to find interesting things to explore in our free time and were extremely helpful when a medical emergency presented itself.

I'd love to go back!!!!

We were a very large group and we were a great challange for Tom and Dave.  But they were incredible!  We were able to operate two differnt construction sites at once  building water holding tanks at schools in Chuti Estancia and also do a Bible school with nearly 200 children each day.  We had an incredible experience and it was a joy to be a part of such a great community outreach. Tom and Dave obviously have a heart for the people there and Mission Guatemala is definitely making a difference in the lives of the  people there.  I felt honored to be able to help in a small way.
Mission Guatemala Inc	117539		/users/profile/159791	Karenwork	Volunteer	5	07/02/2012	I came with 37 adults and young adults from Madisonville, Ky.  We were treated like family by all of the Mission Guatema staff.  We had a wonderful experience doing a Bible School and building  water containers.  The staff were extremely supportive during a time of illness for one our members and stayed with us providing any help we needed.  God met us there and stayed with us through out our visit in this land of paridise!  I look forward to coming again for another experience either medical or building/Bible school!  What a wonderful group!!
Mission Guatemala Inc	117533		/users/profile/159783	jdlester11	Volunteer	4	07/02/2012	I recently retuned from 9 days in Panajachel working in a local community called Chuti Estancia. Tom and Dave were great people to be around and were very friendly to the entire team. They had great construction managers for on the job site. They also organized neat activities for the team during the weekend. This is a group I would undoubtedly volunteer for again. 
Mission Guatemala Inc	113638		/users/profile/154613	Leigh S.	Volunteer	4	06/03/2012	Great team!  This was a fun and adventurous group to work with.  We left having much more insight into the people and culture of Guatemala, and with a deep appreciation for the country.
Mission Guatemala Inc	109904		/users/profile/149691	Kast	Volunteer	5	04/15/2012	We were able to work side by side with the people of Guatemala. Even though the process might be different the end result of the hard work  and the resourcefulness of the people in the little town is apparent every where. Plus the fantastic accommodations provided were an added surprise. It was the percect ending after the long work day.  The meals at the firehouse were also good since we were trying to be emersed in real culture of those we served. The meals the activities helped all of us understand who we were helping while at the same time it was wonderful to be reminded of all our blessings and the power of sharing what we have with others. Over and over again we were reminded that these people had so much to offer us too.

Mission Guatemala Inc	82613		/users/profile/91185	Jackie M.	Volunteer	4	03/19/2011	Our team built furniture for hurricane and mudslide victims who had lost their homes and possessions. We also painted a bldg and helped with the 35 young children attending the mission's nutrition program. We met the Guatemalan doctor who is at the mission clinic. It is impressive what God has done through Dave and Tom In a relatively short time. These men are making friends with the people they lovingly serve, providing jobs, medical care, and education. This was an extremely well-organized, focused experience.
Mission Guatemala Inc	107908		/users/profile/146563	Ric Wilson	Volunteer	4	03/14/2012	This was an amazing trip for all of us. I was especially impressed at how organized the trip was. We had different opportunites to minister each day and were given choices, so we could specialize in different areas. The organization took good care of us and were watchful over us and our safety from where we stayed, to going to the market and also for the food that we ate. I also liked the details that we were given from their website about what to bring, packing suggestions, and also some tips on Guatemalan culture. 
Mission Guatemala Inc	107904		/users/profile/146557	stanharrison	Volunteer	5	03/14/2012	This mission is accomplishing great things for the people of this area.  They not only feed children, but they also are serving the needs of the people through their stove project.  At this time they have installed about 90 stoves in the homes of people who were cooking on open fires in very small huts.  Our work while in Guatemala revolved around helping to install the stoves as well as construct a playground for a school that serves about 90 children.  The only play area they had was an open clay area and a small rusted metal swing set and slide.  When completed the playground will have 10 swings, 2 seesaws, a slide and a climbing structure with 6 poles for children to slide down.  I feel I was blessed and humbled by this experience because of the relationships that were developed with the people and children we served.  This group is truly doing God's work by healing the sick, feeding the hungry and meeting the needs of the people.
Mission Guatemala Inc	107854		/users/profile/146469	ng2012	Volunteer	5	03/12/2012	My volunteer time with Mission Guatemala was one of the best mission experiences that I've had. Tom Heaton and the project staff efficiently planned our time so that all members of our team, regardless of age or experience, could make meaningful contributions in multiple ways. We worked hard, played hard, and learned a great deal about the culture and the people of Guatemala. What most impressed me is the relationships that have been built with the local folks. They are treated as valued partners and stakeholders who take an active part in creating sustainable changes in their communities. It was a pleasure to be a part of such a caring, respectful, and organized group -- my thanks  go to Tom, Dave, Noe, and all of those who made our team feel so welcomed!
Mission Guatemala Inc	107852		/users/profile/146470	macishelton	Volunteer	5	03/12/2012	I worked with Mission Guatemala installing stoves for needy families and working on a playground for a school. The organization has wonderful leaders who are very organized and working hard to improve Guatemala. 
Mission Guatemala Inc	107850		/users/profile/146466	Tara10	Volunteer	5	03/12/2012	I have worked with many different nonprofits and Mission Guatemala has been my favorite one by far. Even though it is a young organization the trip went very smoothly and the staff was prefect. There was a wonderful mix of work and fun. I left there feeling completely  changed and ready to go back again.
Mission Guatemala Inc	107847		/users/profile/146462	Sydney V.	Volunteer	5	03/12/2012	I was very impressed with how everything was planned and organized, but still maintained a healthy degree of flexibility.  I was also amazed to see how many connections within the surrounding communities existed, especially considering the relative youth of this organization.  Everybody was so nice and did a lot to make sure we were comfortable, working hard, and learning about the people and the culture.  It was such a meaningful and transformative experience, and I hope to have the opportunity to work with ten again in the near future!  
Mission Guatemala Inc	107840		/users/profile/146442	William9	Volunteer	5	03/12/2012	Mission Guatemala is a wonderful organization doing good work in places where it is desperately needed. Our group was there last week. Pastor Tom Heaton and his co-workers, especially Dave Burns, were wonderful hosts. Not only did they put us to work helping build a playground, installing stoves, and distributing food to feeding centers, they also gave us a taste of Guatemalan culture by introducing us to Guatemalans who served us wonderful food, sold us native handicrafts and cloths, played us indigenous music, and showed us the stunning scenery around Lake Atitlan. Heaton and his crew make a trip to Guatemala easy--everything ran as smooth as silk. Very professional and friendly, and fun to be with. My students are eager to return. 
Mission Guatemala Inc	100688		/users/profile/124092	Scott234567	Volunteer	5	11/16/2011	My church has been involved with Mission Guatemala since it's beginnings. We saw the dream and beloved in Tom Heaton as the executive director. His abilities to network, vision and resourcing is astounding. Our week this year working in Guatemala was well organized. We never had a need that wasn't fulfilled.  Mission Guatemala has had an explosive year or growth.  In 12 months they opened a medical clinic with a full time doctor seeing patients 5 days a week, a fully equipped dentist's office with a dentist seeing patients 3 days a week.thye opened a preschool serving 35 ofthe poorest children in the area giving them educational opportunities they never would have had. Four and five year old Mayan children who speak Cachique orsome other Mayan language are learning Spanish and English. This prepares them adequately to enter public school in Guatemala. In addition the mission has opened a feeding center in a nearby village serving up to 150 children a balanced meal once a day.  Mision Guatemala's health ministry has moved into pre emotion with nutritious foods made available, hygiene resources and education and the installing of high efficiency wood burning stoves. The stoves eliminate breathing smoke as the families do over. An en fire on the dirt floor of ther kitchen.  In addition less firewood is needed blessing the community. I cannot say enough about the good Mission Guatemala is bringing to San Andre and Panajachel and the surrounding villages. They hire locals to lead projects and have 7 locals indigenous to Guatemala on their staff.  Tom Heaton and Mission Guatemala are world changers. Support this charity and make a world of difference to some of the poorest people in the western hemisphere.
Mission Guatemala Inc	100582	1	/users/profile/123238	dance365	Volunteer	5	11/12/2011	You are never too young or old to go on a mission trip to help these people in Guatemala. I am living proof.  As the youngest going on this trip (I'm not even 16), I had doubts that I would really be able to do anything. I was way wrong.  I definitely felt like I was making a difference in those peoples' lives.  I installed stoves for families.  Many of whom had nothing but a campfire to cook over.  It was truly amazing to see how legitimately grateful these people were for the little that they had.  I think that that's a reality check anyone could use.  You never realize how fortunate you are until you see the conditions in which others live. 
Mission Guatemala Inc	100270		/users/profile/121909	jamoore06	Volunteer	5	11/03/2011	This was an experience that helped strengthen my faith in Christ, reaffirm the direction that I am moving through Christ and helped me learn about a unique culture and environment I was not familiar with.  Mission Guatemala helps the people in San Andres, Pana and surrounding communities with long-term and permant assistance.  They provide a great understanding of the circumstance in which the Guatemalan people are currently living in and how their program assists them.  They give volunteers an opportunity at hands on experiences in serving.  You can get as involved as you like with a wide varieties choices for people of all skills and talents.  Mission Guatemala also gives you some authentic opportunities to experience Mayan and Guatemalan culture and history.  The Mission Guatemala team is made up of kind and compassionate individuals that truly live the mission of being the hands and feet of Christ.  I found them to be genuine in their love for the people they help and those who come to assist.  
Mission Guatemala Inc	100220		/users/profile/121833	Richard234	Volunteer	4	11/03/2011	I enjoyed working with this organization because they were so organized we always had somehthing to do from shopping, working and eating together.  We could divide into two teams and still have plenty of work to do.  The people were very friendly and helpful from Tom Heaton and David Burns to the cooks and the other Guatemalan workers:  ElMer the driver, Angel the caretaker and Delia the assistant cook.  They were all enjoyable to work with and talk to.  I always knew what the agenda of each day was.  Very helpful for me.  
Mission Guatemala Inc	100196		/users/profile/121788	Scott C.	Volunteer	5	11/02/2011	From the time that our group of eleven landed in Guatemala City to the time that we left a week later was the most amazing experience anyone could ever imagine.  Tom met us as soon as we landed in Guatemala City and began to go over the events that would transpire in the upcoming week which included taking in the beautiful sights, learning more about the culture and the people of the small communities visited.   We visited numerous communities where Tom and his staff  has started to help the people of that region whether it was maintaining a feeding center and/or delivering and installing the high efficiency stoves.  Later we would learn This would change the lives of many natives that would never had gotten the chance to do so especially if an organization like MG had not been able to help.   Some of the great things that this organization is doing that others are not,  they are going to the leaders of the individual communities to find out what their needs are in that community.  The other part of it, is going to the individuals themselves to make sure that what the leaders say is correct.  The last thing that I would like others to know if choosing this organization for donations and or planning a mission trip for your church etc., is to know that in a short amount of time, (less than a year) Tom and his staff ARE making a difference in the communities and the lives that they touch everyday of the year.
Mission Guatemala Inc	100114		/users/profile/121648	amoore06	Volunteer	5	11/01/2011	The experience I had with Mission Guatemala (MG) was amazing.  Tom and his crew took great care to ensure we experienced and received from Guatemala as much as and possibly more than we were able to give.  I loved the variety in the tasks we were able to complete and I loved how MG takes a special interest in building relationships.  It is not "give, give, give" it is more like "give and build for the future".  I especially like that MG uses women from the communities where the feeding centers are housed to help make the food, thus making it a learning experience for the whole community and hopefully in the future sustaining so that the full time cook provided by MG can be tasked to assist elsewhere.
Mission Guatemala Inc	100039		/users/profile/121517	aberindy	Volunteer	5	10/31/2011	Mission Guatemala has a working clinic with Doctors, a Dentist and a social worker.  What they have accomplished in a year is amazing!  The staff is accomplished, efficient and professional in every position.  They have an eighteen year old Social Worker who is experienced beyond her years.  The entire Mission Guatemala team is dedicated and will do what it take to accomplish their goals!     
Mission Guatemala Inc	100038		/users/profile/121516	victorialovesbooks	Volunteer	5	10/31/2011	Mission Guatemala is mission in ACTION!!  Our group of eleven did meaningful and powerful work all day every day!  Tom and his staff were there every step of the way to ensure the success of all of our projects. It was obvious that Tom has spent many months building relationships within the community.  We partnered with local resources and the respect and trust for Mission Guatemala was evident everywhere we went.  We can't wait to go back!!! 
Mission Guatemala Inc	100033		/users/profile/121510	Vicki N.

Everyone is so grateful for any little thing done to help them, it is truly humbling experience.  Anyone that gets an opportunity to go help out at Mission Guatemala should jump at the chance.  I know I'm ready to go back.
Mission Guatemala Inc	99940		/users/profile/121360	matthewhmark	Volunteer	5	10/29/2011	This was an incredible week. They took care of us and I was particularly happy because I brought my 14 year old daughter and I felt comfortable with her not needing to be right beside me at all times.
Mission Guatemala Inc	99926		/users/profile/121332	aka0822	Volunteer	5	10/28/2011	Just finished my week on a mission trip to Mission Guatemala.  It has been a fantastic week!  Our group of 11 was able to do many mnay things.  We broke into smaller groups and installed stoves, weighed and measured children, delivered food to a village displaced by recent storms, painted a home, built furnitire and installed dental equipment.The MG staff was fantastice!  They gave us instruction and directionthen let us work.  We had plenty of time to interact with the local people and learn we are all trulybrothers and sisters.  What a blessed experience!  
Mission Guatemala Inc	99842		/users/profile/121196	Susan234567891011	Volunteer	5	10/27/2011	I spent a week with Mission Guatemala helping to install stoves that vent out the roof and use very little wood.  In addition, I assisted in the building of a house for a single lady.  In listening to what the mission is doing with the medical and dental clinic plus the feeding center for 100 kids, I feel that they are going about their work in an organized way.  They are not trying to do everything at once.  I feel that they are truly  doing God's work.
Mission Guatemala Inc	99744		/users/profile/120710	Pennywalk	Volunteer	5	10/25/2011	Tom Heaton and his team are doing incredible things in Guatemala.  The lasting gifts that are being shared are amazing.  Mission Guatemala's medical clinic helps between 300-400 monthly that would not otherwise get medical care.  The feeding program provides meals for 100 kids 5 days a week.  The joy and love Tom and his team have for the people of Guatemala is something everyone feels when spending time there.  I would 110% recommend Mission Guatemala in the future.  I can't wait to return.
Mission Guatemala Inc	99433		/users/profile/119481	SussieH	Volunteer	5	10/18/2011	I just got back from a week in Guatemala working for Mission Guatemala and I wasvery impressed by this organization!   They are doing wonderful work and are so appreciated by the Guatemalan people being served by them.   We were primarily installing stoves into homes which either didn't have stoves at all or which had unventilated stoves.  It was so inspiring to see the wonderful reception that Mission Guatemala got in all of these neighborhoods. People came running out to greet us and to thank us for their stoves.  Clearly Mission Guatemala is appreciated!  It was also wonderful to see the many (about 90) children that Mission Guatemala is feeding daily in Nueva Esperanza and the 20 or so children attending the Mission Guatemala pre-school. Many Guatemalan people of all ages would come out of their homes and smile and wave as we drove the truck by with new stoves to install at their neighbor's homes.
Mission Guatemala Inc	99397		/users/profile/119364	Stephanie2345678	Volunteer	5	10/18/2011	I was blessed with the opportunity to serve alongside the Mission Guatemala staff for 6 days this fall. It was an amazing opportunity to work alongside their team as they serve the people of the San Andres & Panajachel communities. The work that they are doing for families & children is amazing. 
Mission Guatemala Inc	99367		/users/profile/119147	cmiller	Volunteer	4	10/17/2011	Participated with volunteer team to assist mission staff in installing efficient, properly-vented wood-burning stoves in the homes of poor residents of the area.  Very good basic instruction in stove assembly on first day.  It's too bad all of the stove components had to be stored in secure areas down a flight of stairs from where we loaded them onto the pickup truck for delivery and assembly, which made for some additional hand-toting each piece, some of which were very heavy.   I suggest the mission purchase, or ask for donation of, a heavy-duty dolly.  
Mission Guatemala Inc	99349		/users/profile/119021	pastorkim	Volunteer	4	10/16/2011	The difference that Mission Guatemala has made in just one year of operation is amazing.  The work - and the outpouring of support from so many congregations - speak to the power of being church in the world by working collaboratively in communities to assess and support basic needs.  I believe that Misison Guatemala will serve as a model for how to assure that missional efforts really meet the needs of the persons they are meant to serve.  My team left Guatemala knowing the impact we had on the persons served, and motivated to continue our support of the efforts of Mission Guatemala.    
Mission Guatemala Inc	99309		/users/profile/118931	Michelle23456789101112	Volunteer	5	10/14/2011	I went with a Methodist church group to help build more efficient cook-stoves for Mayan women living in villages near Panahachel, and to work on improving the fence and play ground equipment for villagers.Organized materials other groups have sent or brought down.  Entertqined the chileren one afternoon at La Nueva Esperanza.
Mission Guatemala Inc	99296		/users/profile/118909	fsatterlee	Volunteer	5	10/14/2011	I was amazed to discover how much Mission Guatemala has accomplished having been in existence for only one year.  Compared to other missions I have volunteered for, one would have thought it had been established for ten or more years.  It seems to have the ability to cut through red tape and address needs quickly and effectively.  It is clear that it's priority is to serve the people rather than the organization.  I would gladly volunteer to go back to help out with Mission Guatemala.
Mission Guatemala Inc	94170		/users/profile/108781	Bruce B.	Volunteer	5	07/21/2011	What a blessing to go to Guatemala and work with this great team of people.  It was a wonderful week with amazing opportunities to interact with the welcoming, but needy people in rural Guatemala.  Tom and Dave are so dedicated to the cause and worked so very hard to make everything go smoothly while we were there.  In the short time we were there, it seemed like we were able make a real difference.  Even better, we could see the longer-term impact that Mission Guatemala is making, as we attended a special ceremony hosted by a small villiage that honored Mission Guatemala for it's work among them and officially opening a new kitchen & dining room that will enhance the feeding ministry.
Mission Guatemala Inc	94126	1	/users/profile/68169	Caro	Volunteer	5	07/20/2011	I have known Mission Guatemala's director for over 10 years and have been honored through that connection to assist by obtaining a discount from a shipping company so that donations gathered via churches in the United States can be economically sent to the mission's location in the highlands of Guatemala.  I have also made donations, and assisted by translating and by preparing documents for the mission's registration as a Guatemalan non-profit (which will be in addition to its US non-profit status).   I have visited the mission on two occasions in the past year and have been amazed and impressed at the progress made in implementing new programs such as the nutritional center building and school-children feeding program in Nueva Esperanza, the opening of medical and dental clinics in San Andres Semetebaj, and an onsite pre-school there.   This is one of the best organized and accountable non-profits operating in Guatemala and it is all done in a culturally appropriate way, with respect and love for the local residents that it serves
Mission Guatemala Inc	94125	1	/users/profile/108713	Jacob J.	Volunteer	5	07/20/2011	I led a team from Lafayette, Indiana: 20 people representing two congregations.  The size of our group allowed us to break into three work crews that were each able to finish their projects (furniture for the feeding center, help weigh and measure kids at Nueva Esperanza, painting the mission site, and digging at the new home site) thanks to the diligence and encouragement of the Mission Guatemala staff.  The size of our group challenged and sometimes stretched thin the Mission's staff, as they had to run many errands for paint, screws and shovels, but they were always helpful in getting us what we needed to be successful in our projects. As a leader, this was an easy trip to plan and lead.  Mission Guatemala was extremely gracious in hosting us.  They had all of our meals, lodging and transportation lined up.  All were excellent and exceeded my expectations. Reflecting on the trip, Mission Guatemala did a superb job of fostering relationships.  We were able to meet with the native peoples in the villages and get to know many of them by working onsite for several days.  Those that worked on the furniture for the Feeding Center at Nueva Esperanza were able to foster relationships with the children of the village who often helped sand and enjoyed playing games with the team.  The paint crew was able to interact with the doctor, dentist and preschool children as they went about their day.  The "diggers" were able to befriend the contractor and helper who were hired by Mission Guatemala to instruct the work team. If I had to summarize the trip, it would be blessings through relationships with the Mission staff and those we came into contact with.  In all honesty, it was the relationships that made it hard to leave; and, it is the relationships that are calling me (and others from my group) back.
Mission Guatemala Inc	94098	1	/users/profile/108675	Marswings	Volunteer	5	07/20/2011	I was part of a church mission group that worked on three different projects.  One was installing stoves in homes in remote locations that had no means to get safe cooking facilities.  I worked on a project to build cabinets and desks for an elementary school and the third profect was helping to build a house for a displaced family.Mission Guatemala has established a medical clinic with a doctor and a dentist, a pharmacy and a pre-school for 90+ children.  All are clean, well managed and provide despirately needed services.  They have also built a feeding building at the school which feeds all the children a daily meal and provides help to the families as well
Mission Guatemala Inc	94058		/users/profile/108615	Kelly B.	Volunteer	5	07/19/2011	I was able to be a part of a team that assembled stoves (wood burning) in some of the neediest homes in the Panajachel area.  I also assisted with other work such as working on the foundation of a local home as well as sanding & varnishing tables for a feeding center.  Our team worked hard not only getting the stoves assembled but also took time to interact with the families we were helping.  It was exciting to see the homes & really feel like what we were doing was going to make a difference in their day to day lives.  All of our accommodations (lodging, meals, transportation) was completely taken care of and always timely.  The "fun day" was also well planned out and fantastic!  
Mission Guatemala Inc	94052		/users/profile/108608	Allan	Volunteer	5	07/19/2011	I went on my first mission not knowing what to expect. I was one of thirteen people from Johns Creek United Methodist Church  trying to help the people of Guatemala and make a difference. I think they helped me more than i helped them? I was installing stoves in the mountains. The stoves were vented out through the roof to help the quality of air in the house. Most of the children & some of the adults had running noses and coughs. I was shocked to see a foot or more of smoke in the ceilings of the houses. The people were so grateful for the stoves. ( helping them use less wood & the health benefits.) I enjoyed seeing the excitement in their faces. The experience was incredible and look foward to coming back. Tom Heaton & Dave Burns were great host & have the passion it takes to make Mission Guatemala work. The whole week went smoothly & our group was lucky enough to see the opening of the food center. It was a good experience seeing the children sing & dance. Then we were served the first lunch in the new center.   God Bless, Allan Chandler

Mission Guatemala Inc	93905		/users/profile/108337	tmstormjustie	Volunteer	5	07/15/2011	I came to Guatemala thinking I was going to help others and in tern this experience has helped me.  We not only worked for the people but we worked with the people.  The people from the regions we visited were friendly, willing to help and work along with us and we were able to make true accomplishments along the way.  We showed God's love through doing not just telling.  In the short time we were there, we were able to work on foundation of a home for a family who main provider was diagnosed with Arthritis and we were able to dig a 8 foot latreen with just shovels.  We helped paint parts of the clinic, and childrens school, build benches and table, put up wood buring stoves, and interact with the community to show love and caring.  We even had time in the evening to shop in the stores and eat different variety of foods.  This in turn was helping their economy out and providing food on tables for the merchants selling.  I am thankful and have been thanked by many in the community and surrounding communites.  The children were so interested in learning from us they picked up carpentry skills just by us allowing to participate in te work with us; giving all of us a sense of accomplishments.  Thanks to all that went with me and my daughter.  We are excited to see the changes that have occured on our next trip back.

Even though a week is such a short time I feel that our group was able to make a lasting impact on the futures of San Andres and Nueva Esperanza. Tom and Dave do an excellent job of working in and with the community to identify real needs that can be met by Mission Guatemala and the teams.  They also involve the community in some of these projects empowering people to help each other.
Mission Guatemala Inc	93816		/users/profile/108174	kaiteybeth	Volunteer	5	07/13/2011	I have done many years of volunteer and mission work and can honestly say this is one of the best experiences I have had.  David and Tom are not simply there to give the people what they think they need but instead to listen to the voices of the community to find out what the community thinks they need.   Their relationship with the community far exceeded my expectations and I felt the work we did was not just busy work but a critical part of a larger picture.   Everyone on staff was helpful, kind and considerate both towards us and towards the people of Guatemala.  I would recommend this mission to anyone.  
Mission Guatemala Inc	93809	1	/users/profile/108142	Steve Mc	Volunteer	5	07/13/2011	My experience with Mission Guatemala was nothing short of glorious! As a volunteer I was able to bring my entire family so each of us was able to help the people of San Andres and Nueva Esperansa according to our individual talents, and experience special private moments to carry in our hearts for the rest of our lives. The flexible schedule enabled us to "roll" with the weather, their needs etc. and still achieve our goals of painting the clinic, digging a foundation, and building furniture with the local people. It was this type of local interaction that was the "magic" of the trip. We worked hard and were rewarded with sincere heartfelt emotion and smiles of appreciation. We were sad when it came time to leave our new friends. I have a fresh understanding of  "do all the good you can" and will continue "as long as I can" because of Mission Guatemala.

In less than a year they have started a medical clinic, dental clinic, pre-school and feeding center that are really making an impact on the in and around San Andreas. Tom and his team have a real passion for helping the people of the area and work tirelessly.  They work to understand the needs of the community and look for ways solutions that engage the people being helped.
Mission Guatemala Inc	93526		/users/profile/107657	Will P.	Volunteer	5	07/07/2011	Twenty of us served from Lafayette, Indiana for one week.   The first day was a little slow as we tried to match our skills and abilities with the work that needed to be done.  During the week we built tables and benches for a feeding center,  cleaned and painted buildings for a medical and dental clinic, leveled and prepared a home site for construction.   I was impressed with how Mission Guatemala works in partnership with the local people.   The most rewarding part of the experience was the contact we had with local people.  Because our last two work days were school holidays school children helped with the benches and tables for their feeding center.  Now whenever they eat there they will be able to say, "I helped build these tables and benches."

I am on fire about all of the service that Mission Guatemala is bringing to the communities of San Andres and Nueva Esperanza. I highly recommend this organization and encourage you to go and "do all the good you can". It makes a tremendous difference in the lives of people who really need help and are incredibly gracious and proud.
Mission Guatemala Inc	89012		/users/profile/100764	shooterboy112	Volunteer	5	05/21/2011	Everything we did there was wonderful. It was a great experience to do all the things we were able to do. Even though they said they didn't feel like they were not very organized I thought Tom did a great job in keeping us all informed on what was happening and what we were going to be doing for the day. 
Mission Guatemala Inc	88845		/users/profile/100360	JohnMS91	Volunteer	5	05/17/2011	Tom and Dave do a great job at providing work for volunteers, even as Mission Guatemala is a new organization. Their work there is also providing for the needs of so many people in San Andres, and now, Nueva Esperanza, a town across the street from San Andres. I had the awesome opportunity to watch and help the feeding of the students in that town. Too cool! Every weekday, Mission Guatemala's food clinic provides lunch for 100 kids right after school. It was such a blessing to be a part of that!  The clinic is led by some guys that are truly working out of their genuine love for the people of San Andres, and it's definitely made me rethink what it means to "give." It's been an awesome learning experience and I hope to come back soon. 
Mission Guatemala Inc	88499		/users/profile/99689	Todd Outcalt	Volunteer	5	05/09/2011	Mission Guatemala is doing fantastic work in the area of San Andreas.  In addition to providing medical assistance, physical care, and nutrition, Mission Guatemala is uniting and embracing many United Methodist congregations in Indiana, USA, which are sending vital medical supplies and volunteers.  More recently, Calvary United Methodist Church in Brownsburg, IN packed over one ton of medical supplies for MG.  Mission Guatemala is a great work of God that is providing hands-on help to those in need.
Mission Guatemala Inc	88415		/users/profile/99499	jim r	Professional with expertise in this field	2	05/05/2011	The success of this organization beyond this first year will depend entirely on which Mission Statement Tom decides to follow. Outsiders coming in to start projects that someone else is expected to complete usually enjoy the time they are in Country but nothing ever gets completed. It ends up being a trip for the sake of taking a trip. If however Tom focuses on facilitating medical trips and is able to connect usable physicians with patients in need, then I would expect the efforts of Mission Guatemala to bear fruit. - jim r.
Mission Guatemala Inc	88261		/users/profile/99188	Brenda R	General Member of the Public	5	05/02/2011	Our church congregation in Nashville, Indiana has been amazed by the transformation Mission Guatemala has made in the last year under the leadership of Rev. Tom Heaton. What began as prayer for a small Mayan village in San Andres has developed into a site with a medical clinic served by a multi-lingual doctor and a facility for preschool.  Strong support is allowing a dental clinic and a nearby Feeding Center to take shape.  Rev. Heaton has a gift for skillfully matching needs with resources. Dave Burns has the energy and know-how to get projects done.  Mission Guatemala provides realistic opportunities for churches and individuals to make a difference in this poor area. In a few short months, donations have helped to hire local workers, and volunteer mission teams have been inspired to  work on projects that will  improve health, nutrition, education, and housing. Mission Guatemala reminds us that all of us are empowered to make a difference though our gestures of love.
Mission Guatemala Inc	85640		/users/profile/95607	Jeff N B.	Volunteer	5	04/13/2011	Jeff and I had an incredible experience.  The people of Guatemala are wonderful.  We kept pinching ourselves "this is more like a vacation, than a mission trip!"  Then it dawned on us.....We are the ones learning the lesson here!"  The mission continues with us at home. "WE" are to spread the information! And we plan to do just that!  Great time, great food, great leaders and great fellowship......who could ask for anything more?!  First mission trip for us, will not be the last! Tom and Dave are on the "ball".  They know what to do to get the most out of their volunteers!  "Big Dave" and Tom are the best, between the both of them, you have your planner, your gatherer, your executer and all around good guys!  A good time was had by all!  I'll be back! Hasta la vesta.......Batman!  The Boleys,  Rhea Ellen and Jeff  
Mission Guatemala Inc	85139		/users/profile/94792	rcmiller	Volunteer	5	04/11/2011	I spent a week in Panajachel, Guatemala, working with Tom Heaton and the Mission Guatemala staff.  I found the work to be both challenging and rewarding, and left with a true sense of accomplishment.  After working for, and with, the local residents, I was truly impressed with their pride, work ethic, and open acceptance of the volunteers and their efforts.  Tom and his staff have built an amazing relationship with the local population, based on trust and mutual respect, in a very short time and their progress has exceeded all expectations.
Mission Guatemala Inc	84970		/users/profile/94487	John Dinwiddie	Volunteer	5	04/07/2011	The local Mayan people were there working with us to improve their pre-school and Clinic.  This was not a unique event.  The same was happening with the building of a new school cafeteria at a different site up the road.  There is huge potential for these people because of their desire to better themselves.  There is no poverty of spirit, only a poverty of opportunity and basic living essentials.   I look forward to watching the future progress of this Mission, still in it's infancy,  and look forward to continuing to support it.   My hope is that the many other missions currently in Guatemala will reach out to one another to synergize their efforts.   My fear is that ego and self importance from well intentioned support groups may create unnecessary duplication, confusion, and ultimately cast a divisive atmosphere where so much good can be accomplished.
Mission Guatemala Inc	84922		/users/profile/94375	mattlipan	Volunteer	5	04/06/2011	I had the opportunity to lead a team of 12 adults from my church to Guatemala to work with Mission Guatemala. My entire team was impressed with the work MIssion Guatemala is doing in the region of San Andres, Guatemala and the nearly immediate impact their work is making in lives around the area. Through Mission Guatemala's medical clinic, soon to be operational dental clinic, preschool, feeding program, and countless other services it became apparent to my team that the opportunities for Mission Guatemala to grow in meeting the needs of individuals in the area are endless.  As the leader of this team I greatly appreciated the way in which Mission Guatemala used not only our team fees to be in country but the ways in which it uses its donations of supplies and money to engage the local community and meet as many needs as possible.  I would highly recommend Mission Guatemala as an non-profit organization that is making a difference in the lives of the people of Guatemala. I would not hesitate to take another team there and am actually planning another trip this fall. 
Mission Guatemala Inc	84780		/users/profile/94157	u364081	Volunteer	5	04/04/2011	The preparation materials for this mission were A+.  We had all the pre-planning materials to make for such a successful trip! We arrived in Antigua the first night and stayed at a hotel.  We had that evening to explore the area.  The hotel was nice and conveniently located to the square.  The next day we were shuttled in reliable comfortable vans to Las Buenas Nuevas, the compound that we stayed at for the trip in Panajachel.  There were 13 of us in 2 homes and we had plenty of room.  The homes were very clean and comfortable.  The location was wonderful...we looked out at Lake Aitlan with 2 active volcanoes on either side across the lake.  The complex was gated and very safe.   On the way to Panajachel we had the opportunity to stop at the Chichicastenango market.  I enjoyed this time to explore and experience an open market in Guatemala.  I can't say enough good things about Mission Guatemala and the work they are doing in the community.  Our hosts, Tom Heaton and Dave, re-enforced the fact that with any opportunity to interact with the children or people of the area, stop your work and just BE THERE!  They are very down-to-earth and you feel like you know them from the beginning of the trip.  They made this just the best mission experience!  The food at the compound we were served was terrific!!!  I had prepared myself for the type and amount of food that I might be served while I was in Guatemala, but I'd have to say it was worth 4 stars.  Tom and Dave also took us to dinner one evening at a local restaurant with a marimba show.   On the last day we traveled to Guatemala City to a hostel.  Four of us were in one small bedroom (it is a hostel so we were prepared), but the location was only 1 minute from the airport!  The food was also very good.  (The owner of the hostel was perhaps not the most organized, but he was personable and a great cook!)  Overall, I just couldn't have asked for a better trip!!!  The people and children of Guatemala will always have a place in my heart.  I learned so much from Mission Guatemala.  Thank you!
Mission Guatemala Inc	84755		/users/profile/94112	Cindy	Volunteer	5	04/04/2011	I have nothing but good things to say about Mission Guatemala and the work that Tom Heaton and his team are doing there. I have done many US trips but this was my first international project. Even here in the states the accommidations can be bad, the job preparation and details can be poorly handled and you can leave a work site feeling like you didn't really get to show the face of Christ to anyone but your own team. At Mission Guatemala we had great accommidations and Tom had the details of travel etc. all worked out. We were free to do the work needed while interacting with the children in the schools and the people of the communities. I left knowing that our group would be remembered long after our week was over. We can't wait to go back and continue the work God is directing through this mission! Cindy
Mission Guatemala Inc	84722		/users/profile/94050	raebosio	Volunteer	5	04/03/2011	This is an amazing organization.  Tom Heaton has a passion for helping the people of Guatemala and he puts his passion to work through projects that impact the people directly.  While I was helping at the misison I sanded and varnished furniture that will go to the people now living in the tent city.  I went to the tent city myself and saw the conditions and the need.  I also wired metal supports for the feeding center in Nueva Esperanza.  By the end of the week the supports were already up and surrounded by cement.  Direct action and immediate results.  I also went to a school in San Andres were the misison is donating $ for a school wide activity.  The goodwill Tom is creating will have lasting affects.  
Mission Guatemala Inc	84097		/users/profile/93231	Ben L.	Volunteer	5	03/30/2011	We worked with Mission Guatemala serving the mission in the community of San Andres.  During our time there, we helped to build a playground for the preschool/feeding program, worked on furniture for a displaced Mayan community, began digging a foundation for a food distribution center, and took and printed photos for families.  Mission Guatemala was great about offering a variety of projects to keep our team active and interested. Additionally, Tom Heaton, the director of Mission Guatemala, has worked with local lodging facilities to provide some of the best lodging we've had on any of our volunteer mission trips.  It was a great place in a location that allowed us to walk out the front door into the heart of Guatemalan culture. Bringing 20 people on our team, we were the largest group that Mission Guatemala had hosted to date.  They did a great job at handling such a large number.  Honestly, I've seen few who handled large groups nearly as well.  Of particular note was the fact that Tom and Dave (another leader in Mission Guatemala) made it a point to join us for meals and interact with the team on a regular basis.  All told, this was one of our favorite trips.
Mission Guatemala Inc	84080		/users/profile/93210	Laura	Volunteer	5	03/30/2011	The ladies (on our small team of six) painted a mural on the side of the preschool building and then went on to paint the walls of the future dental clinic.   The guys, under Dave's expert supervision and guidance, built monkey bars and an eagle's nest which were the first equipment on the playground.  The kids were so fun to watch as they explored and discovered just how they could climb all over everything!  (Although it did cause some small problem for one or two of the moms who came to retrieve their little ones - the kids wanted to stay and play!) Tom and Dave took such care of us, providing cooks, a driver and a wonderful place to stay that we felt very pampered.  Having said that, it was my husband's and my first mission trip. We were so very touched by the people, their dignity and depth of poverty that we will be forever changed.  As Christ's hands and feet in this world, we are moved to continue to do all the good we can for all the people we can.
Mission Guatemala Inc	84069		/users/profile/93198	genedawson	Volunteer	5	03/30/2011	Work was rewarding as our team completed or started various components of three different mission-specific programs that ranged from basic feeding programs for children to medical and dental clinic operations.   Our team also worked to finish primitave furniture for a tent community adjacent to the community where the mission site is located.
Mission Guatemala Inc	81680		/users/profile/89529	Victor M.	Volunteer	5	03/09/2011	I found our Mission trip to be a wonderful experience. I was impressed with how well Tom and Dave treated us and organized our time. I personally was inspired by the chance to contribute my talents to help those families in Guatemala that need help. I was touched deeply by everyone involved in our trip. To see the hope and determination in the people who have such a hard struggle for even the most basic needs was truly humbling. I thank God for the chance to give back and to honor him with our work. Look forward to the chance to do it again.
Mission Guatemala Inc	81653		/users/profile/89486	Patty M.	Volunteer	5	03/09/2011	What an amazing experience my husband Victor and I had this past week in Guatamala. Meeting Tom and Dave- who by the way are two of the most terrific people I have ever met- was an honor. They are so humble but are doing so much for so many. They really went above and beyond as our hosts. Our work painting and building furniture was fun- we came to know everyone so well and all worked in harmony. What a joy!As someone who struggled a bit with the decision to go-- would I be able to be of help?, would it be awkward?, would my family survive without me?, I can tell you from the bottom of my heart I have no regrets. It was one of the best most spiritually rewarding experiences of my life. I am forever changed.  God Bless Tom and Dave and all of the people of Guatamala!

It also gave peace and comfort to us (parents) who deal with the ongoing financial strains of raising a child(ren) with special needs which can be overwhelming especially during the holidays. Parker Autism Foundation is so near and dear to our hearts. They help so many children and families who dont have the financial means to buy gifts or send their children to specialized summer camps or to simply know where to turn to find support and resources for their children. The staff members who have worked with our son are outstanding! Their experience, compassion, professionalism, and understanding of autism spectrum disorder is above and beyond our expectations! Camp Dakota has been a life-changing experience for our son! I know all the children really appreciate ALL you do to support our local autism community.

I have two autistic boys one higher functioning and one lower functioning. It was very easy I sent them via email a copy of my boy's psychological report and they responded very quickly. The gift card they have provided me is the only means I have to give my children a decent Christmas with things they can use and need to help with things pertaining to their dx.  They were in contact with me every step of the way provided tracking numbers and followed up with me to make sure I got it. I am so grateful and appreciative because honestly with out this card my kids wouldn't have a Christmas. Unfortunate events happened with my vehicle and I had to replace the radiator twice in a two week span so Christmas gifts were the last of my priorities. This program is a god sent. It truely is.

Every aspect of Josh's life has been affected by this life altering disorder; including his family life, being able to function out in the community and his education. He tried different local therapies, but was unsuccessful.   Josh was given an opportunity to see an out of town doctor who specializes in "Difficult to treat Hearing Disorders". We were finally given hope that he could find recovery through on going specialized treatment.   Because we are a low income family, transportation costs to this new doctor, that includes train, buses and cab service is very financially difficult for us. The Autism Spectrum Disorder Foundation blessed Josh with a grant to help our family towards these transportation expenses.    This grant has enabled Josh to receive long awaited, specialized medical treatment. We are so grateful for their generosity towards kids on the Autism Spectrum, who so often struggle with multiple disorders. Through the Autism Spectrum Disorder Foundation's help, Josh has been given the opportunity to find healing and freedom from pain, allowing him to regain quality of life and reach his highest potential.

Autism Spectrum Disorder Foundation Inc	305095	1	/users/profile/396321	Jennifer584	Client Served	5	09/16/2016	Hello Michael,My name is Jennifer Amash. I have 6 kids with 2 of them being on the Autism Spectrum among other things. To say it is a challenge daily in our home would be an understatement. I am always on the go taking kids to therapy, Doctors appointments, IEP meetings, School gatherings etc. I also take care of my disabled father and my 85 year old grandmother with dementia. I help run the Vancouver WA autism mom's group and I coach for the MiracIe League of Vancouver WA. I like to think i am a very giving, caring person and I think my friends would agree. This past July I came down with a terrible pneumonia which I ignored for quite a while and it put me in the hospital with respiratory failure. I spent over 11 days in the hospital which I had never done before ever, I am generally a healthy person and the only times i have been in the hospital were for my 6 deliveries and a minor surgery. As you can imagine being the one who takes care of everyone being laid up has been unbearable for me but I haven't really had a choice. I'm not one to ask for help and be dependent on others so this has been a struggle for me. When I received your check in the mail, I couldn't believe it. I was shocked. Financially, things have been strained around here as my husband has had to take time off work to take me to appointments etc. I was able to pay a few bills, buy some groceries that are easy for the kids to make meals, and hire people to come in and help me with my kiddos. Nobody really wanted to help much when they weren't getting compensated. I can't tell you how much the funds have helped out my family. I am still very sick and on bed rest. I am on all kinds of medication which is also very new to me. Now that I have the means to pay for respite, I am getting some much needed rest. I am waiting on a bunch of test results to come in and when the time comes I'll deal with whatever needs to be done. I am just amazed at your generosity and I hope you know how much My family and I appreciate what you've done for us. Thank you so much!

It is a special blessing to me to get to share the good news with families after they have been selected to receive a holiday gift card from ASDF.

Autism Spectrum Disorder Foundation Inc	243449	1	/users/profile/309051	Tami12	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/22/2015	I became familiar with The Autism Spectrum Disorder Foundation several years ago when a camper was provided funds to attend a camp I direct yearly for children with autism.  Since that time they have funded more than 100 campers to receive a full scholarship for a week of camp they will always remember.  There have been times that I have had one more camper ask at the last moment if there are any more funds and ASDF has always come through. It brings me so much joy to enter the camp season knowing that not one child has to be left out.  Since that time our partnership with ASDF has given many families Christmas who simply could not afford gifts outside of the therapies needed by their child, and has given the gift of communication to a child who could not speak.  They are always a joy to work with and they really seem to understand the needs of the families we serve.

He recently became interested in horses, so I sought out horse therapy, not realizing the cost of such a therapy.   I started looking on the internet and what I found was nothing short of a blessing.  I came across this fantastic organization called the Autism Spectrum Disorder Foundation.  I contacted them and within an hour I was contacted back with an answer that they would pay for his entire lessons.  I cannot wait to see the look on his face when he gets on that horse this Friday afternoon and when I tell him he gets to go back each week.  Thank you doesn't seem enough for this wonderful gift they have given us.  Please consider donating to this wonderful organization so they may help more families like ours.

The diagnosis came right after my husband lost his job and we no longer had health insurance. Of course, Brandon's doctors wanted us to start speech therapy right away since he had severe language and comprehension delays.  The therapist we found had a fee of $135 per session, but lowered it to $90 to help us out.  Even with the discount we KNEW couldn't afford it.  We prayed for help and God answered in the form of Autism Spectrum Disorder Foundation! The staff looked over Brandon's case, his clinical diagnosis, his therapy plan and cut a check to the speech therapist so we could start sessions right away.  Praise God for  these people and the work they do to help families in need.  Autism diagnoses are financially draining for families, I personally don't know anybody with an extra $800 laying around to pay for therapy sessions. So when you can find a place that makes it possible for kids diagnosed with autism to get the help they need, it's a godsend.  Because of their generosity, Brandon starts speech therapy sessions on Thursday.

Autism Spectrum Disorder Foundation Inc	239936		/users/profile/325930	kaciej	Client Served	4	03/26/2015	With my daughter having been misdiagnosed for most of her life, there was no end to the horror stories as we attempted to navigate the public school system. She was not correctly diagnosed with Asperger's until she was 21.  And unbelievably, at this time she incurred a medical crisis which is ongoing and without resolution. Simultaneously she returned to school at the local community college to begin the journey to attain her life goal of earning a PhD in biology. Unfortunately after 5 years of Herculean effort, she was still unable to complete her two years at this level.  Because she is the expert chameleon, her disability remains hidden to neuro-typicals and even to those who work in access/disability resource centers, who refuse to grant the much needed accommodations due to her better than 4 point GPA. No one sees the enormous costs she has to pay just to get through one class. Consequently, this brilliant young woman is in a holding pattern attempting to make this right not only for her but other Aspie's who have given up their own dreams of a college education.  As we have lived in poverty all her life, we are unable to afford the fun things in life and pretty much live in survival mode. Her case manager contacted ASDF with a request for funding for riding lessons for her as she used to ride and loves animals more than people.  These lessons are the only thing she looks forward to every week in her very packed schedule and the instructor enjoys Alex as much as Alex enjoys being there with her. This has been such a boon to her and we are so grateful that ASDF has provided this. We cannot thank them enough.

Dillon has many health problems. He is a special needs child with ADHD, Autism and Degeorge Syndrome. Hes mildly mental retarded as well. Ive never cared for a child like Dillon as my children are grown and gone. As it turns out DHS came and asked me to adopt both children 5 months into the 22 month contract as the parents were not doing what they were suppose to do and staying off the drugs. I got Dillon into many behavioral programs and created a safe and loving enviroment. He now has stability and structure and consisentcy and hes come along way from the time he got here. Ive been trying and writing to people to get Dillon an Ipad and he was put on a back burner and forgot. I contacted Michael Slutsky and of the Autism Spectrum Disorder Foundation and he was right on top of it for Dillon. Finally someone helped me. Dillon got his Ipad yesterday and is now learning the letters and sounds. I cant work full time with Dillon and money is very tight. The state dont pay for any kinds of camps or programs for children like Dillon. Everything is at my expense and with only my husband working, i cant afford any thing like that so i have to do my best. Im so greatful for Michael and his fouyndation. i might need more and im glad someone is there for us. Ive had no experience in dealing with kids like dillon but boy ive gotten better with patience.

Autism Spectrum Disorder Foundation Inc	236969		/users/profile/321214	Insurmountable	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/17/2015	For almost ten years , I have been working with children and families as a behavioral support clinician particularly assisting children along the spectrum.  In all my years as a behavioral support clinician , I have come to see how wonderful individuals along the spectrum are . These individuals are extremely gifted and intelligent.  They possess great abilities and intellect . I encourage parents who have children diagnosed with this disorder to keep on and never give up especially with such tremendous support from organizations like ASDF.  Great job ASDF . Keep up the good work bringing smiles to these special people and making families to smile.  Finally , one important skill I would like to transfer to parents is to put themselves in the world of individuals with autism to understand them.   We have to talk like them , think like them , and act like them to understand them. Importantly , we must listen to their body language as a proactive measure instead being reacting when challenging behaviors occur.

During the past year we have learned so much about his disorder and how to help Aidan succeed.  One of his biggest challenges is communication.  He was very slow to speak, but currently has a vocabulary of about 80 words.  Communicating his wants and needs continues to be a roadblock for him.  When I heard of the Autism Spectrum Disorder Foundation and their program to help children on the spectrum by supplying iPads, I was not sure it was for real.  I contacted the foundation but was told that the year's allotment of iPads had already been distributed.  That was a disappointment.  Knowing what a benefit this assistive technology would be for my grandson I decided to start saving to hopefully purchase one.  Several weeks later I received an email from the foundation informing me that a new supply of iPad mimi's was expected and I would be able to apply for one by sending Aidan's diagnosis.  I immediately responded and within 10 days Aidan had his iPad mini.  It is hard to express in words the difference this is making in Aidan's learning.  There are many free apps available for children on the Autism Spectrum.  We are currently using Candy Count to help with counting and sorting and number sense, ABA Flashcards for expressing emotions, and Emotions, Feelings, and Colors to help with social development.  Aidan's vocabulary and his ability to express his wants, needs, and feelings is improving already.  I can't wait to see what new apps will be available for him in the future.  Thank you to the ASDF and its generous donors for providing this learning tool for our child and other children on the spectrum.  It is truly a great blessing to see your child make the connections necessary to have a future.  We are very grateful for this opportunity for our grandson.   I will be donating the money I saved for Aidan's iPad to the foundation to benefit other children.Denise MyersRochester, PA

We learned of this diagnosis at the age of 6, but, knew "something" was wrong since birth. She has been in therapeutic horseback riding since the age of 7. The first session, she screamed the entire time while on the horse (mainly because she couldn't stand wearing a helmet). After a couple of times, she stopped screaming. She actually looked forward to riding her horse, and told me about it every week. Although she's not a competitive rider, like many people at Stirrups 'N Strides in Citra, FL, she enjoys going each Saturday. She is calm on the horse. She sits with a smile on her face, and doesn't like to stop! She looks forward to it each Saturday. I was so excited that Autism Spectrum Disorder Foundation, Inc. provided a scholarship for her to ride last year. It was unexpected, but, such a blessing!

Carson is two and a half. He was delayed in speech but once he started talking he was picking up words in leaps and bounds. Carson started having seizures, that caused regression. Carson has decreased in verbalizing and has been choosing to sign more. With Carson starting preschool soon, we had come to the decision to get him an iPad that could help ease his communication issues in the school system. ASDF responded to my email immediately informing me once they received a copy of Carson's diagnosis, they could help provide an iPad. I assumed this meant we would go on a waiting list and it'd be 6 months or better before we'd ever hear anything, just because most foundations do have such a long wait list. Not ASDF! Carson received his iPad mini within 2 weeks of the initial email response! With ASDF covering the costs of the tablet for Carson, we were able to purchase the AvidTalker program ourselves. We were so thankful to stumble across their website!!!  BrookeMom to an Ausome Wizard :)

Autism Spectrum Disorder Foundation Inc	211393		/users/profile/274316	erickoranda	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/20/2014	I am a middle school autism teacher. This foundation provided IPAD minis for my students at their Title I school.  I cannot state enough how much thier generosity has impacted my students. These students come from disadvantaged backgrounds and do not often receive the same things that students from advantaged backgrounds receive. To see the joy on their face when they use an IPAD mini is priceless.  These machines have numerous benefits for my students. They help motivate the students to complete their work and meet thier goals, they provide a source of information and also can be used to work on language skills.  It is no secret that many students with autism experience a deep connection with the IPADs and the IPADs bring much joy and order to those whose lives are often lacking in both.  In addition the student love to share the IPADs with each other and this helps them socialize with each other, which is another area that is difficult for them as well.    The IPADs are the way of the future and I am confident that they will help special needs students in the future bridge the gap with thier peers in the general education classes as well as  enable them to share in class discussions and group discussions with thier peers.  Because many students with autism are visually oriented the IPADs provide a way for them to communicate because they can pull up pictures and websites to express themselves.  This organization is amazing and they will never fully know the positive impact they have made on my students. Their contribution is much appreciated!!!!!!

We have many Autistic children that ride in our therapeutic program & I have seen "miracles" happen to these children when they become involved with riding  a horse.  I can't thank the ASDF enough for giving us scholarships for 4 of our children to ride for this coming riding season.  So many of our children's families can't afford to  pay, so we have chosen 4 of these families for your scholarships & I can't tell you how appreciative they are.  The lives of these children can change dramatically as they learn to follow directions, sequencing, & being able to concentrate for the entire lesson!!

Without the support of this organization 20 campers (10 campers in preschool and school-age) would not have had the opportunity to come to camp. I'd like to share some of the comments made by parents of the campers we served.  Orlando's mom writes: "Thank you for all the  financial support you gave my son so he could participate in this wonderful day camp.  He has made great strides in spite of his autism and I owe it to programs like yours and the YMCA which gave him the ability to lead a "normal" life.  He does not want to miss going to camp. If he did not have this opportunity  this summer to attend camp, he would have been at home not making any progress.  Again. thank you from the bottom of our hearts."  Alex's grandmother writes: "Thank you, thank you, thank you for sharing the financial support so my special grandson could attend your excellent day camp program for the last two years.  Alex has improved in his social and communication skills.  He also made some new friends and enjoyed his art class.  He was very happy and excited to go to camp each day.  Again, thanks for the help that was given to him.  I pray many people who can will donate to both of your organizations so many more children with and without disabilities can continue to receive financial support as well as social and emotional support."  Jon and Mimi's mom writes this: "on what I thought was a whim is what I call Divine Order after calling the Hobart Y and speaking with Mrs. Sharon to inquire if there was sibling discount for the Preschool summer day camp program since I have two adopted special needs children both on the Autism Spectrum.  What happened next exceeded my greatest expectation: I was told about the Autism Spectrum Disorder Foundation and the availability of them helping to cover the cost for both of my dear ones to attend day camp.  I have seen so much progress with both of them.  They have enjoyed each day of camp and it does a Mother good to see her children so happy.  Thank you from the bottom of my heart for being willing to support such excellent programs in our community.  May God continue to bless your organization."  
Autism Spectrum Disorder Foundation Inc	208288		/users/profile/270966	MommyJ	Client Served	5	08/01/2014	Like many children on the autism spectrum, my son is drawn to water.  The pool is where he feels most at ease.  It is his joy and truly is his "happy place."  I revel in the fact this he is able to share this joy with me, however it also terrifies me because one of the leading causes of death for individuals with autism is drowning.  This statistic is elevated in individuals who wander.  My husband and I knew early on that our J would need to learn to swim at an young age because of his love of water and his propensity to wander when the rare opportunity presents itself.   When we looked into swimming lessons we quickly figured out that due to the nature of his specific needs, a typical group lesson would not be a safe option for him at the present time.  Unfortunately the costs associated with raising a family, paying for insurance and copays for J's many weekly therapy sessions did not leave much, if any, room for lessons with a private 1:1 instructor.  Through the generous support of the ASDF, our son was able receive scholarships to fund the 1:1 swim lessons that he needs with an incredible, experienced, caring professional.  His instructor and the ASDF have become really important members of J's team because without their help he would not be building the lifesaving skill set that he desperately needs.  Thank you for all that you do!

Autism Spectrum Disorder Foundation Inc	206815		/users/profile/269290	mayleg	Client Served	5	07/21/2014	I am the mother of four (4) year old twin boys. The oldest twin (by a minute) was diagnosed within the spectrum of autism.  I first observed a change in him at the age of 2.  We were devastated when my son stop talking and we lost eye contact communication with him.  Since that realization, my husband and I been researching and implementing many of the therapies we discovered during on-line searches.  We have tried whatever made sense to us at the time, including change in diet  all organic, eliminating certain foods and adding others.  We believe that a holistic approach would be best for our son.  We are determined to help our son overcome the challenges of Autism by attacking the symptoms early and consistently.  Some of the therapies tried are: OT, BA, Speech, gluten/dairy free diet, swimming, etc., you name it we have tried it. In the past 2 years we have exhausted every penny of our saving (we have two others children) paying for the therapies tried in an effort to help our son overcome the challenges of autism.  Our goal is to help our son become a healthy well adjusted adult that will be able to make a positive contribution to his family and society.  We dont know how long we are going to be around, but we are determined to help him reach his full potential.  Someone I met through Parents of Children with Autism `told me about the horseback riding program/therapy and how much it helps her son.  Financially, we couldnt afford to pay for the horseback riding lesson as another tool in the multi-faceted approach in my sons therapy/program.  As I mentioned above, currently, we have him working with a speech therapist, ABA, OT and swimming for which the total cost is the equivalent to my monthly salary.  Through online research I luckily discovered AUTISM SPECTOM DISORDER FOUNDATION.  I immediate wrote to them and was happily surprised to receive a quick response to my email.  I requested help to pay for the Equine Therapy and thankfully received the financial assistance necessary to afford my sons therapy.  This help was a God send, within a week I could see positive results.  My son was able to say a few words, for example, he was asking for the horse, and even requested to go horseback riding.  Mommy, lets go diggy dap, diggy dap.  Those few words gave me hope that one day my baby will be able to fully communicate.   I would like to thank this organization from the bottom of my heart for the financial help they have provided for my precious boy.  I cannot express in words how grateful I am to the Autism Spectrum Disorder Foundation for your scholarship, support and the work you do to assist my family and other families with Autistic Children.

Since birth, I have been on a journey to find therapies for Patrick that would benefit him. He has had speech, occupational and physical therapies. Recently, in the last two or three years, Patrick has had the opportunity to participate in hippo therapy in Centerburg, Ohio. Immediately I noticed a connection that he made with his self awareness, that I had not noticed in his other therapies. I feel it is due to the nature of the horses at the hippo therapy, that helped Patrick to become aware of himself more and his surroundings. I thought he would be afraid to ride a horse, since it is so big!!! However, much to my delight, he was eager and willing to learn about the horse. And not only that, he can hug the horse and just be himself around the horse, with no type of judgement or attitude!! Human attitude, I mean. It gives him a sense of peace and contentment. I am so grateful for the scholarships that Patrick has received, since we have a large family and have had a hard time making ends meet. I wish there were more awareness of the benefits of hippo therapy, to people on the autism spectrum.

All five of my students are exceptional young boys and I am honored to be their teacher. One student, in particular, has so much potential, but, because of communication barriers, it is sometimes difficult to pull his knowledge out. He has a school issued iPad for communication and academic development during the school year, but it must be returned before summer. This young man has made tremendous progress this year and it worried his family and myself so that he would regress during the two month summer break, so I reached out the Autism Spectrum Disorder Foundation Inc. for help. Within an hour of telling them my student's story, they were not only willing, but eager, to supply my student with a mini iPad so that he may have a strong and clear voice, 24/7, 365. The Autism Spectrum Disorder Foundation & Michael Slutsky understand the potential all individuals with autism have and make sure that those individuals have the necessary tools to be successful.

We were told that he would never speak but he began talking at 4 1/2 and he is yet to stop. We were also told that he was healthy at birth only to later discover that he has Autism, Celiac Disease, Chiari Malformation and Ehlers Danlos Syndrome. As a result, he has undergone multiple surgeries, he spends a lot of his waking hours needing to be laying down, he has fine motor challenges and vision impairments. The never ending medical expenses, therapy bills and time away from work have left us unable to purchase an iPad.  The mini iPad that ASDF provided our son has allowed him to complete his schoolwork without needing to be upright and with out needing to be dependent on someone else to write down his answers. Our son can feel the pride of keeping up with his school work independently. We are forever grateful.

It really makes me quite emotional to have such a foundation really & truly help on an individual basis. I previously wrote a review from when they helped my son with an Ipad & now they helped my amazing son with the payment of swimming lessons! He had his 1st lesson, Saturday 3/15/14 & it was much needed! He is looking forward to his classes & as a parent, I know how important it is for my Autistic son to learn how to swim & avoid some of the dangers that go along with water. I truly appreciate this Foundation & will forever be grateful for the opportunities given to us by ASDF.

We were not sure he would be able to continue when the cost of his lessons suddenly increased last fall. Piano is very important in his life because it's an area he shines in among his classmates!  It helps the kids understand that autistic children can do many of the things that typical kids can, and so I think, leads to more inclusiveness. Because of your assistance, our son has already participated in the annual city-wide music decathlon and is preparing for the school talent show and his recital. Thank you for all you do for our son and for all the children that you help!!

Since that point we have been searching for a therapy that will help break through to him.  This Saturday he will start Equine Therapy at a stable designed for kids on the Autism Spectrum.  This is all possible through a generous donation from Autism Spectrum Disorder Foundation.  Getting the email that said we would receive funding from this organization was truly like seeing a light at the end of the tunnel.  I am anxious to see what improvements Truman will make with this therapy approach.

This organization has funded private swimming lessons for 10 children on the Autism Spectrum each year at my aquatic facility.  As an instructor it has been so gratifying to see the progress the children have made.  The ASDF funding has allowed the instructors to give the children one -on-one lessons tailor made to their specific needs.  Their proficiency in swimming has given them great pride and their families piece of mind. Thank you ASDF for all that you do to better the lives of individuals living with Autism. 
Autism Spectrum Disorder Foundation Inc	194341	1	/users/profile/253942	MichelleRussell	Client Served	4	02/15/2014	Good Morning,  I just wanted to send you this note to let you know how thankful Alicia and I am to have had the opportunity to receive this most wonderful gift. Alicia has absolutely grown in so many ways over the year she has been working on the iPad. She has been able to practice her reading with  the help of Ebooks which help her to sound out words, she is able to practice her eye hand coordination, and she also has become more social as she is part of a social group where she is able to chat with other kids. This requires her to think about what she wants to say, spell out the words and read and interpret the responses. The IPAd has also given her a great resource to Learn sign language. She is really into sign language and she goes back to class and teaches her class mates. Overall the iPad has helped her academically, socially, and mentally. She is more open to the world and Growing more and more each day.  Michelle Russell

He is learning how to swim and has a growing confidence in everything he does.  Learning how to swim is a life giving gift when unforeseen accidents happen.  It is a known fact that those on the autism spectrum are attracted to water and many have lost their lives.  The skills my son is learning could possibly save his life one day. Thank you also for the holiday gift card program you provide families in need.  My family is thankful for the help they have provided over the holidays.  You have helped my family have a Christmas that otherwise wouldn't have been possible.  Keep up the great work!  You are changing lives and helping families inflicted by autism.  THANK YOU!
Autism Spectrum Disorder Foundation Inc	194194	1	/users/profile/253706	GretaS	Client Served	5	02/12/2014	Autism Spectrum Disorder Foundation is a wonderful foundation that has helped my son (on the autism spectrum) for several years.  ASDF has provided my son much needed therapy equipment (that my family could not afford otherwise).  The equipment has helped my son overcome many of his sensory problems.  He is no longer in need of OT therapy!  That is HUGE!   ASDF has also helped my son with a new bicycle (fitted to his needs).  His bike has given him a new, "unknown freedom" that every child should experience.  My family is also greatly appreciative to the much needed Holiday Gift Card Program.  Raising a child on the autism spectrum is very costly, thanks to all the therapy needed.  If it wasn't for ASDF helping us with a gift card, my son would not have had Christmas gifts to open, warm winter clothes to wear, nor would we have had food in our bellies over the winter.  Finally, one of the best "gifts" ASDF has given my son is swim lessons at our YMCA.  Thanks to the lessons, my son has: overcome many sensory issues with water, has built up his core muscles, and has totally built up his confidence.  The most important "gift" the swim lessons have provided is learning a new, LIFE SAVING skill.  My family can't thank the Autism Spectrum Disorder Foundation enough for all that they have done for my son.  We are forever grateful to this wonderful foundation and to those that have made the help available to families like ours.  THANK YOU!   I would also like to add one more thing to my review.  I have been reading through the volunteer reviews and see so many negative comments about ASDF.  Some have said that they use 60% of the donations go toward expenses.  I am sure they do.  The therapy equipment, bicycle, swim lessons, and Holiday Gift Cards they have helped my family with ARE expenses (and that isn't including the iPads, camps, computers, etc. that they have provided other families over the years).  PLEASE do not be discouraged by the few people that have given bad reviews.  ASDF has helped our family, and many more across the US with children on the Autism Spectrum.  They TRULY are a Godsend to our family.  I am forever thankful a friend introduced me to ASDF.  If you are looking to help with donations, this is the right place.  They help families DIRECTLY (unlike many other organizations).   Thank you for your help!

He was diagnosed with PDD, NOS at age two. For the past seven years the Foundation has provided him with lessons to learn how to swim. Not only did he acquire the ability, he is able to swim backstroke and freestyle for two laps without stopping!  This has given him great confidence.  In addition, they have helped Ryan to enroll in a great social camp where he was able to expand his challenging receptive and expressive language skills.  He has been able to participate in Tae Kwon Do classes where he attends classes with his peers.  It was a very proud moment when he earned his yellow belt.  All of this was made possible by such a caring and generous ASDF. Ryan has been thriving and has a weekly tutor to help him keep up academically.We are forever grateful for their continued generousity through the years.

Autism Spectrum Disorder Foundation Inc	194051	1	/users/profile/253510	varcsr	General Member of the Public	5	02/10/2014	My son, Connor, has limited communication skills and his speech is mostly unintelligible.  The Ipad provided by the Autism Spectrum Disorder Foundation has opened a whole new world of communication for Connor.  Prior to the Ipad, Connor had a bulky, heavy assistive technology device which he rarely used, probably because it made him feel so different.  Now, when his speech is unintelligible, he pulls out his Ipad installed with TouchChat,  and clarifies his speech;  this is a significant benefit as it minimizes the frustration for  both Connor and his communication partner.   The Ipad has also provided Connor with other communication options.  For instance, he uses the Ipad to take pictures of places he has been such as Jimmy John's, Giant and Staples, or anything he finds interesting.   The pictures are a great way to initiate conversations,  sharing his interest and adventures with others.    In addition to the improved communication opportunities, there are so many educational applications that hold Connor's attention.  The Ipad has not only had a significant impact on Connor's life, but our family life as well, by providing some insight into Connor's thoughts which would otherwise be inaccessible.   It is said, "The way we communicate with others and with ourselves determines the quality of our lives";  the  Ipad provided by your organization has changed the quality of Connor's life and those around him.    With much thanks and appreciation to your organization and staff.

Autism Spectrum Disorder Foundation Inc	193838	1	/users/profile/253218	Renee39	Client Served	5	02/06/2014	I first learned about this organization from my sister whose daughter has some level of MR & was quite impressed that not only do they help Autistic children but also children with special needs period. My son is Autistic however and after placing an inquiry for Ipad assistance, They were able to send him one within 6 months! The Ipad was a refurbished one and had some problems but it had a warranty so we were able to go to the Apple store & they exchanged it for a brand new one because the other one stopped working. I was impressed again that not only did they send us an Ipad but it came with a warranty. This Foundation is a blessing & I am so appreciative for their help. The Ipad has helped my son tremendously. It's the only thing that keeps his interest, It made us see that he's really technology driven & we are now focusing his future based on the things that we've seen him be able to do with the Ipad. Thank you so very much Autism Spectrum Disorder Foundation!!!!  Also, I want to say that it makes me very upset at the people writing negative reviews about this organization. I read a review that 60% of the funds go to expenses, well guess what Ipads are an expense & quite expensive I might add! They are at least trying to help our special needs children. Who else is really doing that? I wasn't on a waiting list for years & years like some other organizations I know of. This is a great service to our children & if they were able to send 100 kids to camp or however many, THAT IS A DIFFERENCE MADE! I am a parent & a client served & this organization is AWESOME!

I started researching different organizations that could help because I work full-time and was trying to go to school full time. But my limited finances and being that my son could not speak I had to put that on hold. I couldn't afford an IPAD being a single parent with a mortgage and I contacted  Autism Spectrum Disorder Foundation INC. and told them my story and they sent my son an IPAD after receiving his prescription. My son is now more verbal and his Teacher can understand what he is now saying along with his participation being up in his classroom. My son now sings and dance and his academic level is now improved. This foundation has been a blessing to my son and he is now progressing everyday. There was no organization out there of all the years of trying to find help for my son no one would help but this blessed foundation.

They were very easy to communicate with and understand our needs.  One year my son traveled to a sports camp that specialized in thrilling outdoor excursions created for kids like him.  ASDF was so generous paying for the tuition and travel costs.  Also ASDF came to our rescue a second time and sponsored my son's tuition to attend special disability inclusion camping experience at Wilderness Inquiry.  Nowadays it's almost impossible to believe that this generosity exists.  Come the holidays I always remember the memories that were created for my son and improved his life and our lives.

This is the 2nd year I've volunteered to canvas for donations. I was checking with one neighbor today who donated last year and he told me about an article in the AARP magazine about this very organization that stated that 60% of the funds donated go toward expenses. That's a huge chunk of change for those so-called do-gooder Board Members getting paid to coordinate this dysfunctional effort. Needless to say, I will not be doing this again next year. They called and called and called this year until I was so tired of not answering the phone that I finally picked it up and agreed to do this again just to get them to stop calling me. They ought to be ashamed of themselves. I will send in the donations I have collected because I collected them in good faith assuming that the majority of the donation was going directly to the cause. At least my conscience won't bother me.

Autism Spectrum Disorder Foundation Inc	118464	27	/users/profile/161123	BriaBoston	Professional with expertise in this field	1	07/15/2012	I received an unsolicited telephone call asking me to distribute information on the ASDF to my neighbors.  I asked SPECIFICALLY if anything else was required.  I was assured I only had to put an information packet in my neighbors mailboxes.  Which I then agreed to do as I have friends impacted by autism.  I receive the materials and it is all about soliciting funds. The process was extremely poorly thought out.  The materials were so poorly prepared, I did not want my name associated with them.  I also felt lied to by their representative.  Then to make matters worse, I know this organization sold my contact information, as I began to get similar calls from other organizations. This is unacceptable to me.  I would investigate this organization and am thinking of sending this info on to our AG.
Autism Spectrum Disorder Foundation Inc	118109	20	/users/profile/160634	patluck	Volunteer	1	07/11/2012	I, too was given the "hard sell" and pull at my heartstrings for all the children who suffer this awful disorder.  I even had to speak with a Supervisor and "Swear" that I was sending the packets.  However, after I received them, I noticed that they are not from my State and when I checked the website, could find little information on local fund awards.  I checked with my state (NJ) Consumer Bureau and found that they filed a report listing that they received over 2 million in donations and, of course, their "expenses" were about the same.  I would not volunteer for this organization or give in to their hard sell.
Autism Spectrum Disorder Foundation Inc	117569	11	/users/profile/159835	CURTIS F BARTELT	Volunteer	1	07/02/2012	The phone person went right to the point of  sending requests to neighbors.  I said that I did not believe in this type of solicitation, but would be glad to receive more information.  Received request for donation without any info to substantiate.  Glad that I checked.  I am retired family MD and sorry that such scams exist.
Autism Spectrum Disorder Foundation Inc	112429	18	/users/profile/153014	POR356	Volunteer	1	05/19/2012	Sites like this one are invaluable in filtering out scams such as the ASDF.  My story is precisely as those below, and you don't have time while on the phone with them to check out the fund raiser.  So I volunteered and then did my research on the charity afterward.  Needless to say, I won't be bothering my neighbors with solicitations from this rip-off.
Autism Spectrum Disorder Foundation Inc	112133	17	/users/profile/152579	sfaina	Volunteer	1	05/15/2012	I wish I had done my research earlier. But I was very busy and it didn't cross my mind.  I am embarrassed that I sent requests to my neighbors and am glad none returned money.  I guess they're smarter than me.  I wrote the check for the whole amount and was going to mail it when something just didn't seem right.  I think it was because they put such a low amount for our goal ($45).   I thought if it was a scam, even that low amount from a lot of people could make a bunch.  It's a shame that the numbers aren't reversed - 7-15% to administration and the rest for the people who need it.  Ripping up the envelope and check, but I lost the value of my stamps.
Autism Spectrum Disorder Foundation Inc	112012	19	/users/profile/152425	gaioh	Volunteer	1	05/14/2012	because i have an autistic grandson, i volunteered to distribute flyers to for this organization's ongoing funding campaign...good thing i checked up on them before i spoke with my friends and neighbors....WHAT A RIP OFF!!! ANYWHERE FROM 80 TO 84% OF THE CONTRIBUTIONS GO TO FUND RAISING AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS....if you are concerned about autism and want to raise awareness, stick to organizations such as AUTISM SPEAKS, where you can help make a difference....gaioh@earthlink.net 
Autism Spectrum Disorder Foundation Inc	109734	34	/users/profile/149489	Dianne2	Volunteer	1	04/12/2012	I thought I would help out for a good cause and thought I better vet this organization before signing my good name and asking for donations on their behalf. Glad I did and just before applying postage. My first impulse was, "how can I help" then my second impulse was to make sure this organization was legit. Sad, we have to be so careful to avoid being taken advantage of.
Autism Spectrum Disorder Foundation Inc	102300	24	/users/profile/133005	jwf1212	Volunteer	1	12/14/2011	I like many others volunteered to distribute donation materials to my neighbors. I'm very glad I didn't apply the stamps to envelopes before reading your evaluations. 
Autism Spectrum Disorder Foundation Inc	99684	19	/users/profile/120507	7899	Volunteer	1	10/24/2011	We received a packet and checked them out on CharityWatch. org.    They rated  ASDF   an  " F ".     ASDF spends 84 cents out of every $ 1.00  collected for administrative and other expenses!!!    Outrageous - they purport to be non-profit but hire a for- profit fund raising company to solicit funds.    Don't fall for the scam.     Check them out!!!    They are screwing things up for the legitimate charities.
Autism Spectrum Disorder Foundation Inc	99088	23	/users/profile/118506	43frank	Volunteer	1	10/07/2011	I volunteered to distribute a small mailing about this organization in my neighborhood.  Another professional fundraising organization - InfoCisionManagement Corp. - sent me the mailing package.  One of the items in the mailing was a card that identified the states that required notification to potential donors about the financial results related to the charity and the professional fundraiser associated with it.  On the Vermont attorney general's site I found very disturbing information about this particular professional fundraiser.   In many cases - for many well known charitable organizations - this fundraiser returned to the charity less than 50% of the money that individuals had donated.  I have decided not to proceed with the solicitations to my neighbors.
Autism Spectrum Disorder Foundation Inc	94499	33	/users/profile/109300	Louie	Volunteer	1	07/27/2011	I volunteered to ask my neighbors to donate to the ASDF when I was called (on the phone) by one of their reps.  Before sending out the envelopes I "goggled" some info.  From State of WA documents on ASDF and their contracted fund-raising companies.  From the data provided to the State of WA my calculations indicate that out of every dollar about 9 to 17 cents goes to the charity.  Looking at the ASDF web site does not indicate what the final funds are used for.
Autism Spectrum Disorder Foundation Inc	94251	21	/users/profile/108930	swede	Professional with expertise in this field	1	07/23/2011	As a social worker with  training in the Autism field, I have serious concerns about the legitimacy of this particular organization. They have never completed Better Business (BBS) forms for investigational rankings; they are a marketing company doing "Sweepstakes"mailings which are known for bilking (especially elder) consumers and only a fraction of what is taken in actually goes to 'donations' for autism related assistance, the rest goes to company executives salary. Check out CharityNavigator.comUsing the term "Autism" in it's name, allows it to be mistaken for other similar organizations who actually DO contribute substantial assistance for families struggling with autism. 
Autism Spectrum Disorder Foundation Inc	94062	8	/users/profile/108621	Tami	Client Served	4	07/19/2011	I direct a camp for children with autism spectrum disorders.  Due to the struggling economy, we have had more families who have found it difficult to pay for their child to come to camp.  It costs a great deal of money to run a high quality camp for this population.  It is hard for us to have to turn kids away.  This organization gave scholarships to 13 of our campers.  We have received the funds for all but the last few who applied and I expect to see those funds in the next week.  A family looking for funds found them and I have not done further research but we are thankful for what they did for our kids! 
Autism Spectrum Disorder Foundation Inc	88836	12	/users/profile/100353	Scottbadesch	Professional with expertise in this field	1	05/17/2011	This organization continues to appear to not wish to inform those it speaks to about the very high percentage of its funds raised that go to adminstration and fund raising.  Why don't they wish to disclose that inforamtion as others do?
Autism Spectrum Disorder Foundation Inc	68824	15	/users/profile/62691	marj	General Member of the Public	1	02/15/2011	We have received over 20 appeals from this organization in the last two months.  The only phone number is an 800 one.  We have left messages, but no one has called back.  From what I have read of this organization, it is less than reputable.
Autism Spectrum Disorder Foundation Inc	58649	30	/users/profile/62635	NPExec	Professional with expertise in this field	1	12/09/2010	I received a phone call from a person asking if I would send out letters to my neighbors to seek donations.  I agreed and they said they would send the materials.  Another person called a few days later to say thank you and confirm that materials would be sent.  I received a post card in the mail staing my materials would be coming.  This is where I was finally able to get some better details about the name of the org so I could do some research.  I looked at their 990 and in 2009, they brought in $1,200,423.   They paid $876,832 to telemarketing firm and another $203,227 to Precision Performance Marketing.  Salaries and other compensation to staff was $23,000.  Without doing much math, it is very easy to see that there is nothing left as far as funds for camp scholarships, assisting families or anything.  Additionally, the fact that they try to market nationwide and duplicate services that many local organizations do tells donors to not bother with it.  They do not provide any services that are unique or different than a local org would provide.  There is little to no direct services offered. 
Autism Spectrum Disorder Foundation Inc	57082	5	/users/profile/59945	Susan	Professional with expertise in this field	4	11/16/2010	I run a summer day camp for children with autism in Pensacola FL.  Yesterday, I got a call questioning the validity of this organization because of the neighborhood solicitaion program they have.  As I researched, I discovered they offer camp scholarships and so I emailed to ask about this program.  Less than 24 hours later, we have a promise of scholarships for our camp.  Michael also told me of many other programs and people they serve.  Check out their website for testimonials from many families all over the country.  I am thankful for ASDF.
Autism Spectrum Disorder Foundation Inc	54757	9	/users/profile/56539	Bill	General Member of the Public	1	10/14/2010	We've been flooded with abandoned telemarketing calls from this organization.  I  have been unsuccessful in reaching a live person, wither at the telemarketer that is the apparent source of the calls, or at the "Foundation."Looks like a scam.
Autism Spectrum Disorder Foundation Inc	54731	12	/users/profile/56500	Gianni	General Member of the Public	1	10/13/2010	I live in NY and a neighbor mailed me a request to donate to this organization knowing that we are very involved with our autistic grandson.  I do not find a lot of information on their webstie about their organization and no information about services in my state.  They seem to have catalogued services only in Idaho, Oregon and Washington to date.  The small print on their fundraising brochure lists Everett Washington as their location, but indicates that they have hired a fundraising organization in Akron, Ohio to solicit funds.  I have no idea if donating to this group would potentially help any autistic person, nor if services are available outside of the northwest US.
Autism Spectrum Disorder Foundation Inc	52594	14	/users/profile/53542	joe22	Volunteer	2	09/16/2010	I volunteered to distribute campaign materials on my street.  As a precautionary measure, I researched the "Autism Spectrum Disorder Foundation" in various online charity rating web sites.  I found several autism RELATED organizations.  But of the 4-5 sites I searched, your site (greatnonprofits.org) is the only one with any information on the specific group named "Autism Spectrum Disorder Foundation".  On your page, the mailing address is shown as Tulalip WA; the return envelopes provided to me show a PO Box in Hagerstown MD.  Illegal?  No.  Unusual?  I don't know.  Food for thought?  Yes, I believe so.

As it should be the animals always come first.I am an avid supporter and love my time visiting the animals.  The efforts they extend to make the experience for the visitors educational is exemplary.  Its nothing new that again and again is been shown there are so many out there that have no regard for animals as living and feeling creatures that deserve life without suffering or being used for profit.  It makes my heart happy to know every single animal at Black Pine will know nothing but the best care possible for the rest of their lives.     
Professional Animal Retirement Center	314639		/users/profile/405995	Lauren134	Volunteer	5	10/26/2016	The people at Black Pine Animal Sanctuary are among some of the most educated, dedicated, and passionate people I've ever encountered in the animal industry, and the behavior in the animals has a direct correlation with that! The enclosures are kept clean daily, and the organization within the facility is great! Top-notch organization!
Professional Animal Retirement Center	314589		/users/profile/405941	Abbey W.

They have some of the best community events (wine & beer tastings, silent auctions, etc) all while you get the chance to walk around the sanctuary.  When you talk with the workers you can definitely tell how passionate they are about what they do.

They have rescued numerous animals who otherwise would not be alive today.  
Professional Animal Retirement Center	256287	1	/users/profile/267121	Teressa J.	Client Served	5	09/10/2015	Black Pine Animal Sanctuary at Albion, Indiana is such a great place to visit and spend time with family.  They are very professional with their care of the animals in their keeping.  They think of new and exciting enrichments for the animals so they don't feel bored or lonely.  They inform all visitors about how the animals have come to them and advocate more humane treatment of animals through out the world.  I love to take my grandchildren here to learn about what they can do to help make sure that the mistakes of the elders do not continue to trickle down.  They learn that the animals that we share our planet with have rights that should be respected.  With the help of places like Black Pine, maybe the next generation will not repeat our mistakes.
Professional Animal Retirement Center	205034	1	/users/profile/267121	Teressa J.	General Member of the Public	5	07/02/2014	I have been to Black Pine many times, taking my camera with me.  Every time I share my pictures, more and more of my friends become enamored with Black Pine Animal Sanctuary.This year, my sister and I took my daughter, my grandson and his friend to this wonderful place.  I was a little worried that the boys (ages 13 and 12) would be bored, but the were not!  We went for a general visit and they both want to go back for a tour so they can learn more about the beautiful animals that call Black Pine their forever home.  None of these animals came from very good places in their past and it is just a joy to see them relaxed and contented in a sanctuary that caters to their needs, not to the public's needs.During this summer break from school, my sister plans to take my other grandchildren during the week for a tour.  I would like my son and his wife to also be able to go.  My son loves wolves and Black Pine has a wonderful pack.  If you are in the Northern Indiana area, it is worth a trip to see the magnificent animals that live their lives here, in safety and grace

Professional Animal Retirement Center	314510	1	/users/profile/405862	susan.haneline	General Member of the Public	5	10/26/2016	As a society we are staggeringly slow to adopt legislation to protect animals.  Because of this, there are far to many animals in urgent need of sanctuary.  BPAS is not a zoo, it is a forever home for animals who have been surrendered, abandoned, seized by law enforcement or acquired through other circumstances.  Many of their animals have lived in deplorable conditions prior to coming to BPAS.  They have been exploited, used for profit, breeding or simply been owned by private citizens that had no idea of the magnatitude of their care.  BPAS gives these animals the love, care, nourishment, and enrichment they deserve.  The staff is amazing, loving, knowledgeable and dedicated.  In addition to caring for these animals in need, they do so much to educate people.  I don't know anyone who has ever visited BPAS that has not been impressed with and moved by this extraordinary facility.

Professional Animal Retirement Center	314441	1	/users/profile/405798	whoahwhat	Volunteer	5	10/25/2016	Black Pine is a wonderful place with a great mission. As someone who visited and then volunteered there, it's an important place for folks who love exotic animals but may not be familiar with what it really takes to care for them. The staff here are working because they care about the lives of the animals here, enriching and improving them, and also about helping educate the public. The animals here may have come from terrible places, may have been cared for by someone ignorant to their needs and at BP they really finally find a home. 
Professional Animal Retirement Center	314438	1	/users/profile/405795	4444masyn	General Member of the Public	5	10/25/2016	BPAS truly cares about not only the animals but our community as well.  They do so very much with very little resources and money.  The volunteers and small paid staff put their hearts and souls into each day.  It amazes me how they do it and they do it very well! I am a proud supporter.

Professional Animal Retirement Center	314425	1	/users/profile/405783	angiegump	General Member of the Public	5	10/25/2016	Before visiting Black Pine Animal Sanctuary, I thought interacting with exotic animals seemed like a "once in a lifetime experience."...Then I learned the dark side of this type of "experience."  It has completely changed my view of animal life held in captivity.  BPAS does a fantastic job of moving the focus from "this is entertainment for me!" to "this is how the animals experience your 'entertainment.'"  What an eye opener.  I remember having an "uneasy" feeling going to the circus as a child.  BPAS put proof behind that feeling, when I couldn't put it into words myself.   What a gift...  We need this important message to reach as many children (and adults!) as possible!
Professional Animal Retirement Center	314415	1	/users/profile/405773	Mary476	General Member of the Public	5	10/25/2016	The staff of Black Pines really cares, not only about "their" animals, but about the treatment and protection of ALL animals.

These animals are so lucky, after being displaced, abused, abandoned!!! We actually do animal enrichment education and make sure that the animals indoor and outdoor cages are cleaned EVERY DAY, food, diets, medical all up to par...visitors comment that they expect it to be messy and smelly (with 100 animals) from turtles to tigers and bears...but not at BPAS... the volunteers and caretakers all the way from the gift shop attendant to diet makers and maintenance, the director and all the countless volunteers.... they all do this out of love for the animals... as do I... this is one place anyone needs to see and support...

We were hooked after the first visit and so fortunate to be only an hour away.  These animals all have a story that you hear by going on the tours.  We feel like we know each animal after several visits.  We follow their stories on Facebook and love seeing pictures of them.  We have attended several fund raisers, such as, Roar and Snore and Lions, Tigers and Beer.  The staff are so personable and you can just feel the love they have for the animals.  We recommend Black Pine to all our friends.  We are always looking forward to the next visit!

Professional Animal Retirement Center	314385		/users/profile/405745	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	10/25/2016	I have been visiting Black Pine pretty much since the beginning.  The staff, volunteers and interns are totally dedicated to ensuring the animals in their care are well taken care of and well loved for the rest of their lives. They continue to amaze me with their unselfish love and hard work. I'm sure a lot of those that visit BP will never see what all it takes to keep it going on a daily basis.  When one of the animals die, they feel a great loss no matter how long the animal has been with them. Black Pine will continue to be near and dear to us as they continue to strive to give each loved animal the best of the rest of their lives.

I have observed as any visitor would, plus worked behind the scenes.   Not to be overly sentimental, but I love this place.  The animals are special,  seen as individuals, and their welfare is of utmost importance.  One has the opportunity to see many species of animals (Primates, Carnivores, large Exotic Birds, Reptiles, and Farm animals) and often close-up--if the animal chooses to be close--and under safe conditions for animals and the public.  Anyone who loves and respects animals will enjoy a visit.   Anyone who cares about the treatment of animals will be touched by the stories of many of these animals and their past lives, and be thankful for their current home.

I did this because of my interest and affection for the animals. Each is an individual, and learning the stories of each animal reinforces that.   One generally has the opportunity to see the animals more "close up" than is often possible in zoos.   I started volunteering a year a half ago and my interest and affection has only increased.   Added to my feelings for the animals is my high regard for those who are keepers and volunteers.  The dedication of these people to the animals is a joy to watch and it only adds to my passion about BPAS.   I thoroughly recommend it as a great place for anyone who is interested in animals, particularly those who believe that animals have the right to be treated respectfully, have nutritious food, and appropriate shelter.   It is not a fancy facility but it is a caring facility.
Professional Animal Retirement Center	247031	3	/users/profile/36879	judy16	Volunteer	5	07/01/2015	I have regularly visited PARC (more widely known as Black Pine Animal Sanctuary) for 6-7 years because I find their mission of rescuing and caring for exotic animals vital to the needs of such animals who have been bred for personal gain with little or no concern for their well-being.  The touring has been most gratifying to see the animals so close and to learn their stories.   I feel so strongly about their mission that when the opportunity presented itself, I started volunteering last year.   I have only become more impressed with the care and respect the animal residents receive there.  It is a very worthwhile place to visit and support financially.
Professional Animal Retirement Center	205047	1	/users/profile/36879	judy16	Client Served	5	07/02/2014	I visit Black Pine Animal Sanctuary (current name) about once a month during their open season.  I always look forward to seeing the animals having "known" some of them for 5 years of visits.  New animal residents are always exciting to meet.  It is wonderful to see a  sanctuary where the animals come first--because it is THEIR forever home.   I thoroughly recommend it as a place to visit for anyone who loves and respects animals.  It is also a place that one feels good about helping with donations.  Donations is how they survive.
Professional Animal Retirement Center	152674	3	/users/profile/36879	judy16	General Member of the Public	5	04/05/2013	I've been visited Black Pine Animal Sanctuary, aka Professional Animal Retirement Center for 6-7 years and I've grown to love it more each year.  The animals that call it home have come from a variety of situations, some deplorable and others from caring homes--they just didn't belong in homes because they ARE wild animals.   The staff shares their stories, and their love and concern for these animals is obvious and contagious.  I don't see how  a visitor could leave the place without being touched and wanting to help in someway. The staff is mainly volunteer which says a lot about how important the mission of this sanctuary is.  They work so hard to make this place not a good place, but a great place.   BPAS rocks!
Professional Animal Retirement Center	126196	1	/users/profile/36879	judy16	General Member of the Public	5	10/16/2012	I have had the opportunity to visit PARC, better known as Black Pine Animal Sanctuary on about a monthly basis for 3-4 years.  As an animal lover and advocate, I am greatly appreciative of the fine work they do, caring for animals that needed a home for a variety of reasons.  I think it is amazing all they accomplish when most of their staff are volunteer.  I think it says a lot about an organization when it is able to draw so many volunteers to help--and help on a regular basis.  That is a labor of love.    BP also serves in educating their visitors to the plight of the individual animals and the animals they represent.    I recommend Black Pine as a place to visit, enjoy, and support.
Professional Animal Retirement Center	103008	1	/users/profile/36879	judy16	General Member of the Public	5	01/06/2012	Since I last wrote about PARC (better known as Black Pine Animal Sanctuary), much has happened.  More animals are now in larger enclosures and more animals have moved to their new "forever" home.  Instead of two black bears, there are now five and they will soon be moving into a new habitat constructed specifically for them.   Additional residents are a female cougar, three wolves, and a marbled fox.  The staff is still dedicated and work hard for the betterment of the residents.  It is a MUST for any animal lover who is in the area.    And there are now permanent bathrooms--the decor is another MUST see.
Professional Animal Retirement Center	36365	3	/users/profile/36879	judy16	General Member of the Public	5	04/21/2010	I have had some wonderful experiences at what I refer to as Black Pine (Animal Sanctuary).  I've visited it frequently in the last couple of years and am always excited when I turn down the last road and into the facility property.  The animals are so special and interesting.  Some are retired performers and others have been rescued from terrible situations.  There are quite a variety of animals, some farm and some exotics.  My favorites are the tigers and bears, but there are also lions, leopards, several species of primates, reptiles, various birds, etc.  Some of the older ones (Mr. Bear, Isaac, Caesar, India, Cody, Coby) have died in the last few years and I miss them all, but new residents are added when space and finances allow.  The staff are wonderful--only 2 are paid a salary and all the others are volunteers.  They are so dedicated and willing to share their love and experiences with the animals. For anyone in Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio (& anyone visiting in the area), who loves animals and their welfare should plan a trip there.  Their website is: http://www.blackpineanimalpark.com/

We were not disappointed.  The facility is nicely set up, for the most part easily accessible, very clean, and in a wonderful wooded setting.  The animals are obviously loved and we'll cares for by the staff.  The staff is knowledgeable, answers any and all questions asked and are informative on the 2 tours available.  There are nice rest rooms and two great covered picnic areas.  There is a wonderful gift shop with affordable, nice souvenirs.  I was beyond pleased with our experience and pleased to get to know the animals I have been seeing on Facebook for several years.  We will be going back again in the spring.  It was a wonderful experience!

My family love animals and you see a place like this helps to let the children see what needs to be done to insure that places like this continue helping.
Professional Animal Retirement Center	255993	1	/users/profile/344379	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	09/10/2015	This organization takes animals so that they can have a safe place to live out their lives in peace.  I donate when I can with supplies hat are needed.

Professional Animal Retirement Center	314355		/users/profile/405715	Chelsea27	General Member of the Public	5	10/25/2016	My family and I love Black Pine! We love being about to walk around the peaceful sanctuary and look at all the animals. The staff is so knowledgable and kind. It's sad to hear all the stories of the animals from before they were rescued but it's nice knowing they are well taken care of for the rest of their lives!
Professional Animal Retirement Center	314353		/users/profile/405714	Sally79	General Member of the Public	5	10/25/2016	They are a class act all the way. I love going to black pines and seeing the animals living out the rest of their lives happy, healthy and loved. Each animal has a story( usually sad and awful) , they work so hard to get the animals to where they are.  Will always support this organization.
Professional Animal Retirement Center	314349		/users/profile/344205	Lovintheup	General Member of the Public	5	10/25/2016	I have supported Black Pines in one way or another for years.     It is great to see animals get the chance to live out the rest of their lives in a safe place with lots of TLC. 
Professional Animal Retirement Center	255824	1	/users/profile/344205	Lovintheup	General Member of the Public	5	09/10/2015	Every animal has a story of how they came to live at Black Pines. The people running this place do it from their hearts to give these animals a safe healthy "rest of their life". So great to see animals happy and at peace.
Professional Animal Retirement Center	314348		/users/profile/405710	Writer	Donor	5	10/25/2016	Black Pine Animal Sanctuary is a wonderful true "for the rest of their lives" sanctuary for animals. The staff is very friendly and skilled and put the animals first, which is how it should be. The guided tour is very educational for everyone ages 5 -100. The staff and volunteers work very hard and do great work in what can be very heartbreaking and challenging circumstances. This is a wonderful nonprofit that should be the standard for other sanctuaries. Highly recommended! 
Professional Animal Retirement Center	314347		/users/profile/405708	Julie284	General Member of the Public	5	10/25/2016	My sisters & I have been going here every year during our family vacation  for the past few years.  We wouldn't miss it and now our young children are growing up going yearly too.  Amazing place, amazing staff.
Professional Animal Retirement Center	314346		/users/profile/405707	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	10/25/2016	For my best friend's birthday I planned a behind the scenes tour which was AMAZING! We both learned so much that day we still talk about it today.She said it was the best birthday gift ever!I love the idea of rescue animals which my husband and I rescue dogs and give them plenty of love.
Professional Animal Retirement Center	314345		/users/profile/405706	Deb_61	General Member of the Public	5	10/25/2016	We love Black Pine Animal Center. Great place and the volunteers know so much about the animals and their history. We went this October for a fundraiser and we are planning on returning next summer to see it again. If you haven't gone, don't overlook a fantastic place for wild animals to retire.
Professional Animal Retirement Center	314342		/users/profile/405703	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	10/25/2016	My parents use to take my son to Black Pine when he was young. He loved it there and has such great memories. He is now a senior in college studying zoology. He needed to complete a paper and the first place he thought of to study animals was Black Pine.  His goal is to work with big cats at a rehabilitation site. Black Pine started his love of animals. I feel so fortunate to have them in Northern Indiana. 
Professional Animal Retirement Center	314338		/users/profile/405698	Sandy127	Volunteer	5	10/25/2016	Volunteered there for 3 plus years, had to quit for personal reasons. That being said I have never seen a more committed staff volunteers and community that has helped give these animals the respect and the care that they deserve.
Professional Animal Retirement Center	314337		/users/profile/405697	Terri87	General Member of the Public	5	10/25/2016	Black Pine takes such great care of the animals and relies on donations. Everything is about the animals and the staff and volunteers are the best!
Professional Animal Retirement Center	314335		/users/profile/405695	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	10/25/2016	Fantastic animal sanctuary. They truly have the animals' best interests in mind and a lot of thought and heart goes into everything they do. I feel that the personal stories behind the animals really educate the public; get the guided tour at least once to hear the full versions from the keepers and volunteers. 
Professional Animal Retirement Center	314332		/users/profile/405692	lauram12	General Member of the Public	5	10/25/2016	Black pine is a wonderful place. Their animals receive the best care for the rest of their life. Not only that but they do wonderful work educating the public about the exotic pet trade and all the animals people try to pass as "domestic" and say make good pets.  I am thankful for places like this, even when it is sad they have to exist. 
Professional Animal Retirement Center	314331		/users/profile/405691	Gretchen20	Volunteer	5	10/25/2016	I started volunteering here several months ago, and it has quickly become a home away from home.  Black Pine is a gem here in the area, and everyone ive talked to loves it! The animals are given the best, most compassionate care possible, and allowed to live their lives how they wish within reason. Overall, brilliant place, brilliant people, and radiant animals! 
Professional Animal Retirement Center	295647	1	/users/profile/386430	Brendan9	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/12/2016	This sanctuary is a gem that deserves to be more well-known by the public and imitated by all other animal sanctuaries not just across the country but all over the world. The professionalism is like that of a major metro-zoo, but the humility, dedication, and intimacy offers what no other institution can provide which is, ironically, a more personal and human encounter with the animal residents. Black Pine Animal Sanctuary is place that has certainly "earned its stripes" and anyone with a passion for animals should make it their business to know about this park and not just their animals and history but also their message.
Professional Animal Retirement Center	295578	1	/users/profile/386363	Christine174	General Member of the Public	5	07/12/2016	I have always thought highly of what Black Pine does for their animals! I have known of them for 17 years and have just been amazed at the changes and the caring for the animals!! We always have a wonderful time when we go and take the grandkids or friends to visit! Number 1 on my list!!
Professional Animal Retirement Center	295527	1	/users/profile/386317	Cherie12	General Member of the Public	5	07/12/2016	We book a private tour. It was the best day ever!  We went behind the scene and learned about the diets , where it comes from, and how much they eat in a day.  During our tour our guide was full of information about each animal. They knew the animals history and the progress they have made since coming to Black Pine.  They know so much about the animals and really care about their well being.  I was so impressed at the way they always put the animals first.  The animals seemed (happy). I am so happy I got to visit and I cant wait until my next visit! I truly believe these animals are so cared for.  They are one big family. It fills my heart with joy seeing the animals cared for like they do.  I love animals more than anything and I stand behind everything Black Pine does. They are the best!!!

Professional Animal Retirement Center	256635		/users/profile/345028	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	09/11/2015	Awesome and caring staff. They share the funny stories along with the sad stories. It's impossible to tell who are paid and who are volunteers because they are all so dedicated.
Professional Animal Retirement Center	256542		/users/profile/344936	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	09/11/2015	They rescue animals from deplorable situations and ensure that they enjoy a wonderful atmosphere for the rest of their lives.

I plan on going back with my grandchildren on a regular basis .
Professional Animal Retirement Center	256344	2	/users/profile/150975	Bj__	General Member of the Public	5	09/11/2015	Black Pine is a forever home for exotic animals who can not return to the wild due to human actions.  These animals are given as close to natural habitats as possible, they are cared for and treated with dignity and respect.  The mission of Black Pine is the animals, their safety and allowing them to live out their natural lives as best they can given the impact human contact has had.  Many of their stories are tragic, but now they will be loved and cared for as the animal they should have been in the wild.  And this home is forever!!!  
Professional Animal Retirement Center	204070	1	/users/profile/150975	Bj__	General Member of the Public	5	06/26/2014	I have followed the awesome work of the staff and volunteers at BPAS for the last several years.  First learning about it when Lori Gagen accepted her job there and being curious about what had taken her from her current job and her passion about the animals.  Being an animal lover myself and a lifelong cat owner, it was only natural I would follow the BPAS story.   Not being able to visit BPAS since I am home bound at this time, I have so enjoyed the fantastic way the public is kept updated with social media.  From the move to the addition of animals, building of new habitats, various illnesses, some deaths, more animals, special programs, tours and so much more.  The public is part of BPAS story, the community is involved, even though I am not there, the names the organizations frequently are local, the vet, the construction crews, the winery for the night fund raiser.  It is a passion for all, to give the animals the best forever home they can.  The friends I have sent rave about the facility, and the fantastic experience their children had.  
Professional Animal Retirement Center	157427	1	/users/profile/150975	Bj__	General Member of the Public	5	05/08/2013	Although I am home bound I have followed the great work that BPAS is doing for animals on FB.  Their exceptional care and support for their animals is evident in how the facility has grown and expanded to meet the needs of the animals that come to them.  Whether it is a black bear coming from a concrete slab corn crib to a habitat where she can run and play and sleep in comfort on her own hammock or a pack of wolves reunited in their own habitat, or lions and tigers.  It is amazing to watch, the community involvement, the volunteers hours, the staff creative innovations to raise awareness not only of BPAS needs but also the universal needs of the exotic animal trade, raising our awareness of abuse and need for legislation to be passed.  With the use of social media and videos, we are kept very involved in their cause, forever homes for animals.  
Professional Animal Retirement Center	110910	3	/users/profile/150975	Bj__	General Member of the Public	5	04/27/2012	I am a Homebound person who has knowledge of Black Pine only through the Internet and knowing Lori from outside contact.  When she went to BPAS I became interested because I love cats, and have had one all my adult life as a pet.  I have learned so much about "exotic pets" through Lori's postings and the BPAS's website and activity on Facebook.  I then pass it on and share wtih my network as well.  Lori and BPAS are truly making a difference in our neck of the woods!!!
Professional Animal Retirement Center	256324	2	/users/profile/344727	Shane12	Client Served	5	09/11/2015	Black Pine is doing great things for these animals! I know a few people that volunteer there and they truly care for the animals there so much. 
Professional Animal Retirement Center	256311	1	/users/profile/344712	Catlvr5	General Member of the Public	5	09/10/2015	Black Pine: This animal sanctuary located in a small town does a BIG job in providing a forever home for its inhabitants.  It doesn't stop there either.   Its staff helps educate visitors about the animals and spreads the word using Facebook and other methods of how people can encourage lawmakers to pass laws that protect animals and stop cruelty.  The volunteers genuinely care about the animals in their charge.  Donations are put to good use at this animal sanctuary. 
Professional Animal Retirement Center	256225	1	/users/profile/151043	Chris58	Donor	5	09/10/2015	Black Pine's dedication and caring staff say it all!  They do so much with so little.

I wish I had more time to give them and help with their worthy mission.  They do so much good for so little.  Those people and volunteers are true unsung heroes.  I will continue to support them financially as long as I am able.

My kids are still talking about what they learned about the felines. It was very interestibg to stick around for the feedibg afterwards.
Professional Animal Retirement Center	256202	1	/users/profile/344596	JUDYmierau	General Member of the Public	5	09/10/2015	This place really cares about the animals they save and gifts them an environment as close to their native land as possible. True care givers.
Professional Animal Retirement Center	256175	1	/users/profile/344572	Sandy101	Donor	5	09/10/2015	I had heard of Black Pine for ages, thought it was a great charity and had donated a few dollars here and there if something crossed my newsfeed. I had seen a picture on another friends page of a tiger and then started looking through the other pics, ended up just liking the page because I love animal pictures.     FINALLY we went and I cannot say enough about how cool the experience was. We went to see a tiger get a bubble bath. It was so wonderful and they loved it and they would bite at clusters of bubbles and you are so CLOSE. The environment blends in so well and it's all so Nature Lodge-ish and then here, you're 6 feet from a sleeping lion. The stories behind the animals the caretaker told as she took us around, they were fascinating. We've been back since several times and will continue to come back forever! Plus, can I say, for grown-upsI think it's way more engaging than the FT Wayne Children's Zoo and WAY less expensive for a much more intimate experience!
Professional Animal Retirement Center	256147	1	/users/profile/344543	ffarmer	Donor	5	09/10/2015	I was so impressed with this little sanctuary with a big heart. Animals seem happy, volunteers knowledgeable and caring and a very important role being filled.  Wonderful place
Professional Animal Retirement Center	256145	1	/users/profile/344541	Writer	Client Served	5	09/10/2015	Black Pine treat each and every animal  that they have given a forever home to as their own. They learn as much as they can and provide them anazing enclosures that are as close to their natural habit that is possible. Everyone working will answer questions from anyone and be happy to help. This is a place I have been going since I was in middle school and now at 32 take my son. Such a positive place. 
Professional Animal Retirement Center	256126	1	/users/profile/344519	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	09/10/2015	Love taking my kids to experience these animals "up close".  The tour is so educational for them, but fun so they don't realize they're learning!
Professional Animal Retirement Center	256113	1	/users/profile/344506	Afoltz	Volunteer	5	09/10/2015	I volunteered here a few years back with my college Purdue University North Central. To this day, I mention Black Pine to anyone and everyone that I can. It was a wonderful experience for me to volunteer and I got to do some things I never expected I would have done. It gave me a new outlook on certain animals as pets, as well as animals used in circus shows and the like. Even today with my middle school students- we read an article about bringing wolves back into wildlife and their near extinction in 1997. I told them all about Black Pine and how yes baby animals can be cute and fuzzy, but most people with those same cute and fuzzy babies end up dumping them or getting rid of them because they are not qualified to take care of them when they are older. Thank you Black Pine for educating me for life, even though I was only there for one day! 
Professional Animal Retirement Center	256109	1	/users/profile/344502	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	09/10/2015	Black Pine is such a wonderful alternative to our local zoo. I enjoyed my visit immensely, learned quite a bit about the animals and the sanctuary, and can't wait to go back for a guided tour and bring the little ones!

From the keepers, to the venue and of course the animals they care for, it is a wonderful, inspiring place!  Hearing the animals stories and seeing how each habitat is created for the most positive life experience for them is incredible.We are blessed to be able to visit this fabulous home to many of our favorite animal species!

Professional Animal Retirement Center	256022	1	/users/profile/344411	jaknerr1	General Member of the Public	5	09/10/2015	This is the best animal sanctuary that I have ever been to....make it a point to go there at least once every year, tours are very informative and see animals that normally we would not see...Personally don't believe wild animals should be caged up, but unfortunately not everyone believes this, and then can't take care of them properly. Thank god for Black Pine. Their animals are very well taken care of and have a forever home where they can be wild like it was intended.
Professional Animal Retirement Center	256007	1	/users/profile/344393	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	09/10/2015	I love visiting and seeing the animals.  They always appear so much happier than animals in a  Zoo.
Professional Animal Retirement Center	255994	1	/users/profile/344380	Sandy100	Client Served	5	09/10/2015	Black Pines Sanctuary is a first class operation.  They spend the time and care to make sure every guest is educated on where the animals came from, what medical conditions they have due to previous treatment and how they are being helped now to live out the rest of their days in this wonderful sanctuary.  Black Pines is in a wooded area to keep the animals shaded and every animal has a shelter in his cage.  They do a wonderful job for the animals.  
Professional Animal Retirement Center	255972	1	/users/profile/344358	Pati M.	General Member of the Public	4	09/10/2015	Helping animals that would otherwise have nowhere to go is fantastic.
Professional Animal Retirement Center	255971	1	/users/profile/344357	Writer	Donor	5	09/10/2015	I had heard of the Black Pine Animal Sanctuary for a number of years but for one reason or another, had never been to see it.  Then a couple of years ago, I took my grandchildren there and was amazed at the work they were doing there for the benefit of the animals! Having always been an animal supporter, I became a donor to this facility.  They are truly concerned about each of these rescued animals and give them wonderful care and surroundings in which to live out their lives!
Professional Animal Retirement Center	255940	1	/users/profile/344324	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	09/10/2015	We love Black Pine Animal Sanctuary. My daughter was a summer intern and now volunteers there. We have been to many sanctuaries around the United States. Black Pine is by far the best. They have beautiful grounds and enclosures. All animals are well taken care of and loved.

These individuals care so much about the animals that they receive the best care that can be given.  They try to give them decent living quarters for both warm temps & middle of winter.
Professional Animal Retirement Center	106324	3	/users/profile/143317	Jody9	General Member of the Public	5	02/12/2012	I am an animal lover that hates to see wild animals being raised by regular individuals that find out later in life there's a lot more to it than being a cute animal.  At Black Pine they have taken these animals in that cannot be put into the wild & have given them a lot of love & care in their handling.  They take great care in the animals they have received over the years.  Black Pine is a facility that I have great respect for in many different areas.

You can see in their expressions the compassion and love that they have for these animals. I would rather take my kids here then a guided tour then to a expensive zoo. 
Professional Animal Retirement Center	255906	1	/users/profile/344288	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	09/10/2015	My husband and I like to go to "zoos" and have been to many different types. Although Black Pines in no way is a zoo, it showcases their animals, birds and reptiles very nicely.  In fact, in a lot of cases, better than many other places we have been.  The park is new with new enclosures and more being built all of the time.  All enclosures and the general area is spotless and very well kept. There is a picnic pavilion and they welcome picnics brought in for your groups enjoyment. I would highly recommend spending a day at Black Pines as often as you can and get acquainted with all of its residents.  They will quickly become friends and you will want to check in on them regularly.

Each time we visit we learn something new!

We all really enjoyed the visit and had no complaints.  The tour was very down to earth and informative, the animals looked very well cared for and loved and appeared healthy and happy in their environments.  The facilities were clean and well laid out and the people were friendly.  We enjoyed having a small picnic lunch and purchased a few souvenirs in the gift shop.  Loved getting up close to many of the animals and would like to return to take a feeding tour someday.

They provide an awesome service for the community by teaching us about the plight of animals taken away from their natural environment and placed as "pets". They care for the animals when the owners find themselves unable to provide proper care  in a home setting. They also take animals rescued from poor conditions . In short, they are teaching our young people to take responsibility for our planet and wildlife while providing a place where animals can be seen.

Each animal has a story and the staff is always willing to share.  We were pleasantly surprised how active all the animals were. We enjoyed spending time watching them.

They all have their own personalities which I love to share with guests. I plan to help out there as long as I am able to. I highly recommend this facility to anyone who wants an amazing learning experience whether through visitation or volunteering. 
Professional Animal Retirement Center	219306	2	/users/profile/68701	-RKO-	Volunteer	5	10/02/2014	I have been a volunteer at Black Pine Animal Sanctuary for five seasons; in all those years, I have NEVER - NOT ONCE - heard a negative comment about Black Pine from any of our visitors. Visitors leave here absolutely mesmerized by the facility, its phenomenal staff, its legion of volunteers, and its 100 exotic animals. Those who criticize this excellent organization obviously have their own agenda (usually a profit motive) because Black Pine does an excellent job of caring for animals that have been neglected, abandoned, mistreated or abused - often by private owners. Black Pine also excels in educating people about the "pros" and "cons" of keeping an exotic wild animal as a pet, or as a 'product' to be used for one's own comfort, convenience, pleasure or profit. Tigers, lions, leopards, primates, reptiles, bobcats, wolves, and even exotic birds thrive at Black Pine because of the ultimate care and attention they're given, often having come from tragic circumstances. Black Pine takes no government funds or taxpayer dollars; it is supported strictly from it admissions revenues, private donations and the sale of merchandise in its gift shop. An occasional grant or generous individual or corporate donation helps Black Pine expand, but its resources are limited and the staff does a superb job of managing its nickels, dimes and quarters. If you want to observe something truly, genuinely focused on caring for unwanted animals, I invite you to visit Black Pine before we close at the end of this month. Black Pine is open Saturdays on Sundays through October from 10 -3. There's no political agenda, no protests or 'preaching'; Black Pine is a compassionate, caring facility where neglected animals come for "the rest of their lives". Any true animal lover will recognize Black Pine for the superior work it does. Not for profit......all for the animals. 
Professional Animal Retirement Center	157400	3	/users/profile/68701	-RKO-	Volunteer	5	05/08/2013	Tucked away in the sleepy little town of Albion, Indiana lies one of Midwest America's best-kept secrets. The Black Pine Animal Sanctuary (BPAS) is a non-profit organization that remarkably cares for about 95 exotic animals that have been confiscated, abandoned, neglected, mistreated or abused. From South American macaws and cockatoos to reptiles, primates, llamas, bears, tigers and lions, BPAS operates on a "shoestring" budget with only one full-time paid employee and two part-time paid staffers. All the rest of the people you encounter at Black Pine are volunteers, absolutely dedicated to the care and welfare of the animals who come to BPAS "for the REST of their lives". Black Pine is a 'retirement home' where animals aren't sold or traded; they don't breed animals or exploit them for commercial purposes. Nestled among acres of tall pine trees, it's the perfect setting for all these beautiful creatures. My personal 'favorite' (if I absolutely had to pick just 'one') is "Betsy", a tiny black bear who suffered at the hands of an atrocious practice called "bear baiting". Betsy was chained to a post so her owner could charge his hunting buddies to release their dogs and teach the dogs how to 'attack'. Defenseless, and unable to escape the torment, Betsy now suffers traumatic injuries: she's blind, crippled and endures permanent trauma from years of unspeakable abuse. Black Pine has been able to provide Betsy (and five other black bears) comfortable surroundings, appropriate medical care, and a healthy diet, so that she now enjoys an excellent quality of life. The staff, Board and volunteers at Black Pine live by one simple motto: "our animals come first". I implore you to plan a 'road trip' this summer to visit Black Pine; it's an experience you that will tug at your heartstrings, and make you appreciate the value and importance of exotic animals to our planet! 
Professional Animal Retirement Center	152597	1	/users/profile/68701	-RKO-	Volunteer	5	04/05/2013	Quietly tucked away in a sleepy little town lies one of the best-kept secrets in northern Indiana. Black Pine Animal Sanctuary (BPAS) is home to about 90 exotic animals, all of whom have been abandoned, abused, mistreated, neglected or confiscated by authorities. From tiny little reptiles like Louie, the bearded dragon, to Mufasa, a handsome 562-lb. lion, BPAS is where these animals come "for the rest of their lives". The sanctuary is a 501c3 non-profit organization that does not trade, sell or breed any animals. Think of Black Pine as a 'retirement home' for these animals, none of whom can ever be returned to their wild, natural habitats, and none of them who would want to go back to the lives they endured before coming to BPAS. Albion, Indiana is a village of a few thousand citizens. Yet, this tiny community gives Black Pine its full, unwavering support and commitment. Without its many volunteers (many of whom live in or near Albion), the one full-time and two part-time paid staffers would never be able to continue in their mission, fully dedicated to the health and well-being of this band of unusual animals. You'll meet 'Peaches', a cockatoo who has gained national notoriety for her 'colorful' vocabulary. Thanks to an enormously generous donor, Black Pine now houses six beautiful black bears, including little Betsy, who was once used as 'bait' in a 'bear baiting' arena that left her blind, crippled and in need of constant medical attention. Nala, a gorgeous 20-year-old African lioness, was a young cub in a private home before becoming Black Pine's first permanent big cat resident. Gus the gator started his life in a college dorm where students kept him in the dormitory's bathtub until Gus outgrew it, and had to be given new quarters at Black Pine. Chui and China were only a few weeks old when they came to Black Pine, victims of the multi-billion-dollar illegal exotic animal smuggling trade. You'll thrill to the spectacular sight of our nine - yes, nine! - tigers! Situated on 18 acres of elegantly wooded property outside of town, BPAS has gradually, over the years, become recognized as a leader in the "business" of rescuing these exotic animals from the hands of neglectful 'pet' owners, or have suffered untold abuse at the hands of people putting profit before humane treatment of these creatures. As a volunteer tour guide (and a member of the Board of Directors), I have come to appreciate BPAS as one of the leading exotic animal sanctuary in the United States. In fact, many experts in the field have told us that they consider Black Pine to be one of the very best sanctuaries in the country. This spring, or summer, take a leisurely drive to rural Noble County, Indiana and see for yourself what a learnign adventure your visit can be! Black Pine takes no government money or taxpayer dollars; it relies strictly on money from gate admissions, donations, and sales of items in our gift shop. From Memorial Day to Labor Day, the sanctuary is open to the public from 10-5 seven days a week. If you come up on any Sunday morning at 11 o'clock, I'll personally give you a guided tour and you can 'meet' our residents and hear their stories, some humorous, some interesting, some tragic. For more information, visit www.blackpine.org. We've had guests from almost every state in the Union, as well as England, China, Canada, New Zealand, and other parts of the world. Where ever you're from, please know that you're welcomed anytime (even during the winter by appointment). So, if you find yourself in northern Indiana with a little time to spare, be sure and visit Albion, Indiana and the Black Pine Animal Sanctuary. There's a quaint little bed-and-breakfast nearby, and many others things to do in the immediate area. 
Professional Animal Retirement Center	125995		/users/profile/68701	-RKO-	Volunteer	5	10/16/2012	Professional Animal Retirement Center, d/b/a Black Pine Animal Sanctuary, takes in exotic animals that have been abandoned, confiscated, neglected, mistreated or abused. Our 85+ animals include lions, tigers, black bears, gray wolves, red foxes, primates, reptiles, exotic birds, 'pasture' animals (donkeys, llamas, pot-bellied pigs, etc.) and spotted leopards. Experts in the exotic animal field have told us we're one of only four or five such sanctuaries in the U.S.A. where they would even consider bringing an animal. With the exception of one full-time paid employee and two part-time employees, all others at the sanctuary are volunteers. I've volunteered as a tour guide for three years, and also serve on the fund-raising committee and the Board of Directors. As with many of our volunteers, this has become a 'passion' for me as we take these desperate animals in for the "rest" of their lives. We don't swap, sell, trade or breed animals; Black Pine is their 'retirement' home, and they're all well taken care of by our platoon of volunteer veterinarians. For more information, please visit our website: www.blackpine.org. Also, see the Fort Wayne (IN) Journal-Gazette's 'Metro' section of today's paper (10/16) for a front-page report on the two tigers that were just moved to Black Pine last Sunday (and two more are arriving next Sunday). We take no taxpayer dollars or government funds, relying strictly on volunteers, admissions, gift shop purchases and donations - large or small. Voted one of Indiana's top ten "summer gotta do" road trips, Black Pine is a stimulating, educational and inspiring experience for animal lovers of all ages. Come see us whenever you're in the northeastern Indiana area! 
Professional Animal Retirement Center	62831		/users/profile/68701	-RKO-	Volunteer	5	02/03/2011	Black Pine Animal Sanctuary in Albion, Indiana (www.blackpine.org) is an awesome 'retirement' home for exotic animals that have been abused, mistreated, neglected or abandoned. With one paid full-time employee and one part-time employee, there's still a desperate need to feed and house the 80+ animals that reside here. Tigers, lions, llamas, reptiles, chimpanzees and exotic birds all make up the population of this remarkable refuge, staffed primarily by dozens of volunteers dedicated to the care and protection of these animals. As a volunteer 'tour guide', I have told these animals' "stories" to countless visitors, all of whom walk away with a better understanding of the plight of these animals - and so many more like them around the nation. I urge you to consider gifting Black Pine with your $5000; it would be a worthwhile investment, just as my volunteerism has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life!! Thank you!
Professional Animal Retirement Center	205782		/users/profile/268033	joeexotictv	General Member of the Public	5	07/12/2014	This place is scamming the public for tens of thousands of dollars to rescue animals from who? Private owners,Think about this for one minute please, are they not a private owner who started out with one cat and found that being non profit is a way for you to fund their hobby? And they want to take your pets away but they can keep theirs.
Professional Animal Retirement Center	205373		/users/profile/267525	topcatsroar	Professional with expertise in this field	1	07/08/2014	I am extremely disappointed in Black Pine Animal Sanctuary-The mission stated here has changed to suit the need to find new donations from Animal Rights Extremists-They encourage boycotts and bans on animal ownership now-This is a political agenda.They themselves rather hypocritical by having tours and allowing people to roam the facility-This is considered 'exploitation of animals' yet state they are against anyone else doing the same.Apparently, it's now all about the money and not the animal at this facility-Extremely disappointed. I give it -0- stars but required to give it a rating and the only reason I gave it -1- star.Attacking others on FB does nothing to help a single animal.
Professional Animal Retirement Center	205008	1	/users/profile/267092	tracyskye	Client Served	5	07/02/2014	I just took my girls to the Black Pine Animal Sanctuary and we left with huge smiles. This place is awesome. The animals are wild and beautiful and it's a much more intimate view of animals vs. going to a zoo. I have such admiration for the people for work and volunteer there and place like it. We also visited the gift shop which had the cutest items to choose from for reasonable prices. This year we decided to visit Black Pine instead of renewing a zoo membership and we are SO glad we did. We'll be visiting Black Pine from now on. 
Professional Animal Retirement Center	204993	1	/users/profile/267074	Angela93	General Member of the Public	5	07/02/2014	This will be out 3rd year visiting this great place. My grandson knew a lot  of the animals names at 3 yrs old. It's much more up close and personal than a regular zoo. The staff is great. We love visiting every year. It's our "birthday trip" this yr. What a great service all of you provide.

Professional Animal Retirement Center	204135	1	/users/profile/266155	Chad9	Client Served	5	06/27/2014	Great place. Obviously the staff and volunteers care for the basic needs of the animals, but what is fascinating is how the organization goes above and beyond meeting basic needs. They find ways to give quality life to animals that have lived most of their lives in a cage performing for human entertainment.   Beyond the needs of the animals, the addition of Black Pine has been a huge benefit to a small town. In some ways, it has put Albion on the map! 
Professional Animal Retirement Center	204035	1	/users/profile/266061	MommyJoJo	General Member of the Public	4	06/26/2014	I have been  enjoying  Black Pine for many,  many years. Each year they amaze me with their growth and improvements to the Sanctuary. As long as it is necessary they will be there lovingly caring for and protecting those animals that for some reason became unloved and unwanted by their original family. Lori and everyone at Black Pine pour their heart and soul into each and every animal each and every day. It was a very rough winter and yet all the volunteers and staff kept their focus and love on each precious being in their care. I praise the staff and volunteers so much for all they do. We donate supplies when we can and will continue to do so as long as they are needed. Please know that this wonderful place deserves all the help and support it can get.    Thank you, Mary Jo Schaaf.
Professional Animal Retirement Center	203985	1	/users/profile/266019	Angie42	General Member of the Public	5	06/26/2014	We went to Black Pines animal sanctuary a few years ago with our children.   It is a fantastic place to visit, the animals are very well taken care of.  The staff is very knowledgeable of the animals and truly care about all of them.   I would highly recommend a visit!  We can't wait to return and see the animals. 
Professional Animal Retirement Center	203864	1	/users/profile/265906	Carol150	General Member of the Public	5	06/26/2014	Just visited and took the tour of The Black Pine Animal Sanctuary last week.  My daughter had always wanted to visit and made donations to them so off we went.  What a positive and enlightening experience.  We were so impressed.  First class operation.  The animals are well taken care of and just beautiful.  I was very surprised as to how many years the parrots had lived there and how some animals came to live there.  I only live about 15 miles from there and it sure is one of our community's best kept secrets.  The staff and workers who were interning there were very knowledgeble about all the animals.  A must go.  You get to se the animals up close and personal.  They are so happy there..  Thank you to the sanctuary for caring for them.
Professional Animal Retirement Center	203858	2	/users/profile/265900	daveb62	General Member of the Public	5	06/26/2014	Our son moved to Fort Wayne which is about 1/2 hour from Albion. We found out about the sanctuary through a brochure he received. The first time we visited we wanted to go to the sanctuary. We weren't going to take the guided tour even though it is suggested. When we got there we decided to take tour and were very glad we did. We learned more from our guide in that visit than we would have in 25 trips to a zoo. The knowledge they have of their animals is amazing and the love they have for the animals is evident every step of the tour. Everyone there was friendly and knowledgeable We can't wait until we can visit again, this is definitely going to be a regular stop for us and our son liked it so much he got the year long admission deal. 
Professional Animal Retirement Center	203816	1	/users/profile/265862	animallover1298	General Member of the Public	5	06/26/2014	They are a dedicated, top notch professional group.  I have been there and see the care they take of all of the animals.  Their spaces are clean and well cared for.  They have a heart and do all they can for these animals.  
Professional Animal Retirement Center	157389	1	/users/profile/208725	Lilac2012	General Member of the Public	5	05/08/2013	THree of us visited Black Pine for the first time last weekend.  It was a very enriching and heartwarming experience.  All the animals looked so well taken care of and "at peace".  I can tell that this sanctuary is truly a positive place for these animals to live!
Professional Animal Retirement Center	153153	1	/users/profile/204004	CindyOB	Donor	5	04/07/2013	Black Pine is an excellent refuge for the animals they take in "for the rest of their lives"!  The staff and volunteers are extremely dedicated and caring-it takes special people to give of themselves as they do every day of the year.  I love visiting Black Pine and it is an exceptionally fun and learning experience!   Please donate to this very worthy facility-your donation will be appreciated and used responsibly!  
Professional Animal Retirement Center	153048	1	/users/profile/203904	sarratorej	Donor	5	04/06/2013	I have been a donor to Black Pines for the past few years.  I LOVE visiting this incredible animal park and wish I lived closer so that I could join the amazing group of volunteers there.  To realize that there are only 3 paid staff at this facility is mind boggling!  The animals are cared for beautifully and loved unconditionally!  I love hearing the stories about each animal and knowing that they have such a wonderful home for the "rest of their lives".
Professional Animal Retirement Center	153021	1	/users/profile/203878	Jenny37	General Member of the Public	5	04/06/2013	LOVED my visit to Black Pine!! Everyone was super friendly and very informative. I believe in the job they are doing and definitely support them! I will be back and will refer friends and family to visit.
Professional Animal Retirement Center	153017	1	/users/profile/203875	cmt018	General Member of the Public	5	04/06/2013	When you arrive at Black Pine and walk through the gates you can feel the caring and love for the animals. It truly is a sanctaury. There is an air of peace there. 
Professional Animal Retirement Center	153012	1	/users/profile/203870	Brenda39	Donor	5	04/06/2013	Black Pine is an exceptional exotic animal "rest home" and very different from other places you may have stopped.  This dedicated staff build shelters as needy animals request a home.  Located in a gorgeous pine woods, you'll find a group that really knows how to stretch a dollar and market their location with out of the box techniques.  Definitely worth a stop when you are in the area! 
Professional Animal Retirement Center	153010	1	/users/profile/203867	Kris11	General Member of the Public	5	04/06/2013	Several years ago I did a search for a big cat sanctuary near enough to visit and came across Black Pine.  It's a 3 1/2 hour drive and well worth it!  The staff are well versed in the life histories of the animals, and have a real passion for taking the best care of each animal in their care.  The number and variety of animals there has grown as well as the facility in the years I have been a visitor, but it's still the big cats I enjoy the most.
Professional Animal Retirement Center	153004	1	/users/profile/203864	Footloose	Donor	5	04/06/2013	Black Pine Animal Sanctuary adopted our red-footed tortoise, "Footloose".We loved him dearly, but he outgrew his enclosure and we knew for him to be happy, he needed a lot more room.  In the summer he would stroll around a large deck where we gave him free reign, but in the winter, the big wading pool we had for him just wasn't big enough.  I know this may sound a little strange for a tortoise, but Footloose loves people.... When we came near him, he would bob his head showing he was glad to see us.  At Black Pine, Footloose has interaction with kids through their education sessions.  He is so happy and has grown much bigger in his large enclosure.We will always be grateful to the wonderful folks at Black Pine for giving Footloose not only a great home, but also a "job" that he loves!Black Pine puts the animals they care for first.. Folks get to enjoy them, but their well-being supersedes all else.  We are so proud and happy that our little buddy is in their capable hands!  It's no wonder Black Pine has been awarded "Top-Rated Charity for two years running.  Let's help them make it three!!!
Professional Animal Retirement Center	153002	1	/users/profile/203862	spymanspy	General Member of the Public	5	04/06/2013	we take deer over to them when we can. recently i had the chance to talk with them. they took the time to explain the park and thier mission. i have never seen such passion to take care of the animals. each animal is treated as if it was a house pet.  with that kind od love and compassion they can't be beat!!!
Professional Animal Retirement Center	152994	1	/users/profile/203847	Roxy2013	Client Served	5	04/06/2013	I cannot say enough about the good works of Black Pine Animal Sanctuary. The staff and loyal volunteers are an amazing group of individuals. My first interaction with BPAS was in the fall of 2012. I desperately needed to find a home for a domesticated fox who could no longer remain with her owner. BPAS helped me through the process and eventually gave this little fox sanctuary within their facility. For this fox it was her last shot at a decent life. I will always be grateful for the kindness shown and the professional manner in which transitioning this fox to BPAS was conducted. I continue to maintain close contact with Black Pine and follow them on Facebook and via their website. They are a fine organization in which I support every chance I get. They truly care about their animals. I will be making a sixteen hour trip this month to pay BPAS a visit. It will be worth every mile.

Professional Animal Retirement Center	152982	1	/users/profile/68527	barb smith	Board Member	5	04/06/2013	Wnen I first started attending events at Black Pine I was amazed at how many volunteers dedicated hours every week to helping at Black Pine.  As I heard the stories of why each animal was at Black Pine I had a whole new respect for all that has been accomplished there.  Last year we were asked to take on a group of tigers that would have been hard to place and through the hard work and determination of many people and the financial support of so many people we were able to say yes to bringing all 4 tigers to Black Pine, so they can live out the rest of their lives surrounded by people that love and respect them.  With the help of staff, volunteers and supporters we will be able to continue to help even more animals live out the rest of their lives in comfort.  I am proud to say I am now a part of the Black Pine "family" and look forward to helping our close to 100 animals, birds and reptiles for the "rest of their lives".
Professional Animal Retirement Center	126066		/users/profile/68527	barb smith	Board Member	5	10/16/2012	I have never worked with any not-for-profit organization that has been so focused on doing what is the best for the animals who need the help the most.  It is sometimes easy to place domestic animals with a loving family, but who can take care of the "exotics" with all their special needs?  Black Pine is one organization that ALWAYS puts the best interest of the animals first and will go that extra mile to make sure these animals are well cared for, and most importantly, well loved for the rest of their lives.  The community, the people, the volunteers and the very small staff work tirelessly 365 days per year to make sure these animals are well fed, comfortable and loved....and sometimes it is done on a shoestring and a prayer.  I highly recommend Black Pine as an organization that is good for the soul and for the heart.
Professional Animal Retirement Center	62680		/users/profile/68527	barb smith	Board Member	5	02/03/2011	Black Pine is such an inspiration on so many levels-from being a savior to animals in need of rescuing or needing a home, to being the "heart" of so many volunteers and neighbors.  The organizations, staff and volunteers that keep Black Pine alive are truly amazing in how they can do so much with so little.  It is obvious that the animals are well taken care of and truly loved which makes their final years comfortable and comforting.  I highly recommend that everyone take just one trip to Black Pine Animal Sanctuary and I can guarantee you will be "hooked"....

Donor	5	04/06/2013	I gather meat that ny friends have that us getting old in their freezer  and make a trip or two every year.  I can't think of another facility like Black Pine close to my area.  The service they provide is so needed, they help the animals and all the people that enjoy seeing happy animals.  I think they are very creative in their fund raising, I attend ad many events as I can, and have introduced many of my friends to the Black Pine experience.  I also donated to their silent auction, and will every year.
Professional Animal Retirement Center	152584	1	/users/profile/203546	Runkle	General Member of the Public	5	04/05/2013	I have known about Black Pine for years. Yes they do a fantastic job and the animals are very well cared for. The staff is the best. But I wanted to say that because of the pure passion of each of the staff and Board members that is why it works so great. Each person has to have a passion to care for these wild creatures of the earth. It is not an easy job. The staff makes it look easy and no work to it but the daily cleaning and the daily feeding and the general care of each animal is something the general public does not see. They don't see how each volunteer and staff member thinks of things to enrich the animal's life on a daily basis. There's a lot behind the scenes that is not praised and known about and these people do a fantastic job. Thank you to all that make this happen. That includes the Board memebers , staff, and the donors and alas the visitors each year.
Professional Animal Retirement Center	152428	4	/users/profile/203427	Jill41	General Member of the Public	5	04/05/2013	Six years ago, my daughter volunteered at Black Pine. They were still in their old facility and operating on limited resources, but their caring and kindness toward the animals was very evident in everything they did. Later, when they moved to the new, larger facility, things got even better for the animals that they care for so much. These animals, each with a story that could break your heart, move to Black Pine, and they are loved and cared for for the rest of their lives. It's a wonderful thing!
Professional Animal Retirement Center	152258	2	/users/profile/203322	akrouse	Volunteer	5	04/05/2013	Wow, this place rocks.  I have been helping out there for two years now.  They take awesome care of the animals and provide careful training to all the volunteers to keep everyone safe and happy. I drive 75 miles one way to work all day for free and I am happy to do it because of the way the staff treats everyone.  They stretch every dollar to the max while still making the sanctuary a beautiful place to visit and comfortable for the animals.  This place far exceeds some of the zoos I have been to. I can't say enough good things about it, but I think you get the point by now.

Professional Animal Retirement Center	152173	1	/users/profile/203275	Treasured M.	General Member of the Public	5	04/05/2013	What an amazing place to take children or for adults to visit!  You get a close up, guided tour of beautiful animals who are loved and well cared for.  I live in the same town and we are proud of BPAP!  I am so glad there is such a wonderful group of people who are willing to go above and beyond taking care of animals for "the rest of their lives."  I remember when Black Pine was started 1/4 mile down my road.  Their growth and move to a larger location is a testament to the good work they are doing.  Way to go!!

Professional Animal Retirement Center	148263	1	/users/profile/171623	Denise29	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/19/2013	When the State of Ohio changed its exotic animal laws, we reached out to Black Pine to help the four remaining big cats at our sanctuary, and provide them sanctuary with quality care for the rest of their lives. They stepped up to help us & the tigers, and they were moved to Black Pine in Oct. 2012 with the help of many other devoted supporters, the new enclosures are now under construction, and hopefully by spring will be completed, and the tigers will be able to enjoy living the remainder of their lives! We are excited for Sammie, Delilah, Taz, & Ticha as they and all the animals at Black Pine deserve to live their lives with peace and happiness! Thanks to all the staff, volunteers, and those who have donated to this great cause! We look forward to many, many visits, and volunteering with the animals!
Professional Animal Retirement Center	126616		/users/profile/171623	Denise29	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/17/2012	Black Pine Animal sanctuary is well on its way to excellence in Exotic Animal Care, & Rescue. They have a wonderful Staff,  great  people running the Facility, and the animals are happy & healthy. It takes allot of dedication, heart, soul, & hard work, and they have proved that! Now they have stepped up once again to take in four tigers, and help out a fellow rescue facility in Ohio that had no other options but to find new homes for the animals they have rescued and cared for many years.This shows their capabilities as a organization, to go forward in helping animals in need, to the best of their ability, and paves the road for others in the future!
Professional Animal Retirement Center	137500	1	/users/profile/183488	thehelp.line	Volunteer	5	11/12/2012	Thank goodness there is a place like Black Pine!  My sister and her husband were in dire need of finding an appropriate home for a beautiful little fox, and Black Pine came to the rescue!  I hear that it is a quality facility with top-notch staff.  I hope to visit there this spring.  As an animal advocate myself, I want to thank Black Pine for what they are doing to provide excellent habitats for their animals and excellent care for them.
Professional Animal Retirement Center	132544		/users/profile/178190	Andy O	General Member of the Public	5	11/01/2012	Black Pine has been very supportive in our efforts to place a domesticated fox in need of a home. I plan on visiting Black Pine for the first time this weekend and very much appreciate their willingness to help a stranger with a little fox who desperately needs a home. My wife and I have searched the country for months looking for someone to help us and Black Pine is going to do just that. There is no way we could ever express our gratitude for their help. 
Professional Animal Retirement Center	129206	2	/users/profile/174571	Alexandra M.	Volunteer	5	10/25/2012	Black Pine Animal Sanctuary will always be a part of who I am. In the fall of 2010 I began volunteering with Black Pine Animal Sanctuary, knowing little of what this non-profit was going to offer me! After graduating from college, I was still looking for the right career path, and found Black Pine as a place to escape the never-ending job search. After giving several school field trips/ private tours (to generous donors), learning more about the need for exotic animal sanctuaries, joining the fundraising committee, and familiarizing myself with the animals (of course) and staff, I began to see Black Pine as an opportunity! I started my Internship in December 2010 and was given many opportunities to learn more about non-profit management, fundraising, and donor relationships. I learned so much in this short time and cannot thank the volunteers and (Lori Gagen) for their knowledge and support! After my internship ended, I still continued to volunteer and applied for the part-time keeper position. In August 2011, I began my short career at Black Pine and will never forget the lessons and memories given! The staff and volunteers at Black Pine Animal Sanctuary are all hard-working, amazing individuals! The facility itself is very exceptional. The animals come first, their care consist of clean waters, diets (keepers very informed on what is best for each animal), clean habitats, medications, spacious and enriching living quarters, but most all unconditional love! I wish I could spend as much time as I had at Black Pine, and savor each moment I get to go back! Please support Black Pine Animal Sanctuary! 
Professional Animal Retirement Center	128518		/users/profile/173689	Julie85	General Member of the Public	5	10/24/2012	Our family LOVES Black Pine along with all of the staff and volunteers. Each family member has their favorite animal to visit each time we go. We always learn something new while visiting and love that the animals are all rescued and well cared for as they live out the remainder of their lives. 
Professional Animal Retirement Center	128200	1	/users/profile/173341	Paul67	General Member of the Public	5	10/23/2012	I have been there to photograph the animals at BPAS. The animals are truly cared for in 5 star way. The care takers are caring, responsible & provide what these poor animals need for the rest of their lives. Since these animals cannot go back into the wild. BPAS is the best place for them! Thank you to BPAS for all that you do! ~Paul
Professional Animal Retirement Center	128183	2	/users/profile/140093	Kelly28	General Member of the Public	4	10/23/2012	The compassion Black Pine and Lori showed a great private owner here in Ohio told the story all on it's own.  We all have our own piece of the mission to carry out in this life, but these folks out did themselves.  After countless hours of research on a whole lot of sanctuaries, and asking a million irritating questions, I found that Black Pine will be well worth the 3 hour trip to visit.  This home for animals works on a fraction of the budget as it's peers, and they do the job better than a whole lot them.  They deserve the kudos, well wishes, helping hands, and donations.

It was an amazing experience to see these animals in such a loving and well managed setting.  We plan to financially support the organization for many years to come as well as visit the animals as often as possible.  I highly recommend this organization for your consideration as you look for opportunities to make a difference in the lives of very special animals.
Professional Animal Retirement Center	127796		/users/profile/172897	Bernadette B.	General Member of the Public	5	10/22/2012	A beautiful "mission," a beautiful setting, beautiful animals .  Very encouraging to see the devoted care and enrichment given these wild animals, their wild natures are respected, not Used for sensationalism.  I know the paid Staff is minimal, and pour far more hours and energy of their lives than you can imagine, and the Sanctuary relies on many great volunteers  They operate frugally with their funds to enrich the animals habitats & lives.  Visitors can get so close (but safe) to see them!  The Staff share such interesting info, and compelling sad backrounds of the rescued residents. 
Professional Animal Retirement Center	127403		/users/profile/172457	Jackie22	Volunteer	5	10/20/2012	I work as a "volunteer" in the course of my employment as a clinical Rehabiliation Service Provider for children with emotional and learning disabilities.  In this capacity, I have worked with children in this wonderfully therapeutic setting known as Black Pine Professional Animal Retirement Center.  The children learn to care for the animals by preparing their diets, provide enrichment activities for the animals, and learn to understand commitment, responsibility, and to better identify their own feelings.  Feelings?  Yes, feelings!  Simply misting the tropical birds on a warm summer's day, helps a child understand what doing something nice for someone means.  That's right - a happily chirping Macaw helps a child learn this important fact of life. In this same way, the Cockatoo that moves away from the gentle spray of water is saying "I don't like this."  Again, the child learns.  I have a child client who created her own Black Pine scrap book.  This simple scrapbook is now a part of her toolbox of coping skills; she keeps it with her at all times and this helps her deal with crippling anxiety.  When she is at the Park, she blossoms and this carries over into her life outside as well.  Another child (in foster care) was blessed with a person visit to the wolves; simply calling to Nanook and having Nanook respond to him is  a memory he is so proud of - something he can call his own.  There is no better therapy.
Professional Animal Retirement Center	127371		/users/profile/172417	Stacy10	General Member of the Public	5	10/19/2012	It's been a while since I've visited Black Pine since I no longer live in the area but no matter how much time passes, I will always remember my experiences there. Every single member of the staff was polite and helpful and obviously cared very deeply for all the animals at the sanctuary. All the animals had adequate space and it was easy to see they were well fed and well taken care of. I had the pleasure to go on the feeding tours several times and will be forever amazed at the trust the animals showed the staff when they entered many of the enclosures to feed the animals up close and personal. A mistreated or abused animal, in my opinion, would never show that level of trust especially around meal times. It's too bad there are not more places like Black Pine for these animals to go. Hopefully they will be around for many, many years to come so they can continue the amazing work they do in helping these animals live out their lives in a warm and caring environment.
Professional Animal Retirement Center	127357		/users/profile/172403	Margaret O.	General Member of the Public	5	10/19/2012	Black Pine Animal Sanctuary has been an enormous help to me in my effort to care for a domesticated fox who's owner could not care for her. I have corresponded numerous times with them either asking for advice on nutrition or some other type of guidance. Always Black Pine has given me excellent information and showed that they genuinely wanted to help me. I have contacted many sanctuaries over the last few months but Black Pine has by far been the most helpful and professional.  I am so glad there is a place like this where these beautiful animals can live out their days with the kind of care and excellence this facility provides. My husband and I visited Black Pine last weekend and we were very impressed. It was a lovely area and the animals were clearly well cared for. The staff and volunteers were extremely helpful as well. We are all very fortunate to have Black Pine.         
Professional Animal Retirement Center	126881		/users/profile/171904	Dianne Lengerich	Donor	5	10/18/2012	I have volunteered at Black Pine Animal Sanctuary for over 8 years and have been a Board member for over 6.  I have seen the organization struggle and grow, meet adversity and over come it.  The passion of the staff and volunteers both is incredible.  The support they have received for their mission has been constantly increasing as they continue to educate the public.  I have volunteered for many nonprofits and have never experienced the energy, passion, and dedication that is present at Black Pine 
Professional Animal Retirement Center	126815		/users/profile/68658	Terry R	Volunteer	5	10/18/2012	I have volunteered for this organization for 17 years.   It is absolutely the most caring facility I have ever been associated with.    Black PIne cares for these exotic animals "for the rest of their lives" and the animals show us trust and caring in return.    It's absolutely amazing the bond Black PIne volunteers have with these animals, especially considering some of the horrible conditions some of them have had in the past.   I highly recommend this facility to everyone.
Professional Animal Retirement Center	62791		/users/profile/68658	Terry R	Volunteer	5	02/03/2011	I have been a volunteer at Black Pine Animal Sanctuary for 15 years and have personally witnessed many truly amazing miracles with the  exotic animals we have rescued.  Animals that had been previously mistreated by humans show us how forgiving and trusting they can be while in our care.   Black Pine is a one-of-a-kind truly wonderful sanctuary.
Professional Animal Retirement Center	126512		/users/profile/171531	James52	General Member of the Public	5	10/17/2012	I highly recommend visiting, donating to, or volunteering at Black Pine Animal Sanctuary.   It is an amazing organization with a wonderful staff.  When visiting it is quite obvious how much the volunteers care for the animals and understand their needs.  They also are great with educating the public on animal behaviors and dangers of exotic animal ownership.
Professional Animal Retirement Center	126452		/users/profile/171473	kstaats	General Member of the Public	5	10/17/2012	My parents volunteer at Black Pine and they love it.  My mother helps with the animals and my father helps with maintenance.  They have some amazing pics and stories.  It is a great place for animals, they get the proper care and an environment that suits them well.  The animals are well cared for and loved by all the staff and volunteers.  The next time Im home, I cant wait to go help out as well :)   
Professional Animal Retirement Center	126438		/users/profile/171459	jillreneemanns	Client Served	5	10/17/2012	Our family watched the documentary, "The Elephant in the Living Room." We are about 2 hours from Black Pine and decided to make the trip with our 4 kids. We all enjoyed the tour, facility and learned a lot that day.  We are planning more return trips! 
Professional Animal Retirement Center	126311	1	/users/profile/171352	IndianaGrrl	Donor	5	10/17/2012	Each time I go to Black Pine I am immediately struck by the wonderful, caring people working and volunteering at the sanctuary.  I overheard and saw so many moments of true passion for animals as I walked along the paths to visit with the animals. To me, it's especially telling when you hear a center staff/volunteer "chatting" with tiger/bear/Tarzen when no one is looking! The animals at Black Pine are truly in a loving environment that gives them the honor and care they deserve!
Professional Animal Retirement Center	126303		/users/profile/171347	ilikedirt21	General Member of the Public	5	10/17/2012	My children love Black Pine. The level of care and love for the animals is extraordinary. My daughter has an obsession with foxes and wolves and this is one of the only places in northern Indiana she can see both of those along with other exotics!
Professional Animal Retirement Center	126277		/users/profile/171326	sookie951	Volunteer	5	10/17/2012	I visited off season last year for my birthday and based on the atmosphere and hearing why many of the animals had been placed here I immediately inquired about volunteering. Shortly after that I met with the director and have been hooked ever since. I drive almost an hour to get there. I work late nights at my job yet look forward to going in to volunteer each week even though Im tired. I started in the middle of winter yet dont mind working there in freezing temperatures or sweltering heat. Thats the unbelievable part. Everyone does it and gives their all for those animals. We truly love and care for them. When one gets sick or injured we worry as if its a family member. Alot ofbyloodsweat and tears is collectively put into our sanctuary. 
Professional Animal Retirement Center	126239		/users/profile/171298	Amy_43	General Member of the Public	5	10/16/2012	I was so impressed by the facility and staff who completely knew the personalities of the animals and care for them.   The respect  for the animals is evident.  Just awesome!
Professional Animal Retirement Center	126085	2	/users/profile/136127	Kati3	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/16/2012	I have worked in the animal field for 17 years now.  Through all of my Vet Tech work, work in zoos, wildlife centers, and other animal related industries, I can not think of a better place to receive the award as a great nonprofit!  The 2.5 paid staff members and team of volunteers are amazing and put the care of the animals first!  They have a huge community that supports them as much as Black Pine supports its community!  They are also trying to help on a state and federal level with the laws regarding exotic animal ownership.  The director went to OH to testify during their making of the new laws recently put into place.  So, it's not only the animals that call Black Pine home that this organization cares about, it's all animals.  They are also helping other organizations with training!  Having the members of the Tri-state CART exotics team come to our sanctuary to learn and train on what to do and how to handle situations with escaped exotic animals and how to transport them safely with out the danger of sedation.  I can't say enough good things about this organization!  Working with Black Pine staff and volunteers has been life changing for me!  They deserve to win this great award!
Professional Animal Retirement Center	126011		/users/profile/171129	Brad11	Volunteer	5	10/16/2012	Excellent place! Professional, well run, nothing but the best in mind for the animals! I can't imagine a better sanctuary for these exotic animals that have been taken out of their element. My wife and i just got involved and plan to do so for a long time. 
Professional Animal Retirement Center	125915		/users/profile/68550	Robin	Board Member	5	10/16/2012	PARC is a last chance home to several animals that people can no longer maintain on their own.  Several of the animals were originally pets to owners who did not understand that you cannot keep them in your home.  The staff is well educated and provide the best care possible to the animals in the sanctuary.  When taking a tour of the park the staff educates people on the animals they are seeing and how it came to live at the park.  It is a wonderful place to visit for all ages.  Be sure to visit soon.
Professional Animal Retirement Center	62700		/users/profile/68550	Robin	Board Member	5	02/03/2011	I have allways enjoyed visiting the Park and seeing how well the animals are taken care of and how much the staff enjoys the day to day care of the animals.  I was encouraged to join the Board of this organization in the initial start up when it became a nonprofit and I continue to serve on the Board because I feel that exotic animals should not be kept as pets and they deserve to have the best life possible and I feel the Park provides this.
Professional Animal Retirement Center	125815		/users/profile/151051	Kimberley R.	Donor	5	10/16/2012	Black Pine does so much to help animals who have nowhere else to go...We love to visit and see all the progress they've made since their move from the original location.  This past week they took in 2 new tigers.
Professional Animal Retirement Center	110979	1	/users/profile/151051	Kimberley R.	Donor	5	04/27/2012	Black Pine serves such a wonderful purpose and helps so many animals in need.  They also try to teach people that exotics are WILD animals and not 'pets'.  I hope that someday there is no need for such places to exist, but while they are needed, I'm SO glad Black Pine is there.  The staff and volunteers are always helpful to visitors and truly care about the animals.  
Professional Animal Retirement Center	111424		/users/profile/69997	ernurse	General Member of the Public	5	05/04/2012	BPAS is a wonderful facility. They take such good care of their animals, allowing them to live comfortable lives. BPAS educates the public about these animals. My children first visited in 1996 and it has been fun to see how BPAS grows and cares for the animals.
Professional Animal Retirement Center	64030		/users/profile/69997	ernurse	General Member of the Public	5	02/06/2011	Black Pine Animal Sanctuary is a wonderful place for the animals and the visitors.    They really care about their animals.   They provide unique programs for the public to learn about the animals.  We first went to BP when my teenagers were toddlers.  This sanctuary is a treasure in our area.  it is wonderful to have them so close. 
Professional Animal Retirement Center	111019	1	/users/profile/151098	Amy_18	Volunteer	5	04/28/2012	Black Pine Animal Sanctuary is a really great place to visit and volunteer! The animals there are well cared for and well loved. It is also encouraging to see the recycling program along with the constructed wetland septic system. 
Professional Animal Retirement Center	110995	1	/users/profile/151067	barbarajo	Board Member	5	04/28/2012	I am so proud of everyone who does so much for all the animals that are fortunate enough to get to spend the rest of their lives at Black Pine.  Except for a very small staff, the sanctuary operates 365 days per year with hours and hours of volunteer time.  So many people are involved in helping our animals.  The whole sanctuary is build piece by piece, using the natural environment as much as possible.  We reuse as much as we can and try to keep the habitats as close to natural as we can. It is a beautiful little place tucked away in rural Indiana.  I am proud to help this sanctuary as much as I can.
Professional Animal Retirement Center	110986		/users/profile/151058	lajohnston	Client Served	5	04/27/2012	BPAS is a wonderful place for families! The staff explain everything about the animals!! I have been there a few times and have learned something new every time! I would suggest that everyone go atleast once!
Professional Animal Retirement Center	110983		/users/profile/151055	Linda72	General Member of the Public	5	04/27/2012	I have visited Black Pine twice and never felt that I was in the way. The staff are passionate about careing for the animals and sharing with the public the importance of conservation and protection of the wild animals.  Their education program is outstanding and interesing.  I love going there. If I didn't live so far away I would be a volunteer myself. 
Professional Animal Retirement Center	110976		/users/profile/151048	Janelle '.	General Member of the Public	5	04/27/2012	BPAS is a wonderful organization full of selfless people.  It is obvious their hearts are deep in the interest of caring for animals in need but even more for the education of the public about exotic animals.  The volunteers offer a wonderful habitat for the animals they take into their care with fun for the animals and also health needs.  The recent story of the team that worked together to extract impacted teeth for Mufasa (the lion) and for the chimpanzee was amazing!
Professional Animal Retirement Center	110970		/users/profile/139501	abbyo46528	Volunteer	5	04/27/2012	Black Pine is a wonderful organization that makes a life changing difference in the lives of misplaced exotic animals.  Not only do they try and make a difference in the animals lives but also in their own community by recycling and the use of a constructed wetland-natural septic system.  Everything is always put to good use at Black Pine and I am very proud to be a part of it.
Professional Animal Retirement Center	104085	1	/users/profile/139501	abbyo46528	Volunteer	5	01/21/2012	Black Pine is a very special place that I am very proud to be a part of.  Their organization provides a safe healthy place for these rescued animals to live out their lives.  A nice balance of public education without exploitation of the animals.
Professional Animal Retirement Center	110900	2	/users/profile/150959	Julcole	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/27/2012	I completed an internship about 5 years ago at black pine animal park. Now I'm an education curator at a small zoo  I love to visit and continue to see the incredible improvements. My co workers are also impressed with black pine's success. The difference the staff makes in these animals lives is remarkable. Black Pine is a must see for any animal lover. 
Professional Animal Retirement Center	110895		/users/profile/69932	tgoegle	General Member of the Public	5	04/27/2012	I have visited Black Pine Animal Sanctuary many times and I am amazed at the amount of care that goes in to taking care of these rescued animals. I can tell the staff genuinely loves and cares for these animals and I can't imagine where these animals would be if it were not for Black Pine. They do such a wonderful job also of educating the public  on the plight of exotic animals and the danger of owning one. I cannot recommend Black Pine enough. 
Professional Animal Retirement Center	63973	1	/users/profile/69932	tgoegle	General Member of the Public	5	02/06/2011	I have been to Black Pines many times, and each time I go,  I am amazed at all of the hard work that goes into caring for these animals that otherwise would not have a home. They have a wonderful group of volunteers that genuinely care for the animals, along with their minimal staff. I can tell all of the hard work is done out of love for these animals, and without Black Pines, these animals would still be suffering. In addition, the wonderful education that is done concerning the sad life of exotic animals that are kept by humans, is so needed. There are so many people that do not realize what goes on with these animals that are kept as pets, or for "show", and Black Pines brings attention to this problem. I admire everything they do for these animals and thank goodness for Black Pines Animal Sanctuary. 
Professional Animal Retirement Center	110892	1	/users/profile/150952	Christine32	General Member of the Public	5	04/27/2012	I've now been to Black Pine on several occassions and each time I come away more impressed with the professionalism of the staff and volunteers.  While the animals are obviously the main attraction, the grounds and habitates are lovely with lots of room for the inhabitants. The staff/volunteers are friendly and very knowledgable about the animals in their care; they can not only relate specific stories about each animal but also provide a lot of information about the breed in general.
Professional Animal Retirement Center	110891	1	/users/profile/150951	Wayne10	General Member of the Public	4	04/27/2012	I love Black Pine for the service that they provide to the animals they protect. They also educate the public and provide a safe environment for the animals and the public.
Professional Animal Retirement Center	110890		/users/profile/150950	Jaleablade	Client Served	5	04/27/2012	Went with my daughters preschool class and the staff were very good with them and understanding if there lack of patience. This is a GREAT place for young children or anyone really to learn about excotic animals in the wild and how u are suppose to take care of them.
Professional Animal Retirement Center	110888	2	/users/profile/140224	AnimalsMatter	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/27/2012	Black Pine has partnered with dedicated volunteers, local refuse service companies, and visiting educators to provide recycling services on site to encourage good stewardship and GREEN living!  The animals enjoy natural habitats.  Organic waste is composted daily.  The sanctuary's septic system features one of only a handful of constructed wetlands for natural, organic breakdown of waste.  BPAS is GREEN!  Bravo!
Professional Animal Retirement Center	106384		/users/profile/143667	JeanneRaines	General Member of the Public	5	02/13/2012	I love visiting - it was such an up close experience in seeing the animals, and the care that is tendered them is so very clear.  I intend to see much more of this place.
Professional Animal Retirement Center	106326	1	/users/profile/143320	felix1140	General Member of the Public	5	02/12/2012	My husband and I LOVE Black Pine! The animals' health and safety and happiness come first and foremost and that's good to see. Everyone involved with Black Pine is friendly and knowledgeable and visiting is a pleasure. We try to go every year, and it's exciting to see the place grow. 
Professional Animal Retirement Center	102877	1	/users/profile/136138	Kris4	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/04/2012	Black Pine is a must facility with some of the most dedicated volunteers and board members I have ever seen in this profession!  I share their beliefs and I am continuously amazed at how much they sacrifice to save animals of all different taxa.  A wonderful facility that will always be close to my heart!
Professional Animal Retirement Center	65097		/users/profile/71159	jrknep01	General Member of the Public	5	02/08/2011	I make it a habit to visit Black Pine Animal Sanctuary as often as possible!  The animal caretakers have done a wonderful job to care for the individual needs of the animal residents.  Animals that have been horrifically abused and/or neglected are given a loving home at Black Pine where they can finally thrive in environments that are painstakingly constructed by staff to meet all of their needs.  Staff are extremely knowledgeable and friendly to guests, making the sanctuary a pleasure to visit.  I love to listen to Peaches the cockatoo talk, watch Tarzan the chimp "make monkeys" out of young and old visitors alike, and watch Joey the graceful Patagonian cavy wander around in her enclosure.  
Professional Animal Retirement Center	64416		/users/profile/70432	Anne	Volunteer	5	02/07/2011	I would like say this about Black pine  Animal Sanctuary.  I have seen other parks and so called sanctuary, But Black pine tops  them all. The volunteers  here are very nice and very caring to the animals, I love coming to help out ware ever I am need. Being the up close to the animal that you only see on  TV is very special.. Watching some of the animal grow up from baby Chui & China & Cita   & Jai. And get to playing with some of the animals.

Love going there and helping ware ever I  am need and love taking there pictures for them of the animals. I think the sanctuary deserve any help or a  ward   for  helping the animals that people have been mean  or  abandit . 1-10 I put this  Sanctuary  up  to 11. Here is some pictrue.Thank you Anne
Professional Animal Retirement Center	64079		/users/profile/70048	Hardings001	Volunteer	5	02/06/2011	Black pine is the most caring and nurturing animal sanctuary I have ever been to.  The people here are outstanding and are always willing to do anything for the greater good of the animals.  I just started volunteering with Black Pine a few weeks ago and I already feel like I am part of the family.  Because of all of the wonderful work these volunteers do, the animals are ALL happy and healthy.  I could not imagine a better place to spend the rest of my days.
Professional Animal Retirement Center	64056		/users/profile/70023	Zoe F.	Volunteer	5	02/06/2011	I live this place.  They honestly love and care about the animals.  They are intensely committed to providing the very best care possible for the animals.  
Professional Animal Retirement Center	64045		/users/profile/70009	Patrice K.	Volunteer	4	02/06/2011	Known as Black Pine Animal Sanctuary, PARC is dedicated to providing permanent homes for captive raised exotic animals of all kinds.  Birds, primates - great apes and monkeys, tigers, lions, reptiles, as well as farm animals that need homes.  The second and equally important part of their mission is to educate people about the care required by these animals and that they are not meant to be pets.  To accomplish the education part of their mission they are open to the public for a nominal fee, providing guided tours by dedicated volunteers who share the sometimes tragic stories of their charges.  Supported by entrance fees, a few annual fundraisers, and donations from local corporations, with 1 paid staff member and approximately 40 volunteers, they make sure that the animals never lack for proper shelter, food, medical care, and mental and physical stimulation.  For a small facility they do a remarkable job, and I am proud to be associated with them.
Professional Animal Retirement Center	64041		/users/profile/70007	Michelle E.	General Member of the Public	5	02/06/2011	I have visited the park for the Halloween visit they put on. The animals are very well taken care of, they are in good health, have the proper housing and the volunteers are very knowledgeable and caring.  They provide a wonderful place for exotic animals that would otherwise have to be put down (as they were before they came into existence) as the previous owners lacked the proper facilities, knowledge or expertise to keep them, neglected or abused them- or were tossing away an animal they had because it could not do the job it was purchased for.
Professional Animal Retirement Center	63965		/users/profile/69924	mfan5	General Member of the Public	5	02/06/2011	I have watched Black Pine grow from a very small almost farm type setting to what they are today.  This has taken place because of all of the wonderful people involved.  There are dedicated staff to take care of these animals.  I have also witnessed how the volunteers handle the death of their beloved animals.  This is more than a "zoo" type of organization, it is a group of truly involved dedicated loving people taking care of animals who NEED and deserve the love and care provided to them.  I am proud to say I am from the same area!  These animals are treated as if they were their own pets or even part of the family.  Bless them for taking the time and effort.
Professional Animal Retirement Center	63963		/users/profile/69922	Grm Siri	General Member of the Public	5	02/06/2011	My first time visiting Black Pine was when my grandchildren were little and BP was in their old facility. How magical it was for the little ones as well as for me! Not only a place of refuge for retired, neglected, abused or unwanted animals, it is a terrific resource for our entire area. We all came away "full" and carrying our favorites of the BP "family" with us. When one of the grandchildren grew to high school age she become a volunteer and loved every minute of her time with the staff, other volunteers, public and especially all of the critters there. I know that she would still be there volunteering if she hadn't become so busy with work and studies and such things. BP is not only a refuge but an asset and source of pride for the wider community.  Many of us suggest it as a place to visit for anyone new to, or visiting the area and others follow the BP news on their Facebook page. A  true source of both the teaching of compassion and animal rescue work as well as alerting those on Facebook to urgent needs of other beings needing rescue or situations that may need changing. Thanks to the BP family and extended family for all you do!
Professional Animal Retirement Center	63958		/users/profile/69916	Yvonne Bressler	Client Served	5	02/06/2011	We visited Black Pine this fall at their Halloween festivities for the first time. It was a wonderful park! We were able to see the animals closer than our traditional zoo and learn their history. The people who worked there were very friendly and took time to discuss each animal. The park offers so much for the community, not only to assist the exotic cast aways but to enrich the lives of our community members by showing compassion for their animals and promoting responsible pet ownership. My family as well as anyone who will listen to me will be visiting Black Pine and supporting Black Pine for years to come! Thank you Black Pine for all you do!
Professional Animal Retirement Center	63799		/users/profile/69742	sftaylor	General Member of the Public	4	02/05/2011	At Black Pine it's personal. From the gift shop to the map and the tour, PARC involves you in the lives of the animals. You get to know them, their names, their stories. It makes you want to go back and see how they are doing. And with Black Pine it's personal. They are trying to work themselves out of a job, advocating for exotics who should stay in the wild, and educating the public to stop the senseless practice of having exotics as pets. For Black Pine patrons it's personal as well. One thing I really love is that you can trade their "wish list" items for entry into the sanctuary. It gets the public more deeply involved and shows that it's all about the care and welfare of the animals.
Professional Animal Retirement Center	63713		/users/profile/69656	Dianne	Volunteer	5	02/05/2011	Black Pine Animal Sanctuary offers an opportunity to meet exotic animals, learn their stories, and understand the enormous need for sanctuaries and the need for regulation of the private ownership of exotics.  Get closer than ever to a lion, tigers, bears, a chimp, monkeys, birds, reptiles and more.  It is an experience that you will never forget.
Professional Animal Retirement Center	63533		/users/profile/69465	Jim B.	Volunteer	5	02/04/2011	It was back in 2006 when my family and I visited Black Pine for the first time. I was so impressed with the animals and the way they were cared for, that I know I wanted to be a part of it.             After talking to one of the volunteers I decided to volunteer. What  started out "just for something to do on the weekends" has turned into more than I could have ever imagined. Now that I put in more and more hours.   OK enough about that.            At Black Pine you will get closer than you probably have ever been to the big cats. We pride ourselves on trying to show every guest what we do and what we are about. After all we could not do what we do without guest's in the park.          Black Pine takes in all kinds of exotic animals, most of which are from people how just can't care for them anymore. We do are best to inform people of  what it takes to have these animals as pets, how long some of them live, and what cost are involved in feeding them.          Well anyway you need to just come out and see for yourselves, spend the afternoon with the animals.  Also during the summer we have feeding tours in witch you can observe most of the animals being fed.   It's a great time.                     Thank You And I hope to see you there. 
Professional Animal Retirement Center	63270		/users/profile/69176	kimberly	Donor	4	02/04/2011	We have visited Black Pine on several occasions including preschool field trips.  Every visit has been wonderful.  Black Pine provides a guide for groups who explains the organization and tells about each of the animals you see.  From my experience, our children gain a ton of knowledge and compassion for animals because of the extra care Black Pine gives to each visitor.
Professional Animal Retirement Center	63165		/users/profile/69058	ellisonme	Volunteer	4	02/04/2011	Well there is so much to say about Black Pine Animal Park. The goal of this sanctuary is to help and care for animals that are abused, mistreated, or were just to much for their said owners to take care of. As a small example of a rescue is the black bear Wrigley. She was abused terribly. She has so many problems I could write this entire letter about them. However to move things along she was basically chained to a tree and mercilessly attacked by dogs trained to hunt bears. And their are countless cases of abuse and sadness present and past. But when their nightmares are over, they are sent to Black Pine Animal Park, where they will live the rest of their lives, not having to worry about when their feed next, if they will have clean water, or whether or not they will be properly taken care of medically. However Black Pine is not perfect we still have many flaws. As the economy becomes tougher we are not able to continue making permanent habitats for the animals where they will be able to walk, run, and feel like more than an animal in time out.  Not all the animals at Black Pine Animal Park come with a terrible tragic story. But they all deserve a good home.
Professional Animal Retirement Center	62908		/users/profile/68784	bubbadylan	General Member of the Public	4	02/03/2011	A wonderful non profit that exists for the care of animals from circus life, abused lives, etc.   They provide neat programs such as overnight stays with the animals, unique fundraising, field trips for our local school children.  Education is a key component.  The zookeepers are highly dedicated to the care of the animals and the safety of all.  Great location
Professional Animal Retirement Center	62817		/users/profile/68689	AcornNut	Volunteer	5	02/03/2011	Black Pine Animal Sanctuary is a wonderful place for both visitors and animals.  I love the personal care the animals get there.  I also volunteer at a local zoo and the care is not as personal there.  Visitors get up close and personal and everyone knows the names of the animals.  You just get a better respone out of the animals when they know their name and you use it when talking about them.With only one full-time employee and one part-time employee they do wonderful things for the animals.  Volunteers are valuable and have a lot of responsibility.I recommend this place to everyone!

They do a wonderful job with limited resources. I encourage anyone to go there and observe what they do for animals and become educated about the problems that many of their rescued animals face. Without dedicated individuals and organizations like theirs, many animals would die or have no where to go when their owners grow tired of them or cannot handle them any longer. They deserve recognition, admiration and whatever resources can be awarded to them for their valiant efforts!
Professional Animal Retirement Center	62747		/users/profile/68600	Robert	Donor	5	02/03/2011	Our first visit to the Black Pine sanctuary was very surprising.  We had a day off and wanted to go somplace close to home but have never been before.  So we went to Black Pine!  My mother-in-law has never seen tigers, lamas, giraffe, or the beautiful birds!  Mom is 84 and was very excited to actually be able to touch some of these animals!  The joy on her face was priceless not  to mention my wife's as she observed her mother enjoying the "wild" animals. The facility is beautiful and very family oriened.  Anytime we have a day to get away, we go to Black Pine.  Thank you to the staff and volunteers who keep this wonderful facility tip top!  
Professional Animal Retirement Center	62721		/users/profile/68572	KallieCoe	Volunteer	4	02/03/2011	I've been volunteering there off and on for over a year. The people that work here are very dedicated and have the animals best interests at heart. They brave all the elements just to make sure every cage is clean and all the animals have food. In the time I have been there they have made huge imporovements on their outdoor enclosures for many of the animals. One of their major issues is that they are way understaffed.
Professional Animal Retirement Center	62716		/users/profile/68567	sabrewer	Volunteer	5	02/03/2011	I am a former volunteer for the Professional Animal Retirement Center (PARC). and I can tell you that there is not a more dedicated, caring, professional nor conscientious group of people than the staff, interns and volunteers at PARC. The work these individuals put into ensuring that all the residents of this facility are not only well taken care of, but PROPERLY taken care of, is without equal.  No matter the season or the weather, these animals are provided with food, enrichment and observation on a daily basis; along with superior veterinary care. PARC is not a place where these animals go to live in obsurcity, rather, it is an educational facility where the staff, volunteers, and interns pass on their knowledge to others; helping to ensure that future generations understand why wild/exotic animals are not meant to be kept as pets or for show.  Although I can no longer volunteer due to my current geographic status, I live in NC, I continue to support and promote this impressive organization for the reasons mentioned above and many others too numerous to detail here.
Professional Animal Retirement Center	62702		/users/profile/68552	anna	Board Member	5	02/03/2011	I first came to Black Pine when I was a teenager and was amazed. When I was 22 i was living just down the road and started volunteering. I have always had a BIG heart for BIG cats and other animals in need. A few years later I was asked to be on the board of directors and I was SOOO honored! Our mission is what my heart feels. Black Pine, and everyone involved, lives and breathes the mission and caring for every resident that has called Black Pine their home. Some stories are sad on why they are there, and some stories are amazing. All in all every animals is treated as an equal and they know they are loved and in good hands with their keepers.

Professional Animal Retirement Center	62698		/users/profile/68548	KimD	General Member of the Public	4	02/03/2011	My son was able to shadow the Exec. Director one day. What a fabulous experience!  The small size of Black Pine gives visitors a more real experience than a zoo.  BP is able to give children and students a "real" look at things and spark an interest in animals...and provide first hand knoweldge about the mistreatment of many animals (my son still talks about how mean past owners were to a bear at the park)..
Professional Animal Retirement Center	62697		/users/profile/68547	KSudler	General Member of the Public	5	02/03/2011	I visited Black Pine Animal Sanctuary January 30, 2011.  This program is one of the best  I have seen.  The volunteers do a great job keeping the facility clean and well kept.  The animals are very healthy and cared for.  When my husband and I took the tour, we only gave them a 20 minute notice we were coming.  The buildings were clean and warm.  The pens were clean and large.  The tour was very educational.  I did not know I would learn so much about these animals.  I learned the difference between species, how much food each animal needs everyday and how people shouldn't try to raise wild animals.   I did not know bears were still used to train hunting dogs by removing teeth and claws and letting the dogs attack it.  This poor bear is now taken care of by Black Pine and has a wonderful home.  Black Pine is not only home to big cats (tigers, leopards, etc..)  they also take care of bears, reptiles, primates, birds and field animals.  I cannot wait to visit this facility in the summer.  They are still are expanding and building.  They have two cougars and a bear that need their own habitat.  They are being kept in nice kennels until this is complete.   
Professional Animal Retirement Center	62695		/users/profile/68544	Kelsey	Volunteer	5	02/03/2011	I came into Black Pine through school and suggestion. It is a great place! All the animals are daily cared for and given enrichment. All the people there take their time to come in on the worse days. Nothing is ever skipped or forgotten about. They do everything to make sure each animal gets what they need. Nothing is more exciting than showing up to dedicate a day of your life to the animals. Black Pine is about commitment, time, care, and love. Nothing makes it easier than those animals!
Professional Animal Retirement Center	62687		/users/profile/68535	knharrold	Volunteer	5	02/03/2011	I first visited Black Pine Animal Sanctuary when I was about 18 years old. Being in college now at age 20, my major is biology, and I am wanting to pursue a career related to animals. I have since completed an internship through Black Pine Animal Sanctuary in the summer of 2010, and spent most of my days there. I couldn't have picked a better place to spend my time. BPAS has a 100% fully committed staff, unlike any other park I have visited. At BPAS, the animals come first, no exceptions. Even though we do not have the funds to give the the best looking habitats, you can tell that every animal is happy where they belong. Coming from abusive homes, this place is luxury compared to what these guys came from. Black Pine strives to make sure every animal is healthy and happy. We do several enrichment activities during the day to allow for better stimulation. There is not a day that goes by that any animal does not get fed due to inclimate weather. Every volunteer and staff is fully committed. Being a volunteer now, I can testify that BPAS is one of the best places I have ever been to. We are slowly growing into a more diverse park, allowing almost every type of animal. I have never been to a sanctuary with so much diversity. I would hands down give BPAS 5 stars on every aspect that we do! Not only do we provide animal care, we also educate every person who walks into the sanctuary about exotic pet ownership, to help stop this worldwide problem.
Professional Animal Retirement Center	62682		/users/profile/68526	Emily B.	General Member of the Public	5	02/03/2011	I grew up just down the street from Black Pine.  At first, I didn't know what it was, but after a few years, I would hear noises - Lions roaring, cougars calling, birds, chimps...everything.  Albion is a small town, and it didn't take long to learn about all the cool things happening on the property. TImes changed, the park moved, and I left town.  My mom started volunteering with Black Pine, and now serves on their board.  I make it a point to go to the park every time I am home - to see the animals, sure.  But also to support the great work that is happening there.   The volunteers and employees work hard and are dedicated to giving these animals the best life possible.  They trudge through rainstorms and blizzard-like conditions to make sure everyone is fed and warm. When animals die, which they do (Black Pine is committed to taking care of these animals until they die), everyone mourns the loss and celebrates the life that was lived. I love everything the park does, and wish there was more I could do to help!  
Professional Animal Retirement Center	35554	5	/users/profile/36374	stacey4	Volunteer	5	04/12/2010	PARC, also known as Black Pine Animal Park to those who know it best is an amazing facility filled with dedicated staff and volunteers. I had the wonderful priviledge of volunteering there for several years while I lived in Fort Wayne, IN. Everyone I encountered was truly devoted to ensuring these animals received the best care possible, despite significant budgetary constraints, and at the time, extremely limited space.
Professional Animal Retirement Center	34821	6	/users/profile/35686	wendy8	General Member of the Public	5	04/06/2010	Whether you know them as Bonar's Funny Farm, Black Pine Exotics or now, Black Pine Animal Park aka Professional Animal Retirement Center (PARC)  You know them for the history of simply helping animals who cannot help themselves.  Not only do they make it possible for "retired" animals to live out their days in good health and happiness, they are also first to help other non-profits in their fundraising.  This special center allows children to become closely aquainted with the animals and helps them to understand the importance of caring for these animals respectfully.  They give them the dignity that they may never have had in their "performing" years.  Thank you to all of the volunteers at Black Pine that make it possible for us to enjoy these beautiful creatures.
Every Child Ministries	317591		/users/profile/87357	ConstanceK	Donor	5	10/31/2016	We've been sponsoring a child through ECM for many years. Our experience has been consistently positive through the years. They are dedicated and conscientious. They truly care about the kids they sponsor, the slaves they're freeing, and the education and housing they provide to homeless children. The little girl we started sponsoring many years ago is now 16 and passed her high school exams! We are so proud of her and so glad she has a home with Christian caregivers and educators who support her.
Every Child Ministries	241932	1	/users/profile/87357	ConstanceK	Donor	5	04/30/2015	We have been helping to support Every Child Ministries for years. Throughout these many years Every Child Ministries has been consistently trustworthy, sincere, accountable, and appreciative.  We are honored to support their work in Africa and have seen the results of our donations as our sponsored child has grown into a healthy, vibrant young lady. I can't recommend them highly enough!
Every Child Ministries	124689		/users/profile/87357	ConstanceK	Donor	5	10/06/2012	My husband and I have been giving to Every Child Ministries for many years.  ECM is an organization that makes a huge impact on the children and slaves they rescue, comfort and educate. They have built schools, rescued street children and freed many slaves in the time we've known them. It has been great to see the progress of Akua, our sponsored child, through the years. The difference between ECM and much larger organizations will be apparent from the start. It's a much more personal giving. You will feel connected, informed and appreciated. In addition, the devotion, sincerity and tireless effort of all the ECM employees continues to amaze us. We would not be giving if we had the slightest doubt about the integrity of ECM - we stand behind them because you couldn't find people more passionate or concerned about the helpless children and slaves that they serve both physically and spiritually.
Every Child Ministries	80004		/users/profile/87357	ConstanceK	Donor	5	02/28/2011	Many years ago, while listening to the Christian radio station KLOVE, a DJ with direct experience of Every Child Ministries introduced my husband and I to this organization. He inspired us to donate to this very worthy cause. We have had constant communication and updates on a very personal level with ECM every month for years.  The founders and volunteers at ECM are extremely dedicated and inspired Christians. We know this, because we have received repeated confirmation via emails and letters from both ECM headquarters, ECM missionaries, and our sponsored child. The emails and letters are filled with personal stories, specific prayer requests, the challenges of ministering, and faith, hope, and love. They continue to minister despite many obstacles, and they continue to amaze me. I wish there were more than 5 stars to rate ECM with - that's how much I value their dedication and efforts for the lost and homeless children and slaves. They have impressed me all these years, and I can't recommend ECM enough. Words really can't do ECM justice. Their hearts are about the biggest I've ever known.
Every Child Ministries	301648		/users/profile/213120	kkgaffney	Donor	5	08/27/2016	I have been involved as a volunteer and as a child and staff sponsor for 25 years. They do a lot with a little and I wholeheartedly recommend Every Child Ministries if you want to be sure your donation dollars are truly making a difference!
Every Child Ministries	261722	1	/users/profile/213120	kkgaffney	Donor	5	10/05/2015	I have been involved with this ministry for 25 years, first as a short-term missionary, and as a donor ever since, sponsoring both a pastor and a child, as well as helping with special projects from time to time.  This is a ministry that does a LOT with a LITTLE. I always know my gifts are making a difference.
Every Child Ministries	160744	2	/users/profile/213120	kkgaffney	Donor	5	06/15/2013	I served with Every Child Ministries overseas for a short time in 1991 during a semester off college. Since then, I have continued to be involved as a regular sponsor for an African pastor and a child in need, and special projects whenever we have extra to give.  The biggest reason I sponsor ECM is because they do SO MUCH with just a little; I know my gifts make a huge difference to a lot of people in meeting their physical and spiritual needs. They also seek to put ministry into the hands of national workers instead of just relying on Americans. Hope this is helpful!
Every Child Ministries	301350		/users/profile/392266	Ronald21	Donor	5	08/23/2016	I have been a child sponsor and have gone on short term mission trips with Every Child Ministries. They are top notch and use all funds wisely. I highly recommend them to anyone. They use Indigenous staff and integrate well with western volunteers and missionaries.  The children that are sponsored are well taken care of and are given quality educations. ECM deserves the highest ratings
Every Child Ministries	300971		/users/profile/391852	Writer	Donor	5	08/18/2016	I've been a sponsor for about 12 years now.  It is very fulfilling to know I'm changing the lives of children by helping them with their education.  This is an outstanding organization that truly cares about all children.  In a country where there can be such turmoil &  poverty, ECM is a beacon of hope and safety.  It has been inspiring watching ECM expand their reach as they have grown their ministry.  I highly recommend this nonprofit.  They are excellent stewards with the monies they receive.  
Every Child Ministries	300888	1	/users/profile/391757	Bob_105	Volunteer	5	08/18/2016	I've been volunteering at Every Child Ministries for over 30 years now! This is a ministry that's given its all to share the gospel with children who would otherwise be looked over, or pushed aside. This ministry is super frugal with every dollar that is donated, so you don't have to worry about how your donations are spent. No fancy offices with beautiful furniture, no huge salaries to meet, just plain, honest people who love Jesus and the children of Africa!
Every Child Ministries	300885		/users/profile/391754	Writer	Donor	5	08/18/2016	I appreciate the updates on the projects that they have going and the different ways to give, either time, funds or specific items.  Their diligence and simplicity truly make me feel like I am partnering with them and making a difference. 
Every Child Ministries	300881		/users/profile/391750	MariamAziz	Volunteer	5	08/18/2016	Incredible nonprofit that is truly changing children's lives in Africa with an amazing focus on sustainability and helping empower communities to become self-sustaining!
Every Child Ministries	300853		/users/profile/391724	margaretc	Donor	5	08/17/2016	I have been a donor with this nonprofit for about three years.  They help provide for Children that are homeless in Africa and provide schooling so they can learn skills to improve their lifestyle.  The child I sponsor, Titus writes me from time to time and the charity keeps me informed about how he is doing in his schoolwork.  My funds enable him to attend the school.  I am impressed with the sincerity, efficiency and caring that this charity exhibits.
Every Child Ministries	300851		/users/profile/391722	karenderringer	Donor	5	08/17/2016	I have been supporting two children thru ECM, one child for over 10 years now. I like ECM because I get regular reports on my childrens' progress and ECM is very easy to reach out to if I have specific needs or concerns. They are very conscientious of the money they are entrusted with to help improve poor and desperate childrens lives in Africa.
Every Child Ministries	300838		/users/profile/391710	Cynthia116	Volunteer	5	08/17/2016	My children and I used to volunteer at ECM every Friday, and it was a great learning and growing experience for them. They could see how much they truly have and learn to share both time and resources with others. The staff are amazing, too!
Every Child Ministries	294499		/users/profile/385237	Linda422	Donor	5	07/01/2016	Making a difference to 'the least of these' is what ECM so clearly does. Being not just 'good' but GREAT stewards of the monies entrusted to them reveals where the leadership's heart in this ministry's is really focused. Ecclesiastes 3:11 tells of how God has placed eternity in the hearts of men. Eternity will only tell of how compassionately and diligently the work being done thru this ministry has drawn many to a saving knowledge of Jesus Christ thru meeting human needs. We're grateful for the opportunity to partner with them. 
Every Child Ministries	294494	1	/users/profile/76578	Mr. and Mrs. Bobby Joe Valdez	Donor	5	07/01/2016	If you ever want to get involved with an organization that helps children and families, honors the Lord, and uses your contributions to further this work of the Lord; ECM is what you have been looking for.  I support 3 children, and have been extremely grateful to have been a part of this organization for over 10 years.  I know where my money is going; to help children in need. And by supporting these kids, or even just donating a sum of money for the work, I know that things are accomplished in the Lord' s name and for the furtherance of His gospel. Women and children who were enslaved in the temples have been freed. Families get much needed food and supplies to help them live and work.  But most of all, people are hearing about Jesus and getting saved!! May God bless this work. And may God bless all the ones who are involved with this special ministry. 
Every Child Ministries	261725	2	/users/profile/76578	Mr. and Mrs. Bobby Joe Valdez	Donor	5	10/05/2015	I have been supporting several children for years now, and am thrilled to be a part of this wonderful ministry.  I know that my support is used to help these children in their everyday lives. They hear the Gospel, are fed, and have someone who shows them love and takes care of them when circumstances are too hard for their families, or they don't have a family to take care of them.  Children are taken off the streets; adults and children are freed from temple slavery; but the best thing is that they hear about how Jesus loves them. For anyone who is wanting to help and know that their support is going for a good cause, this is the cause to support. I receive letters from my kids, and watch them grow through these letters and pictures. When a child "graduates" from the program, I pick up another one. I'm so thankful that John and Lorella listened to the Lord when He gave them a heart for this ministry.  The organization has done SO much good. Praise goes to the Lord!
Every Child Ministries	123594	2	/users/profile/76578	Mr. and Mrs. Bobby Joe Valdez	Donor	5	09/27/2012	ECM has been instrumental in taking children who are abandoned or living in very poor circumstances; and giving them food, shelter and love.  I have known the Rousters for many years, and have been a donor and sponsor for 5 years. I have watched as the children we sponsor grow and mature under ECM's care and leadership.  I know the money I give goes directly to help these children and help give them hope and a future.  They learn about the one who loves them most of all, Jesus, and how He will never forsake or abandon them.  What a wonderful ministry the Rousters and their partners have undertaken!  God Bless Them!
Every Child Ministries	70063	2	/users/profile/76578	Mr. and Mrs. Bobby Joe Valdez	Donor	5	02/17/2011	I have known John and Lorella Rouster for many years now, and the work that they and their staff are doing with the children of Africa is phenomenal.  My husband and I support two children, and ECM is very careful to tell us where the support money goes, and we recieve periodic letters and updates from the children. People are sometimes cautious to donate money to organizations because they aren't sure where the money is being used.  ECM details where the donations go, and what it is used for, with newsletters and emails. I have watched the Lord bless ECM because of the faithfulness of its staff. Hundreds of women and children have been freed from temple slavery. May God continue to bless ECM until the day of His returning. 
Every Child Ministries	289108	3	/users/profile/76381	holly	Volunteer	5	05/09/2016	We have supported ECM for over 20 years. Whenever we have a little extra money we try to send it to one of their current projects.  We have met the American staff and visited the office.  It is unbelievable how these few humble individuals can make the lives of so many children in Africa better in a tangible way, and teach them about Jesus.  93 cents of every dollar is used for the ministry of the poorest African children.  They are able to do this because of the many, many volunteers who help in a myriad of ways.  But also because the staff is always looking for ways to cut unnecessary costs starting with their own small salaries and humble office.  I invite and challenge you to peruse their website and you will be amazed at the many areas where they are impacting the lowliest of forgotten children. You will also recognize the efficiency and clarity they have in addressing projects, people and needs.  But most of all, the staff, the volunteers, and the many, many workers in Africa pray all the time and God answers for His children.  Every part of the ministry that you see on their website, really happens.  It is an amazing ministry.
Every Child Ministries	241051	3	/users/profile/76381	holly	Volunteer	5	04/13/2015	I have been donating to ECM, and volunteering when possible for over 20 years.  We all have many opportunities to support very worthy causes.  I choose to send any extra money I have to ECM for these reasons:  Over several decades of serving forgotten children they have been able to use 94%+ of the donations directly for the needs of the children.  (Only 6% is used for salaries and administrative costs) They are able to do this because they rely very heavily on volunteers to do the work in the states; short-term missionaries who raise their own support to go to Africa and minister; and in the African countries the programs are all run by local churches, pastors, people who have grown up in the area and know the people and culture.  Secondly ECM is incredibly transparent and open about all the ministries they are working in.  Their website is easy to use and they answer questions immediately if you call their office.  When the workers in Africa encounter emergencies like a  throw away child, or a child with immediate medical issues, ECM lets you know of the opportunity to become involved in even a very small way in meeting that specific need.  You also see the results.  They send out newsletters, with pictures, and stories of the children, not statistics - so you are able to pray for faces with names and feel connected with their needs and success stories. We sponsor one of the children who lives at Haven of Hope and is educated in their school.  We exchange letters and pictures with him; are aware of the issues he faces; and feel like we are a part of his life. We receive reports from his teachers and the orphanage, so we know how to pray for him and how to write to him. We recently helped pack a sea container to go to Africa.  It was packed by volunteers.  The boxes were different sizes because they were all boxes that had been repurposed and filled with donations gathered and packed  by individuals - things like textbooks, medical supplies, toothpaste, sunglasses for the albino children, repurposed tables and chairs for the school. ECM repackages old Sunday School lessons with relevant BIble lessons, pictures of black children and plaques with BIble verses made from old greeting cards for the children to hang on their barren walls.  It is amazing how ECM repurposes the castoffs of our society to meet very real needs of forgotten children in Africa. The founders, directors, and very few paid employees of ECM are not earning their living, working in a non-profit organization.  They are passionate about the forgotten children of Africa, donating back to the organization themselves, and taking the smallest salaries possible.  The ministry is truly awesome and you feel like a part of a team of caring people
Every Child Ministries	69882		/users/profile/76381	holly	Donor	5	02/17/2011	I have been donating to Every Child MInistries for over 20 years.  Since their headquarters is in Indiana, I have been able to have personal contact with them and see first hand how the moneys are used.  They do an incredible job of stretching every dollar received so that the money goes to the children in Africa.  They are continually seeking volunteers to do all of their work, cutting their administrative costs to a minimum.  They reuse and recycle used materials from churches and organizations making them applicable for the African ministries.  Volunteers cut out pictures and file them to be assembled later into complete lesson packs.  Sunday school materials are translated into French, zeroxed on office machines and sent to Africa, where they are checked out and used and reused by the nationally trained teachers.  ECM feels an incredible responsibility to the people who have sacrificed to donate money to their cause.  Every cent that is donated for child sponsorship goes to the children.  The sponsored children write letters to their sponsors, thanking them and updating them on their personal lives.  The mothers of the orphanage send "report cards" to the sponsors updating them on the academic and social progress of each sponsored child.  The ECM office is open and available here in Indiana and you can stop by anytime and talk to John and Lorella and see what they are doing. The thing that I appreciate the most after getting to know John and Lorella, but also so many of the volunteers, is their HEART for these children in Africa.  I have seen volunteers cry over these children, they pray regularly for them, and they donate sacrificially of their time, possessions, and money.  It is such an inspiring group of people who are making a change one child at a time.
Every Child Ministries	261574		/users/profile/80745	Marciakay	Donor	5	10/04/2015	My daughters have volunteered at ECM, and we have supported children in Africa through them for about 6 years.  They are the real deal, and every dollar they receive is carefully and wisely invested in the future of women, children and families in Africa.  God bless ECM! 
Every Child Ministries	136364	1	/users/profile/80745	Marciakay	Donor	5	11/09/2012	Every Child Ministries uses every penny wisely, and once people get involved with them, they can see just how much they are really accomplishing for women, children, and families in Africa.  My daughters have done volunteer work for them  for almost 2 years now, and it is a wonderful organization.  
Every Child Ministries	73887	1	/users/profile/80745	Marciakay	Donor	5	02/23/2011	My daughters and I are so happy to be able to support a child through this amazing ministry to children and others in Africa.  The work they do on a limited budget through donations and volunteers is awe-inspiring! 
Every Child Ministries	261440	1	/users/profile/350049	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/03/2015	My husband and I had the privilege of serving for two weeks with ECM in Uganda with the Afayo Project. Seeing firsthand the work that is being done there was  so encouraging . I  appreciated the true caring and concern demonstrated by ECM staff for each person, whether it be a child in the school or an adult in the community. I appreciated the relationships being built on a foundation of mutual trust and respect.This takes lots of time and lots of listening, and does not happen overnight! I appreciated the focus on sustainability, and the flexibility within the organization to meet needs as they arise.  ECM is the real deal!
Every Child Ministries	254126		/users/profile/342434	Zaykova	Donor	5	08/27/2015	I have been with Every Child Ministries for 4 years and feel blessed by everything these great Ministries are doing! So many hungry fed, deprived helped, and sick treated and saved! God bless you for all you do for the forgotten children of Africa!
Every Child Ministries	240445	1	/users/profile/326609	jkrajnak	Donor	5	04/02/2015	My wife and I began to sponsor a homeless, deserted boy that ECM got off the streets at age 3. This month we learned that he has graduated from the Haven of Hope facility run by ECM. PTL! This young man now has hope, confidence and a Christian education with which to begin his young adult life. No telling what he may accomplish for his community and the kingdom because of ECM!We have known and supported ECM for three decades and know them to be vigilant and determined in their love of God and their sensitivity to His will in their ministry. One can easily see God's blessing on this ministry and the praise He receives as a result.
Every Child Ministries	240289		/users/profile/213710	Jim Wallin	Donor	5	03/31/2015	A visit to their offices. A visit with their staff. Humility, frugality, a sincere love and appreciation for their supporters, a deep felt love for the forgotten (truly forgotten) children of Africa, and most of all a sincere appreciation of the gospel and how it relates to them and to the children they serve, is evident. Every Child Ministries is deserving of your support-they have ours. Jim and Marit Wallin
Every Child Ministries	199519		/users/profile/213710	Jim Wallin	Volunteer	5	05/02/2014	ECM has captured our hearts because of their love for unwanted children and because they seek to discover and resolve some of the root problems be it the church, the family, the community, or in some cases outside forces. God wants us to be cheerful givers. To ECM we are cheerful givers.               Jim and Marit Wallin
Every Child Ministries	161185		/users/profile/213710	Jim Wallin	Volunteer	5	06/21/2013	We have been involved in the evangelical church for over 60 years. During that time we have seen many changes taking place in missions and missionary outreach. Every Child Ministries has kept pace. They are involved in all aspects of human need.   First and foremost Every Child Ministries stands firm in its commitment to tell children and adults alike about the love of Jesus and their need to recognize Him as their Lord and Savior. Early on Every Child Ministries' goal was to establish a Sunday School in every village in Ghana. To date over over 2000 Sunday Schools have been established, many in conjunction with local churches  Over the past 27 years this work has expanded to include a home for children, a Christian School, classes in the public schools, health concerns with financial aid where needed, slave children, and many more. Our support for Every Child Ministries continues to be enthusiastic as it should. Jim and Marit WallinDowners Grove, IL 60515   
Every Child Ministries	240190		/users/profile/260424	David222	Professional with expertise in this field	5	03/30/2015	My wife and I have been child sponsors through Every Child Ministries for about five years now, and we appreciate the fact that this nonprofit squeezes every penny out of every dollar given for the various areas of ministry ECM touches. Their administration overhead costs are VERY LOW, and that allows more donation dollars to be used for ministering to the lives of people they serve in the field. The efficient use of a dedicated core of veteran volunteers at their international headquarters is the primary reason for this high ratio of donor dollars to the field versus admin costs. I highly recommend Every Child Ministries as one of the unsung heroes in the not-for-profit world!
Every Child Ministries	199480		/users/profile/260424	David222	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/02/2014	As a professional who has worked for another nonprofit for nearly 30-years, I am continually amazed by the impact Every Child Ministries is making with what many would consider to be a modest budget. My wife and I have been regular donors to ECM for about five years now, primarily as a sponsor of a young child's education at the school they own and operate in Accra, Ghana in West Africa. We appreciate the feedback we receive on how our child is doing in school and we can see how he has been progressing in his education and development because of the investment we are making in this ministry.
Every Child Ministries	240128		/users/profile/326187	ecusw	Professional with expertise in this field	5	03/29/2015	I served with this agency on the mission field and have continued to be an active prayer partner and supporter. The work they do in Africa touches not just the spiritual souls of those they serve but also the actual lives they live by working to make the living conditions better. The former directors were passionate about their ministry and they have been diligent in finding a replacement director who is equally as passionate. They are excellent stewards of the agency funds and through prayer and creativity can stretch a dollar further than even my very frugal mother of six was able to do. Having seen and lived the work of this agency, I recommend this agency to anyone looking invest in the lives of African children, women and men.

Every Child Ministries	201227		/users/profile/262694	kkdart	Volunteer	4	05/29/2014	The folks of this organization truly care for people. Whether it's the orphaned children of AIDS, the adult women who have been entrapped into the Tracosi (not sure of the spelling) slave trade or the sick from all the diseases of their area, ECM will do whatever they can to help out. They love them all and let them know it. But their overriding goal and main objective is bringing the Good News of the Gospel of Jesus Christ to all these people. They know that no matter what else they do, if they don't point them to Christ all will be in vain. And every dollar that comes in, they stretch to go as far as possible, but there are always projects waiting for the funds to come in. They make do with a very small salary so that more can be available for the work. Their volunteers are very dedicated and faithful.  But they are suffering from the same malady so many organizations are, new, younger volunteers are not forthcoming and they may have to begin paying for some of the work that volunteers have traditionally done. 
Every Child Ministries	200807		/users/profile/262174	v123	Donor	5	05/23/2014	I researched Every Child Ministries. This ministry has a genuine concern and love for the work that it does. It is one that is honest and has integrity. I have been giving personally for about 5 years now and have I have gotten the Missions Ministry at my church to give. 
Every Child Ministries	200638		/users/profile/261938	lbgal	Donor	5	05/21/2014	This organization teaches and saves children!  They are small but mighty in love and in all they do for the children of Africa.  They do what we can't personally do.  They are hands on at great sacrifice, but with great love.  I have been a volunteer in the past and have been a donor for over 10 years.  I sponsor 4 children and wish I could do more! 
Every Child Ministries	200266		/users/profile/261427	odfaa	Donor	5	05/14/2014	This organization has touched the lives of so many.  I pray that it continues to grow and reach every child they cone into contact with. God truly moves in the hearts of this ministries' leaders who have a passion to  serve Him as well as others! ECM is doing great things and it has been a blessing to support this ministry. 
Every Child Ministries	199959		/users/profile/261018	DDDC	Volunteer	5	05/08/2014	I have traveled to Africa and seen the work in Ghana.  They really help the children spiritually and education and with health.  There are other ministries of ECM that I visited such as women freed from ritual servitude.  Lorella really knows the customs and so on to help take care of political and legal aspects of the ministry.   No money is wasted.  They are very frugal, and I do not worry that any donations will be wasted.
Every Child Ministries	199920	1	/users/profile/260977	Grace21	General Member of the Public	5	05/08/2014	A visit to their headquarters will convince you of their total commitment to being the"hands and feet of Jesus"!
Every Child Ministries	199742	1	/users/profile/260761	loon2930	Donor	5	05/06/2014	I am thankful to be a supporter of Every Child Ministries for about 14 years now, their heart for these forgotten children is so genuine and real. They send frequent updates, prayer requests, and let you know the needs that they currently have so that you can pray about them. They greatly glorify God as they selflessly continue to bless the lives of these dear children and they are truly an organization worthy of your support.
Every Child Ministries	199727		/users/profile/76979	rosmom	Volunteer	5	05/06/2014	Every Child Ministries maintains integrity by focusing on the Lord and His work in Africa. The staff is small and volunteers have huge hearts! I love ECM!
Every Child Ministries	123886		/users/profile/76979	rosmom	Volunteer	5	09/29/2012	I spent four months in Ghana as a teaching volunteer with Every Child Ministries. What a wonderful organization it is! I love that ECM works toward employing the native people to help spread the ministry and make it effective in helping the people of the country. Teaching teams included one Ghanaian and one American, orphanage moms were women from the same area, and most local offices were staffed by Ghanaians. ECM is a great organization to support!
Every Child Ministries	70419		/users/profile/76979	rosmom	Donor	5	02/17/2011	I served a summer in Ghana with Every Child Ministries and was very impressed with the way this ministry is run.  They have found people who already live in these areas and have trained them to help their own people- the most effective way of supporting a people group, in my opinion.  They use funds wisely and communicate regularly to supporters so we know how money is being used.  They target orphans, street children, and freed shrine slaves, the most helpless!  What an amazing organization! 
Every Child Ministries	199630		/users/profile/260609	bhollyoak	Donor	5	05/05/2014	My husband and I believe the Lord led us to ECM through the Albino Project.  WE located them on line and sent an email.  We immediately received personal communication as if we were significant and highly valued.  As we continued to communicate with ECM sponsoring 3 albino children as well as helping with the albino project we became more and more inspired by the sacrifice and service of the co-founders and their staff.  Lorella as well as the ECM staff are very approachable and clearly committed to the "forgotten children of Africa".  We are amazed at all the work that is going on through this non-profit.  When we have sent checks and been unclear as to their purpose, ECM staff quickly communicates and clarifies with us our intent of the funds showing the integrity of the organization. The same is true of any items we have sent, questions are asked of us so they use the items or funds appropriately.  We have been so encouraged by this ministry we would to do all we can to support them financially, through prayer, and even by going to Africa.  THANK YOU ECM FOR ALL YOU DO.  You have ministered to us as well to fulfill the great commission!  WE LOVE YOU.  
Every Child Ministries	199612		/users/profile/260580	krrawlins	Volunteer	5	05/04/2014	Every Child Ministries does an amazing work in reaching out to the forgotten children in Africa. My family has know John and Lorella Rouster, the founders of ECM for many years. It is amazing to me that this couple began as missionaries to the people of Congo and have grown to serve children and adults in Congo, Ghana and Uganda. When others in Uganda were trying to reach out to the refugee children, many who had been forced to become child soldiers, they went to John and Lorella for advise. ECM has many ministries serving street children, orphans, training Sunday school workers, helping women released from slavery.  It is interesting and worth reading about their different ministries.  Each one started because John and Lorella saw a need; God touched their hearts and  a new ministry was started. There are so many organizations trying to help those less fortunate. If you want to help desperate children, you can know that your money and support will be saving these "African Jewels"!
Every Child Ministries	199560		/users/profile/260509	rcoon	Volunteer	5	05/03/2014	I have been a donor and a casual volunteer for Every Child MInistries for 20 years.  Because of my personal involvement I can attest with authority and experience that the organization is rock solid.  Their level of financial and personal integrity is beyond question.  They operate a huge ministry with a skeletal paid staff here is in the US.  Most of the administrative work is handled by volunteers, so that the money can go to the forgotten children and ministries in Africa. As a child sponsor, I have a relationship with my child.  I regularly receive pictures and reports on his school work and behavioral development.  As soon as they are old enough they send pictures and letters to you. (English is taught in Ghana)  I am currently corresponding with my 16 yr. old child on a regular basis, after 6 years of sponsorship.   I donate to several organizations, but I feel so strongly about the work ECM is accomplishing that anytime I have extra money I send it to ECM and trust them to use it where needed.  I could go on and on, but I invite you to view their webpage.  It will draw you in and you will be amazed at the things they are accomplishing, and the tremendous needs they are revealing.  You will also feel their sincere heart to rescue children and help them grow to love the Lord and live strong independent lives giving back to others.
Every Child Ministries	199540		/users/profile/260487	WeloveAfrica	Volunteer	5	05/02/2014	We love ECM.  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++                                          We LOVE ECM.  We have been involved as volunteers and donors for about 8 years.  We sponsor a darling girl in Ghana.  We just got a letter from her today and she is doing well in her studies and talks about the Lord. Very lovely charity to donate to.  They go to places other missions have not been able to stay in because of harsh environments. They really make a difference in the areas they serve. They also make you feel a part of their ministry as they send hand-written thank you notes, and you get letters from your sponsored child.  We also get updates from our child's teacher regarding her academic progress. They email great newsletters with actual pictures (not stock photos) with details on their work and missionaries. I highly recommend ECM.  They are financially accountable and worthwhile.         
Every Child Ministries	199534		/users/profile/213702	Claire_Sarah	Donor	5	05/02/2014	Every Child Ministries is an excellent vehicle of God's love and kindness to the children of Africa that it helps. The workers are dedicated to bringing God's love to his dear children in Africa. I would encourage everyone who can give to actually give to this charity as the money is wisely and lovingly used.
Every Child Ministries	161180		/users/profile/213702	Claire_Sarah	Donor	5	06/21/2013	I would like to take this opportunity to tell everyone how great a charity Every Child Ministries is. Their focus is totally on sharing the love of the Lord Jesus with the orphans of Africa. Every dollar does so much to help these poor orphans in both a spiritual and practical way. I would encourage everyone who can afford to support them to actually do it.
Every Child Ministries	199518		/users/profile/168240	krajnak	Donor	5	05/02/2014	My wife and I have been involved with ECM for over 30 years now. We have become infinitely aware of their goals and efforts both in the US and in African nations. Not only is every penny accounted for and spent with African children in mind, so too is the daily mindset of the entire organization. The initials are more than an acronym, they truly are an Every Child Ministry!
Every Child Ministries	123563		/users/profile/168240	krajnak	Donor	5	09/27/2012	My wife and I have sponsored a child at Haven of Hope for several years. We have seen him grow from an indigent street-child with no hope to a well educated God-loving teenager. ECM is fully focused on Africa's children through God's lense.
Every Child Ministries	199515		/users/profile/260466	1montez2	Donor	5	05/02/2014	I have been blessed to witness first hand the work that ECM does.  I visited Africa and met the children and staff and was amazed at the level of commitment shown by the workers.  ECM's level of fiscal responsibility is impressive to say the least.  They make every cent count.  The children receive compassionate care and wise  Godly direction for their lives.  My husband and I sponsor a child and we frequently donate to support the ministry in other areas as needed.
Every Child Ministries	199507		/users/profile/76594	Lana Foster	Volunteer	5	05/02/2014	I have been blessed to witness ECM in action and know the co-founders personally.  Just a few of the traits I've seen are: compassion, loving care, Christ-centered, frugal, dedicated, devoted to abandoned and orphaned children, women freed from slavery & families in need of healing.  They are always looking up and listening to God's guidance.  They find a need and fill it.  If you're looking for a charity that you can be certain will make the best investment with your funds, or if you're wanting to help a child or worthwhile project, or if you're looking for a missions experience...ECM is the place you're looking for!
Every Child Ministries	161072	1	/users/profile/76594	Lana Foster	Volunteer	5	06/20/2013	Anyone searching for a non-profit organization you can truly trust and believe in, there's no greater opportunity than EVERY CHILD MINISTRIES (ECM).  Year after year, I am awestruck witnessing the promises of God for increase and blessing demonstrated by the growth of programs and services provided through ECM to the forgotten children of Africa. Keeping God first in word, deed and prayer provides a rock-solid foundation upon which ECM follows God's direction, bringing His practical love, compassion, and provision to those they affectionately call African Jewels--diamonds in the rough--that, with God's guidance and love through ECM, become shining with inner beauty and divine potential, learning to look up to and trust in Jesus for hope and a future. I have been blessed to witness ECM co-founders, John & Lorella Rouster, extend acceptance, love, and practical help to thousands of children in need, recognizing each one as a unique gift of God.  Amazing Grace describes the countless ways I have seen ECM reach out, raising funds to build homes to provide meals, medicine, and education to kids living on the streets, freeing slaves and their children, teaching Bible principles in public schools, comforting kids in war-torn areas, returning displaced kids to their families, teaching skills to teens and others to help them become self-sufficient, providing life-saving surgeries to children, giving meals and hope through a knowledge of Jesus to homeless children...and the list goes on!  I have watched, and learned, as they face what appear to be insurmountable obstacles, placing their full faith in God, and returning His love by answering the call to a higher purpose.   I highly respect and give thanks to all who partner with ECM.  I pray God will continue to bless ECM with caring individuals who partner with them to accomplish these life-changing endeavors.
Every Child Ministries	70079		/users/profile/76594	Lana Foster	Volunteer	5	02/17/2011	I went to Ghana in 2002 when ECM began building Haven of Hope Children's Home.  It was an incredible experience that changed my life.  I will never forget the children living alone on the streets.  These children are orphaned or abandoned.  ECM provides ALL their needs.  NOTHING is ever wasted.  Even used Christmas cards are punched into shapes with Scriptures added for the kids.  This is one organization where you will get to know the Directors personally.  They are the hardest working, most dedicated, God-fearing people I've ever met.  Every time they see a new need involving the forgotten children in Africa, they get more and more involved, always growing, always caring, always praying and thanking God.  My husband and I now sponsor one of the children at Haven of Hope.  We are kept abreast of his well-bing, school grades, and receive letters from him.  Although on a limited income, we have so much more than the majority of families in Africa.  If you want God to bless your life, become a blessing to ECM!!
Every Child Ministries	199498		/users/profile/75938	Beth T.	Donor	5	05/02/2014	ECM is an amazing organization. They have changed so many lives in Africa. Our church is supporting their efforts to free women in slavery. I myself sponsor a child in DRC. But ECM is reaching out to so many more women, children and families and enhancing their lives. What wonderful work they have done and continue to do. They are a light in this world and helping to do the Lords work. God Bless them for all they do. Beth Thomas
Every Child Ministries	160801		/users/profile/75938	Beth T.	Donor	5	06/17/2013	Every Child Ministries is a wonderful organization that has reached so many forgotten children in Africa. I have watched them in action for the past 25 plus years and I am so amazed at what they have accomplished in that time.  These children have been so blessed by this ministry and their lives have been changed for the good.  Without this ministry, I fear these children would be neglected and be without food, clothing and the Word of God. I will continue to offer my support to this wonderful ministry and rejoice for the hard work and amazing lives touched by their love for these children.
Every Child Ministries	124866		/users/profile/75938	Beth T.	Donor	5	10/09/2012	This is such an important working ministry.  Reaching these African children and making such an impact in their lives.  Bring the Word of the Lord and helping to improve their lives with food and shelter and support.  I personally support one child along with general donations every year.  This is so vital that this ministry continues on.  Exceptional direction by John and Lorella Rouster and all that support this ministry.  God Bless them in their work.  Beth Thomas
Every Child Ministries	69493		/users/profile/75938	Beth T.	Donor	5	02/16/2011	This ministry was founded by my Aunt and Uncle and I remember it in its infancy.  They have done so much over the last 25 years, it's just amazing how the Lord works through ordinary, everyday people.  I just saw them as my Dad's brother and his wife.  But they are so much more.  The work they have started there and what they have accomplished, the lives they have touched, especially mine.  They have come to my church twice and shared with the congregation, lighting a fire in the hearts of many.  We now have a ministry  of making pasties every month and all the monies go to ECM.  I have become a sponsor of an 8 year old boy in DR Congo and I know in my heart that this was something I had been needing to do for a long time.  Because of this, I am blessed.  Thank you ECM for your love.   For reaching out to the forgotten children of Africa, for caring and sharing God's love.   Beth Thomas, Potterville, MI
Every Child Ministries	199496		/users/profile/213108	Richard57	Donor	5	05/02/2014	Excellent work! They are very careful with their funds. Led by very humble and dedicated servants of the Lord.
Every Child Ministries	160733		/users/profile/213108	Richard57	General Member of the Public	5	06/15/2013	This wonderful organization is doing great things with every penny they get. They operate out of a modest building, and find creative ways to stretch their funds. Led by John and Lorella, who themselves are very humble servants, the work of this mission has had and continues to have a positive impact in the lives of those whom they serve.
Every Child Ministries	199493		/users/profile/260443	allancox	Donor	5	05/02/2014	I am continually amazed with how much they do with so little funds. They are always looking for new fields to reach. They are never satisfied with the status-quo. I think that Christians get more bang for their bucks with ECM.
Every Child Ministries	199491		/users/profile/260439	NancyGushee	Volunteer	5	05/02/2014	Doing excellent work in Africa, reaching many children and families with the message of Jesus Christ!I have worked with them for many years, as an office volunteer and last year had the privelage of going on a summer team and seeing the work for myself.  Doing a great work for Christ.
Every Child Ministries	199471		/users/profile/168301	njdchelsea	Donor	5	05/01/2014	Every child Ministries remains one of the most worthwhile ministries that we donate to.  I feel the most is made of every penny and the  smallest donations are welcomed and made use of.  They are faithful in sending newsletters, updates, and prayer requests. They reach out to some of the world's neediest and offer hope where there was none.  I have met the directors and felt they are humble, hard working and faithful in their ministry. I would sincerely recommend the support of this ministry.
Every Child Ministries	160706		/users/profile/168301	njdchelsea	Donor	5	06/15/2013	I am amazed at the kind of work and service that EMC provides to the people in these small villages in Africa. The areas are poverty stricken, and there is great spiritual bondage. The staff shows a great love for "the least of these" in their day to day life among them and we feel our contributions to this work can help make a huge impact through their efforts. My husband and I highly recommend supporting this ministry through prayer, and donations, which we do on an automatic monthly basis. 
Every Child Ministries	123615		/users/profile/168301	njdchelsea	Donor	5	09/27/2012	My husband and I are very careful about what organizations we contribute to - we have researched the percentage of monies that go directly to help the local people, we have met and heard the project leaders, and have spoken with volunteers that have visited Africa to see the actual progress that is being accomplished.  We highly commend Every Child Ministries and are confident that the Lord's hand is upon them and that their focus is on Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior, as well as on teaching very practical living skills to help others improve their living situations. Their goal of rescuing young girls from being condemned to sexual slavery is also an amazing ministry.
Every Child Ministries	199448		/users/profile/260384	Kevanw	Donor	5	05/01/2014	I echo the many other reviews here.. This organization is without peer. I've been a long time donor and precisely becasue of the mission, the passion and the results. They are completely transparent in their operation and one could not ask for more from a charity. The work that they do in saving children and adults from poverty and slavery and bringing them to know Jesus is simply remarkable and clearly God is guiding this group.Highly recommend ECM to anyone wanting to donate and see a tangible impact from their donation.
Every Child Ministries	199444		/users/profile/168322	Kelly48	Donor	5	05/01/2014	I've been giving to ECM for about 12 years plus now.  It is wonderful to see and know that you are changing the life of a child forever.  It has been an honor to watch this ministry grow from its beginnings.  This organization is some how able to squeeze the most of every penny they get.  The organization has continued to grow every year, helping more and more children.  It is such a blessing to receive letters and drawings from the child you are sponsoring.  In my 30 some years of giving to nonprofits, ECM is the best I've ever been involved with.  You can't go wrong with donating to this great organization.
Every Child Ministries	160761		/users/profile/168322	Kelly48	Donor	5	06/16/2013	I have been involved with ECM from the beginning (10 years).  First sponsoring one child in Uganda and then expanding my donations to sponsoring a second child in the Congo.  The children and I correspond with each other about twice a year.  It has been a very humbling and rewarding experience to touch and change their lives.  It has been an honor to watch this ministry grow and keep expanding.  Their commitment to the children and women is matched by no other.  The tenacity and perseverance of this organization against the greatest of odds has always amazed me.   I highly encourage you to get involved and give to this wonderful organization that so wisely uses its money and resources.
Every Child Ministries	123634		/users/profile/168322	Kelly48	Donor	5	09/27/2012	Ive been involved with ECM for 10 years.  I sponsor two children.  I cannot say enough about this wonderful organization.  They literally change childrens lives on a shoestring budget.  It has been an honor to watch this non-profit grow over the last 10 years.  They started with next to nothing and continue to persevere under difficult circumstances.  My life has been enriched by providing my sponsor children with school, shelter and medical care in a Christian setting.  I love receiving letters from them and sharing about myself as well.  I highly encourage you to support this organization.  You will be amazed at what ECM accomplishes.  
Every Child Ministries	199441		/users/profile/260374	jwkodf	Donor	5	05/01/2014	Every Child Ministries is a very well run ministry that seems to get the most out of every dollar donated. The leaders of this ministry live very frugal lives and have invested heavily of their own time and talents in an attempt to reach the children in Africa that need care and compassion. I know the leaders personally as well as a number of the volunteers and they operate and serve with integrity and passion. I strongly support and encourage others to support this great ministry to children in Africa!
Every Child Ministries	199438		/users/profile/260370	Kathi10	Donor	5	05/01/2014	I continued to be so impressed with this nonprofit ministry.  They are one of the most authentic ministries I have ever seen.  They truly give the largest amount of their money to their ministry.  The leaders make the smallest amount of money--I don't know how they survive.  They continue to serve the poorest and most marginalized, while sharing the love of Jesus.  This ministry is the real deal!
Every Child Ministries	199435		/users/profile/168216	kenp	Donor	5	05/01/2014	It is a huge blessing to be able to partner with ECM in the work that The Lord is doing through them worldwide. The accounts of the many lives that have been, and continue to be impacted by this ministry are very inspiring! No better place to invest than ECM!
Every Child Ministries	123542		/users/profile/168216	kenp	Donor	5	09/27/2012	ECM is doing great works in multiple areas for children in Africa. There isn't room here to list the many lives that have been transformed by this ministry.
Every Child Ministries	199433		/users/profile/168223	annymae15	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/01/2014	As a social worker, I have been impressed again and again how ECM succeeds at helping people thrive by addressing needs from a holistic approach.  They are my favorite non-profit to support and as a sponsor, I enjoy how very personal the communications are.  They're great at engaging their supporters.  I trust them in regards to how they manage the money I send them and find them overall inspiring in their care for people.
Every Child Ministries	123549		/users/profile/168223	annymae15	General Member of the Public	5	09/27/2012	I have sponsored two children through Every Child Ministries and my experience has been fantastic.  ECM does exemplary work in reaching out to people in marginalized segments of society and with children in poverty who would otherwise be forgotten.  I admire the work they have done with homeless street children, freeing and rehabilitating temple slaves, and making gains against sex trafficking in Africa.  They look at people holistically and strive to meet basic, legal, educational, and spiritual needs.  Additionally, they excel at communicating with sponsors, sending letters from children, frequent updates, and I even recevied a DVD which showed work at the school my child was living at and I got to see my child drumming and dancing.  As a social worker, I have experience with many non-profit organizations and ECM recevies my highest commendation.  I trust them implicitly with my donations and am grateful to play a small part in the valuable work they are doing.
Every Child Ministries	161989		/users/profile/80839	Bertschs	Donor	5	07/03/2013	Every Child Ministries is an organization functioning administratively on  a minimum amount of dollars like I have never seen (1.7% for 2012!). This is due to the many wonderful volunteers serving the ministry as well as administration staff that is very diligent in watching their spending! We have been acquainted with ECM for many years and have seen them maintain low administration costs year after year; have not seen any other organization that meets that percentage!  This is important when contributing to an organization. Hildred Bertsch
Every Child Ministries	73976		/users/profile/80839	Bertschs	General Member of the Public	5	02/23/2011	Every Child Ministries is an organization that shares the love of Jesus with children (and others) in Africa -- and their use of contributions is beyond amazing! Our favorite saying is "they can get two cents out of every penny" when it comes to the ministry. The monies used for administration are very minimal, as they believe what people contribute is to be used for ministering to the mission field. God is using ECM in a mighty way!
Every Child Ministries	160898	1	/users/profile/213319	JoeO	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/18/2013	The best thing about Every Child Ministries is that they are constantly reaching out to those in need.  The directors, John & Lorella Rouster, are eager to help whomever they can, all in the name of Christ.  They operate on a small budget, but their service has great consequences.  By working with the nationals in Ghana, the Congo, and Uganda, they have helped those most vulnerable to abuse and mistreatment.   I personally support their ministry and have encouraged my church family to do so, for over 10 years. 
Every Child Ministries	160763		/users/profile/78556	glendafh	Donor	5	06/16/2013	My husband and I have been financial supporters of ECM for several years.  The work they do is outstanding!  These people minister to ALL those in need, no matter what their situation.  Haven of Hope is serving as a home for children, where their spiritual and physical needs are being met.  ECM will continue to do this great work as long as all of us stand along side them.  Thank God for these people and the work they do.  
Every Child Ministries	124638		/users/profile/78556	glendafh	General Member of the Public	5	10/05/2012	Every Child Ministries is an amazing non-profit organization.  They are helping to benefit the children and families of Africa.  Their aid covers so much more than just financial.  They help these children by educating them,  by providing spiritual guidance,  by feeding, clothing and restoring families.  The list goes on and on.  Please consider ECM as you compile your non-profits for giving list.  May God continue to bless ECM.
Every Child Ministries	71844		/users/profile/78556	glendafh	Donor	5	02/20/2011	ECM is an amazing non-profit, dedicated to improving the lives of children.  My husband and I give monthly to their Haven of Hope project, which is a home for orphans and needy children.  The newsletters we received detail the work that is being accomplished in the lives of these children and the adults that are also ministered to.  Besides dealing with the physical needs of the children, ECM also ministers to their spiritual needs.  The work that is being done here is nothing short of miraculous and spreads through out the entire community.  Praise the Lord for the workers at ECM, who give of their own lives to be missionaries to those in need. 
Every Child Ministries	160740		/users/profile/76052	Dorothy Knol Rex	Donor	5	06/15/2013	I've been supporting a child in Uganda, Africa for about 5 years now.  It's so good to hear from her.  I even get her report cards!  I've been a part of ECM since it began, I think.  My money has always been used for the ministry.  I trust them completely.  Dorothy Rex
Every Child Ministries	69596		/users/profile/76052	Dorothy Knol Rex	Donor	5	02/16/2011	I'm from Arizona.  I've known about and supported ECM since it's beginning.  I support a little girl in Africa.  I'm awed with all that ECM has accomplished since it's origination.  Expecially the release of the slave women.
Every Child Ministries	160730		/users/profile/213105	Daniel45	Donor	5	06/15/2013	The broad scope of impact this ministry has on the life of Africans is staggering - from helping women bonded in slavery to bringing clean drinking water to villages, to helping young children whose parents have been killed due to war or illness - is simply amazing.
Every Child Ministries	160729		/users/profile/213104	kevanwilson3	Donor	5	06/15/2013	I have been involved with assisting the various ministries at ECM for years. While I do support other charitable organizations, none is as open, honest, transparent or concerned with God's work as ECM. If you want your donation to support much needed work and to be used as effectively and efficiently as possible, I can think of no better place to put it. I only wish I could give more. I am truly blessed to be a small part of what this organization accomplishes. Kevan Wilson
Every Child Ministries	160717		/users/profile/213088	mark1956	Donor	5	06/15/2013	I began supporting ECM because a friend was going overseas as a missionary with them. As I have watched this ministry, I have been impressed with their transparency and accountability with the funding they receive. The use of email to send information, receipts, and prayer requests shows that they are being good stewards of their finances. But I am more impressed with their desire to serve others that they contact through their work. Both donors and recipients are treated with value.  The frequent updates on their work in many locations gives me current things to be thankful for and to pray about. I feel like 'one of the team". My friend is no longer serving overseas, but my support for the ministry of ECM will continue as they share the love of God in ways that minister to both the physical and spiritual needs of people who need help.  I whole-heartedly support them and would recommend them to anyone who asks.
Every Child Ministries	160707		/users/profile/213077	ckhieb	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/15/2013	I went to Ghana on a mission trip in the summer of 2008  with ECM and spent my time at Haven of Hope.  When I went to Haven of Hope, my eyes were opened to how God loves and takes care of the "least of these." through the people who contribute to and work for ECM.  ECM loves these children with all their hearts. The children are loved, cared for, appreciated, cherished and taught the good news and hope of Jesus. I saw it. I experienced it. It was real. I met incredible and resilient children who have been through the worst experiences, yet they sing of their heavenly father and praise His name constantly. When I went to HOH, I was expecting to teach the children about God through VBS. Wow - did God show me that I was the one who needed to learn something through these children. These children are simply amazing. My time at Haven of Hope was an experience I will never forget. I sponsor one of the children I met at HOH. She wants to be a nurse. They send me her report cards and pictures that she has colored for me. What an amazing organization. ECM is making a difference. I've seen it. God is good. Thank you ECM!
Every Child Ministries	160687		/users/profile/213047	Martiirene	Donor	5	06/14/2013	My husband and I have donated to ECM for several years. We now also sponsor a child. We feel theyuse all the funds wisely. Their work with the people and children of Africa is outstanding.
Every Child Ministries	160678		/users/profile/78674	Becky Wiles Brown	Donor	5	06/14/2013	Wonderful grassroots ministry to children in Africa. So blessed to be to apart of ECM for many years and be so connected to what is going on. We now are sponsoring a child and never had so much information about her!! 
Every Child Ministries	71954		/users/profile/78674	Becky Wiles Brown	Donor	5	02/20/2011	My husband and I have been long time supporters of ECM as have both of our parents.  We are excited about the growth and work of ECM over the years.  We are especially excited about the liberation of slave women and children as the gospel reaches even the darkest places.  It is exiciting to be supporting this grass root ministry that started right here in NWI with one family responding to God's call.  Becky and Doug Brown
Every Child Ministries	145104		/users/profile/191664	alilockett	Donor	4	11/30/2012	I appreciate this ministry greatly and thank God that there is a ministry locally that helps such a poverty stricken country.

Every Child Ministries	127864		/users/profile/172982	Rose1234	Donor	5	10/23/2012	I have been giving to Every Child Ministries for years.  In these economic times every penny counts and I am only giving where my heart tells me.  I am sure that giving to ECM is the right choice because they are very responsible in how they use their funds.  I would recommend this organization highly.

Every Child Ministries	124824		/users/profile/169870	Dr. Carl S. Hale	General Member of the Public	5	10/08/2012	I became associated with ECM back in 2006 because of their focus on impoverished children in Africa, all in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.  SInce that time I have had an opportunity to become a financial supporter of this ministry and to sponsor a child in Africa.  The impact of this ministry is greater than it's humble origins and low key website would indicate.  Although not a high profile ministry, ECM has had a pivotal and lasting impact in several countries in Africa.  Long before Kony became known in the international media, ECM staff were in Africa serving thousands of children who were traumatized by his reign of terror, quietly meeting the spiritual, material, and emotional needs of these chidlren.  Dollar for dollar, I know this ministry is working amazing things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, because it is the power of HIs Spirit and HIs love that are being shared by ECM missionaries and staff.  Although I also support other higher profile ministries involving children,  ECM  is closest to my heart!!!
Every Child Ministries	124648		/users/profile/78097	peoplepc	Volunteer	5	10/05/2012	We continue to support ECM with enthusiasm. Every visit to their Hebron Headquarters is encouraging. The knowledge, commitment, and dedication on the part of all leaders, employees, and volunteers is obvious. A good work is being done because of them and their dedication to the forgotten children of Africa is evident. We trust that this work can continue to expand as the challenges they are facing and the opportunities they hope to grasp continue to expand. Jim and Marit Wallin, Downers Grove, IL.
Every Child Ministries	71419		/users/profile/78097	peoplepc	Volunteer	5	02/19/2011	We were looking for a non profit organization worthy of our interest. We found it in ECM. Our first visit to their headquarters was impressive. Operating out of a small frame building in rural Indiana, it was immediately obvious that our donations would not be used for the director's comfort. pride, or anything else except to serve the children of  Africa. ECM serves children in many ways. The most significant to us is Haven of Hope. This is a home where unwanted children are cared for and educated. They are also taught the love that Jesus has for them through His death, burial, and RESURRECTION.  We have sponsored a young girl through ECM and have enjoyed observing her growth and developing love for Jesus. She shares a space on our refrigerator and in our hearts with our own grandchildren. We strongly support ECM  as we feel  our donations are used with integrity. Jim and Marit WallinDowners Grove,IL
Every Child Ministries	124304		/users/profile/169139	tsarina	Donor	5	10/02/2012	Every Child Ministries works to serve some of the neediest people, especially children, in Africa. The stories behind the people they help are heart wrenching, but the hope these people find in Jesus is beyond comprehension. The ministry works with sponsoring destitute children, freeing and rehabilitating slaves, feeding street children, among other things. They are small and don't always have many resources, but they are very innovative and responcible with what God does provide. They are also very greatful to donors, even for small amounts. Most importantly, the workers have great faith and believe in the power of prayer.
Every Child Ministries	124148		/users/profile/76544	Ted and Wilma	Volunteer	5	10/02/2012	ECM, Every Child Ministries. is hard to describe in a few words.  The work that is done to aid children and families in African countries has touched our hearts so deeply that it is a pleasure to volunteer and feel like we are a small part of something God inspired and blessed.  Newsletters report new and ongoing projects on a regular basis - from providing schooling and housing to some children, serving warm meals to other street children,   to working to stop child traficing and the practice of giving a child to a "priest" and that child becoming a slave for the rest of her life.  The Rousters, as directors of the mission, are personal friends who have such integrity that we know any donations given are dollars stretched to provide the maximum benefit to children in desparate situations.  
Every Child Ministries	70033		/users/profile/76544	Ted and Wilma	Volunteer	5	02/17/2011	My husband and I have been sponsors of children in Africa through the ECM Mission for many years.  It has been a blessing to us to see that the children are attending school, being cared for by loving Christians and will grow to be an asset to their community.  Because we know the directors very well as members of the same church, we see the sincerity and dedication they bring to every project that is undertaken. We have been volunteering at the mission headquarters for several years.  As a retired couple there are many opportunities to help out with mailings and fund raisers on an as needed basis.  We have met many other workers who share a passion for reaching forgotten and misused children and have grown to love their company..  Although at times it feels like what can one couple do, being a part of something that really is making a difference in the lives of so many is an experience that we will always cherish.  We would encourage any one with a heart for children to see how they could get involved.
Every Child Ministries	124024		/users/profile/168819	Denelder	Volunteer	5	10/01/2012	I've been a volunteer with ECM for about 26 years. One of the reasons I love this ministry is because the directors not only use every donation to it's maximun potential but they do it without wasting anything, or being frivolus. They have very few paid employees, so most everything that is done, is done by volunteer help. The fact that ECM has been around for this many years, trusting in God's faithfulness to provide for every need and lead them each step of the way is a testament to God's love for the African people that ECM serves!
Every Child Ministries	123971		/users/profile/75943	Nancy	Donor	5	10/01/2012	I have volunteered with ECM over the years and been a Donor regularly almost from the begining, watched this grow from a basement office to an international ministry reaching many children with physical and spiritual needs.  I am presently planning to go with them on a summer mission team next summer.
Every Child Ministries	69498		/users/profile/75943	Nancy	Volunteer	5	02/16/2011	I have been involved with ECM almost since the start 25 years ago. I have been a volunteer in the past and continue to support ECM with donations, both financial and supplies that are sent to Africa.  They are very caring and personally involved with the children they are helping. Presently a group of ladies that I am with are meeting to work on a project that will be sent to encourage the ladies in Africa.  I like that a very high percentage of the donated funds are used directly in Africa.     
Every Child Ministries	123923		/users/profile/168684	Readyteddy	Donor	5	09/30/2012	John & Lorella Rouster are wonderful examples of sharing and demonstrating the love of Christ to others. They don't just minister to the many people groups of Africa, but live their lives as caretakers of those who are image barriers of God - everyone!! The countless times that they have personally sacrificed to give and pepare to help others to give of their time, talents, and monies when available to be used as tools to carry and show he love of Chirst to others is what they do and what ECM is all about. They reach the lost for Christ by showing His love and care and sacrifice for us on the cross as they sacrifice daily to serve our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.  To have had the privilige to serve with and to be ministered to by John and Lorella through these many years has been a blessing to us and our entire family. When they ar state-side the minister in the local church at Hillside Community Church and our grandchildren are now the benefactors of their continued love and devotition to sharing and being the hands and feet of Christ. They are missionaries "as they go"  they have always been a "6" on a scale of 1-5 with five being the highest. .Ted Herndon
Every Child Ministries	123912		/users/profile/168668	Bill1arr0w	Donor	5	09/30/2012	Dear People, We think that Every Child Ministries is a great organization for bringing help and Christian love to the orphans of Africa. They give almost every cent of our donation to the children of Africa and keep us updated with news about all their projects.
Every Child Ministries	123900		/users/profile/168648	paul_computer_tutor	Donor	5	09/30/2012	The ECM website covers their work more than adequately, so I want to share my experiences as a supporter.  If my experiences are representative, then ECM not only know the recipients of their help personally, they also know their supporters personally.  It's wonderful to be more than just a donor number or an entry on a database.  This is so rare amongst charities today, and it's like a breath of fresh air.  There are many Christian charities doing good work (and one can see just how good ECM's work is on their website), but what made ECM stand out for me was their treatment of their supporters.  Long may it continue...
Every Child Ministries	123853		/users/profile/168596	kramtelbuab	Donor	5	09/29/2012	A friend of mine works with ECM in Ghana. i am well pleased with the reports we recieve for ECM showing how they positively affect the lives of the children there. I enjoy the newsletters and prayer calendar that lets me know how to specifically pray for both the workers and the people they minister to in the varioius countries. i would strongly encourage people who want to support a positive-outreach to include ECM in their prayers and financial giving.
Every Child Ministries	123830		/users/profile/168565	jjoniec	Board Member	5	09/29/2012	Every Child Ministries, lead by John & Lorella Rouster, as directors is a ministry dedicated to relieving the physcial needs of the under-resourced children in Africa. Further they bring spiritual life through the sharing of the joyous message of Jesus Christ. 
Every Child Ministries	123771		/users/profile/168499	jlschoon	Donor	5	09/28/2012	I've met John & Lorella Rouster. They started ECM more than 25 years ago. Well over 90% of the money I contrbute goes to the intended recipients-not to administration and promotion. This has to be the place to get more "bang for the buck" than almost any other organization I'm aware of. You can trust these humble folks!    JOHN
Every Child Ministries	123768		/users/profile/168498	Kenneth Dawson	Board Member	5	09/28/2012	I have been serving on the board of Every Child Ministries (ECM) for about a year.  It is without a doubt been one of the most rewarding organizations I have been associated with in my adult life.  The work that the directors, staff, and missionaries do in an attempt to spread the gospel and bring hope to the people of Africa is amazing.  Being a board member I hear first hand the work that these amazing individuals perform on a daily basis.  This includes digging wells in Africa and performing fundraisers here in the United States.  The work that is performed by the entire ECM team inspires me to want to do more for God and other individuals crying out for spiritual and material needs.  I pray that donations, support, and the prayers continue so the work in Africa can continue.  To God be the glory for the great work that is being done in Africa. 
Every Child Ministries	123732		/users/profile/168445	Meisty	Volunteer	5	09/28/2012	I was so impressed with ECM the very first time I met John & Lorella Rouster that I volunteered to travel to Africa with them for two weeks in 2002.  It was the most exciting and enlightening experience of my life.  We worked on creating an orphanage for the street kids in Accra, Ghana, W. Africa.  Visiting the street children was such an eye-opener, and realizing how far a dollar can go in Africa was also a surprise.  ECM's devotion and dedication to the forgotten children of Africa far exceeds being commendable...they constantly are striving to do more and help more in more ways.  A visit to their website reveals the many areas of their work.  I was amazed at how very much they do with minimal help from volunteers.  They waste NOTHING.  Even scraps of paper are used to print Scripture verses for the kids, and the kids cherish them!   It's hard to imagine the hardships, child trafficking, and even slavery, that are present in the lives of so many African children.  It is heart-warming to see the improvements and positive changes ECM makes every day...and they give all the glory to God.  My husband and I  have watched "our" sponsored child grow up in the orphanage since age 3.  If you've ever wanted to become involved in an organization that helps children, I can personally attest that there is no better than ECM.  If you cannot afford to sponsor a child, they have a "stand in the gap" fund, so ANY amount is always a help and is always appreciated.  I have grown to love and respect John & Lorella Rouster, ECM's founders, and their many pursuits, providing the practical love of Christ in so many ways.  May God continue to bless the Rouster's and ECM for many years to come.
Every Child Ministries	123722		/users/profile/168434	tron9960	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/28/2012	I served as chairman of the missions committee in a medium sized church. One of my jobs was to evaluate our effectiveness in our giving. I evaluated 20 missionaries, and 10 organizations. Every Child Ministries came out to be the number 1 organizations as far as effectiveness, and low cost of administration. EMC, I tip my hat to you. You are the best.                                                       Dave LaBerge
Every Child Ministries	123648		/users/profile/168336	chun	Donor	5	09/27/2012	My impression of ECM is that of fine stewardship of the provision from the Lord! Secondly, the mission field that ECM serves is probably the most demanding, yet ECM seems to want to be low key. I remember the words from Jesus about "doing the good deed/serving in secret...so that the Father who sees in secret would repay..." May the Lord continue to bless and shine through this wonderful organization! 
Every Child Ministries	123647		/users/profile/77840	CarJam	General Member of the Public	5	09/27/2012	I am very impressed with this organization's sacrificial leadership; they are personally committed to keeping their overhead expenses low.  The salary of the highest paid employee is quite low, and that is extremely inspiring to me.  I don't have a large income, so I sacrifice a lot to give more.  It is important to me to give to a charity with leaders that personally practice that same conviction.   ECM is that charity. 96% of their funding is used directly on their good works toward the needy and the oppressed.  Live simply so others can simply live.  Thank you ECM!
Every Child Ministries	71205		/users/profile/77840	CarJam	Donor	5	02/18/2011	One day I took approximately 5 hours to  thoroughly research charities because I wanted to be sure that our donations were being used responsibly.   That is how I discovered that Every Child Ministries excels tremendously when it comes to integrity and the responsible handling of donations.  They really are an example for other organizations to follow.   The administration at Every Child Ministries go without themselves to ensure as much as possible gets to those who are truly in need.   Because I know they are making these self sacrifices, I am truly inspired to make sacrifices myself so that I can also give as much as I can.  
Every Child Ministries	123644		/users/profile/168331	Jenny27	General Member of the Public	5	09/27/2012	ECM is an amazing organization which works tirelessly to help the people of Africa and spread the gospel of Jesus Christ. I have been an ECM prayer partner for 7 years, since a friend volunteered in Ghana over the summer, and have continued to support this ministry in prayer ever since. They are absolutely dedicated to the betterment of the lives of the people of Africa, physically, emotionally, and spiritually. 
Every Child Ministries	123639		/users/profile/168327	glaib	Donor	5	09/27/2012	ECM Africa is an excellent organization.  They are doing a vital ministry with children in Africa.  They ar very thorough in their outreach and I have the utmost respect for them.
Every Child Ministries	123586		/users/profile/168266	Melissa78	Donor	5	09/27/2012	My sister was a missionary for Every Child Ministries in Ghana. She fell in love with the kids and was so impressed by how hard all of the volunteers work to keep children safe, cared for, and loved. There is such a threat for children to be sacrificed, abandoned, abused, and neglected, and Every Child Ministries cares for these children very much. They use their resources wisely and take every measure to use God's money where it is most needed. Every email response and interaction with ECM has been so personal and they are so grateful for any help and support they receive. They are making a difference and sacrifice much for the forgotten children of Africa. 
Every Child Ministries	123578		/users/profile/168258	maranatha	Volunteer	5	09/27/2012	I went to Ghana West Africa with ECM for 3 years. I was telling people it was the second greatest experience of my life behind my conversion to Jesus Christ. My wife reminded me it was my 3rd greatest experience of my life.Ministering with ECM in Africa was the the THIRD greatest experience of my life behind meeting Jesus and marrying my sweet wife Leslie.God's mighty hand is on this ministry.They are making such a tremendous impact for Christ.Look at God,He took 2 farmers fron Indiana and is tuirning the continent of Afica upside down. I am amazed that they can do so much with so little.Anyone who goes with ECM on a short term or long term missions trip will never be the same .May Jesus Christ continue to be lifted up through ECM.

Every Child Ministries	123567		/users/profile/168244	Callie19	Donor	5	09/27/2012	My journey with ECM has been an unusual one to be sure. God called me to this ministry thru another great program called Steer inc. I was told pretty straight forwardly to get a milk cow, so through them I bought a cow and when I was picking a missionary to give my profits too, this one really stood out, children are my passion in this life, I love them, and have a strong desire to show them and tell them that they are precious and sacredly loved by our Great God! So what better way to reach this goal than by supporting those who are sharing the gospel and loving on God's children every day! By milking my cow I am able to do what I would not otherwise be able to, support someone who is carrying out my dream of serving the children, while I am in school and working to pay for that. Someday I hope to be there with them serving my Lord by serving the least of these, but until that day comes I have been so blessed and comforted knowing that everything I can give is serving to further His kingdom and gives me comfort knowing that these little ones are being shown our love, but more importantly being shown the love of their heavenly father. I truly believe that ECM is a beautiful reflection of our Savior's heart
Every Child Ministries	123566		/users/profile/168243	Indianabuc	Donor	5	09/27/2012	It is wonderful seeing the impact our support provides to the children of Africa.
Every Child Ministries	123558		/users/profile/168233	jack.parr	Donor	5	09/27/2012	ECM does such a great job of taking young children off the streets in Africa an providing them with a home, school and food.  They also have raised thousands of dollars to release young women who were made slaves to tribal leaders.  ECM has a very low overhead cost (5-7%).  They have so many volunteers who provide basic resources to run the organization here in the USA plus providing help and leadership in Africa.
Every Child Ministries	123546		/users/profile/76270	joeym11	Volunteer	5	09/27/2012	Tell them all the good works they to to save the children and slave women in africa. They do a wonderful job.

Every Child Ministries	123540		/users/profile/168214	bookaholic	Donor	5	09/27/2012	I have used another organization to sponsor a child before and they sent a letter maybe once a year. ECM sends a letter from my sponsored child much more frequently. Also, I used to wonder how much of my money got to my sponsored child, with ECM, I know for sure they maximize their gifts to the children and squeak every cent for all it is worth. I love that they take donations of items as well as money also! I may not always have a lot of money but I always have useful stuff to donate! 
Every Child Ministries	79572		/users/profile/86899	Dana Neevel	Volunteer	5	02/28/2011	I spent about 14 months serving at Haven of Hope- a ministry of ECM in Ghana- which serves the most vulnerable children who have been abandoned, abused, or orphaned. I was so blessed to be a part of these kids' lives through the ups and downs. ECM is doing wonderful work there to provide for the physical, academic, spiritual, and social well-being of the kids. I have personally seen where many of the kids came from and can honestly say that God is using ECM to give these kids hope for a future that they otherwise would not have.

WHAT AN AWESOME GOD WE SERVE AND HOW THE CHILDREN WILL LEARN ABOUT JESUS AND HOW HE SUFFERED FOR ALL OF US.  I PRAY THAT ALL THE CHILDREN IN AFRICA WILL LEARN AND GROW AND WILL HAVE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT OUR SAVIOR THROUGH THE PEOPLE WHO WORK WITH THIS ORGANIZATION.   MAY GOD BLESS THE WORLD AND GIVE US PEACE.

Every Child Ministries	78000		/users/profile/85267	quijak	Donor	5	02/26/2011	I came to know of this charity through a long time friend... a dear & wonderful Christian woman named Agnes Schoon.  After her passing and knowing that she was a volunteer at ECM and had sponsored children in Africa through their ministry,  I decided it would be a great way to honor her memory and her good works by sponsoring a child myself.  I enjoy the letters from my sponsored child and know that ECM is teaching him not only about the love of Christ but is also helping him with everyday needs to better his life.   Lori
Every Child Ministries	76836		/users/profile/84072	Joeandelaine	Donor	5	02/26/2011	The Lord Jesus told us in Matthew 18 that children are precious to Him and should be cared for and not sinned against.  Every Child Ministries has been established to care for children and obey this command of the Lord.  Through the establishment of Sunday Schools, through Haven of Hope Home, through trokosi release, etc. I have appreciated the way that directors John and Lorella Rouster have reached out to the poor and weak with the good news of Christ.  Our church has had the privilege of supporting their work over the past decade.   Even though the Rousters are getting older, they are always looking at new and improved ways to care in Jesus' name.  I am aware that they have served in DRC, Ghana, and Uganda...and there are probably more that I am not immediately aware of.  And seeing their track record, I suppose that if the Lord tarries, they will blossom out into more and more countries through their ministry. I'm glad to support ECM and our church family appreciates their care.  They give us an opportunity to care too.  May God bless ECM.
Every Child Ministries	75827		/users/profile/82821	Mark L	Volunteer	5	02/25/2011	I first heard of Every Child Ministries when Co-Founders John & Lorella Rouster began attending my church in the 1980's.  As I got to know more about them and the ministry God had called them to, I was impressed by their deep love and extreme dedication to the children of Africa.  They had willingly left their families and friends to move thousands of miles away to bring the Gospel to children who had never had the opportunity to hear that Jesus loves them.  Through these past 25+ years no decision has been made nor any money spent without first wrapping everything in prayer and then following God's leading.  The Rousters' lives are a testament to their firm belief that ECM is completely God's ministry and not their own.
Every Child Ministries	75784		/users/profile/82777	geokam	Donor	5	02/25/2011	We searched extensively online, looking for a Christian organization that is dedicated to helping, teaching, and building up those in need.  ECM's team shares the love and education necessary to allow those they help become effective members of their communities.Additionally, their funds management is spectacular, and the salaries paid are extremely low compared to MOST charities we've heard of online or through TV or any other media.  In other words, as a donor to ECM, you are NOT paying for an extravagant lifestyle for the leaders of the organization; most of the money goes straight through to the kids and programs they provide.
Every Child Ministries	75712		/users/profile/82703	kari	General Member of the Public	5	02/25/2011	I have known about ECM ministries for many years now and am always amazed at how God is using the people in this organization to make a difference in so many lives of not only African children, but also the men and women who have been blinded by false teachings.  The hearts of those who willingly give of their time, money, and hard work just shows the love and dedication this ministry has to God and the African people.  May God continue to use and bless this ministry.

In our 15 years of working with non-profits, we have never seen an organization with such dedication to serving the needs of children and using the greatest percentage of each donated dollar to do it.  Their co-directors, staff, board and volunteers are all selfless-hardworking people that simply carry out their stated mission in WORD and DEED to the best of their God-given abilities....each and every day they are given.  It is a privilege to be part of what God is doing through His blessed and driven hands and feet from Every Child Ministries! 
Every Child Ministries	75456		/users/profile/82423	jwk1	General Member of the Public	5	02/25/2011	We have related with the founders of Every Child Ministries on numerous occasions and strongly affirm the ministry they are doing in Africa.

Every Child Ministries	75377		/users/profile/82340	ginger	Donor	5	02/25/2011	My contact with Every Child MInistries is as a supporter of one of their short-term missionaries.  Two of my friends have participated in ECM's short term missionary summer trips.  Since they are responsible for all of the funding involved in their trip, I have donated to help make the trip possible.  As a result I got feedback via email while they were serving in AFrica, as well as detailed personal reports when they returned.  My one friend has gone several times, which indicates how good the short term missionary experience through ECM is. What impresses me as a supporter is the extent to which the summer missionaries are involved in the missionary experience.  In college ,any of my friends went on short term missionary trips with athletics or set up by the colleges.  These trips offered people a taste or missionary work; a feel for the foreign country; exposure to the culture differences; and a desire to both help the people and evangelize.  But they remained tourists - the trips included tourist attractions; the housing was separate for the Americans and the food was good. With Every Child Ministries, if you go on a short term trip - you ARE the missionary.  John and Lorella find out how you want to serve and evaluate your gifts and experiences, and then they help you become a missionary for the time you are there.  If you are in the orphange, you live with the children; you help with meal preparation; clean-up; and when you see a child who needs a hug, needs their hair brushed, needs assistance with a math problem, you jump in and help.  If you are in the street ministry you become a missionary nurse;  You are caring for wounds with the few supplies you brought; you are washing hurt children's feet; and you are actively sharing Jesus's love to the children.  Because a good portion of ECM's ministries occur in English speaking countries, you are able to share your faith directly. I am so impressed with the way ECM manages to turn a person into a real missionary who is serving Jesus on the front lines and saving souls of little children as soon as you step foot on foreign soil.
Every Child Ministries	75327		/users/profile/82288	flat screen	Volunteer	3	02/25/2011	My sincere gratitude to the directors and the entire management of every child ministry through whose effort, it has become possible that the good news is being preached to children and teenagers with the required materilas that help them to understand the word of God, in its simple form.To all membners and staff which have contributed in one way or the other, whether in kind or cash which have kept these vision going, we say thank you and God bless you, And whatever contribution you have made, may it to be a seed in the field of God which will yield increase in the coming days.may God bless you as you give to the work of God.
Every Child Ministries	75080		/users/profile/82018	Ruth A.	Donor	5	02/24/2011	I have been associated with Every Child Ministry from the beginning. I have donated since the beginning. I have chosen this to be my main ministry to support other than my home churches because the way they use every monetary or used item to it's full potential. Examples are used Christmas cards are transformed into Crosses that were given as rewards for children living in Congo for learning memory verses. Children are very excited to have the Crosses and are willing to learn several verses to get one. ECM takes used medicine bottles and make sewing kits to give out. Used Bible school materials are used in Ghana at Haven of Hope for teaching.

It has truly been more of a blessing to us than we feel like we are a blessing to it! The work that Every Child Ministries does for the African people is so unbelievable.  The lives that have been touched and made better by ECM are countless.  The extremely unselfish and personal way that the organization is run matches none.  In today's world, it is hard to come by such an organization! We will gladly continue our association with and support of Every Child Ministries for years to come!
Every Child Ministries	74531		/users/profile/81441	Joseph Nkoso	Client Served	5	02/24/2011	I am JOseph Nkoso, in Democratic Republic of Congo. I am so glad of the support ECM is offering to sponsor vulnarable , abandoned, children victim of rape and acused to be a sorcerer who had been undrer critical situation and now have found a good sens of life. There are three children, one of them had been thown out while she was only one year old, and with ECM support, we have done a great work to offer her parental affection during more that four years with support of ECM . Now she goes to school as other children do.  Another girl who had been victim of rape on the street had been  rescued  and brought to stay with us  to care for her. she spent more that two years with us and all this had been the sponsorship of ECM that had allowes us to deal with her. W She sixten years old , very inteligent and goes to school because ECM is supporting her. Another children accused to be a sorcerer had been rescued by us, after he phad passed two yeras on street while he was four years old. we cared for him and now the realives of his mother who died by AIDS came and took responsilities to care for him because ECM sponsored him. At present, we are going one with one girl of seven years old whose parents died and who are at present sponsored by ECM. Her sister with be on the folowing month by the grace of God  sponsor by ECM.  We have close contact with ECM and we are going on helping two widow who have AIDS and are no longer able to support their children ( five at all) and we how eyes are turned to ECM for sponsoring them. You see that ECM is a worthy christian orgaization that brings hope to the forgoten children here where we live.  the good way for  You  to sponsor children in Africa is to pass by ECM.  Pastor Joseph Nkoso Kinshasa
Every Child Ministries	74518		/users/profile/81428	Roxanne Petrie	Volunteer	5	02/24/2011	What I love most about Every Child Ministries is the personal touch I receive.  I never feel that I am just another number as a sponsor to this surprisingly extensive ministry.  Each month, after I submit my donation to support one of Africas forgotten children, I always receive a receipt with a handwritten message/verse from one of ECMs volunteers continually thanking me for my support.   In addition to being a sponsor, which is rewarding in itself, I especially appreciate the many ways one can volunteereven from another state.  I sew simple skirts for their orphanage, Haven of Hope in Ghana, W. Africa.  The skirts are hand carried to Ghana, or elsewhere, as missionaries travel back and forth.  Recently, I received email from ECM with photos of a young girl at Haven of Hope who was wearing one of my skirts and holding another one.  She was new to the orphanage and was provided with proper clothing.  ECM had the forethought to take pictures of this smiling girl, wearing a new found dignity, and sent them to me along with her life story.  It warmed my heart.  Being a sponsor has given me great joy! I also believe ECM is extremely fiscally responsible in their efforts to take the gospel to parts of the world where it is truly needed.   
Every Child Ministries	74471		/users/profile/81365	boniface4jesus	Volunteer	5	02/24/2011	ECM is a good ministry, helping reach people in Africa with the Gospel of Jesus Christ. The ministry has been founded, by the Lords leading, through John and Lorella Rouster, who were a couple of local farmers. The ministrys local headquarters seeks  and receives local people to volunteer with projects. Our previous pastor, and his wife went to the mission field in Ghana Africa through ECM. Although they are still doing mission work in Ghana Africa (the northwestern part), ECM has helped them as needed. ECM has been instrumental in helping many witch doctors and others in similar situations realize the errors of their ways, and also, in the process, obtain the freedom of the slaves within the witch doctors service. ECM also has many similar ministries in oter countries in Africa.
Every Child Ministries	74322		/users/profile/81204	Ms. D	General Member of the Public	5	02/24/2011	I got involved with ECM at my Church, because we support them as a whole.  Last year when Mr. Rouster came and gave their presentation, I was truly impressed with all that they do overseas.  He was asking members to support a child.  I had to give my support.  Since having a child overseas, she sends me cards or one time I got her handprint.  Her name is Irene and I know she is being blessed since ECM.  I know ECM does excellent work, they are loving, caring individuals.  And they love spreading the love, you cannot find more joyful souls (angels) than the individual at ECM.  The work they do is excellent on all levels, truly excellent!  I pray that God would continue blessed their efforts. Blessed,Evangelist Dannette Stevens
Every Child Ministries	74318		/users/profile/81198	thekid	Donor	5	02/24/2011	This organization is unlike any other that I've come across. From a personal standpoint, my mother is albino and has been through alot in her life in regards to treatment from all nationalities from African Americans to caucasians. When I saw this organization aiding the albino kids in Africa and preventing them from absolute death and genocide, I knew this was truly the non profit organization that not only Was a nonconglomerate type entity that truly carried out their missions, without forcing or overwhelming their own values on individuals like so many other groups, but that ECM was a group that I relate to personally. I hope to one day spare my time and resources to this group. -D.

Every Child Ministries	74262		/users/profile/81139	sandi	Volunteer	5	02/23/2011	Every Child Ministries is a ministry which seeks to share the love of Christ with the lost children of Africa.  ECM not only seeks to feed children spiritually but also physically.  They are the hands and feet of Christ.

Every Child Ministries	74237		/users/profile/81112	R and L	Donor	5	02/23/2011	This Mission Headquarters is located in the community that we now call home.  Through the years, we have seen how God has blessed this humble couple and the work they do while sharing their faith with the often forgotten children in Africa. They have made a safe place for many African children to call home at Haven of Hope,  a school where they are lovingly taught, sponsors found to help meet their needs, food and clothing for their bodies, and examples of Christ and His Love lived out before them...........all because John and Lorella love the Lord and chose to obey His call to follow Him.  The Rousters are diligent and frugal with the resources ECM receives.  May God continue to bless their work as it truly is..................All about HIM, our Lord and Savior.

A couple months ago a friend and I took a 2 1/2 ride south to visit Every Child and to bring school supplies our church had collected for Ghana.

Every Child Ministries	74036		/users/profile/80902	Gerry	Volunteer	4	02/23/2011	My wife and I became involved with Every Child Ministries when a friend of mine from work invited us to a Fund-raising dinner several years ago.  We became involved as volunteers shortly after that dinner.  She was much more involved than I was in the beginning due to work schedules.  Since I'm now retired,  I help to keep the books on a regular basis.  John and Lorella are very frugal and follow tight parameters on the expenditure of any and all funds that are donated to ECM.   Each of us have particular talents to share and do so willingly to help the children of Africa through the outreach of ECM.
Every Child Ministries	73984		/users/profile/80847	susan	Donor	5	02/23/2011	I have been involved with Every Child Ministries for over 25 years, and have been blessed to know John and Lorella Rouster and their love for the children of Africa.  I have worked many of their fund raising  garage sales, where I have seen first hand the generosity of the people who come out to help  with their time and physical strength, to see that every effort is made to assure a successful outcome for this ministry.  I personally have not been to Africa with the Rouster's but my husband has, and he has seen the love they have for the forgotten and  abused children they minister to.  He has seen first hand how hard they work and what they have accomplished.   I know with all my heart that God hand selected the Rouster's for this time in history.    My husband and I know without a doubt that when we donate money for a specific cause it is going only to that cause and every dollar is accounted for.  Every Child Ministries is an example of compassion, courage and strength for a hurting Continent.  
Every Child Ministries	73920		/users/profile/80783	David B Chgo	Board Member	5	02/23/2011	Having volunteered at ECM since my first short-term missionary trip in 1995, I have repeatedly seen the Lord Jesus demonstrate His love for African children by using ECM to minister to their varied spiritual, physical, and emotions needs. The Lord also demonstrated His love for me by allowing me to participate in His great work of drawing people of all types from all over the world to Himself through ECM. ECMs biblical focus, reliance on African staff, holistic ministry, prudent financial management, and commitment to the task, convince me that the Lord is pleased that I followed His directions to serve Him at ECM and I am now and will be eternally grateful for the opportunity.  
Every Child Ministries	73909		/users/profile/80774	pofalici	Volunteer	5	02/23/2011	I have known Joh and Lorella Rouster since beforfe they started Every Child Ministries. What the have accomplished and continue to is amazing. When working in Zaire, they lived in the remotest places under the worse conditions while producing huge results in the lives of the Africans. Their work then and now is a combination of practical and spiritual benefits that are immeasurable. They opened a medical clinic and John initially ran it saving lives and effectively treating everything from "river blindness" to infertiity. untold thousand of people's lives were changed and improved in Zaire.\When politicla problems made it impossible for them to stay in Zaire, they moved on to other African nations and expanded their work to providing homes and education for street kids, rescuing sex slaves from temples and providing these women and their children with emotional healing and education so they can support themselves and working to unit street children with their families. They are the most effective and far-reaching ministry I know of. Each year the seem to expand to a  new area of need and meet it such as building huts for dislocated families, building a library, expanding their outreach to a new group of hurting people or children.  Until very recent years all they have accomplished was done by volunteers help in their headquarters in the U.S. This is very unusual as most mission organizations I know of have large expensive headquarters and many paid workers. The last I knew of they have one full-time paid employee who used to be a volunteer. John himself works to support his own household when he is not in Africa. Supporting ECM produces almost 100% benefit to any donors goals to helping the people being ministered to. ECM has constantly produced life-changing benefits to those on the receiving end of their many good works. They train and equip local people to become leaders and have multipled their work  constantly through this method. They truly love the people of Africa and that is where they are in spirit even when they are not actually there.

Every Child Ministries	73877		/users/profile/80734	Linda McCollough	General Member of the Public	5	02/23/2011	ECM is a great organization. If your church or organization is looking for a group to support, plan a trip, raise funds, or as an individual you are looking for one of those awesome opportunities-choose Every Child Ministries. Lorella and John have cultivated a mission-driven organization that strives to better the lives of children, and their families through caring for their basic needs, education and developing opportunities for them to succeed and climb from difficult places.I have participated in 2 trips to Ghana with them, and can't wait to go another time. ECM really has a heart for serving people that have too often fallen between the cracks or in some cases been marked as the group that doesn't matter. I respect and support ECM because of their heart for ministry and opportunities they strive to create for others.

Every Child Ministries	73502		/users/profile/80329	Heather	Volunteer	4	02/23/2011	In the past years I have volunteered with this organization and they have been a great resource to children of war in different countries in Africa. I am currently a donor for one of the children in their sponsorship program and it's truly been a blessing to be able to support one of the children that I met in person when I was a volunteer. I now see this child participating in school and being a student and overall feelng like he can relate to his peers in the community who are enrolled in school as well...I know this kind of experience builds a positive self image and can create opportunities for him/his family down the road in completing his education...and to know that I am part of that is beyond rewarding. I know that this ministry provides great service despite how small this NGO is...I was there to execute their services in partnering with them in past volunteership to provide a food program, a clothing program, a teaching program, a medical first aid program, and a sponsorship program.Lorella and John's ministry is a labor of love to childen and families who have no resouces and support, and their ministry has surely grown over time to expand services to other countries and even different regions in countries in Africa. I look forward to continuing my sponsorship with ECM, and the possibility of returning as a volunteer in the near future to embark on another journey with this team is more than likely. 
Every Child Ministries	73476		/users/profile/80301	kassiedan	Volunteer	5	02/23/2011	I volunteered in Ghana with ECM in the summer of 2007. From my first interactions with the organization at the Urbana conference, i was impressed by their deep sincerity and commitment to what they do. They really love each of the women and children they work with and work with devotion to bring about positive change in their lives. They push through all challenges and always find a way to finish something they feel called to do. All the programs, from Haven of Hope to the trokosi liberations are motivated by a strong faith and bring about lasting change in these lives. I have nothing but deep admiration for ECM and the work that they do.

I am thankful to the Lord for allowing me this opportunity and have been encouraged as I have seen someone rescued from the streets to now a young man with an engaging smile.  Being able to make an impact on even one, is more than worthwhile.  AND my small church Sunday school were thrilled to gather up boxes of school supplies that went directly to Uganda!
Every Child Ministries	72078		/users/profile/78817	pohlkat99	Donor	5	02/21/2011	ECM is amazing.  They are truly following God's heart in their African ministries.

Every Child Ministries	71735		/users/profile/78441	Irene	General Member of the Public	5	02/20/2011	ECM provides direct, hands-on care and services where it is needed most; and most deserved: to victim children.  They are selfless, live very modestly, and work tirelessly year-round, year after year, and continue to make a very big difference in these young people's lives.  I really admire John and Lorella and their ECM workers and volunteers and have complete trust and confidence in them.
Every Child Ministries	71565		/users/profile/78262	Debby H.	General Member of the Public	5	02/19/2011	ECM is located in my home town. They have a simple headquarters. The leaders of this ministry have been to my home church and they are regular, everyday, ordinary people who have a passion and call for ministering to children in Africa. In this day and age of many so called Christian ministries doing nothing more than taking people's money, ECM is the real thing.  
Every Child Ministries	71301		/users/profile/77966	Taalah	Volunteer	5	02/19/2011	I found out about ECM after hearing about the atrocities done to women and children in Trokosi shrines in West Africa. I wanted to find an organization to donate to who would help. An online search brought me to ECM. Besides liberation of shrine slaves, they help street children learn a vocation, provide for families ravaged by war in Uganda, and help African Church leaders. What I really admire about them is the faith in God that is displayed. They send out prayer requests at least once a month because they believe prayer is powerful. When faced with setbacks, they don't complain, but ask God to continue to provide for them to do his work. The people who run the office in America are friendly, candid, and even ask us if there is anything we would like them to pray for. In ECM, I see a group of people seeking Jesus Christ. 
Every Child Ministries	71028		/users/profile/77651	Carl	Volunteer	5	02/18/2011	     I have been familiar with ECM for approximately 12 years as my Church has supported ECM as one of its missionaries.  My family and I became much more familiar with ECM by sponsoring 5 children in Uganda during the last three years.  My wife and I have also attended ECM's last two banquets in our state.      All of my contacts with the Rousters and the ECM staff have been pleasant and rewarding.  ECM is a Christ-centered ministry that is run very efficiently.  Through God's financial blessings and our utmost trust in ECM's mission, we have also started monthly giving to ECM "Where Needed Most" and "The Way Home" project in Uganda.             Carl

I  was looking for a place where I could become a volunteer. I helped make educational items for children in Africa, in my home.  I have also made gift packages over the years.  Later I sponsored several children and still do.  I was drawn to ECM because of their history and their founders.  I lived in a nearby town and know they truly exist. They are who they say they are and the donations do reach those in need of our help.

There are so many different ways for people to get involved vounteering at ECM. They don't shy away from anyone helping, no matter how much or how little the volunteer may do. I feel like since I did not give a large chunk of my time to ECM, I really looked at the organization from a distance. The work that I did was topical things such as cleaning or organizing. I rarely delved into the details of the work that they were doing. Nonetheless, I could see their heart and passion for the children of Africa. Their dedication, despite trials is inspiring. They truly are an organization that lives to serve the children of Africa and see them come into relationship with Jesus Christ. 
Every Child Ministries	70546		/users/profile/77115	Cheri Mc.	Donor	5	02/18/2011	ECM was founded by my Aunt and Uncle many years ago.  Uncle John and Aunt Lorella have dedicated their lives to ECM.  It is amazing how it has grown over the years.  It is also amazing all of the great things happening because of the ministry.  Keep up the good work!!!
Every Child Ministries	70374		/users/profile/76931	Deb Herrold	Donor	5	02/17/2011	My husband & I support 2 children.  I have been very impressed with the person attention to each child and donor.  The children faithfully send reports of their progress and pictures they draw for us.  I live close to the ECM office so I go to the office and see the operation first hand.  They are doing a very good job of loving the forgotten and unloved children in Africa.  I am very happy to be involved with this ministry, and I know the Lord is pleased.  
Every Child Ministries	70353		/users/profile/76903	tustin7	Donor	5	02/17/2011	ECM is my favorite non-profit ministry.  I love that they support the children of Africa and provide orphanages for those on the streets.  They are also involved in freeing slaves and stopping trafficking.  The newsletters are so down-to earth and real and the reader gets a genuine sense of what is going on there.   I feel as though they are very resourceful with the money that is donated and that it goes a long way.  I trust ECM and feel that they use donated money wisely.  They are also trying to help the families there to be successful in a trade that can be self-supporting.
Every Child Ministries	70263		/users/profile/76798	mschuman	General Member of the Public	5	02/17/2011	My Sunday School class became involved with ECM by sponsoring a child. The feedback we received was awesome. We received newsletters and individual letters from our child. We also received report cards and other updates from his teachers and caregivers. We were able to send notes to our child and received notes back from him so we know they were delivered quickly half a world away. ECM is serious about caring for children and they do an incredible job preparing them for their world.
Every Child Ministries	70207		/users/profile/76730	jpadams	Volunteer	5	02/17/2011	I became interested in ECM's ministry because my church and I very much support the work this ministry is doing in Ghana, Africa. We support the Driscoll's , 2 missionaries in this organization, with prayer support and financial support.The Driscoll's were at our church in early January and showed us videos of the school that has been completed and many of the children they are working with. I feel very strongly in their efforts to free the Trokosi slaves, educating the people about this practice and educating the children , as well as meeting physical needs. I am excitedly awaiting my trip to Ghana the end of July to work as a volunteer!  I know any money they receive is put to good use.I feel like they are very worthy of any monies your organization could reward them with!
Every Child Ministries	70160		/users/profile/76679	ELLA	Board Member	5	02/17/2011	I have served on the board at ECM for a number of years.  John and Lorella are outstanding directors.  They are very organized and very thrifty in everything they do.  They give of their time and talents 24/7.  They are always available.  We  sponsor a child at Haven of Hope  and it has been a joy joy to watch her learn and grow.  We write letters to each other and ECM sends us her report cards.  I also volunteer one day a week and do a variety of things.  There is a lot of volunteer work to be done.  Won't you come and help us? ? ?
Every Child Ministries	70153		/users/profile/76671	wilma1222	Donor	5	02/17/2011	Every Child Ministries offers hope to children who have lived without hope and the expectation of ever having any of their dreams come true.  I personally have been to Uganda with ECM and have been so impressed with the National staff and most certainly with the founders of this ministry!  While they are fully committed to improving the physical well being of children, John & Lorella Rouster are people who realize that children who learn about God, who He is and commit their lives to Jesus Christ have a hope that even the most horrific conditions will never be able to destroy! 
Every Child Ministries	70137		/users/profile/76654	Alan Phillips	Donor	5	02/17/2011	ECM has been an amazing ministry for my family.  We have a child (Denis) that we support through them.  They are very upfront about the costs and where the money goes and how it helps.  I have very consistent reports and messages that come back from Denis, along with pictures, report cards, and notes from him.  My family LOVES what we do for him, and feel he's a part of our family.  I'm also encouraged by everything the ministry does.  Connecting these kids to Christ is priority #1, but not just in words...in actions too.  Digging wells for fresh water, raising schools, providing essentials, and more.  All of it shows their heart and more.  May God bless all their efforts.
Every Child Ministries	69979		/users/profile/76487	MBenefield	Donor	5	02/17/2011	My daughter visited ECM in Ghana, Africa in 2008.  We got to hear and see the difference that ECM is making in the lives of the children there.  This is the only ministry that I'm aware of that works toward freeing the Trokosi slaves!  What a great work!  Several shrines have liberated the slaves that were held there and a great many of them have come to the knowledge of a loving Savior through the efforts of ECM!  We were so impressed that we have been sponsoring a little boy there ever since 2008.  We have had the privilege of watching him grow and knowing that his life is much better due to ECM and our donations.
Every Child Ministries	69971		/users/profile/76476	Gennifer	Donor	5	02/17/2011	Every Child Ministries is people truly helping people who are in need and changing lives for the better.     We know the director and family on a personal basis from our church in Indiana and they have done a wonderful, sacrificial and loving job for a long time now!    We are supporters of a young lady in Africa who has written us personally and told us how ECM has helped her family and how thankful she is to our family for being a part of her life.  To read updates and receive the prayer requests from this group of people, you can see for yourself the amazing work they are doing!  They truly are making a difference for people here and for eternity.  Thank you!

Every Child Ministries	69843		/users/profile/76341	Dale	Donor	5	02/17/2011	We have known, prayed, and worshipped  with John and Lorella for over twenty years. The words Integrity and Faith instantly come to mind. As a man,  I see  John as a role model and a Man of God. The Rousters are totally driven by Biblical  guidelines and a great Love for God's Children. They are Christ centered and Christ focused  and driven to help take the Children of Africa off the streets, out of the slave camps and put them in Sunday School !!  As they diligently push on towards the goal of leading every child to Christ; they also attend to practicle matters like health, sanitation, nutrition and education.  We serve an Awesome God; and it's amazing to see how the people who work with E.C.M. find that their lives also have been improved and enriched !! I whole heartedly support this great organization and pray for every life ever touched by the efforts and Love of the people of E.C.M.  Thank you, Lord, for  bringing John and Lorella into our lives.  They Make a Difference !!
Every Child Ministries	69702		/users/profile/76180	njdboerne	Donor	5	02/16/2011	I have met the Rousters and have friends that have worked short  term  with them in Africa.

Every Child Ministries	69681		/users/profile/76156	Cheryl B.	Volunteer	5	02/16/2011	I have seen first hand the difference ECM has made in the lives of hundreds of children in Africa.  They work diligently to see children are fed physically and spiritually.  They are responsible with ALL of the  resources available to them.  ECM also works at helping to teach and train nationals in order to help more children than they can reach alone!
Every Child Ministries	69640		/users/profile/76098	Kathy C.	Donor	4	02/16/2011	We have been associated with this ECM for many years.  The Rousters have been faithful to the calling the Lord Jesus has put on their hearts.  They have brought the freedom of Christ to thousands of children and the literal freedom to many sex slaves.  We have sponsored a child for several years and love how we see the monies go to helping the chidren and not taking much for the administrative role that they play.
Every Child Ministries	69633		/users/profile/76091	lynn	Donor	5	02/16/2011	ECM is an outstanding organization that is completely Christ focused and helping the most helpless.

Every Child Ministries	69527		/users/profile/75975	arnaser	Donor	5	02/16/2011	ECM is a great organization and we have enjoyed being a donor for several years.   They send us cards and pictures that our sponsored child has made just for us.  It is so nice to get letters, drawings, pictures, and more from our ECM child.   We know that they are a great organization and the money gets put to good use.

National FFA Organization	255591	3	/users/profile/179670	Anna28	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/09/2015	The National FFA Association gives opportunities to thousands of youth across America to be a part of something. They gain skills in leadership, public speaking, responsibility, citizenship just to name a few.  Without FFA I would not have the amazing career as an agricultural educator and the opportunity to give to others an amazing, life-long learning experience.
National FFA Organization	133906	1	/users/profile/179670	Anna28	Advisor	5	11/05/2012	As an FFA member in high school I found a place where others held my rural, agricultural values and a place where I could spend a lot of time with horses! I knew in my freshman year that that was what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. The FFA and agriculture classes gave me focus which served me well through all of my high school years and allowed me to go to college knowing what I was going to do when I graduated. Since I became an agriculture instructor and an FFA Advisor I get to live my dream every day. I get to work with students who find value in themselves through the FFA program, and gain a greater knowledge of our incredible agriculture industry. The National FFA Organization has made this possible for millions of students through its inception in 1928. Thank you for making a positive difference in students lives!
National FFA Organization	154320	2	/users/profile/187499	bark river	General Member of the Public	5	04/11/2013	We have 3 generations of FFA members in our family.  FFA gives young people a purpose and focus.  They learn many life skills along with the new technology involved in agriculture.  FFA helps produce young people who are the next leaders in their communities and our country.  Young people develop good a good work ethic and a positive attitude towards life which makes them wonderful leaders.  FFA is the best youth program in our country in my opinion.  
National FFA Organization	141234	2	/users/profile/187499	bark river	Volunteer	5	11/19/2012	As an FFA wife.mom and supporter I have seen the amazing benefits of FFA 1st hand.  My husband and our 3 sons all learned life long lessons and skills from their time in FFA and their Vo Ag classes.  FFA promotes and encourages the best from young people.  The young people that experience FFA are the hope and future of our country as they strive to work hard to accomplish their goals in life.  Plus FFA helped our family restore our barn!!  FFA is a great organiztion and is more than worthy as a top nonprofit.
National FFA Organization	152336	2	/users/profile/179474	Will15	Volunteer	5	04/05/2013	Very impactful organization and consistently develops young leaders.
National FFA Organization	133721	2	/users/profile/179474	Will15	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/05/2012	I have seen nearly every aspect of FFA and always been impressed.  As a student member it was invaluable for me to develop leadership skills and technical knowledge and expertise in the agricultural industry.  In leadership roles I met so many people, developed my public speaking skills, and really grew as a person.  After college I was an ag teacher and FFA advisor and saw first hand how students are impacted by the programs and did my part to pay it forward.  Now as a national staff person I continue to be inspired everyday by the great work that staff, advisors, volunteers are doing to ensure that students today have the same great experience and great opportunities as were available 5, 10, 15, and even 85 years ago.

I was in the FFA in high school and still talk about those experiences today.  I still have my FFA jacket.  My four children were all very active in The FFA and still are.  No doubt that The FFA played a major role in developing who they are today..... Premier Leadership, Personal Growth and Career Success, that is what they instill in their FFA members
National FFA Organization	144525	1	/users/profile/191061	AnitaS	Client Served	5	11/29/2012	FFA gave me the confidence to speak in public, lead groups, work as part of an effective team, and continually reach for higher goals.

My husband works long hours doing what he loves, making a difference in the lives of amazing young people.

The combination of passionate FFA advisors and volunteers who believe strongly in the program makes all the difference! I want my children, my nieces and nephews, friends kids and all other kids I know, to be in the FFA program!
National FFA Organization	142384	1	/users/profile/188851	pratt_wr	Volunteer	5	11/25/2012	FFA has been a great help in raising our three children. It teaches them to set high standards, so critical in today's world. The skills they learned in FFA continue to influence their lives as adults. They learned to think critically and to express themselves both orally and in written form. They learned the value of tracking income and expenses and to follow through on obligations. FFA can't be beat!   
National FFA Organization	140513	1	/users/profile/186703	Sara V	Advisor	5	11/16/2012	FFA does make a positive difference in the lives of young people.  Nothing is wasted with this organization's use of funds as they get back to the student.  I have seen firsthand the affect that this organization has on students and I am a firm believer in it.

National FFA Organization	140219		/users/profile/186388	Amanda61	Volunteer	5	11/15/2012	FFA is not just an organization, they are life changers. They help kids find direction and purpose to become anything they want from farmers to doctors. Our students learn ethics and values that make them better citizens. National FFA gives kids a chance to be part of Agriculture whether they live in a city or out in the country. As a former member and now an Agriscience teacher I believe that National FFA is on of the best youth organizations there is. 
National FFA Organization	140021		/users/profile/184933	Sam_8	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/15/2012	The National FFA Organization changes lives and sets careers in motion.  I was a FFA member during my high school career.  In my day FFA stood for the Future Farmers of America.  I was proud to call myself a Future Farmer and to have the honor and privilege of wearing that blue and gold jacket!  The leadership skills learned through my vocational agriculture classes and honed and sharpened by participating in FFA contests (today called Career Development Events) gave me the self confidence and motivation needed for me to obtain a Bachelor of Science and a Master's of Education in Agriculture Education.  Today that path has led to me being the County Extension Director for Cooperative Extension in the county that I was born and raised in.  The last line of the FFA Creed was my closing slide in my presentation when I applied for the County Director's position that answered the question of why I wanted the position.  That quote is "...and that I can exert an influence in my home and community which will stand solid for my part in that inspiring task."

I, my sister, and most of my cousins were active in the organization and I believe we would all say our involvement has positively impacted our adult lives. I became an FFA advisor because of how much I believe in what the FFA does. My students still get so much out of it and I see it every day.
National FFA Organization	139469	1	/users/profile/185586	inmanr	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/14/2012	The National FFA Organization has had an impact on my life like no other organization I've ever been involved with.  When I first entered school, I was not interested, and would not give it a chance.  However, in a short amount of time, I became involved, and it was the best decision.  It led me to become a state FFA officer, and eventually to my current career as an agriculture teacher and FFA advisor.  The impact that this organization has on students is unmatched by any other.  Many organizations are worthy; however, the FFA is truly one of a kind.

National FFA Organization	139149		/users/profile/185253	fuqua11	Advisor	5	11/14/2012	After being involved in the FFA as a student in high school, I spent time on the family farm. Could not stay away from the love of the FFA program so I went back to school and now I am an advisor. No other program can change the lives of students the way the FFA program prepares them for the real world challenges.
National FFA Organization	139121		/users/profile/185225	srammels	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/14/2012	I first got involved in the FFA as a sophomore in high school, simply wanting to qualify to show my horses at county fair. I immediately fell in love with the organization and began to get highly involved. FFA took me from a lost and depressed teenager to a strong, confident leader. It sparked my interest in the agricultural industry which I have been very successful in since graduating college with an Agricultural Education degree. I can honestly say that I owe 100% of my successes to FFA and my advisor, Mr. Deppe. Without either I would not have had the opportunity to grow into the person I am today.

THERE IS NO OTHER ORIGINATION THAT TEACHES KIDS WHAT  THEY GET FROM THE FFA. IN A 4 YEAR SPAN THEY TURN FROM A SHY LITTLE IN SECURED PERSON INTO SOME ONE WHO CAN GIVE A SPEECH TO A LARGE CROWD, AND THE CONFIDENCE THEY GET FROM THE PROGRAM IS BEYOND BELIEVE. IVE HAD PARENTS TELL ME THAT THEIR CHILD WOULD OF DROPPED OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL IF IT WASN'T FOR THE FFA. GREAT KIDS, FANTASTIC TEACHERS, AND LIFE TIME FRIENDS WHO ARE THERE WHEN YOU NEED ANYTHING. THE REGULAR HIGH SCHOOL DOES NOT DO TO STUDENTS THAT FFA DOES.
National FFA Organization	138842		/users/profile/184929	slfox	Client Served	5	11/14/2012	From working with the FFA on various programs, in both the Organization and the Foundation, I know first-hand, how hard the entire team works to uphold their mission in positively impacting the lives of students in order to develop them into the great leaders of tomorrow. When you come across an FFA student, you can tell how proud they are to be apart of the organization. You can see it in their refined skills, their confidence and their maturity. I'm amazed at the range of students the FFA impacts and am very thankful this organization holds students to such a high level of regard.
National FFA Organization	138824		/users/profile/184907	okstate10	Volunteer	5	11/14/2012	As an 8th grade student, I had the opportunity to take ag class. Growing up in agriculture, that was a logical decision for me to make. The opportunity that greeted me as I walked through the door on the first day of class laid the foundation for everything I've done since. In addition to taking the class, I joined FFA and set out on a path of success. The skills gained through public speaking, livestock showing and being chapter president helped shape my future, influencing decisions such as my major in college and my present profession, as a professional in an agriculture-related non-profit. I am thankful for the lessons and skills learned through FFA. Currently, I have younger family members involved in FFA and I am excited for the direction it is taking them. 
National FFA Organization	138803		/users/profile/184884	coon	Advisor	5	11/14/2012	One of the greatest experiences that I have had in teaching is outside the classroom. I have taken hundreds of students to hotels and restaurants, many for the first time. The experience is priceless as students eat in a fine dining establishment or stay in thier first hotel. I have the opportunity to instill proper table etiquette and behavior while in these semi formal settings. I recall one Junior in high school, whose mother had died when he was 10 and whose father was an alcoholic, ask me how to order from a menu. We never had a lesson like that in a classroom.
National FFA Organization	138798		/users/profile/184879	Allysa	Client Served	5	11/14/2012	When I started taking Ag classes in high school, I did so because we got to grow plants and raise fish. Who wouldn't want a class like that?? :) It didn't take long for me to realize that those classes and the National FFA Organization would make a serious impact in my life. Before joining FFA, I was a shy, quiet kid, with little confidence and no idea what I wanted to do with my future. Being a part of the organization really helped me step out of my comfort zone and try new things, develop new skills, and discover the leader within. By the time I graduated high school, I was a different person. I had an amazing network of friends and industry experts, a renewed confidence in myself and my abilities, and a passion for agriculture. I went on to study Agriculture Economics in college and now work for an Agricultural Financial Institution. I continue to volunteer at FFA events whenever possible, because I know first hand what kind of impact this organization can have on it's members.

FFA is a great organization making a real impact!
National FFA Organization	138736		/users/profile/184813	Tyler2007-8	Client Served	5	11/14/2012	I joined FFA in high school, and as a reserved farm kid, I was given many opportunities to risk and grow. The best part was the more "official" members of the organization (teachers, staff, officers, etc) who invested in me as they had been invested in by others. I highly recommend supporting the FFA. I do.

My FFA advisor got me to say the creed and after that I was hooked. It was obvious to me that I needed to continue the legacy so I then became an Agriculture Teacher too. The FFA has changed so many lives and I am honored to have the opportunity to help.

Not only for students but for those of all ages. Being a Alumni member and joining my kids at State conventions or taking them to competitions you see the respect and professionalism that young adults in the general public are no longer taught without being in a top leadership based organization like the FFA. I strive as a parent to fight the school districts in Florida not to take ag out of anymore schools. It amazes me how those to thanks Walmart is where your food comes from.

This organization gives students opportunities to learn life skills all while giving back to their communitities.

General Member of the Public	5	11/14/2012	I was a member of the National FFA Organization in California for all four years of high school.  I was able to take advantage of so many opportunities to learn and grow.  There is something for every student.  I participated in state and national choirs, competed in many prepared and extemporaneous public speaking events, competed at the national level for marketing plan presentation, was a chapter and sectional officer, and raised sheep.  Not to mention the countless leadership conferences I attended.  I made so many friends, several from across the country, that I still keep in touch with.  One of my teachers has become one of my greatest friends.  I don't know anyone who was involved in FFA and regretted it!

I was a member in High School as well as my 2 younger brothers and my dad was too.  Both my parents and I are lifetime members of the National FFA Alumni.  FFA provides unlimited opportunities for students to develop their leadership skills and personal growth, community service, as well as preparing them for careers in anything they want to do.  I could only hope that they would pursue a career in agriculture, but students should pursue their passions and be happy with their career path.
National FFA Organization	138542		/users/profile/184611	Melissa I.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/13/2012	I am a second generation FFA member and I am proud to have a daughter in the FFA and a son who can't wait to wear the blue and gold jacket.  FFA gives youth the opportunity to explore careers and learn about leadership, citizenship and responsibility.  FFA provides classroom instruction which is rich in science and math and provides an extracurricular which allows youth to get involved at the chapter, section, district, state and national levels.  It builds self esteem and through it all helps mold kids into wonderful adults who will give back to their communities.  FFA helped me develop my public speaking skills and gave me opportunities to learn about all kinds of things related to Agriculture, horticulture, plant science, animal science and agri-business.  I love that the FFA organization is rich in tradition with the goal of reaching to tomorrow.  FFA is a fantastic youth organization!
National FFA Organization	138531		/users/profile/184601	classy_carolina_lady	Volunteer	5	11/13/2012	I became involved with FFA when my daughter entered 9th grade and became a member.  She immediately fell in love with all aspects of the organization.  She served as an officer all four years of high school, was on two State Championship teams and went to Nationals to compete two times.  I went to State and National Conventions with the group and was so very impressed with the youth of this organization.  I've never experienced anything like being in the audience at the National Conventions and seeing all those Blue Jackets and enthusiasm!  I was in the Charter Group that started our local FFA Alumni Association and have been involved with that for the last nine years as a member and officer.  I stay even though my daughter is long gone from high school - because I believe!  I watched her and her friends grow and become leaders through this organization - all the way to American Degree Recipents!  I only wish more of today's youth had the opportunity to become a part of FFA! Our Alumni group works hard at our fundraisers so that we might give scholarships and help out in other supportive ways - because we believe in FFA!

National FFA Organization	138504		/users/profile/184571	AgRow	Client Served	5	11/13/2012	The National FFA Organization led me to my current career and prepared me for accelerated growth in my field.  In the most recent intake of US Foreign Service Officers, I was the youngest successful candidate, and can thank the wealth of business experience, professional growth, and career exploration that I received as a member of the FFA for helping me to reach this goal.  From helping guide me through starting my first international business at 14, to providing scholarships to support two tertiary degrees and experiential learning experiences in nine countries, FFA has had an instrumental impact throughout my formal education.  The FFA simply changed my life for the better and I will forever be in its debt! 
National FFA Organization	138498		/users/profile/184565	Brian46	Volunteer	5	11/13/2012	The FFA is without a doubt the greatest youth organization in the world! My career started way back in 1985 when I was in 7th grade. I enjoyed all of the contests that the FFA had to compete in and learned the basics of public speaking and parlimentary procedure. I would never have imagined that just 7 short years later I would have the oppurtunity to be a VA State FFA Officer. I can honestly say that without the life skills that FFA taught me, I would never have had the courage to fulfill my duties as an officer. Fast forward to 2010, with the economy forcing me into a career change at almost 40 years old, I was able to get a job with the USDA. I know it is because of this wonderful organization, the interviews for officers and the public speaking skills allowed me to land a career without a college education. I know I can never give back to the FFA what it has given to me, but I am super excited to see my children as they start their FFA careers in the same chapter where I started mine!

National FFA Organization	138486		/users/profile/184555	Proud FFA Mom	Volunteer	5	11/13/2012	I am very proud of all this organization and its accomplishments with respect to raising the next generations.  The leadership, such as the school advisor, has been a mentor and excellent role model to my four daughters - 4 American Degree receipents, 2 National CDE winners, participants in five National contests (two first place teams and two second place teams); four National FFA scholarship awardees; and one nom com finalist and state delegate. All four are pursuing ag related careers. Can you tell that I am a FFA fan? I have had the distinct honor to serve as the female chaperone at four National FFA conventions and watch these young folks in action. I also fully know the effort and dedication that the advisor gives to his profession and to his students. Whether the students win or not, they all benefit greatly from knowing and working with him. My family holds FFA in high honor. There is quite a legacy throughout the state and the nation. I also appreciate your time.

It gave me confidence. Confidence to stand up for myself and believe that my goals and dreams are possible. Confidence to succeed in public speaking and develop friendships across the country and even across the world. It broke me out of my shell and is a major part of who I am today. I am a better person for having been involved in the association. It has given me more than I will ever be able to give back. Thank you FFA!
National FFA Organization	138456		/users/profile/184524	WIffa-er07	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/13/2012	Being a member of FFA, took this quiet, shy farm girl and showed her her own potential. The FFA provided me with the encouragement and an environment to grow as a person and become a leader. It allowed me to step out of my comfort zone and think out of the box. It truly is a tool that I've used for the rest of my life. Lasting longer than my student membership, is the friendships gained, life skills learned, the scholarships earned, and a passion that has fueled my current career in agricultural communications. Today, I support my own younger brothers in their FFA activities. And, I look forward to every time I get to meet a young FFA student.
National FFA Organization	138452		/users/profile/184520	HannahSla	Client Served	5	11/13/2012	I learned many valuable lessons and skills as a member of the National FFA Organization in high school. From public speaking to parliamentary procedure to poultry production, I had many opportunities for learning and growth. FFA also offers many leadership opportunities, from the chapter level all the way up to the national level; as vice president of my chapter, I learned to work with a team - how to navigate personality differences, how to plan events, how to communicate with a team, and more. The National FFA Organization provides an avenue for students to take a passion - be it leadership, service, agriculture, entrepreneurship...the list goes on - and pursue it as far as they want. I was always inspired to see fellow members at conferences showcase a business they started, a project they finished, or a herd of cattle they raised and sold. FFA can take you as far as you are willing to go. I highly recommend it to almost any high school student (some schools also have middle school chapters, so I also recommend it to middle school students). The National FFA Organization facilitates the development of many useful skills in America's students, and is growing future leaders.
National FFA Organization	138446		/users/profile/184514	Sherry Cole	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/13/2012	FFA changes lives.  It allows all students the opportunity to participate, regardless of gender or race.  When students walk in wearing those blue jackets, you can't help but notice the pride and confidence it gives them.  Last year as I walked into the building where our State FFA Convention was being held, two FFA members (not students I knew) immediately approached me to ask if they could help.  They were not part of the formal welcoming committe...they were just two FFA members who noticed I was lost.  I am not sure if this would have happened anywhere else.  FFA builds leadership skills and character.  And America needs leaders with both.

The education you get from being an AGG student is one that you will use every day in all aspects of life and the time and life lessons you get from an Advisor is something you will be thankfull for your whole life. Now as I watch my daughter who is now an FFA Member I couldnt be a prouder Parent, and I know that the education and support the FFA gives her she will have a great jump on life and be a better prepared person for all the things life will throw at her. And as an active alumnist I still help the FFA in many ways so it is rewarding your whole life not just as a student.

I am kept well abreast of  the impact of my support and the support of others and am often provided with opportunities to see the difference that this outstandinng organization makes in the students of agricultural educationn that they serve -- you absolutely can experience the difference made in these students as they enter and progress through further education, career experiences and in societal leadership experiences.

Although my direct involvement ended when I retired as Kentucky State Secretary in 1980, I use the skills and confidence I developed through FFA everyday.  32 years later my oldest niece is now involved in her local chapter and I look forward to watching her progress over the course of her FFA career.  Money and time invested in supporting the FFA will pay dividends throughout generations. 
National FFA Organization	138340		/users/profile/184406	jlechtenberg	Advisor	5	11/13/2012	The FFA has helped to shape me into the person that I am today.  I have 7 siblings who were all in FFA and my father was an FFA adviser for over 20 years.  FFA was where I gave my first public speech, The FFA Creed, and it was where I met my first group of peers from outside my own school.  FFA was where I set my first goals and started to work towards a career.  Through my FFA experience I was transformed from a shy 8th grader into a leader of my local chapter.  From there I grew into a role as a State FFA Officer which ultimately led me into my career as an Agriculture Educator and an FFA Adviser.  As a teacher I have seen other students make very similar transitions.  No other organization allows the opportunities for premier leadership, personal growth, and career success like the National FFA Organization.

National FFA Organization	138298		/users/profile/184355	ab1406	Volunteer	5	11/13/2012	My children have been involved in many activities throughout their school careers, but the most beneficial to all of them has been FFA. As a parent and a teacher I can not say enough good things about this organization and what it does for kids. Many think that FFA is just about raising animals and doing agricultural projects, but it is so much more. An FFA member learns about failure, success, refining skills, research, current and past history of agriculture in our country and its importance, but most importantly they learn about leadership and self worth.  I have taught for over 25 years and have seen students in a variety of settings, and my first national and state conventions were awe inspiring. All students stood tall and were proud to represent FFA and knew what that meant. They consistently prevailed with good manners, politeness and consideration to all.  The experiences students have in the FFA have an immense effect on who they become as adults. FFA helps to build positive active citizens amd young adults who know how to make a difference for the positive. I was not introduced to FFA until my own children became involved, but  I am currently an FFA Alumni member and will continue to be so in order to help this organization prosper and grow.

I joined in 1975 as a sophomore and was a part of that first wave of women in FFA.  I served as a chapter officer (Vice-President), a delegate to the state convention and a member of the National FFA Band.  I gained confidence in speaking, in my ability to think on my feet and confidence in my ability to learn to build not only concrete items with my hands but to build relationships with other people.  My sons are FFA members and I credit FFA with giving them solid people skills as well.  FFA is the greatest single organization in the world.  FFA serves all types of young people with all kinds of interests and skills and challenges those young people to become something bigger, something more than they were before.

It was that same year a group of parents got together & said "these kids need our support" so we formed a FFA Booster Club for our Chapter.  Through FFA and friends met there our daughter became interested in showing cattle - she has her own herd of Polled Herefords - and has been showing ever since.  Quite another aspect of our agricultural education!!!  Our daughter has since graduated and is in college studying for a degree in agriculture.

It taught me self-confidence, how to research, how to study, how to be helpful in my community, and how to treat others around me.  FFA teaches so much about team work, being an individual, and leadership.  I definately look back to my time in FFA when I'm trying to make a decision, or figure out what I should do, and how to be an asset to myself, family, friends, and community.

The level of skill and professionalism is higher than some college students and adults.

She graduated high school as a person who understands the importance of giving back to her community, one who is able to communicate well with peers and adults, and as an oustanding public speaker.  Those skills she learned in FFA are the reason she is attending an out-of-state university completely on scholarships.

I thank God everyday that my friend dragged me to my first meeting, as it was that meeting that completely changed my life. I slowly, but surely became involved in the FFA, competing in my first Career Development Event as an 8th grader and won 2nd place on the State Level in Extemporaneous Public Speaking. I never excelled at anything particularly in high school, but I excelled in FFA. The National FFA Organization truly motivates students to premier leadership, personal growth and career success.  I have developed into a leader that can excel under stressful circumstances, learn from my mistakes, work as a team player, and most importantly, always put the success of others before myself.

National FFA Organization	138056		/users/profile/184098	SargeisRa	Volunteer	5	11/13/2012	There is something to be said about a Youth Organization that puts on the largest annual National Convention in the United States of America.  No other youth organization allows for the diversity of skill sets that the FFA does.  Most youth organizations (well, most organizations period) bring people together because of a common background or common goal.  There is only one thing common about FFA and that is the tool through which it functions, Agriculture and Agricultural Education.  As for what they do, FFA has so many options for members to succeed its shocking.  FFA truly allows for anyone's skill set in life to shine bright, no matter what that may be.  There is just so much to do!  Also, what is great about the FFA is their Official Dress.  The Official Dress that FFA members have to wear to events is standard for all.  This standardized attire encourages appropriate dressing for students of all ages and genders.  It also does something more important though, it allows those students in FFA to be judged on their abilities and personalities.  You cannot judge a FFA member on how they dress or what they look like.........because they all look and dress the same!  So, it inadvertently forces people to look at that students skills and personality.  I believe that this tends to bring out the best in people.

The results are sometimes shocking. Thousands of us have learned and grown and now lead and volunteer.  The best work of the organization is acoomplished in local high schools but fantastic dedicated teacher/advisors.
National FFA Organization	137955		/users/profile/183993	rupjam	Advisor	5	11/13/2012	The National FFA Organization by far exceeds all other youth organizations in the country when it comes to leadership and preparing youth for career readiness.  I was an FFA member in my youth and still carry the things I learned with me today proudly as an FFA Advisor.

National FFA Organization	137953		/users/profile/183990	ewmccann	Advisor	5	11/13/2012	The National FFA Organization is one of the front runners in providing high quality, industry driven and age appropriate leadership and career opportunities to youth in our schools. The organization makes a concentrated effort to meet student needs by providing relevant workshops, events and activities. It is structured to allow each student to experience success. I am an second generation agricultural educator, the fruit of a successful FFA chapter and agricultural education program. The FFA has a unique way of allowing students to set and reach amazing goals. It is one of the top organizations I have ever been a part of during my lifetime.
National FFA Organization	137950		/users/profile/183987	Annette8	Advisor	5	11/13/2012	I was an FFA member in high school and it changed my life!  I was a very shy student who didn't like being out of my comfort zone.  Through my experience in the FFA I became very outgoing and was excited to present in front of others.  I also learned the importance of service to others and my community.  Through this experience I decided that becoming an agriculture teacher and FFA Advisor.  I love teaching others and providing them with opportunities to become a successful and respected citizen of our community.
National FFA Organization	137947		/users/profile/183983	SaigeA	Volunteer	5	11/13/2012	FFA is quite honestly one of the most influential and important youth organizations I have ever been involved in. While I currently serve primarily as a volunteer, I am also an advisory board member for our local chapter, was a 7 year FFA member, state officer and I now am a professional in the agriculture industry. I fully attribute my career success and personal development to skills I learned through this organization. Students involved in this program are not only exposed to leadership, speaking and career development skills, but are among the brightest, hardest working and most valuable students in many communities. 
National FFA Organization	137857		/users/profile/183874	TeresaM	Advisor	5	11/13/2012	I learned about FFA through my dad's high school yearbook.  My dad was a member of FFA and the yearbook picture of all the FFA boys in their corduroy jackets was an inspiration to me.  As a farm girl, I could not participate in sports because I had to help out on the farm after school.  However, I was allowed to join FFA and participate in contests since they were directly related to my home activities.  My FFA advisor became a second father to me and my FFA friends were a second family.  My FFA experiences led to scholarships that allowed me to become an agriculture teacher and FFA advisor myself.  Without that financial support, my life's path would have been much different.  Since then, I have helped countless students reach beyond their own expectations and make a difference through agriculture and FFA.  The long history of FFA adds credibility to our activities and builds connections with our communities.  My grandfather used to tell stories about his trip to Kansas City for the National FFA Convention.  All FFA members have stories of leadership that have helped to strengthen agriculture across our country.  FFA will continue to make a positive difference in the lives of students.
National FFA Organization	137363		/users/profile/183336	Larry Case	Volunteer	5	11/12/2012	I have worked as a professional local agricultural education teacher and State and National administrator.  Now that I am retired, I volunteer in support of the local teachers and students.  FFA is the element that makes education fun and useful.  It helps young people to engage in education and thus learn more then just classroom work.  It helps them develop into young men and women with outstanding leadership and personal skills.  They develop healthy relationships with others and strive to be positive in all that they do!  I will continue to volunteer as long as I am able!  
National FFA Organization	136596		/users/profile/182525	Annoth	General Member of the Public	5	11/09/2012	I was shy. No doubt about it. Last time I was asked to present, I froze up and couldnt do it. Once I entered my sophomore year for high school, I learned about FFA. I was highly attracted to the idea of raising a show animal and the profit. It seemed like a gateway to my dream job. I originally was going to raise chickens since it was cheaper (initaly) but I was then told by my mum that money didnt matter so I got a pig. He's currently gained 60 lbs as of this week :D I also went into the LDE of Quiz. Got 1st place as an individual but the freshmen in my "team" dragged me down to 7th overall team :/ It really got the attention of my chapter officers and now the sentinel is teaching me how to be a poultry judger for my first CDE. This organization has changed me for the better. I thought my passion for Production Agriculture had died long ago but its back and is nipping at my heels. As a greenhand, I still have a lot to learn but it's worth all the hours I spend at the barn, cleaning a pen, washing my hog only to have him roll in mud, and put up with the squealing in the bath at 6 AM. I hope to stay in the FFA well past my graduation! They are such and amazing organization!
National FFA Organization	136169		/users/profile/182078	jwielfaert	Advisor	5	11/09/2012	FFA was a turning point for me when I was in high school.  I didn't know that there was a community of leaders out there that cared about me and the things I participated in and it helped me find a career in horticulture and agriscience.  Now, I am a teaching assistant for a local Tech Center where I can work with FFA students, doing the things we both like and helping them find a future related to things they enjoy,
National FFA Organization	136017		/users/profile/181924	asheliz	Client Served	5	11/08/2012	FFA has been one of the most influential things in my life. I honestly had no idea how it would change the path of my life forever. When I joined FFA in 9th grade I was that shy girl who was always made fun of for her love of horses and animals. I signed up for basic ag. out of shear luck. When I first stepped into the agriculture room I had no idea that it would soon become my second home. I had no idea what it was. I even met my role model Kendall that day. She stood proud in her blue corduroy jacket that I would soon adopt into my closet. I spoke to the teacher and he seemed extremely excited. I was weary, but it seemed like my kind of place. I joined the swine showing team and found a new love. I have a new passion for these cute little animals. well if you can call a 300 pound pig little. I soon opened up to some of the members and as the year went on I became more active. I was even elected as our class reporter for opening ceremony practice, even though my cheeks flamed just standing in front of my small class. I soon decided to  run for an officer position for chapter. I became chapter reporter and continued on my path. I soon fell in love with public speaking and competed in the prepared public speaking contest. Then in April I decided to run for area, but toward the end I got scared. My advisor was quick to jump in and MAKE me run. I practiced my speech for weeks. I yelled it across pastures and said it in my sleep practically. As I stood on stage I remember my knees shaking and my white knuckles clutching the podium. I said my speech with a smile and got off stage without falling. When names were called I heard mine and I walked onto stage. I thought I had gotten sentinel, but much to my surprise I was elected President. I am truly blessed by God to have that opportunity. I have had many chances to work with younger students as well as some my age. I look forward to running for state officer this year and I hope to give back to this organization just half of what it gave me. It has even shaped my career choice. I always wanted to be a vet, but last year God told me to be an agriculture teacher and I hope to make an impact on someones life like my advisor has for me. I thank God every day for bringing me to this organization. I do everything for the glory of Him!
National FFA Organization	135977		/users/profile/181882	Matt Gonz.	Board Member	5	11/08/2012	Unlike most reviews, my exposure to FFA was entirely from a business perspective. My company has been a financial supporter of the FFA for over 25 years and I was asked to join the Sponsors Board.  After 2 years, I became a member of the National FFA Organization Board of Directors.  My view is of the financial interworkings of the organization so I see precisely how they spend the money that comes from members, doners and corporate sponsors is spent. This organization is all about the students, their development and the prudent utilization of their financial resources.  I donate to this nonprofit and I have no hesitation recommending it others. National FFA is changing students lives and through them the future of our country.  We need young people who know how to lead. There is no better way to support that than through a donation to the National FFA.
National FFA Organization	135948		/users/profile/181849	papennat	Donor	5	11/08/2012	I have a long history with the National FFA Organization.  It started out in Junior High, when I joined as a member & started getting involved.  I remained a member throughout Junior High and High School, getting more involved in leadership and speaking roles.  My leadership experience led me to being selected as one of the Governor's Youth Leadership Award recipients in my state.  My experiences were so impactful that I decided to become an Agriculture Teacher and FFA Advisor myself.  After 3.5 years of college, I achieved that goal, and was hired as an Agriscience Instructor.  7 more years later, I have just moved on to a new phase in my career - in Educational Technology, but I remain actively involved as an Alumni member & supporter, as a volunteer for various FFA functions & contests, and as a donor.  FFA is truly life-changing for many of its members, including me!

The FFA has impacted my life greatly. My experience as an FFA member has shaped me into the person I am today. The FFA is a great group that promotes premier leadership, personal group, and career success.  As a current FFA member and officer, I encourage every high-school student that has an FFA chapter at their school and officers Agriscience classes to join in. It is definitely a life changing experience! BLUE AND GOLD!
National FFA Organization	135822		/users/profile/181711	Julesy	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/08/2012	I was an FFA member nearly 30 years ago! It was the FFA that helped guide me in shaping my career in agriculture communications, and today I am still involved with the organization as a volunteer.  Also today, my daughter is a third generation FFA member.  It was the ag classroom and her involvement in FFA that taught her how to study.  She struggled with reading comprehension in elementary school.  But when she got to high school and started learning how to memorize and know botanical names of plants (an area she clicked with and now loves), her study ethic rolled over into her non-ag courses.  So much so, for the first time in her school career, last year she was inducted into the National Beta Club (senior division honor society)! I credit her instructor and FFA for this, no doubt.  Plus, she and her FFA Floriculture team made it to the National FFA Floriculture competition in October 2012 and came in 4th in the country!  How cool is that?!  After all of this positive life-changing experience, she has decided to be an agriculture education instructor!  FFA rocks!  
National FFA Organization	135668		/users/profile/181545	Kalie	Client Served	5	11/08/2012	The National FFA Organization makes a positive difference in the lives of students by developing their potential for premier leadership, personal growth, and career success through agricutlural education.  It provides opportunities for agricultural education students to build relationships and develop leadership skills that position them to be lifelong learners!  FFA puts the concepts students are learning in agriculture classes and personal work projects (called supervised agricultural experiences or SAEs) into travel, competitive, and service opportunities.  For example, I became passionate about animal agriculture in my basic agricultural science class, got hands-on experience by starting my own business raising swine, and cattle, and competed in award programs against other students with similar projects.  As a junior in high school, I attended the Washington Leadership Conference in Washington, D.C. where I was challenged to put my passion for agriculture into action through service.  I came back to my community and conducted agricultural activities with elementary school students, learning together through agriculture.  FFA helped me find my passion and gave me the skills and connections to pursue that passion! 
National FFA Organization	135628		/users/profile/181506	Melissa108	Volunteer	5	11/08/2012	The National FFA Organization is a group of young adults that is not like any other group. We are students that have a passion for agriculture and are in school pursuing our dreams. The National FFA Organization has made me who I am today. I grew up on a farm in northeast Nebraska and joined FFA in the 8th grade. From there I have had a tremendous journey. I have won numerous awards and have gained skills that will be so helpful in my future. I have currently just received my American FFA Degree from the National Organization. This is the highest award in the nation that a FFA member can receive. It was truly, a great honor to receive this award and it is something that looks great on resumes. FFA has changed my life and will continue to make dreams come true for upcoming members. The National FFA Organization is the largest youth conference ever. So it is my opinion, that FFA is a tremendous group of young adults and we are the leaders of agriculture.
National FFA Organization	135625		/users/profile/181502	Joseph T.	Volunteer	5	11/08/2012	I just graduated high school in June of 2012. I was a member for four years an I have seen more places in the united states then my parents did. I was honored to compete in two state teams (dairy and agronomy). Today I am starting my career in the United States Army. The FFA taught me how to be a better leader, a better person, show motivation, and paying attention to small details. FFA is not just for small town hicks, but it's also for high class people. I recommend everyone should attend this group and challenge yourself and others.
National FFA Organization	135589		/users/profile/181467	Lynn37	Volunteer	5	11/08/2012	The National FFA Organization is like none other. It helps students to make a difference and become active citizens. For me, it has helped me to have endless opportunities (even beyond my membership), develop quality relationships, build connections, grow as a leader, discover my passion, and prepare for a career. FFA does not just benefits its members, but all of society.
National FFA Organization	135546		/users/profile/181420	Lisa168	General Member of the Public	5	11/08/2012	FFA has really helped my daughter grow into a young lady who has gained valuable experience that will follow her throught her life. She has learned to write an SAE grant that will hopefully help her start her own business, something she never dreamed she could do, it has offered her the oppertunity to try hands on activities that  have encouraged her to try a career field she never thought about before. Plus the experieince of writing the grant will help her when it comes time to apply to college and for scholarships. FFA has also made her a strong, capable leader who is willing to pitch in and help others, and be a positive role model for other youth. She has learned too through FFA that is not just about taking ag. classes and showning animals at the county fair, but that it goes deeper... A real understanding that without farmers and agriculture related fields there would be no America as we know it.
National FFA Organization	135518		/users/profile/181390	Paryce B.	Volunteer	5	11/08/2012	Truth be told, the FFA changed my life as it has and continues to do for over half a million members and lives the members reach out to. Truth be told I don't know where I would be if the FFA hadn't helped me through so much in high school. I wouldn't have the morals I have today or the friends, skills, relationships, or confidence, without the FFA I wouldn't be who I am today. Today and everyday I advocate for agriculture and agriculture education because I learned its importance in school while also learning the difference I can make, but no one can do it alone and I didn't have to because the FFA is the largest family I have ever been a part of. For me the FFA wasn't just a fun class with animals, shop tools, and food of course, it was my safe place, FFA was and is my home. I have never found a place with more accepting, heartfelt, dedicated, and assuring people. They don't care where you come from or what you have done in the past, they look forward, to your future as well as the worlds.
National FFA Organization	135506		/users/profile/181373	CarinaDuran	Volunteer	4	11/08/2012	The FFA has and still is making a difference in my life. And trust me I love it! Without the FFA, HighSchool would probably be horrible. Every year I just learn more and more, my public speaking skills have improved,etc. The best part about the FFA is getting to meet knew people, it's such a blessing being surrounded with such patient people like myself. FOREVER BLUE! 
National FFA Organization	135505		/users/profile/181372	Dana22	General Member of the Public	5	11/08/2012	FFA has created the entire path in life for my daughter Tyler Morgan Smith. She has been involved in FFA since the 7th grade and is currently President of her FFA at West Oak High School in SC. She lives and breathes for her FFA and is so excited to be going to college next year to become a Agriculture teacher and touch the lives of kids the same way her FFA teacher has. She has been involved in rodeo her whole life and currently High School rodeos with the GHSRA will continue on to college rodeo while studying her Ag Education. Thank you for continuing to give these kids the opportunity to be involved in such a life building association!
National FFA Organization	135465		/users/profile/181327	Mary131	Volunteer	5	11/08/2012	My daughter has ADHD and anxiety, and was extremely shy when she joined the FFA.  We were really shocked that she wanted to join, but excited too because it meant that she found something she was interested in.  This will be her third year, and she has grown by leaps and bounds.  She has more confidence in speaking in public than we ever thought she would, and she has made friends all over the U.S. who are passionate about the very same thing.  She even went from wanting to be a veterinarian to wanting to be an Ag teacher.  I have been volunteering with the local chapter for as long as my daughter has been a member.  I have attended both state and national conventions, and I can honestly say that FFA is far more than just farming.  They are teaching students how to be a leader with integrity.  They are teaching students how to speak in public.  They are helping to cultivate the student's thought process to enable them to be productive citizens.  They promote agricultural awareness.  There are just so many things that FFA is outside of farming/agriculture and I cannot say enough about what FFA means to us personally!  
National FFA Organization	135427		/users/profile/181290	Chip B.	Board Member	3	11/08/2012	The FFA is an organization that actually delivers on what it promises to do. The mission statement describes it perfectly -- FFA members actually develop PREMIER LEADERSHIP, PERSONAL GROWTH, and CAREER SUCCESS. I have been fortunate to witness hundreds of students become successful by participation in FFA. There is no greater investment than to support our youth and our agriculture.
National FFA Organization	135212		/users/profile/181075	White Buffalo	Volunteer	5	11/07/2012	The FFA is giving students a chance to expand their leadership, and few other groups in high school do more in their local communities.  That is why I am a major supporter/donator, as well as giving them as much of my time as I can.  I am getting much more than the dollars and hours I give to them, when I see the great things they are doing to develop themselves, the program, and our community.
National FFA Organization	135053		/users/profile/180918	tate_rm	Donor	5	11/07/2012	In addition to being a current donor to FFA, I am a past member. Although I was involved in many other organizations as a student and am involved in various organziations now as an adult, FFA remains the best organziation I have encountered. I wish there was an adult version! It offers tremendous opportunities to its members in the area of leadership, personal growth and career success. It helped me develop important skills that I still use to this day such as public speaking, being a servant leader, budgeting and financials, etc. It played a major role in shaping me into the person I am today and my ag. teacher/FFA advisor had a significant influence on me as a role model. What it offers is open to all students and there are so many different programs, each person can find the niche within FFA that fits best for them. As a donor, I appreciate the positive difference and impact FFA continues to make on students today.
National FFA Organization	134966		/users/profile/180833	mariahr	Volunteer	5	11/07/2012	FFA truly prepares students for their future life and career.  Unfortunately, not all students are taught good work ethic, repsonsibility, respectfulness, and other soft skills from home.  This organization works to meet students where they are and raise their skill set so that they can be successful in the future.  This organization also communicates well with students, parents, teachers, sponsors, and all stakeholders through the use of their website, availability of staff members, through social media outlets, and other avenues.

The FFA builds self confidence, promotes agriculture, and gives people the resources they may need for their future indevors.  Being involved with the FFA as a past president, public speaker, livestock judging/oral reasons has gained me the experience an confidence to do what I am doing now, an auctioneer.  The FFA organization should be a required course in high school, once involved with this organization you will go far in whatever you intend to do...

National FFA Organization	134307		/users/profile/180124	Dustin S.	Client Served	5	11/06/2012	I joined the FFA in 2006 as a freshman in high school.  I joined because I didn't like school, and I was looking for anything to make high school go by faster.  I had no motivation, no interest, and no plan for the future.  As I got involved with the FFA, I was challenged to do better, to be better.  I found my passions through the FFA, and decided it was time to make a change.  I went from being a mediocre student with no drive or plan, to a dedicated student with college and career plans.  Because I gave the FFA an chance and took advantage of the opportunity, I made my life into something better.  I am now a junior at the University of Minnesota, Crookston, studying my passions in life, hold the coveted American FFA Degree, served 9,300 FFA members as a Minnesota FFA State Officer, and now running my own business at 20 years old.  This organization is truly focused on developing student leaders, and preparing them for personal growth and career success.  I owe what I am today to the National FFA Organization, and to my high school FFA advisor.

I personally have never been an FFA member but I have seen first hand what it has done for my sons.  The program has helped make them the confident, independent young adults that they are.  I have been involved with this program for over 20 years as a parent, sponsor, Alumni member at all levels from local to national.  Working with the FFA members has taught me many things also and I will continue to be a supporter of this organization.
National FFA Organization	134244		/users/profile/180030	Carl I.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/06/2012	I have been involved with the FFA organization for 37 years from the community (chapter) level to the national level.  As a high school FFA member, I was able to take part in numerous educational and career opportunities and through my involvement I earned a scholarship that paid about half of my college expenses, allowing me to complete college without the need for student loans.  At the collegiate level, through FFA I was truly able to apply the FFA Motto (Learning to Do, Doing to Learn, Earning to Live, Living to Serve) as the organization helped me find a career path about which I was and continue to be passionate.  As a high school agricultural science teacher and FFA Advisor, I was able to mentor and watch high school student members overcome personal, financial, family and educational obstacles to find success in the FFA organization - whether that was learning to stand in front of a class and deliver a 3 minute speech, stand in a showring with an animal they had raised, stand on a stage to accept a proficiency award, stand on risers among a chorus of voices, stand in front of a wood or metal project they had designed and built in an agriculture class, stand with their arm compassionately around someone who was unable to stand on their own, or perhaps most importantly, stand up for what they believe in with conviction and understanding.  My own involvement with FFA took me from the high school level to the college level, working with young men and women preparing to become agricultural education teachers and FFA Advisors.  I have been fortunate to watch those young men and women take the lessons and opportunities provided through FFA involvement and apply them in various leadership, service and technical agriculture contexts. Several of these college students through the years have been supported by FFA scholarships and several have attended national-level collegiate events that have provided immeasurable opportunity for career networking, as well as advanced leadership and technical content skills related to the agriculture, food, and natural resources industry.  Through serving as a consultant to the National FFA board of directors, I had the rather unique opportunity to observe the inner workings of the organization on the national level; I completed that assignment with an even better understanding that the organization is really about opportunities for young people from all backgrounds, all sectors, and all geographic regions across the USA.  As my own three children went through the local FFA program, I was able to observe another unique perspective as a parent;  three sons with three very different temperaments all found a niche and a place they could both fit in and stand out within the organization. Through involvement with the Alumni segment of the organization on a local, state, and national level, I have felt fortunate to be a facilitator of those stand-up opportunities that I have come to associate with this incredible organization.  Now, as I contemplate the end of a professional career directly involved with agricultural education and FFA, I am both humbled and honored that two of my children have been so positively impacted by the organization that they have chosen to continue their involvement by becoming high school agricultural educators and FFA advisors.  From the local to the national level, the FFA is an organization that creates legacies!

The opportunities to develop her leadership skills, grow as a person and find her passion were tremendous.  It is because of FFA that she is a successful part of the poultry industry, doing what she loves and loving what she is doing.  And I've had the joy or observing many students in the past 10 years enjoy a similar experience.
National FFA Organization	134141	1	/users/profile/179916	mrssauvola	Advisor	5	11/06/2012	I have been involved with the FFA since 1989, when I was in 7th grade.  Without the positive role models I met and the leadership skills I gained, I wouldn't be the person I am today.  Home wasn't the best place when I was growing up, so any chance I had to go to an event organized through the FFA or on a trip to a conference or workshop where I could build life skills to get out of that negative home situation...I was there!  One of those trips took me to the college I chose to attend after I graduated from high school and the organization also provided me with a look at many different careers.  I chose to become an Agriscience Instructor and FFA Advisor so that I could in turn be that positive role model for young people today.  I have never looked back!  This organization offers students the vehicles necessary to set and achieve goals, gain valuable life skills and become upstanding citizens who can make a difference in others' lives.  I am proud to be an Agriscience Instructor and lifetime FFA Alumni member.  
National FFA Organization	134130		/users/profile/179901	wibrian	Client Served	5	11/06/2012	I can tell you that FFA is a great organization! My son was always a student who would sit in the back row and get by with as little as possible. He joined FFA as a Freshman in high school and has flourished ever since. He has been an officer in the organization, gotten his state degree, moved on to speaking competitions, competed in the state and national talent portions, and has gotten the opportunity to go through Dale Carnegie Training with is experiences. It is not often that a high school student will sit down with the CEO of a national company, Tyson Foods or a regional manager of Stihl Company, and have meaningful conversations about their company or what they as students feel about things. Those expericences are priceless for a student. Not to say what it says about how those companies value the education and leadership that our students possess! THANK YOU TO EVERY COMPANY THAT PARTICIPATES WITH FFA!!!!!!! As an FFA Alumni, I can speak to that the FFA was a vital part in my taking on a leadership role in my career. I would have stayed a wall flower had I not had the opportunity to do speaking competitions or other team building exercises.
National FFA Organization	134123		/users/profile/179895	brandonkdavis	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/06/2012	I was in FFA in high school and college and now hold alumni membership. FFA has been and continues to be the most impactful organization that I have had the chance to be associated with. From providing me leadership skills, career exploration opportunities, and real-life experiences, I owe so much to FFA. I cannot imagine my life without this worthy organization. The national organization constantly seeks out ways to challenge and grow its members. The bounty of leadership and career development opportunities are too numerous to mention. Students who take advantage of these conferences and competitions are more aware of the agricultural industry and their role in guiding its future. I truly believe the success of agriculture in the future will depend almost exclusively on the members and supporters of the National FFA Organization. I am proud to count myself as a former member, supporter, and alumnus of this organization.

She wore her jacket proudly, as did her sister, my cousin, and then me. And now that I'm an FFA advisor, that jacket is still being worn - by my students. I work in one of the poorest counties in Virginia and our students can't afford to purchase jackets, but that hasn't stopped them. FFA means so much to our kids. It gives them opportunities that would NEVER be possible without this organization. Agriculture is obviously important and the root behind this organization - afterall, where would we be without it? - but we're able to give these kids so much more than that. They will use the skills they learn in this organization for the rest of their lives - it will make them better individuals, better community members, better employees, and better leaders. 
National FFA Organization	134095		/users/profile/179865	FFASupport0022	General Member of the Public	5	11/06/2012	Leadership education is key to developing individuals that can solve problems. The National FFA Organization is the best leadership development organization at the high school level. Students who go through the National FFA organization are better prepared to solve major global issues like; hunger and energy. An investment in the FFA is a safe investment in the future, it is you saying you believe the problems the world faces are problems that need to be solved and can be solved by our future leaders. Invest in the best, invest in our future, invest in the FFA!
National FFA Organization	134078		/users/profile/179848	Michelle101	Advisor	5	11/06/2012	FFA has been a part of my life since 1993.  It is a phenomenal organization that gave me a boost in life and helped me chose my career. Students learn not only how important agriculture is, but life long skills as well.  It gives students good clean fun and lots of opportunities to expand their horizons!
National FFA Organization	134050		/users/profile/179819	Bonnie N.	Advisor	5	11/06/2012	The National FFA Organization has been a part of my life since the 1970's. As a student it was valuable in opening opportunities to developing skills in public speaking, team building, record keeping and career exploration. I stayed involved through college and became an agriculture teacher. I find the opportunities for todays students are never ending. The organization is still relevant and evolving to meet the needs of ALL students, rural, suburban or urban communities. 
National FFA Organization	134046		/users/profile/179815	BobbyWeb	Donor	5	11/06/2012	It only takes a few minutes in the presence of these young people to clearly understand the unique value that the FFA brings to youth.  Their focus on leadership development, work-based learning and agriculture education is yielding some of the most talented young leaders I have ever had the priviledge of interfacing with in our industry.  Whether your family is rooted in agriculture or not.  The FFA is truly changing the landscape of youth development.  The old perception that agriculture is just for farmers is a complete myth.  Today's agriculture spans the gammit of available career pathways and the FFA is preparing this young people for career readiness in many areas such as biotechnology, manufacturing, sales, marketing, finance and economics, scientific research as well as production agriculture.  
National FFA Organization	134040		/users/profile/179808	Bonjour	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/06/2012	The FFA is an incredible organization which emphasizes leadership opportunities for youth in areas related to agriculture.  I took my first agricultural education class in high school, despite my parents' and counselor's recommendations and never looked back.  My degrees are in agricultural education and I work with FFA members all the time.  It truly changes lives.  Whether you realize it or not, everyone is involved in agriculture in that everyone eats.  Likewise, the FFA can benefit everyone, regardless if their career goals include farming, some agricultural industry, or nothing remotely related to ag.  Football stars, actors, doctors, lawyers, and even past U.S. presidents have been members of this youth organization.  The FFA is a powerful association.   
National FFA Organization	134029		/users/profile/179797	kcouture	Advisor	5	11/06/2012	I joined FFA in my freshman year of high school and have never looked back. I became an agriculture teacher and after nearly 30 years I can honestly say that the National FFA Organization changes students lives. The FFA is the premier student leadership organization in the United States and has been emulated all over the world. I have seen so many students find their place in the world through their involvement with the FFA at the chapter, state and national levels. The National FFA Organization has changed to make it relevant to all young people, not just farm kids. It is forward thinking, socially aware and initiative driven.
National FFA Organization	134003		/users/profile/179770	AgJB099	Client Served	5	11/06/2012	I can honestly say that I don't know where I would be today without the National FFA Organization. I started my FFA experience as a sophomore in high school and quickly found that I had a passion for plants, thanks to my horticulture class and my fantastic Ag. Ed. instructor. Thanks to the FFA, I had the opportunity to pursue my passion for plants in crop judging, floriculture, and landscape contests and am now a university student pursuing a degree in crop and weed sciences. Also through my experience, I developed my leadership skills. I went from being a shy, quiet girl to the president of my state FFA association. My best friends, my work experience, my mentors, my university, my passion for agriculture, my leadership skills; I have these because of the FFA. I constantly look around at my life and find that most everything I have been given the opportunity to do is because of the impact FFA created in my life. I cannot thank FFA enough for the opportunities it has given me and for helping me become the person I am today. 
National FFA Organization	133945		/users/profile/179709	Kaylie A.	Volunteer	5	11/05/2012	As a high school student, FFA was a place I felt as though I could fit in and have a fun time with my friends.  However, as I became more active, FFA was no longer just the organization I was part of; I began learning what it meant to be a global citizen.  This organization provided me with a reality check that was sorely missing from my sheltered experiences in the rural Catskills.  Through FFA I learned the importance of community service and what it will take to overcome the World Food Crisis. In addition, I also was given the opportunity to develop my self-confidence by participating in speaking events and lobbying on behalf of agriculture on both the state and national level.  There is no way I would be where I am today without this organization.
National FFA Organization	133924		/users/profile/179686	carolr	General Member of the Public	4	11/05/2012	Although I had no knowledge of FFA before coming to teach at the PPCSD (born & raised in NYC), I'm continually impressed by their involvement in community activities.  Every student needs to find his/her niche, and the more opportunities for education we can offer, the better!  Keep up the great work, FFA!!
National FFA Organization	133872		/users/profile/179631	c.macneil	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/05/2012	It is unfortunate that I did not hear of FFA until I was in college & learned about it as part of my education, now that I am an FFA advisor it is an awe inspiring process to watch my students grow throughout their years in the FFA.  They develop a love for agriculture which will serve them well throughout their lifetime as well as learn public speaking, leadership & career success skills that will assist them in achieving their goals.  The number of opportunities that the FFA offers to students far out paces anything else I have ever seen in any other organization - I wish every student would grab those opportunities & take advantage of them to the best of their abilities, those who do truly shine.
National FFA Organization	133864		/users/profile/179620	MSWITT44	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/05/2012	I know I may be biased about Agriculture Education and FFA since I am a professional in this area, but FFA has to rank as one of the top clubs in any school.  The reason being is that it stands for all that's good in the world and has tremendous leadership skill potential for students-I don't know how many students will tell you the reason where they are today is because of what they did in FFA.  The other thing about FFA is that it can connect with any student in any school-there is something in FFA for everyone.  There is a reason why the National FFA Convention is the largest youth convention in the U.S. and many State Conventions are the largest their respective state.  Last but not least, there is a bond between FFA members and their advisors (teacher sponsors) that nothing else seems to parallel.  As an FFA advisor myself, I get invited to all my students graduations and to most of their weddings etc.  You know you are doing things correctly when a student (or ex-student) thinks enough of their teacher to invite them to important family events.
National FFA Organization	133834	1	/users/profile/179591	TMarten	Advisor	5	11/05/2012	The National FFA directly impacts students in communities (rural, suburban and urban) by developing the leadership and career skills through contests, interviews, and conferences. Tied in with agricultural education so that students can learn about feed, fueling and beautifying our planet. 
National FFA Organization	133832	1	/users/profile/179589	mlucyw4	Volunteer	5	11/05/2012	I was inspired and impressed the first time I heard a 15-year-old in a blue jacket recite a creed about the past, present and future of agriculture. It gave me chills then and still does to this day. At that time I decided that I wanted every young person to have the opportunity that I didn't and learn about agriculture, leadership and service through FFA. This organization inspires me to work harder and support the students who dedicate themselves to making the future better. I am in awe of those students and thrilled to be able to support the National FFA Organization and it's mission. 
National FFA Organization	133827	1	/users/profile/179583	Debi5033	Volunteer	5	11/05/2012	I was not aware of FFA until my son's best friend introduced him to the organization. Sadly, like many, I assumed that it was all about farming.  As my Son joined the ranks of many FFA members, I understood what the organization was about.  The skills acquired during his time  were many and included leadership, speaking and business skills.  He went on to become a State officer and has become a wonderful young leader due to his time in FFA .Because of my son't success, I was fortunate enough to watch my daughter come out of her shell by also being a part of the high school organization.  I would highly recomment FFA to any young adult who wants to excel above others in their school and life in general.  I am a member of the local alumni chapter and it has been a wonderful experience.  It is my was of giving back to an organization that I didn't have the opportunity to be a part of during my youth.  
National FFA Organization	133825	2	/users/profile/179581	jan.woodworth61	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/05/2012	The FFA is an organization that changes lives.  That sounds like an over-used cliche, but in this case it's true.  As a HS teacher who advised an FFA chapter for many years; as a parent whose children have all been active FFA members; as a local Board of Education member who has seen the FFA in action in our school; as a teacher educator for Career Technical Education teacher who has trained agriculture teachers, I have had the opportunity to see this organization from many angles... and ALL of them are positive and life altering.  Kids find a home through the FFA - they learn about agriculture and become leaders, and they learn about themselves.  The FFA is an organization for everyone - girls, boys, all ethnicities and religions.  Being an FFA member and participating in the wealth of opportunities available to them allows students to become the best they can be and to exceed even their own expectations for what they can do.  Hands down, no other youth organization offers the variety of opportunities available through the FFA.  I stand behind it 100%
National FFA Organization	133821	1	/users/profile/179577	CHSFFA	Advisor	5	11/05/2012	While I was never in FFA, I watched my Uncles, my brother, and my male friends succeed in FFA projects in my small rural high school.  We had a small, but mighty chapter.  I graduated with a degree in Ag/Hort and married a boy who loved agriculture and wanted to teach...that's where I saw kids blossom.  They might not have it in the classroom, but with FFA everybody had a niche.  I became so passionate about this area of agriculture, I went back to school, received my ag ed teaching license and now teach both ag. and science to Jr. High and High school students.  I am the JH advisor and boy do they have energy!  I have to say I love their enthusiasm and this year's convention set them on fire...it was awesome!!  They can't get enough!  Makes my job a lot easier and gives us all something to look forward to in the future, rest a little easier, knowing that it will be in good hands as long as there are Vo-Ag programs and the FFA.
National FFA Organization	133816	1	/users/profile/179571	Kim_53	Donor	5	11/05/2012	I'm familiar with the National FFA Organization both as a former member and as a current sponsor. And it's changing the lives of students across the country, every day. I feel extremely confident  and satisfied  investing my company's money into the work that FFA does to develop leadership, personal growth and career success in its students. I'm a result of their work, and I often credit my FFA experience as the best career preparation possible. 
National FFA Organization	133793	1	/users/profile/179548	MVFFA	Advisor	5	11/05/2012	FFA is hands down the most useful and fulfilling youth organization that will prepare students not only for careers but more importantly for being a productive citizen of our society. 
National FFA Organization	133788	2	/users/profile/179542	Purdue Pete	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/05/2012	FFA is the greatest youth leadership organization in the world. It helps kids speak, conduct meetings and it gives them skills that are not taught in other areas of the school environment.  Many students who were average at the beginning of their FFA careers converted into top flight leaders in the world of agriculture. If your school offers agriculture education in their curriculum, its a nobrainer!! We have had many students go on to higher education, then to high paying jobs because of their FFA experience!!
National FFA Organization	133787	2	/users/profile/179541	carriek	Advisor	5	11/05/2012	The FFA gives so much opportunity for students.  Either learning how to speak in front of groups of people to understand the importance of professionalism.  I have many graduates come back and express to me how FFA has put them ahead of the class and is very successful with post-secondary school and careers!  I am proud to be an advisor and make a difference in all students lives, even if some do not major in agriculture after high school, FFA still gives those students skills they wouldn't receive in any other student organization.   
National FFA Organization	133782		/users/profile/179537	JPAP	Client Served	5	11/05/2012	I am a past memberand FFA advisor. FFA is an amazing organization that focuses on training the next gereration of leaders, businessmen, entreprenuers, and involved citizens. No other organization provides the trainings, experiences and supprt that FFA offers. 
National FFA Organization	133779	1	/users/profile/179534	Delta2009	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/05/2012	I am a product of the organization and chose a career in agricultural education because of the profound impact it had on my life. With the lack of true servant leaders in our country the National FFA Organization provides opportunities for students to become engaged in leadership develop that can change their lives.
National FFA Organization	133770	1	/users/profile/179523	alp0017	Donor	5	11/05/2012	I have donated both money and time to this organization. It is comprised of some of the finest young people in this country who are truly dedicated to making a difference. Most people think of FFA just as kids interested in agriculture but it is so much more. These kids are going to be the future leaders, educators, and innovators of our society. They may or may not be involved in agriculture but what they learn from this organization will help them on their journey through life. The students I see coming out of this organization make me realize more and more that this is one of the best ways I can invest my time and money. It is put to good use and is greatly appreciated. I would also like to add I was a member of this organization for 9 years and I am very appreciative for all the experiences and knowledge I gained. THAT is why I continue to give back to this group. 
National FFA Organization	133757	1	/users/profile/39717	dj1043	Volunteer	5	11/05/2012	National FFA has been one of the top non-profits for me to give my time to. I have learned so much about Agriculture then I ever knew existed. I am so impressed by the young people who are a part of this organization. Their leadership qualities that I have observed are very outstanding. I am more aware of what it takes to feed the world and to have seen not only production farming but the research that goes into trying to feed the world. This organization is a great place for our children to learn and give back.
National FFA Organization	133738	1	/users/profile/179491	TracyK1	Board Member	5	11/05/2012	I can certainly say the FFA had a direct impact in my life.  FFA was a vehicle for both self-improvement and community service.  As a student, I learned who I could become and how I can serve others through my participation in the organization.  Later, as an FFA Advisor, I had the privilege to watch my students reach their potential and develop skills they would not have developed elsewhere.  Now, as a teacher educator and college professor, I watch my college students bring their FFA stories to my classroom in hopes they can bring success and growth to their future students, much like they themselves experienced.
National FFA Organization	133704	1	/users/profile/179454	dustyh93	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/05/2012	Throughout high school and college I was an active member of the FFA. I was headed down a bad road until I was turned around and joined the FFA. Agricultural education gave me more than just skills and ethics, it saved me. This organization helped me finish my high school education and pushed me to pursue a college degree. Now with a degree in Agricultural Science and a great career I believe FFA was the main contribution to where I am now.
National FFA Organization	133689	1	/users/profile/179437	Dwight A.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/05/2012	FFA and agricultural education provided me personal development and leadership training that has benefited me my entire career.  FFA changes lives and gives young people an avenue to develop and pursue a career in agriculture.  It is an honor to continue being a part of this great organization.
National FFA Organization	133671	1	/users/profile/179415	Heidi D.	Client Served	5	11/05/2012	I was an FFA member in high school, and I thank my lucky stars for that experience every day of my life. As an FFA member, I had the opportunity to learn about production agriculture, leadership, and citizenship. It was in FFA that I developed a strong commitment to service and education, which I still carry today. The values of this organization still resonate in every aspect of my life--the strongest and most far-reaching being respect and responsibility. FFA truly lives out its mission of cultivating "premier leadership, personal growth, and career success." Not only does FFA teach its members important agricultural facts and skills, it forms them into some of the nation's finest leaders and most involved citizens.
National FFA Organization	133607	3	/users/profile/179345	April_12	Volunteer	5	11/05/2012	FFA positively benefits so many people and places each year. They encourage premier leadership, personal growth and career success. This amazing organization helped me to become who I am today. 
National FFA Organization	133605	2	/users/profile/179343	Ashley29	Volunteer	5	11/05/2012	Wow! This organization has changed my life. It has given me a drive and work ethic that will follow me throughout my life. The FFA has enabled me to choose a career that I know I am willing to give my all to.  It has also allowed me to make lifelong friends across the nation. One of the greatest things I have ever been involved with. 
National FFA Organization	133601	2	/users/profile/179339	Andrea52	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/05/2012	I continue to be amazed by the ways in which FFA prepares young people for their futures. Their programs encourage students to discover their interests and talents, helps them develop skills and around those skills and talents, and then teaches them how to use those skills to serve others.  Many people think the organization only trains kids to become farmers, but it's so, so much more than that.
National FFA Organization	133590	2	/users/profile/179330	Rob_11	Donor	5	11/05/2012	Amazing Organization supporting over 550,000 young people as they develop premier leadership, gain personal growth and explore successful careers in the agricultural industry and beyond

It is amazing to see the wolves  and to hear how much they contribute to the environment.  I love the face that I can come once a month, sometimes a two times a month to see my Wotan, up close and personal.  It's a beautiful place and the staff are amazing with all the animals, not just wolves but bison, foxes and coyotes.  The staff certainly shows they love them as well as the people who come to tour the park.

Wolf Park Inc	274675		/users/profile/364133	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	12/18/2015	Always thought wolves were fabulous animals but the experience at Wolf Park put me into such a beautiful time beyond anything I could have imagined.  The area itself is well cared for and the setting to show off the wolves, bison, coyotes, and the foxes fit perfectly.  Then you get to meet and spend time with the people and you really get to understand why this is such a great experience.  They respect and love the animals and each other.  As an extra, my family gave me the gift of a wolf sponsership so after a safety and education session, able to actually be with the wolves and that was the most astonishing time.  Nothing negative at any time.  Always top of my best memories.
Wolf Park Inc	274672		/users/profile/364130	Vandana B.	General Member of the Public	5	12/18/2015	It is known that the importance of wolves in keeping thebalance of nature.

A visit there is educational, informative, and so much fun for all, regardless of age. Observing the animals individually and as a pack  and participating in the wolf howl is, as my grandson says, "awesome!". We especially love the night walks and bon fire as a nice round-out to the evening. Thank you for such fun times!Barb Davis

We finally got there this spring, totally in love with it..so much so we adopted a wolf. It is very clean and the staff is super friendly. Such a great learning experience.

Wolf Park Inc	273096		/users/profile/362282	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	11/30/2015	I have always loved wolves, and when I came across their website I knew I had to visit them one day. We ended up going to Wolf Park on our honeymoon. We loved it and I hope that we are able to go back on our 25th which is in 7 years. 
Wolf Park Inc	273076	1	/users/profile/362261	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	11/29/2015	Great place to learn about the Wolf. I had the pleasure to sponsor a wolf a little while ago and had the experience of a lifetime to be able to visit with the pack. The memory will never be forgotten.  
Wolf Park Inc	273066		/users/profile/362251	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	11/29/2015	I have visited Wolf Park with my family, and subscribe to their regular updates.  The care and resources that they devote to the animals who reside there is simply amazing, and the events that they coordinate are always both enlightening and a blast to attend!  From the Howl Nights where guests can howl along with the wolf pack, the Bison Demonstrations where the wolves mock hunt the herd of bison, to the Holiday events where the wolves are provided with treats like pumpkins or turkeys to play with/devour, the team at Wolf Park is always going above and beyond in their work with these animals.
Wolf Park Inc	273050		/users/profile/362235	Writer	Donor	5	11/29/2015	Wolf park is an amazing place where you can learn a lot about wolves. Wolf park is my favorite place to go. Visiting wolf park recharges me physically, mentally, and spiritually. 
Wolf Park Inc	273048		/users/profile/362233	Shannon110	General Member of the Public	5	11/29/2015	Excellent place to bring your kids and learn about the wolves. I had a fanatic time learning new things about the wolves didn't know they love to eat pumpkins.

I live in South Africa where we do not really have wolves and I've been visiting their website for more than 10 years now (since the days of the late Tristan and Marion et al) and I've always been so impressed with them and the work that they do.  I totally love the pictures of Monty Sloan.  Great organisation!
Wolf Park Inc	244436		/users/profile/331345	csutton306	Donor	5	06/02/2015	Both my daughter and I have sponsored wolves at Wolf Park.  After you attend a special training session you can go in with your wolf (with a highly trained Wolf Park Staffer also.) If your wolf isn't feeling sociable, they will take you in with another. It's an awesome experience for a wolf lover. I actually was kissed by my wolf Ayla! Even if you can afford to sponsor a wolf It's still a wonderful place to visit. The people there are friendly and very knowledgeable. This is not just a tourist trap - the people there really love wolves and have studied them for years and  want to share all they have learned about these beautiful animals. 
Wolf Park Inc	244402	1	/users/profile/331306	Anna96	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/02/2015	Not only are the staff at Wolf Park very knowledgeable about the candids at the park, they are also incredibly dedicated to caring for the animals and educating the public about them. No where else can you find a great team, who teaches about candid behavior and the management and socialization of captive wolves, while the public experiences  the animals up close and personal. Anna Grob

Wolf Park Inc	244333		/users/profile/331224	Angela130	General Member of the Public	5	06/02/2015	We took our two children to Wolf Park this spring and it went above and beyond my expectations. We planned on visiting and seeing some animals and having a good time but the staff was so knowledgeable and really new the animals on a personal level. We were part of a tour that the park does many times a day, in which they walk the guests around the park and teach them about the wildlife that they have on the grounds. They don't just point and introduce us to the animals, they teach us. They explain the actions animals in the wild as well in captivity, they teach us new facts that aren't as well known and they inform us of the impact humankind is having on their natural environment. This was such an amazing experience that we even went back that evening for Howl Night and we learned even more about these amazing animals. We can't wait to go back and we are now planning our next visit.

Wolf Park Inc	242401		/users/profile/224056	Ken McCort	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/07/2015	Wolf Park is an amazing place! The staff and volunteers are all science based and use the socialized wolves, coyotes and foxes to help other scientists around the world better understand these creatures. Cognitive testing and other non invasive data is gathered on their populations. The animals are well cared for and look at the people and events help their as "environmental enrichment". I have been privileged to be associated and work with the animals and staff here for over 32 years.  The place just keep getting better!

From celebrating the births of the wolf pups to mourning the losses of the beloved long term wolves.

More people need to be educated about wolves and how important a species they are. Your sanctuary will show your wolf ambassadors to a wide variety of people. This will help their species by educating awareness of their plight in the wild.

Wolf Park Inc	240553		/users/profile/286898	Julie198	General Member of the Public	4	04/05/2015	Wolf Park is a great place to visit. It is a learning experience for those  not familiar with  wolf behavior. The resident wolves are beautiful as are the buffalo and foxes. If one chooses to sponsor a wolf, they have access to personal meetings with the wolves. I truly love this place and treasure each visit.
Wolf Park Inc	223153		/users/profile/286898	Julie198	Donor	5	10/15/2014	Wolf Park is a great place to learn about the wolf. The staff is kind, knowledgeable, and care deeply for the wolves there. Sponsorships are available to enable donors to visit the wolves one on one. I truly love this place. It is a great outing for the whole family.
Wolf Park Inc	240545		/users/profile/326738	cdirosaria	Volunteer	5	04/05/2015	My family and I LOVE visiting Wolf Park!  Just a 10-minute drive outside of Lafayette, Wolf Park offers a unique and educational escape into nature!  We particularly enjoy "Howl Night", where wolves get to strut their stuff, the staff give us a great debriefing on wolf behavior, and we ALL get to participate (even the neighboring dogs and coyotes can be heard joining in the distance). I'd recommend Wolf Park to anyone interested in these beautiful animals. 
Wolf Park Inc	240543		/users/profile/326733	KW2015	Client Served	5	04/05/2015	I love Wolf Park! They do a wonderful job of educating the public about wolves and their behavior and place in our ecosystem. They have wonderful staff and volunteers as well. Of course,  my favorite part are the beautiful wolves.  Love them! !They are a worthy charity and have my full support. 
Wolf Park Inc	240538		/users/profile/326726	Shawn24	General Member of the Public	5	04/05/2015	Great park!! The animals are beautiful and well cared for. I love coming here to see the wolves! They have lots of great activities through the year to allow people to come and learn and enjoy these awesome animals. Thank you Wolf park for caring for all of them.
Wolf Park Inc	240537		/users/profile/326725	amylwatt	General Member of the Public	5	04/05/2015	The Wolf Park is a great organization for wolves and humans! It is so important for people to be exposed to animals like wolves to see their true beauty and learn why it is so important for them to be protected. The park offers great events for humans from behind the scenes tour to howl nights with the wolves (I have personally been to both and theyre both great). You can tell that the staff really cares about their work and the animals they interact with. Definitely a very special place. 
Wolf Park Inc	240536	1	/users/profile/326723	Cindi K.	Client Served	5	04/05/2015	My first visit to Wolf Park was about 15 years ago when I was involved in Greyhound rescue. We brought all my children with. We were educated on this first visit on pack behavior (which was a great lesson, being I had 4 adopted greyhouds in our home, along with fosters).  The wolves were stunning, and the volunteers were great and did a wonderful job. We learned so much!  I have returned many times for visits, can't get enough!  Wolves are essential. Thank you Wolf Park for all you do to educate the world on the truth of the beautiful wolf!
Wolf Park Inc	240534		/users/profile/326720	Angela121	General Member of the Public	5	04/05/2015	We visit Wolf park with our Girl Scout Troop.

Wolf Park Inc	238705		/users/profile/324090	Joshua27	General Member of the Public	5	03/01/2015	Wolf Park is both an educational experience and a thrill every time I've visited.  It's easy to see how dedicated the staff are, how much they love the animals they care for, and how much they believe in their mission to educate the public about the true nature of wolves and further our understanding of them at the same time.  While watching the wolves gambol about the staff members' legs, it was possible to see domesticated canine behavior in their movements, but also the much sterner, prototypical material, the pack mentality, the strength and instincts of hunters.  While the staff seemed at ease they were always firm with the wolves, always careful to maintain the balance they must have worked for years to achieve. Bringing children to see these wolves up close, to prepare food for them, is something I wish every parent could do at some point.  Both generations need to hear the message Wolf Park has for us, whether it's spoken explicitly or observed implicitly.
Wolf Park Inc	238700		/users/profile/324083	thefuture	Volunteer	5	03/01/2015	We as Human Species "SERIOUSLY" need to Educate millions on people to save "MANKIND"! This killing of Wolves, Coyotes & so many other Wildlife Predators "MUST STOP" or Mankind will become "EXTINCTED" in the Future. This Maddness of killing all the Predators & placing Livestock on Public land sold by the Government it a Perfect Combination of promoting Diseases that will cause "PLAGUE's" of thousands of Viruses ( Like Ebola & MAD Cow) to the Human Race. without Predators to weed out and destroy the sick & diseased Elk & deer & others, Livestock will be exposed to Diseases from contact with diseased animals in the wild. Ranchers will sale their sick & diseased Livestock and corporations will process diseased meat to people to eat without knowing it until it's too late.
Wolf Park Inc	238696		/users/profile/257114	Barbrad714	Volunteer	5	03/01/2015	While my son was growing up, we made a number of visits to Wolf Park for tours and Howl Nights.  When a vacancy opened up for a Head Counselor of Summer Camps, I jumped at the opportunity to work at the park. I've always been impressed by the quality of care the animals receive and that the animals' best interests is always #1.  Now that I've been running the camp program for three years and have had the opportunity to see the behind the scenes operations of the park, I can still say that they are top notch in their knowledge and genuine care of the wolves, foxes, coyotes and bison. I recommend you visit the park and become members, enroll your children/grandchildren in camp, and sponsor one or more of our animals so you can go in and visit "your" animal.  The gift shop has quality gifts and mementoes of your visit.  Come visit our new red fox, Scarlette.  She is awesome!  Hope to see you at Wolf Park!!! 
Wolf Park Inc	196709	2	/users/profile/257114	Barbrad714	Volunteer	5	03/29/2014	I first became familiar with Wolf Park when I took my young son for a visit in the mid 1990s.  We took the tour and came back later for Howl Night.  As an animal lover, I have very high standards when it comes to the care of captive animals.  What I saw and heard impressed me.  Every aspect of my visit was highly positive.  The animal care staff was knowledgeable about the species and about the individual animal and the animals' best interests were always the top priority.  We returned a number of times and when new neighbors moved in across the street, I brought their children to Wolf Park.   I am a teacher and Wolf Park became a favorite place for field trips. The staff provided detailed, educational information about wolf behavior in the wild and in captivity.  They educated my students on the true nature of wolves as opposed to the wolf in fiction.   In the spring of 2012, I received an email at school indicating that Wolf Park was seeking a Head Camp Counselor to direct their summer camp program. I knew it was an excellent summer job for me and two hours later, I placed my resume on the desk at Wolf Park.  I was thrilled to be offered the position.  This summer, I look forward to my third summer running the camps at Wolf Park and educating children about wolves. When camp is not in session, I volunteer at the Park.  I've had many opportunities to observe human-animal interactions and I continue to be very impressed by the staff's dedication to the well-being of the wolves, coyotes, foxes and bison.  The founder of Wolf Park, Dr. Klinghammer, believed that when you keep an animal in captivity, it is your responsibility to provide environmental enrichment to keep the animals mentally stimulated and happy.  These enriching activities take place throughout the year and are great fun for humans and animals alike.   Wolf Park has a large (almost 7 acre) main pack enclosure as well as smaller enclosures in the East Lake Retirement Center.  Since Wolf Park takes outstanding care of the wolves, they live very long lives and just like humans may need assisted living as they age, the animals often need a place to retire apart from the main pack.  The staff is dedicated to providing all the care the animal needs to be healthy and comfortable.  The animals receive vet care throughout their lives. Wolf Park is a world renowned wolf research facility conducting behavioral research.  Animal science majors from universities around the world travel to Wolf Park to learn about canis lupus.  One of the most extensive libraries of books, research papers and audio/visual materials on wolves are available for these students.  I just can't say enough good things about the park.  The large numbers of dedicated volunteers and interns speaks volumes about the quality of care they give to the animals.  Visit the park, take a tour, howl with the wolves, attend a seminar, attend a special event and send your children to summer camp at Wolf Park.  You will walk away with a new appreciation of the wolf and their importance to the environment. 
Wolf Park Inc	238695	1	/users/profile/324072	Eveline L.	Volunteer	5	03/01/2015	I have supported Wolf Park for two decades because of their mission to save wolves, foxes, coyotes, provide ample enrichment for the animals, education and fun events for visitors. I loved howl night and getting to meet my wolves. Sponsors get regular updates. 
Wolf Park Inc	238694	1	/users/profile/324070	Ben_43	General Member of the Public	5	03/01/2015	We love the Wolf Park.  Unfortunately, not as many people in Indiana know about it outside of the local area.  We've been to several events, and howling with the wolves is always a favorite for kids (and parents).  The staff here has always been great, and they answer a ton of questions for the visitors.  The admission is cheap, and they have an enclosed viewing room in addition to the bleachers in case of bad weather. Because we live in Indianapolis, we typically try to time our visits with other events in the Lafayette area and a visit to Prophetstown State Park or some of the local memorials.  Wolf Park is appropriate for all ages, and would probably make for a unique and fun date night.  Their website lists lots of events, so there is almost always something going on.
Wolf Park Inc	237561		/users/profile/322275	Cheryl130	Volunteer	5	02/03/2015	I think it was deplorable what the white man did to this  beautiful animals to be begin with when they came to America and  Canada.  They not have to hunt just about extinction. They are for a purpose just like us.

The tours/talks are interesting and you're sure to learn something new. The staff is wonderful.

Wolf Park Inc	237533	1	/users/profile/322226	Mark158	Donor	5	02/02/2015	A long time ago I sponsored the release of two wolves being introduced to Yellowstone National Park. Imagine my surprised when I learned of the research center in my own state. I scheduled a meeting and had a VIP tour which I became a member and sponsor of a pup named Marion.  For many years we supported her and made quarterly trips up to see her.  It is a great facility, well trained staff and your chance to see wolves among other animals. Monty's photography is also awesome and he holds seminars.  Please visit and make donations.  I encourage you to sponsor as well. I wish I could do more.
Wolf Park Inc	237530		/users/profile/322220	Carole29	General Member of the Public	5	02/02/2015	My name is Carole and my husband and I went to spend the day at CWWC outside of Colorado Springs a little over a year ago.  It was the most  wonderful experience in our lives.  We spent the day on a wonderful walk, one on one experience inside with the wolves and a photo session, a moonlight walk and a educational group talk around a huge fire pit.  It was a day i will never forget. I spent over $600 willingly to get gifts, mementos, and sponsor a few of the wolves at the center. I would never use that money for anything more worthy than that day.  We had a day and experience that will for ever change our lives.   We plan on returning every year at least once and keep up with what's happening at the center and around the world. We are very proud to not only be an advocate and and supporter of such a well organized and exceptional establishment. Thank you for all you do!
Wolf Park Inc	236458		/users/profile/320372	Cynthia87	General Member of the Public	5	01/07/2015	I first learned of Wolf Park well over 10 years ago and I've been a fan ever since.  You come to completely understand the wolf and to appreciate them!  Being a photographer, the opportunity to photograph wolves has been one of the highlights of my life!  Now I finally know and understand wolves and I totally love them.  I can value their role and appreciate this majestic creature!  Wolf Park is a research facility that educates the public so that we can understand and not hate wolves.  I really cannot put into words how deeply I feel about the work that they do and how I feel about these wolves.  The wolves themselves have become my friends.  To lose them in death has been simply devastating!  Wolf Park and the wolves have enriched my life in so many ways...too numerous too count!  I've been a member for many years, an active photographer for many years and have talked to many people about this great facility and about wolves.  How do you sum up something that has touched your heart so much?  I don't know how to!
Wolf Park Inc	236289		/users/profile/320132	jtson21	General Member of the Public	5	01/05/2015	My wife and I love and adore wolves.  We went to a "day with the wolves" seminar and it was amazing.  We got to meet almost every one of the wolves and got many wolf kisses.  I will do again.  I would recommend it to anyone who loves wolves.  It is cheap to take a walking tour too.  I can't wait to go back.

Wolf Park Inc	236273		/users/profile/320104	Peter58	General Member of the Public	5	01/05/2015	I drove here from Wisconsin to attend their annual Turkey Toss. I'd never seen grey wolves in person, but they were so lovely! The staff was very well informed and just as friendly. I'd go every day if I could. I certainly miss watching Daphne bully her penmates out of food!
Wolf Park Inc	236269		/users/profile/320097	DiggerGirl	Donor	5	01/05/2015	What an incredible place! They do so much to educate people about a terribly misunderstood species. Socializing their wolves to humans and allowing interaction with sponsors sets them apart from zoos. Their wolves are true ambassadors of the species. I have always loved wolves. As a child, I rooted for the wolf in "Little Red" and "The Three Pigs." I first saw one in captivity when I was six, and have wanted to pet one ever since. Because of Wolf Park, I was able to realize this dream. Not only did I get to pet one, but three! I even received lovely wolf kisses. The experience was awe-inspiring. The required safety program, prior to entering the enclosure was comprehensive and informative.
Wolf Park Inc	236268		/users/profile/257106	Sherri18	Volunteer	5	01/05/2015	My husband had promised to take me to Wolf Park; however, he died before we could go.  I went for a visit and fell in love with the wolves and the whole experience.  It is so educational and I learned so very much about wolves, coyotes and foxes.  I wound up volunteering for 7 years until I moved to the UK after marrying a Brit.  I cannot begin to tell you the feeling when you walk into an enclosure with the wolves.  One time they were in a circle around me and did a group howl.  Absolutely thrilling.  Everyone who works at the Park does it because they love the animals and take such wonderful care of them.  Evening carrying buckets of water to them in the winter when it freezes.  It is a very special place.  
Wolf Park Inc	196703	3	/users/profile/257106	Sherri18	Volunteer	5	03/29/2014	As a former volunteer at Wolf Park, I can recommend the Park to everyone.  The Park makes every effort to properly educate the public in wolf behaviour.  I learned so very much while there. So many people work so hard to be sure all of the animals are kept healthy and happy.  I treasure the 7 years I was there and still miss the animals and staff.

I *intentionally* planned another trip "to visit relatives", so we had an excuse to go back. Hmm, I think we may need to visit those relatives again. Lol. It's a wonderful experience for the whole family!  I *highly* recommend it!

You can see them up close in a nice field area. Their enclosures are huge and natural. The tour was great. Very knowledgeable staff. Nice gift shop too. We hope to visit again.
Wolf Park Inc	234018		/users/profile/298090	adder7	General Member of the Public	5	11/19/2014	A teacher friend told me of this place. She had taken her own children there nearly 20 years ago. We were happy to find it in operation and I took my twin daughters there last summer. We live 4 hours away and have been back 2 other times and plan to go again soon before the winter. My girls learned so much from their camp and our own experiences there from the workers. They have done great things in studies/research and to inspire young people to become advocates for wolves! Thank you for all the dedication and hard work you do!!!!!!!!!!

The volunteers there really take the time to introduce the wolves to the public. They seem to really love being a part of that community. Every time we leave there, we feel as if we're a part of their family! We truly enjoy visiting with the wolves, and seeing them in their habitat.

Wolf Park Inc	233964		/users/profile/298023	Rwils873	General Member of the Public	5	11/19/2014	I can't say enough great things about Wolf Park. The staff members  are extremely friendly and amazingly knowledgeable.  There has never been I time that they haven't been able to answer any questions I had. I had the pleasure of spending the day with Mrs. Goodman and Mr. Slone.  To see these wonderful people educate the public about wolves, their habitats,  and behavior was awe inspiring.  The most impressive thing is the way they love the wolves at Wolf Park.  You really get to see the bond between human and wolf. Wolf Park is an excellent place and really does give me hope that through education, wolves can be reintroduced to an environment and people will not feel they have to be hunted down.  I can't wait till I can go back. Wolf Park is fantastic! Regina Work

I heard about it as a student at Purdue, ended up spending 2 years learning about wolves and volunteering with their veterinarian as I could. I am now in vet school and still tell people about this place all of the time as an example of a very well run educational facility that takes wonderful care of their animals.
Wolf Park Inc	233960		/users/profile/298015	Karen317	Donor	5	11/19/2014	Wolf Park is an amazing facility that allows the public to view the animals, students from all over the world to participate in internships, and others to learn and study animal behavior. The animals are clearly the priority for the caring and very knowledgeable staff.  The park welcomes children and families to participate in fun, holiday themed activities, thus making learning about animals an enjoyable and entertaining activity. Although my education and career path are not of an animal behavior nature, I enjoy attending the 3 day seminars they frequently offer which include non-staff guest speakers. The seminars I have attended have given me a wealth of information in understading and relatng to my own pet (non-wolf) dogs behaviors.

I believe all living things are part of the natural order of our beautiful World and sustaining all life sustains humans too.  it's so good to have a place like Wolf Park for kids to learn the importance of taking care of these magnificent creatures and how they relate to our well being.

Wolf Park Inc	223247		/users/profile/286988	artlyonart	General Member of the Public	4	10/15/2014	I was saddened to see how little Wolf Park can afford to spend on visitor facilities. They're fine, with a drcent gift shop, but the place needs our donations and support to grow and improve and become even better. You go for the wolves and they are magnificent and beautiful and huge and frightening all at once. My only regret is not having more $$ to donate. What a wonderful opportunity,  andvwe will go again.

It all began with our love of wolves and our desire to see the myth of "The Big, Bad Wolf" expunged. I am a professional illustrator and spent a week at Wolf Park studying and sketching a dozen of the pack members to produce a portfolio called "The Wolves of Wolf Park." There is no describing what an awe-inspiring experience it was. I got to know these magnificent animals individually and to study their behavior in as close to natural conditions as possible. Howling with them on a starry night as I sat by a bonfire with a gathering of the park's helpers is a magical memory I will cherish for life. Wolf Park educates, raises awareness, busts misconceptions about and above all helps the survival chances of Canis Lupus, the great ancestor of all our beloved domesticated dogs. Their work, done with absolute love and respect, is essential.

I remember the joy when new pups arrive and I have cried with the passing of each wolf I have gotten to know.  The wolves, coyotes, and foxes are very well cared for and well socialized.  The staff love the wolves and are very well versed in wolf management and care.  I highly recommend it to anyone interested in wolves.  The sound of the wolves howling at night is one of the most amazing sounds I have ever heard.  I'm not sure where the poster who gave Wolfpark 2 stars was actually at, but everything she said I have never experienced.  The only thing I can think of is she was talking to a new intern.

Wolf Park Inc	213145		/users/profile/276287	Gabrina G.	Client Served	2	09/03/2014	I have very mixed feelings about Wolf Park. We were there when they had fox kits and they were being hand raised. I asked the woman who seemed to be in charge--she was greasy-haired, braless and barefoot--and she said they came from a breeding program. Essentially, they were bought from a "puppy mill" type situation that specializes in exotics. That was NOT the answer I was expecting. The woman who was sitting in fox urine seemed annoyed that I dared to ask where the fox kits came from instead of just accepting that they were there being hand raised. I even asked what happens to the moms and she said she didn't know. A little horrifying for a place that is supposed to be about the well-being of these animals. Their youngest wolves have a lot of health issues caused by bad breeding. Again, not what I was expecting to hear. I don't know if it's a lack of funding or a lack of caring, but we were there twice in the last ten years and after the last visit we are officially done with Wolf Park. If you choose to visit, ask lots of questions. People need to know about this place, both the good and the bad.
Wolf Park Inc	213138		/users/profile/276278	JeanB219	Donor	5	09/03/2014	I enjoy all the information that wolf park has to offer. The people there take very good care of all these wolves and make sure they get everything they need.You can even sponsor a wolf and actually go into the cage with them and get to know them and all their personalities that's the best part. Also there's a tour they give to see all the different wolves,coyotes,bison,and foxes. I highly recommend going to wolf park and learning about them its well worth it     
Wolf Park Inc	213137		/users/profile/276277	Leslie59	General Member of the Public	5	09/03/2014	My high school biology teacher, Mr. Weiss, used to take his classes to Wolf Park. We studied the wolves and the inner workings of the pack during the semester and we would ultimately end up at the park itself to observe and learn for a day. I went in 1991 and remember the day my class visited the park with Mr. Weiss to this very day. I even remember the names of the wolves and their ranking in the pack. Imbo, Chinook, Altaire, Ursa, Vega...all still in my mind's eye. For years I kept my detailed notes from that semester and that field trip just so I could look back and recall that day. I wasn't a great student in high school, as a matter of fact, when I visited the park my senior year, I was pregnant with my daughter, school wasn't a priority for me but that trip sparked an interest in me that has stayed with me over the years. My love for nature, biology and wolves was sparked in a classroom and was sealed at Wolf Park. It's such an amazing place and it truly, truly changed my life 23 years ago.

My kids/extended family have enjoyed a wide variety of "outings" to the Park, and have always had a fun and educational time there. To see the wolves, (and foxes and  coyotes  ) in such an accessible yet "wild" setting really allows for a deeper understanding of them, and of their importance to our world.

Wolf Park Inc	199470		/users/profile/260407	timlori	General Member of the Public	5	05/01/2014	I have had a lifelong fascination with wolves, but I did not get to Wolf Park to feed that interest until I was in my 60s and lived many states away.  I'm sorry I waited that long, but it was more than worth the wait.  The magnificent animals who live and thrive there, along with the dedicated, enthusiastic and well-educated staff who are more than willing to share their knowledge with others, made my 3-day visit more than I ever imagined possible.  What I learned was remarkable, though not surprisingly the highlight of the journey was quality time spent up close with the wolves themselves.  I've been a card carrying, paid-up member of Wolf Park ever since.  I donate when I can, and look forward to my next visit!
Wolf Park Inc	198372		/users/profile/259086	wolveseyolvesey	Client Served	5	04/19/2014	Wolf Park made my dream come true. When I was about 7 years old my class took a field trip up to the park, and they debunked all the fairytale horror stories that surrounded wolves. I instantly fell in love with those "huge dogs" behind the fence and desperately wanted to pet one. I spent the next 11 years learning everything that I could about wolves, even going so far as to travel out to Yellowstone twice in hopes that I'd see a wild wolf. I was lucky enough to catch a quick glimpse of one through some binoculars, and though it was super cool to see a wolf in its natural habit, I still had that wish to pet one.  When I turned 18, I was able to sponsor a wolf at Wolf Park and go into her enclosure. The staff did an amazing job preparing me before I went in, showing me a video of wolf body/facial expressions and how to act around the animals. They took great care to make sure that I was safe as well as making sure the animal was comfortable. The specific wolf that I sponsored was a very shy girl who preferred to keep her distance from new comers. The staff informed me that there was a very good chance that she wouldn't come up to me and that they wouldn't force her. I accepted this, and as I entered the enclosure I kept my distance from her and knelt on the ground as I was instructed. The staff waited next to me, calling to her a bit (she loved the staff members who had come into the enclosure with me, so she was debating the pros and cons of coming over to us ;) ). Eventually she worked up the courage to come over, sniff me, and let me pet her. I would have never gotten to have such a wonderful experience if it hadn't been for the amazing staff at this truly unique park.

Wolf Park Inc	196710	2	/users/profile/257116	jodyharkey	Volunteer	5	03/29/2014	My first experience at Wolf Park was as an intern. I can honestly say that I have never met a group of people more dedicated to education about wild canids (wolves, foxes, and coyotes). The Park goes above an beyond what is necessary and/or required for public safety while also ensuring that visitors get to see wild canids up close. I would recommend a visit to Wolf Park to anyone. For those who want to learn a little more, volunteer and internship opportunities are well worth it. 
Wolf Park Inc	196704	3	/users/profile/257107	jofoo82	Volunteer	5	03/29/2014	I was lucky enough to take part in Wolf Park's Internship Programme in summer 2003.  I spent 3 months working for the park and learning about wolf behaviour, ecology, recovery and conservation.  I also had the amazing opportunity to work with a hugely dedicated team of staff members who are passionate about the conservation and protection of this species.  They work tirelessly to promote understanding of this sometimes controversial animal with the ambassador wolves that live there.  They provide a unique education resource for many and have visitors travel from all over the world to see their work and learn from their research.  Home to wolves, foxes, coyotes and bison, Wolf Park is easily one of the best facilities I have seen and had the pleasure of working for.   They provide tours, lectures and a huge range of courses to help people better understand behaviour.  For a lucky few, there is also the opportunity to interact with some of the wolves at the park to further this understanding and connection. I have revisited the park 4 times in 2007, 2010, 2011 & 2013 (travelling from the UK each time) both to volunteer and conduct research into what visitors learn from their experience there.  You can find more details about my recent interviews which were conducted at the park via my blog: http://wildlifebyjo.wordpress.com/ http://wildlifebyjo.wordpress.com/2014/01/02/managing-wolves-an-interview-with-dana-drenzek-from-wolf-park/ http://wildlifebyjo.wordpress.com/2013/10/25/wolf-park-what-the-visitors-think/ http://wildlifebyjo.wordpress.com/2013/10/16/wolf-park-a-volunteers-perspective/ http://wildlifebyjo.wordpress.com/2013/10/05/a-day-with-wolves/ Wolf Park is a very special place and one which has had a lasting impact on my life and career choices.

Wolf Park Inc	196702	3	/users/profile/257105	Veronica_S	Volunteer	5	03/29/2014	I was an intern for three months during 2004 and it was an amazing and very educational time. The resident staff is extremely knowledgable in the field of animal behaviour and I learned so much about ethological studies in general and canine behaviour in particular. They offered guided tours, behaviour demonstrations, wolf-bison interaction demo (which most often was the best opportunity to watch both wolves and bison eating apples (tossed to the bison) side by side, as the bison are too big for 2-3 wolves to handle in the middle of the day) and the ever popular Howl Night that attracted solid crowds every Friday and Saturday evening. I consider myself very lucky to have been given the opportunity to work and study in such wonderful settings! After my stay at Wolf Park, I conducted an environmental enrichment study on a captive pack of wolves at a zoo in the U.K. as a part of my degree. Those wolves were non-socialized and the difference in behavioural spectra between the UK and Wolf Park wolves was striking. The wolves in the UK hardly did anything but run to the far-end of their enclosure when visitors passed by and had almost no interactions among the pack during visiting hours. It was extremely rare to see them at a full rest with their head down, lying on their sides. This was ABSOLUTELY NOT the case with the wolves at Wolf Park, where we were able to observe relaxed wolves, interactive behaviours and it wasn't until I spent time at the other zoo that I fully realised how much these animals benefit from being socialized when in a captive setting. Having socialized animals opens up a whole new tool box for keeping captive animals from getting bored in their surroundings, something that is often painfully obvious in traditional zoos. At Wolf Park, staff can interact with the wolves and apply some training methods to keep the wolves interested and enriched and relaxed around human presence. This is key to keep stress levels low and stereotypic behaviours at bay. Cortisol analyses of Wolf Park wolves compared to non-socialized wolves also confirmed that non-socialized wolves are much more stressed. I'm glad to say that zoos in Sweden have started to catch up and the use of, for example, clicker-training based exercises to provide behavioural enrichment is becoming ever more common also among non-socialized animals.The canine behaviour lessons and the training methods that I learned at Wolf Park have held up all these years, also in my role as a dog owner. I can recommend attending seminars and training courses that Wolf Park organizes as you are likely to come out the other end much more knowledgable and with new perspectives on animal behaviour and animal handling. Wolf Park provides a great visitor experience, a quite unique opportunity to observe wolves behaving like wolves, and the opportunity to learn an immense amount about wolves and canine behaviour! I would recommend it to each and everyone who have ever considered going there, as visitors and/or as interns, practicums and volunteers.
Wolf Park Inc	196698	3	/users/profile/257099	BlakeP	Volunteer	5	03/29/2014	When I moved to the Lafayette area in late 2004 to work at Purdue (Biomedical), I saw signs for Wolf Park and went to visit over the Christmas Holidays.  In years past, I had visited and been a sponsor at other wolf-related facilities, so knew a bit about wolves, behavior studies, ecology, and more.  By the time my tour ended, I was impressed enough that I signed up as a volunteer that day.   The facility has acreage not only to support it's main pack in style, but to provide a retirement community and a buffer against future urban growth.  Unlike the wild, where adult wolves who are forced out of the pack (essentially to die) for reasons of age or social incompatibility, Wolf Park provides space where they can live long and happy lives.  While it can't allow dispersal by young wolves to create new packs, it can provide the opportunity for evolving pack dynamics to take place.  While the evolving main pack makes use of the large enclosure (app. 7 acres), those voted out of the pack have enclosures of varying sizes to allow them to form mini-packs or be by themselves.  Smaller enclosures are used for those elderly or sick so they don't have to move far for food or water, while allowing staff and volunteers to monitor them closely.  Larger enclosures can easily handle groups of three or even four at need; and, it should be noted that those in the retirement community get to choose their companions.   Wolf Park has also been in the forefront of efforts to prevent inbreeding not just at the Park, but at wolf facilities nationwide.  Despite any ignorant comments you may read, the wolves at Wolf Park do not come from a single pair.  If you listen, or do even a small bit of research online, you will find that Wolf Park is part of a network that shares both genealogical information on the wolves, as well as wolf pups, with other accredited facilities.  This helps ensure a lack of inbreeding as well as helping other facilities with responsible breeding and growth.   Sadly, the wolf-bison demonstrations at Wolf Park have been halted due to what I personally regard as yet another ignorant complaint (complaint may have been filed by someone who never visited the Park).  In the wild, it usually takes six or more adult wolves to bring down even a small, sick, or injured bison.  At Wolf Park, the practice was to take a couple of wolves in with the bison so they could act on their natural instincts to track, explore, and do the opening phases of how they would hunt in the wild.  This allowed them a more natural life, posed effectively no danger to the bison, and minimal danger to the wolves.  It did not seem to stress the bison on the days they agreed to take part, and I would note that many days the wolves either preferred to explore and hunt smaller game (moles, voles, and mice) or both parties seemed to feel it was too hot to do anything other than cool off in the water.  Bison watering troughs make dandy wolf swimming pools as it turns out.  There is a LOT more I could say on this subject, and if you are interested the staff can go into detail on activities, studies, and more if you want facts rather than emotions.  A great deal of research does take place in the park, and if you actually listen to what is said, you can find out about those published studies.  These range from studies on other canids (foxes and coyotes) to intelligence tests on the wolves.  The behavior studies (ethology for the uninformed) are a backbone of the research undertaken by Park founder, the late Erich Klinghammer.  In fact, if you actually listen to what is said, you might find that several leaders in wolf conservation and study efforts got their start at Wolf Park, at least one rather well-known (and respected) researcher was himself a puppy "mom" many years back.   If you want to hold to romantic and ignorant notions of wolves as paragons of virtue, monogamous, and other tripe, then Wolf Park is not the place for you.   If you actually care to listen and learn, and deal with facts, then you can learn a great deal about wolf behavior, language, and how some of that translates to other canids including dogs.  We can and do get them to howl, but also note that there is often a fairly regular and set amount of time that passes between howling sessions.  Want to know more about it, then ask and I'm sure that any staff member or volunteer will tell you all you want to know about what we jokingly refer to as "recharging the howl battery." In fact, if you have questions we are very good about getting those answered by people who have decades of experience with wolves and animal behavior.  Want to learn even more?  Then sign up for one of the many special lectures and sessions done by staff and outside experts in everything from wolves to dog training.   There is much to learn at Wolf Park if you will listen and participate.  Bring a sense of humor, a sense of adventure, and be willing to consider new information, and you will have a great time and come away much the richer.  If not, that's your loss and harmful to real efforts to save and protect our environment.   Oh, and to answer the question I'm most often asked at the Park:  do I trust the wolves?  Yes, I do.  I trust them to be wolves, and treat them with the respect and care that deserves.  Only a fool (or the sadly underinformed) would try to treat them as a dog, or think that we do so.  To answer the second-most asked question, I personally do think they have a sense of humor, and it is low (gotcha). There have been no formal studies in this regard, so my take is purely anecdotal, but...   Come listen, learn, and make up your own mind about the Park and the questions of the day.   
Wolf Park Inc	196697	3	/users/profile/257098	SharonChen	Volunteer	5	03/29/2014	I was accepted as an extern in March 2013.  A place with wolves, coyotes, foxes, bisons, big field and friendly people is just awesome.  The staffs and senior volulnteers are all welcoming and willing to give us full assisstance.  We were offered lots of chances to participate in daily park-maintaining activities, from ground cleaning to interacting with wolves. I felt considered and well-treated as an amateur and non-native English speaker (I came from Taiwan). It's a wonderful place and I have arranged my second visit!
Wolf Park Inc	196696	2	/users/profile/257097	jlipton	Volunteer	5	03/29/2014	Wolf Park is an incredible organization, and one of the only places in the United States with in-depth research and observation of captive wolves.  I completed two internships here, one during the Winter Season and one during the Summer, and it absolutely changed my life, and left me with a strong dedication to pursuing scientifically-informed conservation.  All the animals are pretty much treated like kings.  The park only breeds with other organizations with a good track record of socializing and taking care of their animals.  Every species, save the bison, are hand-raised and smothered with love from 10 days old.  Wolf Park has pursued and accomplished some amazing advances towards socializing animals, which allows interaction between all kinds of people and these fascinating predators.On top of that, the park is focused equally on research and education.  Tours and demonstrations are packed full of information.  A sign of a good organization is how long its staff stick around, and most of Wolf Park's staff are in for life.  The volunteers are equally dedicated, and any one of them know as much as ecology as most grad students, and are so happy to share everything they know.The park is small, and completely independent of government funds.  They do incredibly with the resources they have, and have been included in some fascinating research in the 40 years they've been open.  In all that time, the park has never experienced a critical injury between humans and wolves, and continually provided an incredible opportunity for both scientists and the public. 
Wolf Park Inc	196695	1	/users/profile/257096	MeredithWJ	Volunteer	5	03/29/2014	I have completed two internships at Wolf Park, as well as travelled from Boston, MA to Indiana many times over the past 7 years in order to volunteer.  That's right, my idea of a vacation is volunteering at Wolf Park. You could not find a more dedicated group of people than the staff, interns, and volunteers at Wolf Park.  The park was initially started as a research facility to study animal behavior, in this case, wolves and other wild canids.  Wolf Park has contributed amazing research in the field of ethology, and many wolf centers throughout the country have used Wolf Park as a model for their own facilities.  It also contributes public education programs for visitors, including public and private tours.  The wolves at Wolf Park are socialized, meaning they are used to having people around.  This is very helpful in allowing them to be viewed by complete strangers without being stressed out, also for checking their overall health, and creating opportunities for behavior enrichment.  This does not in any way mean they are pets or even that they act like dogs. If anything, dogs exhibit aspects of wolf behavior. Wolf Park did organize wolf-bison demonstrations for many years, by placing two or three wolves into a large enclosure with their bison herd.  A healthy bison has nothing to fear from wolves, and while the wolves would show interest and occasionally test the bison, neither species ever inflicted any serious harm upon the other.  The demonstrations ended recently after a complaint was made, and the USDA (needlessly, in many peoples' opinions) prohibited such interactions from taking place. Another neat things about the park is that the bloodline found in the most recent generation of pups can be traced back to the original wolves forty years ago. That's quite an accomplishment! Wolves have also been brought in from other wildlife centers to encourage genetic diversity, and while some wolves will mate with siblings given the choice, steps are taken (such as sterilization) to prohibit too much inbreeding.  Wolf Park has contributed to wolf research in the wild through their own behavior research, and it is a valuable educational facility, as well as a great place for families to come and learn more about an animal that few people ever get to see up close. 
Wolf Park Inc	196694	3	/users/profile/257095	AshleighS	Volunteer	5	03/29/2014	I first learned of Wolf Park in a newspaper article. My first visit was to a Howl Night in January. There weren't many people but the staff gave a wonderful presentation. I knew I wanted to come back. I became an intern the next summer. I learned so much about wolves, their status and behaviors in the wild compared to captivity, as well as how new research of wild wolves had changed through the decades and how it compares to what we thought we knew from captive behaviors. I continued to volunteer as well as complete two additional summer internships. I had the privilege of being a "puppy mom" for the two wonderful coyotes who live at the park. Wolf Park animals are socialized to humans from the time they are small puppies. The people who are with them constantly and care for them as puppies are referred to as puppy moms. It leads to less stress during their lives since they aren't afraid of humans and many look forward to interactions. It is a great asset in their long term health care. The staff is very knowledgeable and they care greatly for the animals.  I've also had the opportunity to hear great presentations by experts like Doug Smith (the head of the wolf recovery in Yellowstone) and Ray Coppinger (biologist) at Wolf Park.  It is a beautiful and wonderful thing to be standing in the park when the wolves begin to howl. It's a wonderful place to learn not only the science of wolves, but to see them for what they are beyond the myths and the legends. All that I learned at Wolf Park helped me reach my goal of a career in captive wildlife care. 
Wolf Park Inc	196692	3	/users/profile/257093	anna_l_richter	Volunteer	5	03/29/2014	I completed a three month Summer internship in 2013 and had an absolutely amazing time! There are wolves, bison, coyotes and red and grey foxes. The grey foxes were still kits when I went, so I was able to help socialise them. All the animals at Wolf Park are socialised. This creates a better experience for the public, since the animals are not afraid to come up to the fence! All the staff and other volunteers are so welcoming and I felt very comfortable very quickly. The amount of things I learnt about wolves was incredible. Educating and interacting with the public was great fun, although i must admit I was quite scared about giving my first tour. Though it was hard work, it was very rewarding and I would truly recommend it.I will treasure these memories forever.Thanks Wolf Park!
Wolf Park Inc	177010		/users/profile/233470	breenew29	General Member of the Public	1	10/11/2013	My first clue that Wolf Park wasn't the experience I thought it would be was when we were waiting for the tour and our guide was speaking to the couple in front of us about the bison they have on site there.  She said that they used to have times where they would allow the bison and wolves to interact... they would let the wolves hunt the bison and then the bison would attack the wolves.  Our guide explained that 'unfortunately' they had to stop this because someone uploaded a video to the internet and the government told them they couldn't allow incompatible species to interact.  I was horrified, and the guide commiserated with the couple about how the government sticks its nose into things it shouldn't.   My next big clue, and probably more important than they way they treat the wolves like pet dogs, was that when asked where they got all the wolves, our guide responded that they all came from one original pair.  THEY BREED SIBLINGS and now the latest pups were born with cataracts and a couple of them had to have surgery.  I don't care if this is how wolves act in the wild, I think this is a horrible practice in a facility that is emphasizing research and education.  Go rescue some wolves.  While the facility as a whole is very large, the wolves were divided up into small groups, or singly, and in relatively small enclosures. Their idea of research is putting ground dwelling and tree dwelling fox together so 'we can see what happens.' We were told they don't encourage the wolves to howl because they felt it 'strained their vocal cords.' I could go on and on, but if you feel you must go there, please view this place with open eyes and I'm sure you will feel as heartsick as I still do, weeks later.
Wolf Park Inc	148204	3	/users/profile/196243	Sophie A.	Volunteer	5	01/17/2013	I did a 3 month intership back in 2003 at the park. It was an amazing experience that I will always remember - the interaction with the animals along with educating others through tours. It was hard work but so rewarding, I would highly recommend to anyone who is passionate about American canids to either visit, sponsor or undertake one of their volunteer programs. I return to the park when I can - an unbelieveable experience. Also a great opppertunity for photo ops as the animals are hand reared so are happy to watch their 'human TV' and come close to the enclosure fences for a better view. Aling with wolves you can see coyotes, foxes and a herd of bison. During the main open season they even do a wolf-bison demonstration where it is explained that the predator-prey ratio ensures that the wolves are unable to bring down a healthy adult bison. instead you get to see the testing behaviour of the wolf, looking for weakness and the herd in return chase off any wolf whom may come too close. This park captures the imagination of the young who may not otherwise get to see one of their countries natural predators up close - you can even ask them to howl!
Wolf Park Inc	145672	2	/users/profile/192212	Jayne3	General Member of the Public	5	12/03/2012	I've taken my Girl Scouts to Wolf Park twice. They love Wolf Park and I love Wolf Park. There's no place better to learn about predators and prey, and the staff and grounds are impressive. I would absolutely recommend this place to any animal lover, and anyone who wants to really understand wolves and their behavior. Everyone there is incredibly helpful, and of course the girls loved their stellar gift shop. Educational and entertaining! I would definitely recommend the combo ticket so you can take the tour and then come back to howl with the wolves.

International Disaster Emergency Service Inc	313432		/users/profile/404803	Doug47	Donor	5	10/22/2016	Im a shy person who doesnt enjoy being the center of attention. As such, I have always dreaded events like fathers day and my birthday - until this year.	A couple of months before those special days, the Missions Coordinator at our church showed me a brochure from the International Disaster Emergency Service (I.D.E.S.) It was titled Choose Gifts That Change Lives!. The catalogue addressed vividly, with words and pictures, the desperate needs of struggling people through out the world and, most importantly, offered opportunities to help them in the name of Christ. For example: 	For as little as one dollar, one could provide a fish that a poor family could raise and 	ultimately use to provide a meal for their family.	For the cost of a cup of barista coffee one could purchase a coffee plant that would 	grow and provide income for an entire family in need.	$50.00 would help a missionary assist someone in starting a pig farm.	And then I found the solution for my special days dilemma - A water buffalo. I told family and friends that instead of parties and gifts, I wanted all gift money to be collected and sent to I.D.E.S. for the purchase of a water buffalo for needy folks in Myanmar. The buffalo would be used on farms, in place of a John Deere, to clear fields and till the ground.	My wife collected the gift money and I.D.E.S. did the rest. Money was sent to a local missionary who purchased the water buffalo and delivered it to a struggling village where he is used to help others and as a very effective conversation starter about the love of Jesus Christ.	Thank you I.D.E.S. for making my last birthday the best I have ever had. I cant wait till Christmas.

International Disaster Emergency Service Inc	308661		/users/profile/400035	dgr11801	Client Served	5	10/07/2016	IDES has been our great, compassionate and dependable partner in the Lord's harvest work in the Philippines for the last eleven years now.From medical/dental missions (free clinics) in needy and unserved communities, to disaster/emergency and relief missions to Livelihood programs ( donation of sewing machines), IDES provided the much-needed financial resources and encouragement so the affected people, churches and communities can recover, recoup and move forward with their lives.When super-typhoon "Koppu" (local name 'Lando") hit the Philippines last November 2016 and destroyed thousands upon thousands of hectares of rice fields in the Central Plains of Luzon, and with it the livelihood of tens of thousands of farmers, IDES provided the funds so farmers can have the rice/palay seeds to replant their fields, along with the fertilizers and pesticides to protect the rice plants. One of the farmers who had almost given up hopein recovering and feeding his family tearfully told our mission workers, " I did not know that there were still people in the United States who are doing this...helping complete strangers." We know he was speaking from the heart, and for all those farmers (and families) who received the valuable seeds/pesticides, and their lives back.Literally thousands of children/adults who have received free medicines, medical check-ups, dental services, and visual/eye check-ups ( health insurance is virtually non-existent for the poor majority of the population), and free food/lunch with it, come away so encouraged and happy that they have received these blessings.We/the Harvest for Christ Foundation are so thankful and blessed to have a loving and caring partner in the International Disaster and Emergency Services (IDES).

I was able to go with our local church to assist in the building of storage sheds in Henryville, IN a few years ago after a tornado ripped through the area.  It was amazing to see how organized things were which allowed me as a non-carpenter the ability to assist with the building of the shed.Since then I have had the pleasure of working in IDES's workshop where the sheds begin.  I worked building the walls of the sheds in order to make a shed kit that is delivered to areas where disasters have occurred for assembly by volunteers in the field.

Since becoming a supporter I have seen the numerous ways that IDES responds to disasters both here in the US and abroad.  Always, the love of Christ is central to their mission .  Recent improvements to their website and social media presence are allowing the stories to be told in a compelling fashion and to a wider audience.

They meet immediate needs and help establish sustainable avenues to meet needs long term as well.  They come alongside, feed, build, grow and, most importantly, share Christ with people all over the world and in our own neighborhoods. It is humbling to read about the work they are doing and the people groups they are reaching.  Keep up the great work,  IDES!
International Disaster Emergency Service Inc	308033		/users/profile/399415	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/05/2016	IDES was on the ground immediately after the tornadoes hit Joplin MO and Moore OK twice. The service they provide to residents who have lost everything is vital in their recovery and rebuilding efforts. Our church has worked alongside IDES to help provide relief on several occasions. In addition to that our church supports them financially on a regular basis. It is a blessing to partner with a relief organization that is a faithful steward of their resources. The bottom line is that hurting people are helped in the name of Christ.
International Disaster Emergency Service Inc	308032		/users/profile/399413	cohoonms	Client Served	5	10/05/2016	IDES has partnered with Landmark Christian Church in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin in a number of ways over the last dozen years. IDES has provided funding to help us; distribute Hmong Language Bibles in Thailand, repair numerous buildings that were devastated by natural disasters, shipping of food to Haiti after the 2010 earthquake and numerous times since. IDES has taken the lead at the Student International Conference on Missions each year with learning activities for our teen age members, they have provided opportunities for the teens to package food to be sent to to those in need and a building experience where the teens build sheds that can be shipped to areas in the USA where disasters have occurred. These sheds can be used so that families can store their most needed items.  We are currently working with IDES to repair a family home in the Chiang Rai area of Thailand. IDES is involved in some of the largest disaster relief services in the world and they still care about helping individual families that are in need.
International Disaster Emergency Service Inc	308031		/users/profile/399412	Writer	Donor	5	10/05/2016	IDES provides a vital role in both helping meet needs in the midst of adversity, but also in promoting the Gospel message. Their unique approach to linking up local churches and missionaries to the people needing aid provides a great opportunity for a relationship to be established, which can then provide an open door for faith conversations to happen. I've supported them for many years. And plan to continue!

International Disaster Emergency Service Inc	307854		/users/profile/399222	CDForeman	Donor	5	10/04/2016	International Disaster Emergency Service is our "go to" organization when disaster hits around the world. They channel funds thru local Christians with boots on the ground directly to those impacted by the natural disaster. We know when we give, our money goes to those most hurting. IDES gives us play by play reports on how the disaster relief work is going in an area. IDES is truly a first responder and helps us as a church play a significant role in helping people who need immediate relief and rescue. Thank you IDES! 
International Disaster Emergency Service Inc	304472		/users/profile/395641	Minnesotans	Donor	5	09/14/2016	In a day when so many other charitable organizations end up using so little of all donations given for the purpose the donor intended, we find IDES to be the exact opposite:  whatever we donate will go completely to the cause they are responding to.  And what we find to be equally important in our giving is the fact that all of the wonderful emergency services are done in the name of Christ.  IDES is truly a marvelous Christian outreach, meeting the needs of so many people.  We continue to give, knowing we can have complete confidence in the stewardship of every dollar they receive.

The volunteer coordinator, Misty Bodkins, is awesome. She is so attentive and appreciative of the volunteers. She really makes you feel like you are an important part of IDES. I look forward to going on Tuesdays and doing what I can to help this great ministry. What IDES does is so important especially in the world today when so many tragedies are happening all over the world. As a volunteer, I feel that I can offer support with organizational or administrative tasks so that the staff can focus on the very important mission of this ministry.

In our relationship with IDES we have received reports from mission groups in the field or persons in need who received physical and spiritual support from IDES. We can see our investment reaching many to do God's work.

Our perspective changed in November 2013 when our home and large proton of our little town was destroyed by an EF4 tornado.  So thankful for the support IDES gave our community. We personally were given a shed for our property. It was a huge blessing to have a place to put a few things durning the extremely long process of rebuilding. IDES is so well organized and their efforts and volunteers coordinated very efficiently. That is a big strength when stepping into a disaster where nothing is organized or efficient.  Nearly everyday now I look out my window and see the shed and am reminded of kindness, generosity and God's faithfulness shown  through this great organization and the good people who serve there.

A fun-filled day that provides donations for IDES to use for world hunger.  After a number of years we have become a part of the Harvest of Talents committee,  and we look forward each year to the ways that our small church and community can have a huge impact on the world through IDES.   We have also had some experience with IDES as volunteers in Joplin, MO about a year after the tornado devastated that area.There aren't too many organizations that I donate to that I can say I personally know the  Executive Director, but I can with IDES.  We have met  and gotten to know Rick Jett and his wife Nancy, as they always try to attend our annual Harvest of Talents celebration.  They are truly caring and compassionate  people with a vision to carry out God's will in their lives.  Rick & Nancy and their dedicated staff have my confidence when sending donations.  I don't worry about where my money is going or how it will be used.  I know it is being used efficiently and effectively to carry God's love out in to the world.

IDES uses our donations to help others in a very efficient manner,  with 87% of expenses spent on programs & services it delivers to people in need. They meet physical and spiritual needs by partnering with church missionaries who are already on the ground in the affected area.
International Disaster Emergency Service Inc	245063		/users/profile/332163	Lopestoper	Donor	5	06/11/2015	We have supported IDES for many years  because they are quick to respond to any emergency and do their help through people already on the field wherever possible. This prevents fraud and gets the help to people who need it most.  We even have the FISH bank they offered years ago for our spare change. We love turning what money we don't miss to something vital for someone else.

I have always been impressed with the stewardship of IDES in the administration and compassion of distributing funds through our churches and missionaries around the world.

International Disaster Emergency Service Inc	215178		/users/profile/278551	norms	Donor	5	09/16/2014	IDES is a very effective international relief agency.  They have very small staff and overhead, but effectively work with churches and missionaries in disaster areas to provide relief.  I first became personally acquainted with IDES personnel after Hurricane Katrina and was very blessed that our little churches in Mandeville and Slidell were able to host many volunteers who came to assist in the recovery.  IDES provided early and sustained assistance and their representatives were very efficient in analyzing what needed to be done and recruiting volunteers to assist.  I have the highest regard for IDES personnel for their personal integrity and compassion and for the agency's prompt action to provide needed relief.  I give them my highest recommendation and am fully confident that my donations are wisely used.

They don't only focus on one area of need but  strive for a more wholistic remedy. I have helped with tornado rebuilding in southern Indiana and it was very well managed. Our church has also hosted the rice packing event for Haiti which is an awesome hands on way to get many who may not ever travel to a far away place to help someone in need.

International Disaster Emergency Service Inc	214297		/users/profile/94145	kamsgma	Volunteer	5	09/09/2014	One of the most gratifying experiences is the privilege of working with the original Harvest of Talents for World Hunger, Lincoln IL, on the Harvest Ministry Team, now in its 31st year after having raised nearly two million dollars for hunger relief in Jesus' name in 26 countries, including the USA, and inspiring several other Harvests to begin across the country. Key scriptures for the Harvest ministry are: I Peter 4:10, Matthew 25:35, and Galatians 6:9. It is very humbling, precious, and magnificently worthwhile. Since its inception, the Harvest has given 100% of funds raised to I.D.E.S. for distribution to accountable Christian missionaries who give full measure for food where it is needed most for hunger relief, and it has always been given in Jesus' name. While working together to share our prayers, talents, time, and resources is wonderful, the fact that we can count on every penny we raise going where it is desperately needed and turned into nourishing food while giving God the glory is all thanks to I.D.E.S. They make the tough decisions, and they make them prayerfully. We treasure our relationship with I.D.E.S. as trusted partners in this ministry. I have only the highest respect for the executive director, board, staff, and the history on which they stand. Prayer, faith, dedication, and compassion are at the heart of everyone at I.D.E.S., and we could not be more secure in our partnership with I.D.E.S.
International Disaster Emergency Service Inc	84771		/users/profile/94145	kamsgma	Donor	5	04/04/2011	As Chairperson of Harvest of Talents for World Hunger, now in its 28th year, I can attest to the integrity of I.D.E.S. because of personally knowing the staff and a board member (both past and present). The dedication of the staff and board to the I.D.E.S. mission is without question. The Harvest ministry entrusts every penny raised to I.D.E.S. for their discretion in distributing the funds around the world for hunger relief in Jesus' name; last year the Harvest raised over $93K in Lincoln, IL alone, in addition to sister Harvests elsewhere. I.D.E.S. staff is excellent with communication, outreach, support, and stewardship. It is a prayerfully managed charitable organization with leadership integrity from the top down. The Harvest is proud to partner with I.D.E.S. in hunger relief; the missionaries are accountable for funds and reporting. We appreciate the various ways (in addition to hunger relief) that the Christian community can help people in need around the world through I.D.E.S.

International Disaster Emergency Service Inc	213612		/users/profile/276810	DebraMoberly	Donor	5	09/05/2014	IDES (International Disaster Emergency Service) Is my favorite non-profit organization. This group helps people all over the world who are suffering through natural disasters. One of the main reasons that I support them, is that I know that all the money that I donate to them will go straight to the people who need it most.  They do more than help people in major disasters. They also care about people who have suffered smaller things, such as when my home church was burned by arsonists.  Even the children in my Sunday School class are able to understand what IDES does and enthusiastically support this group. They are truly God's servants.Debra Moberly

International Disaster Emergency Service Inc	213280		/users/profile/276450	abide	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/04/2014	I have been in the ministry for over sixty two years and there is nothing on the face of this earth that is equal to the type of non profit, sacrificial, benevolent  ,kindness, and humanitarian service that IDES does world wide. If there was a one to ten star rating for such benefits that IDES contributes to  mankind, a multitude of responsible  leaders  would rate it 10 ,as well as those who work with the despairing, poor,scattered lives, orphans helpless elderly ,broken hearted and hopeless. In places where there are  tears,hunger , despair,loss of homes, injury, in all types of international crisis IDES steps in  and makes thing happen for good and for God. Through their spiritual insight they can return  a community or situation into encouragement, hope,  optimism, even smiles and restore purpose and give "light at the end of the tunnel". I have seen IDES rise to meet ugly tragic situations -with help from doners-and feed over 4,300 families where there was hunger, restore polluter water to healthy use, send equipment for responsible leaders to use to build, feed the orphaned and neglected children, rebuild tornado stricken  towns, rebuild earthquake areas and restore hurricane cities and homes  to liveable communities. I have seen their contributions make  possibles teaching situation  where high ethic,morality, honesty, godliness and virtue is restored. Much of this is due to their founder's purpose and mission .as well  to it board responsibility to good stewardship and accounting.  iDES continues to grow and expand and is most worthy of a donors support. James LandrumPresident Christian Food and Medical MinistryBloomington,IndianaJasland@msn.com   Sent from Indiana James"For the Lord taketh pleasure in his people: he will beautify the meek with salvation.Psalms 149:4 
International Disaster Emergency Service Inc	213260		/users/profile/276432	Jon_Weatherly	Board Member	5	09/04/2014	Christians with a burden to share with people who have experienced hardships and disasters face a dilemma: how to get help to them quickly, efficiently and effectively. Of the many organizations that do this, IDES stands out because of its distinctive method. IDES typically addresses disasters and emergencies globally by working directly with churches and church leaders to fund the responses that those people "on the ground" design and implement. This method leverages the expertise of people who know the situation firsthand. It also eliminates layers of bureaucracy that can add expense and limit response time and effectiveness. With all this, there's strong accountability. Those on the field who receive funding are responsible to account for their expenditures and provide evidence of the work they've done and its impact. Those who deliver faithfully can receive funds in the future as new needs and opportunities arise. Those who don't follow through on their plans lose the opportunity for future funding. Whenever the news comes of a disaster in the world that causes human suffering, my first recommendation is that concerned Christians send their gifts to IDES. They can do so with the assurance that their gifts will be used well and that people will be cared for in the name of Jesus Christ.
International Disaster Emergency Service Inc	213221		/users/profile/276378	dadlh101	Donor	5	09/03/2014	International Disaster Emergency Service Inc is a truly well organized disaster response organization as well as dedicated to World Hunger Relief. With the addition of their new Offices and Warehouse in Noblesville they are uniquely qualified to respond with amazing speed compared to bureaucratically controlled organizations. A review of their financial aspirations places them, in my judgment, into a category of one of the leanest Administration to Function spending ratios among numerous Non-Profits which I've supported over the years.   
International Disaster Emergency Service Inc	213216		/users/profile/95300	lmillert	Donor	5	09/03/2014	I am the Missions Chair for my church. We set aside 25% of our general fund for mission support currently sending monthly checks to 22 different entities. We vet each mission and only support those with excellent stewardship of the funds they receive and have low administrative expense. IDES is an organization that provides services that any denomination or individual could back regardless of faith or belief. Although they are basically an independant Christian mission they do not discriminate against anyone regardless of their station in life. When disasters strike whether it be earthquake, hurricane, tsunami, tornado etc IDES is there many times before the bureaucratic organizations. If I had to pick just one disaster response team to support it would definitely be IDES. 
International Disaster Emergency Service Inc	169473		/users/profile/95300	lmillert	Donor	5	09/12/2013	As an elder and missionary chair we look to worthy missions. I.D.E.S. is by far one of the most efficient organizations I have known. We have sent support on a need basis from time to time. This year 2013 we pick I.D.E.S. for monthly support. Along with this we encourage members to take the fish banks and fill them. This has been well received. Our VBS  project this year was I.D.E.S. with a good offering for 30 kids. The thing is this is an organization that has and can do great things. We are a small congregation but have been mission minded ever since we started. We tithe 25% of our general income to missions. Currently we have 25 missions we send support to. We look to what a mission is doing to earn our support. The fact that I.D.E.S. put the resources where they are needed and are quick to respond to disasters working through the local churches or missions in foreign countries. They are prepared and in many cases are on the way before the storm is over. The small amounts all add up. Many hands make for light work.

I have collected Sonfish banks for our church for over 15 years. Every penny goes for famine relief.  Any one can fill a Sonfish bank from children to the elderly on fixed incomes. What many consider pocket change can keep a person alive for a month. We have sent gifts for US tornadoes, the tsunami in Japan, earthquakes in Chili and monsoon flooding in the Philippines. I appreciate how much of our gift goes to the designated need.

Impressive is  the fact that 100% of donations go directly to the  victims of disaster, whether it be domestic or foreign. I have friends in Charlestown, Indiana who were assisted by IDES when a tornado destroyed much  of their  community.  A Filipino co-worker was touched when she saw and heard of the assistance the Philippines was receiving from IDES about a year ago after disaster struck their nation.

They provided finances for disaster relief numerous times - for floods, typhoons, fire, and drought. They were great to work with. The local people were always very appreciative. IDES had a good reputation. The people said that they were not corrupt like others because they always gave out at least 5kg of rice - rather than the usual 1kg. None of their finances were skimmed off the top with the likes of "consultancy fees." IDES were able to provide assistance in smaller pockets where help was really needed but overlooked by the biggest relief organizations.

International Disaster Emergency Service Inc	177760		/users/profile/234341	ccabell927	Donor	5	10/15/2013	I have supported this wonderful organization since their inception.  I have been on the Missions Committee at our church, and IDES is one of the regular missions that we support.  I like the fact that funds go directly to the nearest Restoration Movement church or missionary in the area needing help, because they would know exactly where the help is needed the most.  I always recommend IDES to anyone wishing to help in the event of disasters because I trust them implicitly!  In addition to funding, they also send and support teams of volunteers to the disaster areas (such as New Orleans and Joplin, MO) to assist in rebuilding, distributing supplies, etc.  They are prompt with receipts, and I also like the calendar they provide on the back of their receipts listing some of the many areas that have received funding all over the world.

International Disaster Emergency Service Inc	169877		/users/profile/225150	DOWN	Donor	5	09/16/2013	We really appreciate IDES.   Our minister was a missionary before coming back to the pulpit and he said that IDES gives almost all of their donations to help the people in need.  He thinks it is one of the best in  using money wisely.   So many so called "relief agents" use a very small fraction of their donations for helping others.  This is why we give to IDES.   We know where our money is going.   They were in Oklahoma City helping the people of Moore and as far as the TV coverage went, they received very little credit because they were not BIG NAME but believe me----they are a wonderful group.    Linda DowningBeaver, OK

International Disaster Emergency Service Inc	169539		/users/profile/224706	Eulitta	Donor	5	09/13/2013	We have been Prayer Warriors for IDES for many years so we are aware of the thousands of dollars given each month to various missions, cities, and countries for flood relief, feeding programs, clean water and, of course, disaster relief. One of our favorite ways to donate is to "purchase" via a catalog a goat or some chicks which will be given to someone in a third world country for a micro business. We exclaim our CONGRATULATIONS to IDES for receiving the highest rating-4 stars- from Charity Navigator for "sound fiscal management and commitment to accountability and transparency".

I appreciate their timely response to my donations and the inclusion of the monthly prayer calendar on the back of my receipt. It shows me they are wise stewards of the money I entrust to the work of IDES.  I can always count on IDES to be at the sight of a need quickly.

They are also one of the last organizations to leave. Our experience has always been that 100% of our funds are distributed within the impacted communities much faster than any other relief organization. IDES is an organization led by men and women of high integrity, who are dedicated to helping people worldwide and serving Christ.

International Disaster Emergency Service Inc	85666		/users/profile/95648	Linda L.	Donor	5	04/14/2011	100% efficiant and effective, wise stewards of the funds entrusted to them - IDES is one of the best in aiding our missionaries to minister and evangelize to victims in times of great tragedy and difficulties around the world.   Many of the independant missionaries and ministries that we support regularly have had need of IDES help and have received it promptly.   IDES is reliable and scripturally on target.   Our church has supported IDES for many years and Lord willing many more.
International Disaster Emergency Service Inc	169311		/users/profile/224389	Debbie94	Volunteer	5	09/12/2013	We have participated in Harvest of Talents that supports IDES for many years now, and have seen the ways that they have been around the world for many victims of disaster.  We have also known people on the Board who have had to struggle with how to allocate the money to different needs, as the needs are so many.  I am excited at how they use local churches, that are already grounded in the areas where the disasters are, instead of needing to set up new systems to get the help where it is needed.  From observing how the money is used, I see that little is used for administration, and they are very careful to be sure that as much as possible goes to where it is needed.

One reviewer, Mitzi S uses the word "trusworthy" and she is absolutely correct. If you give your money and time and talent to I.D.E.S. you can know without a doubt that the dollars will go to the most needy and in the name of Jesus.

This wonderful organization has come to the aid of Thousands of cyclone and flood ravaged Christians in India over the past few years.  IDES has sent over $65,000 to Christian ministers who have been able to reach many Hindu people with the Gospel because of the relief they have been able to provide.  The last disastrous flood wiped out many Temples, homes and buildings in a very sacred area of Hinduism, where preaching the Gospel has been almost impossible.  But the funds received from IDES has enabled Christian ministers to reach into this area with the Gospel in a powerful way.  India is a vast land with great numbers of souls that have never been taught the truth about Jesus Christ.  Thanks to the contributions of IDES, hundreds of thousands will come in contact with the Gospel for the first time, and many will obey the word and be added to God's church.  Thank God for IDES!!
International Disaster Emergency Service Inc	167684		/users/profile/222550	Mitzi S.	Donor	5	09/05/2013	IDES is the most trustworthy agency I know for handling money. Anytime a national emergency strikes and our church or individual church members want to help out, we do it through IDES. We know the  money that is given to them is being used for the purpose it was sent. We've met recipients as well as givers and IDES' integrity is never in question. Often, if another agency calls for solicitation, I will ask what percentage of the giving goes towards the actual project. It usually stops them since a large percent goes towards the fundraisers and not the fund. I simply tell them we do ALL our giving through IDES. It's also very convenient to do all this type of giving in one place and to have an honest answer for any other fundraisers who often call during emergencies. My husband has done volunteer work for them twice and both ventures were organized and successful.   God has truly blessed our churches with the work IDES does around the world.

They helped members of the South Louisville Christian Church, where I served for 17 years, as well as they church. They helped the White Mills Christian Camp, in Kentucky when the camp was devastated by a flood. They have responded to the victims of tornadoes in Birmingham, Alabama and in Joplin, Missouri.

I have worked with IDES in the area where Hurricane Katrina left devistation as well as in tornado relief around this country.  IDES is TOP NOTCH!  I have been impressed with the organization from the leaders in the office to the individuals out in the field.  I have watched as IDES touched lives of people who were left homeless or devistated through natural disasters.  I have seen them not only re-build homes, but restore lives.  I am honored to be able to serve with IDES and look forward to our next adventure in Oklahoma City this October.

It has been a great honor to learn about their humble beginnings and their enormous impact around the world.Christians around the world donate and benefit from their outreach made possible though IDES.They serve all peoples through missionaries and representatives by suporting their work including housing, medical, nutritional, clean water and evangelism during disasters international and domestic, They are loyal to their mission. They are currently stretching and growing both physically and in their desire to reach more people and do more work for the Kingdom. I would consider any donation made to this group to be money well spent as it will be compounded by their honest and open approach to distribution as well as grown through the love of those on the receiving end.

International Disaster Emergency Service Inc	160930		/users/profile/213349	fritchskid	Donor	5	06/18/2013	I participate in a missions ministry team at a local church.  In the 30 plus years that I have been reading about, working with and supporting various organizations, I have found none that use their resources so well and so wisely.  IDES works with local entities to determine the real needs of people in emergency or critical situations.  In that way they can assure that funds do not go to waste, but directly to the ones who are most in need.  If you designate your donation to a specific need, that is where it is used.  They keep their overhead low so donations go to the on-the-ground need.

My family loves that our donations go directly to help those hurting--here and abroad.  One can even donate specifically for any particular need or situation in the world, and IDES will make sure that donation goes to that need. IDES has helped so many people in the name of Christ and that is a blessing to us as Christians.

The fact that IDES works through known ministers and missionaries provides assurance that funds donated are used carefully and in a worthwhile manner. We have designated funds to procure goats and chickens so that impoverished people can become more self sufficient. We have also heard from folks we know who have seen, first hand, disaster relief provided by IDES' co-workers.   WE enthusiastically support and recommend this mission !

International Disaster Emergency Service Inc	84963		/users/profile/94475	rrowan	Donor	5	04/07/2011	As a donor, I have personally visited the offices and met most of the staff.  I also have met many of the founder's family, some of whom continue in the operations.  I have had contact with those who have used I.D.E.S. funds in various disaster situations since at least 1998's Hurricane Mitch relief, probably before that as well. International Disaster Emergency Services (I.D.E.S.) is a lean and efficient organization.  There offices are spartan and the staff serves far more because of the compassion in their hearts than any monetary compensation.  All overhead is paid from donations not designated for a particular need.  If you donat funds for a specific disaster or emergency, 100% of the funds to toward that need. I.D.E.S. tries to work through organizations and people already in the area of the need.  This process means that problems with language, culture and governments are minimized and that utilization of local resources is maximized..  It also means that those on the scene already have their overhead expenses covered. Those on the scene plan to continue to be in the region after the disaster so they have reason to do the best job.  When housing is a big need, I.D.E.S. homes are often the best ones built.  When rebuilding lost food production or economic activity, I.D.E.S. often has the most successful programs. I.D.E.S. methods are so successful that when other agencies leave the area (sometimes asked to leave), I.D.E.S. is often asked to stay longer. I.D.E.S. demands accountability of these local partners.  If a partner does not do a thorough accounting fo the funds and resources provided by I.D.E.S., they are unlikely to get I.D.E.S. help in the future. Not every need is a major disaster.  At times, an organization requests help in dealing with its own disaster or emergency.  I.D.E.S. has the necessary protocols to ensure that the project is worthy as is the requesting organization.  Again, accountability is part of the process. Board approval is necessary for any funds to be disbursed, regardless of the level of disaster.  Decisions are made at the highest level by an informed board.

Their prices are much more affordable as well.  My only issue is that although they provided all the needed info for pre-surgery, I received not one word of post-surgery info ahead of time.  I used their services years ago for cats... but never for a dog.  I had no idea neutering a male DOG requires a lot more aftercare and restrictions than a male CAT and it's a lot harder on a dog.  Believe me, I have no problem with providing all necessary love and care for our pup for whatever amount of time it takes, BUT had I known post-surgical restrictions lasted 14 days I would never have scheduled neutering for our male dog when I did.  It completely ruined our plans for the following weekend (9 days later) for our dog and for ourselves.  Just one statement from them (during scheduling) to make me aware that restrictions last 14 days would have made all the difference.  Then I could have asked any specific questions in regard to our plans and known BEFOREHAND that it was not good timing.  There would have been no problem on our part waiting until another time to take him in.  Their care and caring are excellent but more information BEFORE scheduling, specifically about restrictions  AFTER, would be so beneficial.

They NEVER told me a pickup time then said they would CALL ME when my dogs were ready to be picked up. Apparently the latest pickup time was at 4:15 and they did not call me until 4:53!! 7 minutes before they closed!! When we got there, they said there was a late fee!! But the rude manager came out and talked to me. She was disgruntled and rude but stated that she would waive the late fee. But after initially paying $170 at drop off, I had to pay $47 to pick them up, even though the fee was supposedly dropped!!! I am more peeved at the fact my dogs had been done for hours, waiting in cages, stress levels going crazy, when they could have came home with me when they were finished!! I will never come back again and I will make sure everyone knows NOT to take their pets here!! If you genuinely care about your animals, please do yourself and them a favor and go somewhere else!!

Hope for Animals	221065	1	/users/profile/284765	Tee98	Donor	5	10/08/2014	H.O.P.E. for Animals provides wonderful services for the community to help people who can't afford the cost of typical vet care. Their new wellness clinic is a godsend for low income people, as well. Now, because of their efforts, they are helping to cut down on the over population of animals, including feral cats with their spay and neuter services. They are very good stewards of their funds. I am a donor and have been since 2012. I will continue to support them as much as I can. Without them, many more unwanted animals would come in to this world and face starvation, disease, neglect, abuse and death. Because of them, many pet owners can afford to get medical treatment for their pets they could not otherwise afford. HIGH FIVE TO ALL H.O.P.E. STAFF!!!

They are a wonderful organization that this community direly needs.  My first experience with them was when my husband told me that if I wanted a puppy, that I had to get my older dog and the puppy fixed. In order to afford that I went in search of a place to have it done. Enter HOPE! Everyone that I encountered there were very friendly, professional and showed a lot of love and care and compassion for the humans and the animals. Because of this, I now try to donate to them every chance I get. I have also sat in on a meeting about SNR and TNR. I have to say that the passion that Madeleine Laird and the others that work there moves me to want to do everything I can to help their cause.  I also have a sticker on my minivan that says I support HOPE for Animals and while at Walmart, I came out to a hand written note from Madeleine Laird thanking me for the support.

Hope for Animals	189871	2	/users/profile/247909	Andrea84	Client Served	5	12/04/2013	H.O.P.E. for animals in Fort Wayne is amazing! My cat was experiencing discomfort from a rash on his back. They squeezed us in to their already busy schedule. Every person we saw there was beyond kind, helpful, and attentive. The check in staff, the vet assistants, and the veterinarian were awesome! There was an issue with another animal there and the assistant kept coming in and checking on us in the exam room keeping us informed why it was taking so long. The veterinarian suggested right away that my cat had an allergy and a steroid shot would help his skin. Just like she said, within two weeks all of his skin scabs have been healed and he is not scratching all over. Aside from how accurate and sweet everyone was, the cost was a lifesaver! At the time we could not afford a traditional vet office visit or any additional services they suggested. The visit was only $10 and the steroid shot was only $7.50. I can't wait until I have some spare money to donate to this wonderful organization. This is the only place I will consider taking my pet from now on! Thanks H.O.P.E.!!!!

My most recent Cat addition (Daisy) came from a rescue affiliated with H.O.P.E. which resulted in my having her spayed there.  They were so easy and nice to work with.  They were organized and efficient and Daisy received top-notch care.  I'm a social worker in town and one of my client's was able to take her dog to them for care she could not otherwise have afforded.  She was happy with the services received and the dog benefitted from treatment for an allergic reaction.  It's wonderful that this service exists as there are a lot of people who could provide a good home to an animal but could never afford the medical care they need.  I was so inspired by them that I volunteered in their booth at a local event and have made a couple small donations.   They do a great service.  I can't say enough nice things about them!

I called H.O.P.E. at a loss, not wanting to lose my cat of 8 years.  It seemed hopeless, I was at my end, I could not afford the $700 more my old vet wanted for more tests.  H.O.P.E. said they didnt normally do something like that.  I thought my cat would have to be put down.  It wasnt 10 minutes later H.O.P.E.  called me back, said a vet there could help me, to bring Crybaby in for them to look at her first.  I took her in on a Friday, they examined her and immediatly could tell me what was wrong after over a year of what Crybaby had to go through.  They sent me home that Friday with antibiotics and the following Monday did surgery to remove a bladder stone the size of a golf ball.  No matter what I can do now, it will never be enough to thank them for saving my Crybaby.  I can never thank H.O.P.E. enough for all they have done for us!

The veterinarian (Dr. Margaret Thornburg) and vet tech (Nicole) were marvelous. They treated Emma (my cat) with great kindness, making it less traumatic than it could have been. Thanks again to HOPE for Animals! It's a great place to take your pets for spay/neutering and wellness services. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a low cost alternative to regular vets (for regular wellness issues).

Hope for Animals	85872	1	/users/profile/95942	tyson	Volunteer	5	04/15/2011	As a low-cost spay/neuter/vaccination clinic HOPE has operated for less than a year. They have accomplished a great deal in this short time. I volunteer in the office, and I am impressed with the dedication and resilience of the staff. These professionals must deal with some very demanding situations, especially with feral,  unsocialized, or frightened animals. Yet they maintain their sense of humor and compassion. And the clinic  prices are beyond reasonable. As a cat rescue group, HOPE has been around for several years. I've volunteered with other rescue groups, but Emilie Beard, who manages the rescue aspect, is several notches above any other I've seen. Based on what I see as a foster for some of her cats, she carefully  tends to the medical and social needs of every cat. She knows their history, their personal quirks, their habits . . . . She can make a well informed recommendation as to the type of home in which the cat/kitten will thrive. I call Emilie "The Cat Whisperer" due to her extensive knowledge and experience in caring for cats.

Client Served	5	11/09/2010	Upon having to put our beloved cat Scarlet down due to cancer, we happened upon H.O.P.E. for Animals website showing animals for adoption.  Two 2 week old kittens from Mrs. Tuxedo's litter "called" to us.  We called, explained our loss and how devastated our boys were, especially our 9 year old.  Mrs. Beard, Director, did everything in her power to give us "HOPE".  She sent us photo's, permitted us to meet the kittens and sent us a few updates until the kittens (and us) were ready for the adoption.  The kittens were so well socialized, very friendly, healthy and loving.  Mrs. Beard has earned her "wings" many times over--not just for caring for animals, but for the humans who adopt them.

They even trimmed off the hairmats that were all over the long haired boy which made him much more comfortable & calm.I will definitely keep them in mind for anyone who asks about low cost/effective services in the future.I also greatly appreciate the fact that they fit me in to the schedule because of the semi-feral boy in a humane trap.

Hope for Animals	50606	6	/users/profile/51125	karaf78	Client Served	5	08/18/2010	Almost a year ago, I was looking to adopt a kitten.  I found H.O.P.E. for Animals online and saw pictures of some of the kittens they had up for adoption and emailed them to ask about a kitten I was interested in.  I had to fill out some basic information before I was allowed into the house where the cats and kittens were kept.  Once I was there, I was so impressed with the care all the cats and kittens were getting and their living conditions.  They were not caged up like other shelters, and the lady in charge knew the story and personality of every single cat there!!  You could tell everyone involved cared so much for each animal and wanted to find the best home possible for all of them.  They asked about other pets I had at home and how the new kitten would fit in.  They also gave me tips and information on introducing a new kitten to the cat I already had.  The cats and kittens were not being given to just anybody; there was a process to make sure each animal went to a caring home and that they would be spayed or neutered.  This also impressed me as I hate to hear stories of animals being mistreated.  H.O.P.E. rescues these animals and makes sure they are healthy and makes sure they find great homes.  I was so impressed with them that I ended up adopting two kittens instead of just one, as I was planning on.  Everyone there is so invested in these animals and dedicated to their cause, and it truly is an organization that works to improve the lives of animals.

Happy Hollow Children's Camp, Inc.	305531		/users/profile/396786	Trinity S.	Client Served	5	09/19/2016	As a child, this camp was the best part of summer. The counselors impacted me in so many ways from helping me to step out of my comfort zones and helping me embrace myself for who I truly was. I loved this camp so much as a child that I came back to work several summers. Happy Hollow is a vibrant, lively place, and the people there truly want to give their campers the best experience possible.
Happy Hollow Children's Camp, Inc.	303970		/users/profile/219566	bmelchi	Board Member	5	09/13/2016	I was initially attracted to working with Happy Hollow Camp because I personally believe an appreciation of nature is essential to being a well-rounded person and Happy Hollow was unique among the groups we support in that they were the only ones to provide an experience focused on the outdoors for the kids.  I soon found that this camp is so much more than a way for kids to spend a week exploring the woods.  Most of the summer campers come from extremely difficult family, social and economic situations and this camp offers many of them a first glimpse at an entirely different world; one which many of them have never even imagined.  They are exposed to experiences they are simply not afforded in their normal lives, many of which can be personally challenging, but once they are able to overcome their apprehension and accomplish something they did not think they could, it changes them forever and gives them the confidence to change other parts of their lives.  The physical and mental changes many campers experience in one short week are truly amazing.  The number of children that return for multiple summers and who eventually become counselors, is a testament to the positive experience they have each year.  I have come to appreciate Happy Hollow for being so much more than a simple summer camp.  It is a place where kids can build confidence and learn to overcome obstacles and eventually change the world around them for the better.

I attended their fundraising gala this past winter and was profoundly struck by the passion and conviction with which one of the former campers who is now a counselor spoke with respect to how this organization affected his life and how it can help other children.  Happy Hollow offers children an opportunity to experience something many of them would never have a chance to experience otherwise and they do so at very little cost to the families.  The commitment and enthusiasm of the people which make up the Happy Hollow organization is wonderful and they truly love getting to work with the kids.

They learn to enjoy creeks, horseback riding, new healthy foods, each other all while showing respect to the adult leaders and their surrounding.  The camp program has a profound impact on the children who attend and their families.  At the same time, counselors develop as leaders and build lifelong friendships with each other and give back to the camp for years to follow.
Happy Hollow Children's Camp, Inc.	302464		/users/profile/393599	Writer	Board Member	5	09/02/2016	When the under privileged kids that are served by this camp with a free week of summer camp arrive on Sunday night, they often are nervous or cry because of the new to them environment of the beautiful countryside known as the Brown County Indiana Hills. After a week of learning about nature, learning what is like to have three family style meals a day, learning crafts, learning skills, riding horses, playing on the rope course, and many other activities, they cry because they don't want to leave to go. Yet, in a short week they have learned that there can be better for them, that there are people who care, and there are folks who can help them reach their dreams if they themselves are willing to put in the effort on their end.  It is really a sight to behold.

Five of those summers were spent as a camper the other six as a staff member. Words cannot express how much this camp and the people who run it mean to me. Being able to leave the city for a whole week as a child was a dream come true and it was something that my mother could afford. At Happy Hollow it may not always seem like it but they do really make a difference in the lives of others.

It was such a magical place.  Having the opportunity to work with kids from Indianapolis has been  one of the highlights of my life.  I learned so much from the campers - one special talent I acquaire was the ability to cornrow and french braid.  My daughter (now 22) and many of her friends benefitted from this skill that was honed at Happy Hollow.  I am a better person today because of the time spent working in the woods of Brown County with some of the most wonderful people - both staff and campers.  It's been a few years since I last visited, but what remarkable changes have been made in the over 30 years since I was blessed to be a staff member there.

Happy Hollow Children's Camp, Inc.	259623	2	/users/profile/348140	Teagan	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/25/2015	As a leader in youth development for 25 years, the various organizations I have worked with have collaborated with Happy Hollow on many occasions.  The youth clients we referred to Happy Hollow were always very pleased with the experience and especially enjoyed meeting guidance counselors with international life experience.  It broadened kids perspective to our global society.  Typically the kids we referred would have spent their summer in the house watching TV because of safety concerns for them being outside in a high-risk crime area or because the kids were just not accustomed to the great outdoors.  Seeing the change in kid's confidence levels and excitement about their summer experience was always great testament to the excellent work of Happy Hollow camp staff.    --- Tonja Eagan, CEO, Social Health Association of Indiana

The love, support, creativity, and determination of the Happy Hollow Staff is something that you would not normally see in a workplace. The enthusiasm, eagerness, and bright spirits gleaming from the students are the inspiration and motivation that keeps the camp moving. I believe that Happy Hollow Camp is a place of love, warmth, and something that everyone should be able to experience. As a staff, I got to grow and challenged to go outside of my box. With those challenges, I then challenged all of the kids that I was lucky to have and they tremendous growth in them for just under a week was amazing.

They hired me as their horseback riding instructor.  I worked for 3 summers as the horseback riding instructor, worked many school groups, helped in the kitchen, and have volunteered at their annual Under the Stars Gala for the past 13 out of 14 years.  Bernie and Tammy make this place great for all the kids, staff and user groups.  Not only have I worked there and volunteered there since 1999 they are all apart of my family.  Bernie walked me down the aisle at my wedding.  Tammy is my best friend.  Once you go to Happy Hollow it is in your blood, you never want to leave.  The kids that get to attend this great camp leave with the joy of getting to do a sleep out on the athletic feild or go on a camp-out way out in the woods where you make your own dinner over a campfire.  They get to go swimming, mountain biking, horseback riding.  They get to face their biggest fears on the challenge course or high ropes.  They learn to respect nature and all that is in it.  They get on the bus on Sunday's kind of scared not knowing what to expect or who they will be bunking with....then on Friday when they go home they are hugging everyone, laughing, crying because they don't want to leave.  They made friends with people they may never have talked to before.  They get on the bus and they sing camp songs all the way back to the drop off in Indianapolis.
Happy Hollow Children's Camp, Inc.	187230		/users/profile/244228	joma	Volunteer	5	10/31/2013	I have volunteered at Happy Hollow Camp since 1988. This is a camp for kids that are from a socioeconomically challenged family or have a certain type of need(foster family, kids with asthma, ....). At this camp, these kids get to experience the great outdoors, see animals that they have only seen in a book,  learn life skills and are able to do many things that they have never even heard of. They learn that there are all sorts of challenges that they can overcome and that they can do many things they never would have dreamed of. Many of these kids come back each summer, and it is so rewarding to see  how they have matured in their decision making. It is especially rewarding when these children see the importance of camp and end up coming back at camp counselors when they are old enough. It is so special to see these you men and women grow up and pass on these opportunities to others. We had one girl that came to all 8 years of asthma camp that she was eligible, came back as a counselor in training, counselor, and then returned when she finished college and was a respiratory therapist. We have also had a young man that came many years to asthma camp, returned as a counselor in training, became a counselor, and now is working his way through college. He has turned into a fine young man and has been a great counselor and role model to the youth that are coming through camp.

Happy Hollow helped me realize how much opportunity was available to me as a youth and that we could positively change the course of our lives into adulthood.  My experiences with Frank, Tom, Ann, Julie, Alfonso, Dimitri, Davie, Susie, Bernie and many others was invaluable to me as a camper. Besides the unmeasurable amount of fun we had I mostly remember choking back tears when we had to leave at the end of the week!  The camp counselors of America program brought foreign counselors into the camp, which opened my eyes to other cultures around the world. I attended camp as a camper for four-years, counselor in-training for a year and at then became a counselor for four years. My experiences throughout with all of the U.S. and foreign counselors of Happy Hollow truly changed my life for the better.  I'm now a Major in the U.S. Army and have been serving for 19-years.  My love for other cultures, which I found at Happy Hollow, and service in the Army has blessed me to be able to travel to more than 11 countries around the world.

She is on the surface very "Wednesday Adams" but with a little patience one can find the sweet, caring, friendly and fun loving young lady she really is. She left scared of all the "happy" faces and cheery singing, but came back with a reward for her vocals and lots of bounce in her descriptions and even a few new friends. Happy Hollow Children's Camp did all that and more in just  1 week. I will likely be sending her back next year. She may even apply to work for the camp when she becomes old enough.

I began my relationship with Happy Hollow as a camper at the age of 8 years old. I fell in love with the beautiful scenery, the activities, but most of all the staff.  I continued to attend as a camper until I was finally able to become a counselor in training.  After two years I became staff.  I loved every minute of my time at that camp, and my fondest memories of my childhood took place on those grounds.  Now life has come full circle, my 4 children have all attended the camp, and my oldest followed my same path.. Camper, CIT.. and finally staff.  I can not imagine my life, nor theirs without such a wonderful environment and amazing people.  I feel blessed just to have been able to have Happy Hollow as part of my life, and I hope it continues for years to come. 
Happy Hollow Children's Camp, Inc.	169870		/users/profile/225144	CWhetstine	Volunteer	5	09/16/2013	The camp staff, volunteers and board members are truely caring and want to help as many children as possible.  They live through the mission of the camp.  The camp itself is beautiful and well maintained.  The camp means so much to so many children.  My time as a board member was short, due to my location change, but Happy Hollow will always have a special place in my heart, and I will continue to support the camp and its mission from miles away.  
Happy Hollow Children's Camp, Inc.	169829		/users/profile/225082	velvet11	Board Member	5	09/15/2013	What a great organization who's interest is to invest in the youth of Central Indiana through the expericence of a natural environment and peer networking.  Camp is similar to what we (adults) look forward to an adventurous get-a-way from our daily whirlwind.  I have been priviledge to serve on the board of directors for over two years.  I can attest ot the dedication of the staff, volunteers and board members.  This is an exploratory avenue for children to fully understand and appreciate the beauty of the great outdoors.  
Happy Hollow Children's Camp, Inc.	169188		/users/profile/224228	RamblinWreck	Donor	4	09/11/2013	I have loved serving the children that attend camp.  It has been great to see then grow and enjoy the environment the camp provides.  My heart and my passion is to continue supporting the camp and make it better by improving the experiences.
Happy Hollow Children's Camp, Inc.	169160		/users/profile/224194	DGrotz	Board Member	5	09/11/2013	I have been a board member for Happy Hollow for the past three years.  The board members are sincerely dedicated to Happy Hollow.  This is a working board which means that the board members are very involved and give of their time and talent.  The executive/administrative staff is exceptional and is also very dedicated.  They all have "day jobs", but it is not unusual for them to be cooking in the kitchen or washing dishes when needed.  They want the camp experience to be wonderful.I have heard some of the campers speak before.  When you hear how the camp has touched them, you know how important this experience is for these kids.  Please participate or support.
Happy Hollow Children's Camp, Inc.	169057		/users/profile/224072	Wilhar	Volunteer	5	09/11/2013	I have been fortunate to be involved with Happy Hollow Children's Camp since 1988.  I started as a volunteer nurse at the Asthma Camp; became a board member in 1995; and am currently the Secretary of the Board.  I feel blessed to go to camp every summer to spend a glorious week with 120 potentially wheezing children.  I am not sure who has more fun, the kids or me!!  Happy Hollow serves children from all walks of life.  We serve children from the inner-city and those that may have medical diagnoses that prohibit them from attending other camps.  They experiences activities that they may have never been exposed to such as: horseback riding, rock climbing, a zip line, fishing, canoeing and swimming in a lake led by a very dedicated staff.  They also are fed the best camp food in the world (in my humble opinion.)  It is truly a wonderful learning experience for our children.  
Happy Hollow Children's Camp, Inc.	169034		/users/profile/224047	Josh18	Board Member	5	09/11/2013	Happy Hollow Camp operates a children's camp in Brown County Indiana.  The main group served by the camp are inner city kids.  Many of these kids have never experienced a camp environment, or really the rurual outdoors.  Some have never really seen bright stars.  Even though the camp is just a week long, it can be a life-changing event for these kids. They learn an appreciation of nature and the outdoors, self-discipline, and how to work in groups among other many valuable life skills camp teaches.   
Happy Hollow Children's Camp, Inc.	168905	1	/users/profile/223877	AmandaRyan	Board Member	5	09/10/2013	I have been a board member since 2011 and I feel blessed that I get to be a part of these kids lives in some way. Happy Hollow Children's Camp is something you have to see to believe. It's not only beautiful, well kept, up-to-date and safe, it's a kids dream! Happy Hollow gives underprivileged youth a chance to experience something a lot of us take for granted - fresh air, outdoor sports and making friends for a lifetime. Most of the campers come from the inner-city and do not get to experience those and Happy Hollow Camp makes that possible.
Happy Hollow Children's Camp, Inc.	167995		/users/profile/222884	josephthynes	Volunteer	5	09/06/2013	I had the pleasure of volunteering at a local fundraiser for Happy Hallow Childrens Camp.  It never feels like work when it's for a great cause.  The camp provides such a great service to the community, giving these kids the opportunity to have a fun and educational experience they wouldn't be able to have otherwise.  It's really a wonderful program for the everybody involved.
Happy Hollow Children's Camp, Inc.	166869	1	/users/profile/221713	jwatz	Volunteer	5	09/04/2013	I volunteered this past summer session to help the campers get picked up and checked out after spending 5 days down at Happy Hollow's Camp.  The smiles on these kids faces were priceless and it was apparent that the staff, activities at camp, the overall environment, and culture at Happy Hollow must be just wonderful!  I look forward to visiting the actual camp site one day when camp is in session.
Happy Hollow Children's Camp, Inc.	165147	1	/users/profile/219519	Rtarpey	Volunteer	5	08/16/2013	I was humbled by witnessing the gratitude and extreme passion that all of the staff at Happy Hollow put into this program from the top down.  The leadership team displays all the attributes that you would want to see in providing our youth with a stable & happy outcome.  They are responsible, trustworthy, knowledgeable, compassionate, and are in complete control to handle any situation that arises.  I experienced Happy Hollow's leaders not only take control of a wide range of activities but also collaborate with camp counselors and volunteers alike by forming huddles and making sure that everybody was on board to provide the best camping experience possible for the kids.Upon seeing hundreds of campers return with an EAR TO EAR GRIN, and knowing the beauty that this camp in the hills of southern Indiana beholds, I am confident that this is one of the best educational and life altering programs a child can have and also so deserving.  Thank you to all of HAPPY HOLLOWs Team for all that you do!  My family looks forward to many more volunteer opportunities and a chance to someday send our son there for an Amazing Life Experience!
Malawi Project Inc	316443	1	/users/profile/407695	GIGATTAATTGIG	General Member of the Public	5	10/29/2016	As someone who grew up on several continents and been involved with multiple mission projects, I can honestly say that this amazing project oozes compassion and the love of Jesus.  For me, it's enough just knowing there are thousands of children in Malawi (and their parents) who get so excited when they hear that  "Ms. Suzi" and "Mr. Richard" are coming from the USA.  My insight has deepened over the past few months, as I am temporarily in the Indianapolis area.  I've been blessed to witness the deep love, daily devotion, and wonderful work ethic with which Richard and Suzi Stephens lead the MALAWI PROJECT.  They are continually getting the word out of the overwhelming needs of one of the poorest countries on the planet, now facing a horrific famine.  Richard/Suzi will come speak to your high school/college group, civic organization, , hospital, church, etc.   Richard/Suzi are sharing the need online, by phone, or snail mail.  In a country where many women give birth on the side of the road, they are now receiving "birthing packets" from women's groups in the USA!  In a country where medical supplies are almost non-existent, there are now USA nurses, doctors, hospitals, and corporations donating medical supplies, training, and machinery to be shipped to Malawi.  I've seen and heard about job training, sending seed/food, clothing, birthing packets, and so much more.  What an awesome testimony of what love in action can do!
Malawi Project Inc	315353	1	/users/profile/406680	iTunes2016	Donor	5	10/27/2016	 As a woman who's plan was to homebirth their first child with the presence of a midwife,  even I was startled by the fact that these women have to labor and deliver all alone with no one to help them,  or in a facility where tools are rusty, broken, and  unsterile.  So when they're simple requests were for a razor blade to cut the umbilical cord, a onesie, Hat, and blanket for the baby, for a bed pad  to keep the blood and fluids sanitary and for easy disposal, I was moved  at the simplicity of their request. These relatively inexpensive and common items can make such a big difference  during one of the most important events in a woman's life emotionally, spirituality, and physically. This is just one amazingly simple way to show the love of Christ. Blessings to you all who make the Malawi Project a success. 
Malawi Project Inc	314784	1	/users/profile/406135	Nancy277	General Member of the Public	5	10/26/2016	Great group doing amazing things!  Helped my daughter realize a dream of building a well in Malawi. 
Malawi Project Inc	313508	1	/users/profile/404874	Writer	Client Served	4	10/23/2016	Had no Wheelchair for my school going child. I could carry her on my back to and from school. Malawi Project gave her a wheelchair to use. I am now free to attend to other things while my daughter is in class learning.Unlike many NGOs, Malawi project has workers with highest integrity. They don't promise what they cannot help.  They provide and not promise where they can.The project is helping people stand on their feet......NOT handouts.Thanks Malawi Project Board and workers in Malawi
Malawi Project Inc	312841		/users/profile/404213	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	4	10/21/2016	As a nurse in Malawian major hospital, I help patients with cancer. Though we have drugs that help relieve the pain, one challenge experienced for years has been simply how to get pill bottles with which to disperse liquid medications to patients.If I attend workshops, I was making sure I collect as many empty water bottles as I could. These, we could clean them and disperse medicines with to patients. It was hard.Now, we have been given thousands of pill bottles by the Malawi Project inc. We are able to share liquid medications to our cancer patients with.Thank you Malawi Project. Thank you all who donated. You have helped us here in Malawi. This can only be understood by a medical profession like me
Malawi Project Inc	312840		/users/profile/404212	Writer	Volunteer	3	10/21/2016	Great Project that has provided primary service to tens of thousand s of Malawians.Supported in Education, health care, Agriculture and humanitarian assistance to most needy communities.The project's main focus on rural underprivilleged people makes it more people centred with an aim of making a difference.

Malawi Project Inc	290119	2	/users/profile/380402	Writer	Donor	5	05/17/2016	The Malawi Project has grabbed the attention of Americans, showing them that community collaborations across continents can be done without the influence of power differentials. By operating with local decision making in Malawi, The Malawi Projects' American community enables growth, positive development, and positive decision making empowering Malawians to do what is best for themselves.  
Malawi Project Inc	287797	3	/users/profile/377932	Writer	Board Member	5	04/30/2016	This past year I have watched as literally thousands of people in a number of nations participated in the pill collection program for Malawi hospitals. Well over 1 1/2 million pill containers were received before it was stopped on December 31, 2015. It is not often a program is so successful that a charity must stop it, but this happened to the Project in just 8 months of activity. One can hardly find the words to express the appreciation the Board of Directors  feels toward all who trusted the MP enough to commit to such a massive and successful program. Thanks to everyone who has seen fit to work with us to help the people of Malawi.
Malawi Project Inc	275054	3	/users/profile/364610	Jane101	Volunteer	4	12/28/2015	I started collecting pill containers at work in May/June collecting about 500 or so. It was an easy project that did not cost any one anyone anything and made everyone feel good.Now I have about 100 bottles that I don't know what to do with and we are now asked to send financial donations. Surely there are other countries in the world that could use medicine containers, but when I asked, I was not given any other options but was given the request of financial donations.It's a shame that this is the way it ended. I gave it four stars because it was a good program while it lasted, but I would give it one star as to how that program ended.
Malawi Project Inc	273033	1	/users/profile/362216	KellyatDietFacts	Donor	5	11/28/2015	The Malawi Project does a great job of informing donors of their current projects, as well as documenting the progress in both written word and photographs. As a donor, I appreciate all of the hard work by volunteers that goes into  each and every project. When I give, I never feel like my donation is sent into a void where I might question what became of it; rather, with Malawi Project's wonderful newsletters and posts on social media, we know our donations are being received, properly handled, and eventually routed to those in need. What a wonderful organization! I can't enough good things about them.
Malawi Project Inc	272594	1	/users/profile/361671	birdisgreenafrica	Advisor	5	11/20/2015	I am thankful for the Malawi Project and future successful Projects in Malawi!  I have a heart for the Malawians.  I am a Missionary who traveled in Malawi, and Ministered in 2012 and 2013 .  I wanted to stay in Malawi , however I was waiting on the Holy Spirit to direct me to stay.  I plan to return and I plan to stay longer.  I want to make a difference in the Hearts of the Malawians.  Yesu ndi wahmoyo,,,,,,Indiana missionary and chaplinI am truly thankful for how you have helped the Malawians who are so dear to me.  
Malawi Project Inc	270726	1	/users/profile/359455	Linda392	Donor	5	11/02/2015	I have known about the Malawi Project nearly from the start as I have been friends of Suzi and Dick for many, many years.  They have a steadfast love and devotion for the people of Malawi! So much so, that they have laid their lives out to help them. As the government of Malawi and others have partnered with The Malawi Project, an amazing transformation has been taking place! Malawians have been given a hope for their future. The work is far reaching. The needs are great. The Malawi Project has had a great impact for positive change. There are improvements in the conditions of hospitals, In the opportunity for people to learn how to earn a living, in the care of those with special needs, in giving a people with little hope, a hope for a better future. 
Malawi Project Inc	270723	2	/users/profile/359452	Writer	Donor	5	11/02/2015	If you're looking to support a non-profit that is single-handedly changing the face of a nation and its people for the better while also making them self-sufficient - this the organization for you!  Plus, it's an organization that is a great steward with its resources and funds.  You can be re-assured that their donations go directly to help the individuals and programs in Malawi that help make it a more self-sufficient nation as well as a healthier one. I highly recommend this organization.
Malawi Project Inc	270721	1	/users/profile/359450	bhuffmisterquik	Donor	5	11/02/2015	I've worked with the Malawi Project for a number of years now and I can't tell you how impressed I've been with the work they do.  By teaching the people of this great land to be self-sufficient by growing their own food or by helping them with their health care system, the work they have done has truly been blessed.  The most amazing thing to me is that they do not have permanent representation in the country and have worked with the people so that they can be self sustained on their own in the years to come. 
Malawi Project Inc	270504	2	/users/profile/359223	Writer	Board Member	5	10/31/2015	After visiting Malawi in 1993, my whole life changed. I have never been the same and would never want to be. I first fell in love with the children and then the whole country of the kindest, gentlest , most happy people on earth. They had little possessions, but the most loving and giving hearts of anyone I have ever met. To be honest, I left wanting what they had. Community, sharing, closeness and a peace that I could never find in my busy, fast paced, materialistic world. However, they suffered from malnutrition, malaria, lack of drinking water, no infrastructure to call on for help, aid or hope to live a better ,healthier life. They died painfully and needlessly for lack of even the simplest medical supplies and medications that I find on every street corner of my home land. Dedicating my life to help them have an easier, healthier life was the best gift I ever gave myself. Malawi Project is God lead, with people following His lead, and the resources He provides has amazed all who see. Malawi Project is ALL ABOUT THE PEOPLE, who can do every thing we can , if they just had the resources and opportunity.  With God on our side ,we dreamed the wildest impossible dreams and He provided those dreams multiplied by a million. If you give yourself the gift of loving Malawi and her people, YOU will never be the same either,  because God comes up so close when you serve them it is tangible and goose pimples  break out as you KNOW you are doing what God wants you to do, just loving the poorest and neediest people you could ever meet. Partnering with us, The Malawi Project ,will make you appreciate your country like never before and will drive you to help others and give you peace as you please your God.

Malawi Project Inc	270466		/users/profile/249760	Orchik7	Volunteer	5	10/31/2015	The Malawi project is a tremendous work that provides so many different services to the wonderful people of Malawi!! From wheelchairs, tractors, medical supplies, school supplies and more! Dick and Susie Stephens work tirelessly to continue to provide this needy country with provisions to meet their needs!
Malawi Project Inc	191324		/users/profile/249760	Orchik7	Donor	5	12/21/2013	Although we had heard of the Malawi Project for years it wasn't until the last few years that we took the time to become educated in some of the amazing works they have undertaken. We have been fortunate to be able to become closely acquainted with two of the founders of The Malawi Project and have become convinced that they have genuinely and generously given their time, treasure and talent. To some degree the world has become a bit suspicious if not openly cynical about benevolent organizations. Please, please, please take the time to investigate the inner workings and the utilization of donor dollars of this group. I am convinced you will find, as we have, that we should have been more deeply involved in The Malawi Project earlier rather than later. 
Malawi Project Inc	270419	1	/users/profile/359136	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	10/31/2015	The Malawi project is so incredibly beneficial to the people of Malawi. The founders, Dick and Suzie Stephens, are beyond passionate about their role. They give above and beyond anyone I've ever met. 
Malawi Project Inc	270386		/users/profile/359102	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/31/2015	Great nonprofit group doing amazing things!  The Stephens family have devoted so much time and energy to helping Malawi. 
Malawi Project Inc	270385	1	/users/profile/359101	Teresa82	Donor	5	10/31/2015	So proud to do just a small part to help this organization. When deciding whether to participate in the medicine bottle program, I researched the organization. After my research, I had no problem presenting this to my church as a worthwhile program for us to support. 
Malawi Project Inc	270378		/users/profile/359094	Nic F.	Volunteer	5	10/31/2015	I had the incredible privilege of working directly with Dick and Suzi in Malawi. They are tireless servants working at all hours towards strategic goals that have a direct positive impact wherever their efforts are applied. It's a real honor to watch their supporters coalesce under dick and suzis direction making a fruitful and tangible difference in Malawi.  The best part of the Malawi project is their ability to be light on their feet with the ability to change direction quickly meeting an immediate need when it occurs.  It's been some years since I've been to Malawi. There's not a day that goes by I don't think about the Malawi Project and Dick and Suzi. These are the organizations that truly change lives for the better and warm Gods Heart. 
Malawi Project Inc	270344		/users/profile/359062	Writer	Board Member	5	10/31/2015	Very encouraged by watching the success of The Malawi Project year after year. This is not a "One and Done" group. These folks keep building on their success and are having an ever increasing positive affect across the entire country. I also appreciate how they want their work to continue to be taken over by the people of Malawi, and not simply run and controlled from the western world. 
Malawi Project Inc	269804	1	/users/profile/358537	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/30/2015	   We have known Richard and Suzi Stephens for over 20 years and have seen the good that has been done for the people of Malawi. We helped collect used hospital bed from a nursing home near us and ship them to Malawi. Another time we collected medical supplies and loaded them in a container and shipped them to be used by the hospitals in Malawi.   My husband has made two trips to Malawi and has seen first hand the good that has been done there by the Malawi Project.    We know of no other mission effort where all of the money and supplies that are donated goes directly to help the people. Every member of the board of the Project serves without a salary and is not allowed to use any of the resources for anything other than to help the people of Malawi.    Because of their work there a village chief donated land to build a school for the children of her village. They have also built a grist mill to grind maze because the women of the village was having to carry baskets of maze on their heads and walk about five miles to have it ground. They have built an additional school and are in the process of building a hospital on the property.    This is only in one location in the southern part of the country and thy have done much more through out the whole nation.
Malawi Project Inc	269696		/users/profile/358420	John360	Volunteer	5	10/30/2015	I have been involved with the Malawi Project from almost the start.  We have helped the people of Malawi in so many ways.  Some as simple like sending food  others as complicated as building Hospitals.  But the one thing I have noticed over the may years is that the Malawi Project is not a top down driven organization it has been driver by the opportunities that ordinary people bring to the table.  You don't need to be a doctor to help the sick you can send the simple items that a family would need.  People all over the world have found their way to help.The Malawi Project is not driven by money it is driven by the heart.
Malawi Project Inc	269653		/users/profile/358373	Writer	Board Member	5	10/30/2015	The outpouring of support for the needs of the people of Malawi continues to amaze us year after year, and the work done by the Malawi people themselves to make this support meaningful is beautiful to behold. In the past 21 years this support base and working relationship has resulted in over 20 million dollars in food, educational, agricultural and medical being distributed throughout the nation. We are deeply appreciative to all who have made this endeavor possible.
Malawi Project Inc	269243		/users/profile/249764	rpafrica	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/29/2015	The Malawi Project is one of the most pro-active works we have seen in all of our travels to numerous countries.   Having worked with their teams on the ground in Malawi, we know that their work is getting results and making a difference to the people of Malawi.  I highly recommend their work as a model for how outreach can be done effectively.
Malawi Project Inc	191328		/users/profile/249764	rpafrica	Professional with expertise in this field	5	12/21/2013	Having seen the Malawi Project first hand in Malawi, I can say that they are doing a great job in reaching out to help the people of this nation with health matters as well as sustainable farming and other projects.  There team of workers are covering the country with initiative projects to help Malawian's help themselves.    They are helping in hospitals and clinics with much needed medical equipment.  They are helping in schools with much needed text books and other teaching aids.   They are helping in the farming communities by teaching new and better farming techniques as well as providing mini tractors in some areas in connection with their sustainable farming workshops.    I have to say,  if I was not already engaged full time in ministry, I would be in Malawi helping this team in their work full time.   Keep up the good job; Malawi Project.  
Malawi Project Inc	269089		/users/profile/357819	bryon	Board Member	5	10/29/2015	I have volunteered with the Malawi Project for more then a decade.  Their commitment to making the people of Malawi of first importance has motivated me to get more deeply involved over the years.  They are not partial in their aid, they provide for those in need regardless of who they are, their affiliations, or their religious beliefs.  The Malawi Project is also committed to getting the Malawians to take responsibility for their own future.  This is done by handing programs started by the Malawi Project over to the Malawian people.  They have done this with a hospital, schools, agricultural programs - shared village tractors, aid distribution, food processing plant, etc.  Thank you Malawi Project for all you have done.
Malawi Project Inc	268995		/users/profile/357722	Dacobb24	Volunteer	5	10/29/2015	I work for Cornerstone Advertising and I have had the pleasure of working with Dick Stephens, fearless founder of the Malawi Project, on many online and press related projects. Since day one I have been consistently impressed by the tireless dedication that he and his team have shown for the people of Malawi. Dick and his team at the Malawi project exemplify what a Non-Profit should strive to be- a selfless organization that teaches those it helps. The Malawi Project seeks to teach the man to fish so he can survive after they are gone. What a wonderful concept for other organizations to follow. Thank you Malawi Project for all that you do!
Malawi Project Inc	268966		/users/profile/357694	Tracy96	Donor	5	10/29/2015	I have been supporting the Malawi Project for over 15 years (financially and volunteer hours) and have joked with the leadership that, "if my for-profit business was as mission-successful as the Project that I'd be retired by now!" It's been a blessing to see the successful impact, and the scale of that impact, that the Malawi Project has had on the lives of the people in Malawi.
Malawi Project Inc	268931		/users/profile/249977	ChrisV1717	Donor	5	10/29/2015	Great nonprofit the truly cares about the people of Malawi.  Their latest endeavor to collect pill bottles for the hospitals of Malawi has truly gone viral through social media.  The Malawi project should be able to single handedly provided enough pill containers for every hospital to stop dispensing in napkins.  What a heart this group has for other people.  Proud to be a donor and volunteer.
Malawi Project Inc	191481	1	/users/profile/249977	ChrisV1717	Donor	5	12/25/2013	A good organization starts with people and you won't find better people than Dick and Suzie Stephens.   Dick and Suzie have had a tremendous impact on our family and marriage.  As someone who helps them with their house and bills while they are gone every summer, I can personally attest to the fact that they have made this their life's ambition to help other people.  Every dollar that is donated is poured into the life of a Malawian.  This organization works because it is based on solid Christian principles and it was started from the ground up as a grassroots organization.  I challenge you to inspect other organizations that are using 30-40 cents on the dollar for infrastructure and then give your money to a small nonprofit like the Malawi project that is working to use every cent to help others in need.    
Malawi Project Inc	268864		/users/profile/357597	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/29/2015	I worked with Malawians before I learned of the Malawi project and the immense good they do. When I experienced first hand, boots on the ground, what the Project did for Malawians and how they operate- allowing Malawians to better themselves instead of just giving handouts, I knew I needed to do everything I could to help them. If you have an opportunity to help the Malawi Project, please don't hesitate to do so. It will be used wisely!!!
Malawi Project Inc	268813		/users/profile/249836	Texan	Volunteer	5	10/28/2015	The Malawi Project is an amazing organization that has enabled two of my kids and myself to become involved in a meaningful way to help Malawi. The people of this organization are dedicated to helping the people of Malawi learn to help themselves. They also completely support Americans of all ages in finding their talents and supporting this country. I have had the opportunity to travel to Malawi with this organization and saw first hand the incredible level of support they have provided and the deep respect they have earned by the people of Malawi. It is clear to me that supporting this organization will directly help a country in great need in some very big ways.
Malawi Project Inc	191381		/users/profile/249836	Texan	Volunteer	5	12/22/2013	The Malawi Project has greatly and positively impacted my family over the past three years since we first learned of its existence and allowed us to hopefully positively impact the people of this very special country in Africa.   Two of my children wanted to focus their scouting projects  on Malawi, and were given great encouragement and advice as to how to proceed through the Malawi Project. Our church became involved as well and I can say that this organization allowed many of us in Austin, Texas, to directly impact the people of Malawi. A great strength of the Malawi Project is their openness to support an individual's or group's desire to help with whatever focus or talents that person or group brings to the table. As a result of our efforts to send supplies including toothbrushes, baby packs, school textbooks, and laptops to Malawi a 6 member team from our church visited Malawi with leaders of the Malawi Project this past August. This allowed us to see first hand many of the individuals, hospitals, schools, and schools for ministers that the Malawi Project supports in so many ways. We also saw their constant efforts to assess what the most critical needs were of the country to be sure they were helping in the most useful ways. One of the best aspects of this organization is how it provides encouragement and needed supplies but encourages the people of Malawi to use them in the way they best see fit to allow them to take ownership of the projects to help with long term sustainability. The Malawi Project is an amazing organization which has clearly benefited countless people in that country. They have a strong network of supporters in the country from which they can network and work with in their efforts. I can say with complete confidence that whether a person is looking to provide financial support, materials, or the donation of time the Malawi Project will utilize those donations in a trustworthy and beneficial manner to help the special people of this country.
Malawi Project Inc	268746		/users/profile/357479	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	10/28/2015	The Malawi Project is an amazing nonprofit organization that has given my daughter, and her schoolmates the opportunity to help others. The professionalism, and compassion that is at the core of this organization is bar none. The amount of help and the different kinds of help that they give, with such effort and love simply is inspiring. They help the people of Malawi, but they also help others here in our country become better people by teaching what it is to truly be a giving, selfless person. I look forward to helping the Malawi Project for many more years to come.

Malawi Project Inc	191263		/users/profile/249674	Wilson T.

Malawi Project Inc	193461		/users/profile/252668	rjubel	Donor	5	01/29/2014	The Malawi Project is an exemplary organization -- a mission model for assistance programs. It's volunteers and donated resources are used to partner with and mentor the Malawi people, to equip them as they work with them to become self-reliant. Their emphasis is "caring for" rather than "caretaking." We met Richard and Suzi Stephens seven years ago, who through their character and information about the Project, made lasting impressions on us. Our congregation has since participated in various assistance projects, including sending a young couple to Malawi for a short mission trip. Bob Ubelhor
Malawi Project Inc	193410		/users/profile/252602	ronalice	Donor	5	01/29/2014	We have been aware and have supported this project off and on for over ten years.  The things that have been accomplished, hospital, orphanage, nutritious meal production, etc., only begin to demonstrate the impact made on the people of Malawi.  Dick and Suzi Stephens, along with so many others, have done amazing work.  This is a most worthy endeavor.
Malawi Project Inc	192982		/users/profile/252039	ngeerlings	Donor	5	01/22/2014	The Malawi Project has done so many wonderful things for so many needy people! When I donate, I know that my money is going to a good cause: wheelchairs, hospital building and supplies , food, etc .  I highly recommend this organization.
Malawi Project Inc	192877		/users/profile/251881	ryanjaydds	Donor	5	01/21/2014	I have had the immense pleasure of knowing Dick and Suzi Stephens for several years now as one of their health care providers and I am ceaselessly impressed with their devotion to the Malawi Project.  They have personally helped me with transporting equipment donations from my office to Malawi and they have been extremely grateful with each donation.  I have enjoyed learning about the culture and conditions of Malawi through their exceptional publications.  This is a top notch, extremely well-operated organization that is worthy of your attention and donations.  Dick and Suzi are truly heroes to me and I hope that I may one day emulate their kindness in deed, service, and gratitude.  
Malawi Project Inc	192832	1	/users/profile/251809	Nancy148	General Member of the Public	5	01/20/2014	We interviewed Dick and Suzi  on our Boston radio station, "Fireside."  They were incredible in their passion and devotion to the people of Malawi.  Our listeners let us know that their story gave them hope for humanity and one said their story brought them to treats.  They are special people carrying out a very special ministry.   Nancy and Jim Callahan, cohosts.
Malawi Project Inc	192823		/users/profile/61932	meichan1029	Volunteer	5	01/19/2014	I volunteered with the Malawi Project twice, in the summers of 2005 and 2006, and had my life and heart utterly stripped to the core and changed from the inside out. I am astounded by the impact the Malawi Project has made in the country over the years and the multiple times they have been recognized by the government. The desire the organizers have to make a difference in the lives of the Malawian people cannot be described in mere words - it's something that must be seen, felt, and heard. This project is worthy of support and I will do all that I can in the years to come to further their vision in impacting Malawi for the better.
Malawi Project Inc	192734		/users/profile/251690	rustym	General Member of the Public	5	01/17/2014	I have been amazed at the opportunity in Malawi and the wonderful response and work the Stephens have put into helping the people of Malawi on so many levels. I have enjoyed not only interacting with Dick and Suzi about The Malawi Project but encourage others to consider it. At one point we were active in collecting discarded nursing home beds in Kokomo, which hospitals in Malawi welcomed! 
Malawi Project Inc	192706	1	/users/profile/251648	fordycesr	Donor	5	01/16/2014	The Malawi Project is an amazing organization that is able to act as a catalyst to increase the impact from each dollar given. The Malawi Project doesn't own any infrastructure within Malawi, but encourages local ownership and independence and self sufficiency.The Malawi Project doesn't just focus on one issue or problem and is one of the reasons why I think my donation is able to make the most impact in one of the poorest countries in the world.Most importantly, I know that my donation is used to show the love of Jesus to those in need.
Malawi Project Inc	192623	1	/users/profile/251532	dutchmasters	General Member of the Public	5	01/15/2014	My wife and I were visiting Malawi in 2005 and stopped on our way from Karonga to Thondwe overnight at Blessings Hospital.  We were totally blown away by the site.   First, there is a clean, well organized hospital that meets the needs of those in the surrounding area-including an ambulance.  Everything is well maintained and it is truly a peaceful place.  Next, there is the vita-meal plant next door that produces bags of porridge to stem the chronic starvation of Malawi during the drought season.   It is a clinically sanitary environment meeting rigorous standards.  Last but not least there is  a wonderful, compassionate and well thought out orphanage on the property. Compassion and love are freely given.  Our money did not go to the lifestyles of the rich and famous but 100% went straight into the maintenance of the site.  In the midst of suffering and chaos it is so refreshing to find a group that spends its money totally on its mission and not in self sustenance.    We have met Dick and Suzi personally and know their hearts and their mission.  It is making a difference in Africa.  The plans to meet needs on levels that fundamentally resolve the issues that cause the most suffering is practical, thoughtful, and realistic.   The concept of delivering wheelchairs, special tractors, medical care, prenatal and delivery care will help raise a hopeful generation of Malawians who will truly make their home the warm heart of Africa.
Malawi Project Inc	192612		/users/profile/251518	Marcy4	General Member of the Public	5	01/15/2014	Years ago I was preparing to teach a Sunday School Class on the topic, "The Compelling Gospel".  I asked Dick what it is about the gospel of Christ that is so compelling that Christians will dedicate and sacrifice their own comfort and lives for the sake of others.  Dick replied that these Christians  are compelled to "lose themselves in a Cause greater than themselves."     When Dick and Susie returned from their first trip to Malawi, we could sense their great desire to do more for the country.   My daughter and I returned with them the next year.  We saw first hand the dedication they had in both spreading the gospel and bringing hope, healing, and aid to the Malawians.     This was the beginning of a great continuing work, which is bearing great fruit for the kingdom  and exemplifying that their hearts are definitely lost in a Cause greater than themselves.  
Malawi Project Inc	192590		/users/profile/251485	Mary Sue M.	Volunteer	5	01/15/2014	As neighbors to the Stephens' we have witnessed first had their devotion to the people of Malawi. Their story is inspirational and their selfless work unceasing. Whether working to improve the medical, educational, farming or just basic living conditions, they are tireless in their drive to do more. The Malawi Project is the example of what a Great Nonprofit is and should be. 
Malawi Project Inc	192576	1	/users/profile/251466	flash14wsg	Board Member	5	01/14/2014	In the past ten years The Malawi Project has shipped well over 1 1/2 million pieces of Christian literature, over 150 million dollars in medical aid, large shipments of agricultural goods, 8 farm tractors, thousands of school text books, over 3,000 wheelchairs, and millions of dollars in pharmaceuticals. These are distributed from one of our warehouses in Malawi to points all over the nation. It is a rather extensive network. Very low administrative cost. Thanks to all supporters in a number of nations who are making this work possible.
Malawi Project Inc	192567		/users/profile/251456	Chimwemwe	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/14/2014	I highly recommend the Malawi Project, Inc. to anyone who is interested. I am a member of a different non-profit organization that also works in Malawi and have been very impressed by the work that the Malawi Project, Inc. has done and continues to do in Malawi. They are concerned with all aspects of the lives of the people in Malawi. They help with education, health care, agriculture and so much more. The Stephens are a couple who have worked very hard to help people in the US become aware of what life is like in Malawi and improve the lives of the people in Malawi. I thank God for them and their work.
Malawi Project Inc	192566		/users/profile/251455	Stella E.	General Member of the Public	5	01/14/2014	I'm from Malawi I have known the Stephens since 1998.  They're a blessing to Malawi, they work day and night making sure children and people of Malawi get medical help, clothes, food, disabled people have wheelchairs and you name it.  They gave up their lives and dedicate everything they have to this charity. Words cannot explain what this organization is doing they're a good example of how we all should be in life. God bless Suzi and Dick.
Malawi Project Inc	192557		/users/profile/251442	yunfeigao.1	Donor	5	01/14/2014	It's been a bless to be able to support this great ministry! I first heard of this project from one of our friends in the church, and he has been supporting Dick and Suzi for a long time. I remember the first time I have heard about the kids there in Malawi and how their lives are, I couldn't help but break into tears. They have been making good use of the fund for those kids and for God. It's my pleasure to recommend this ministry to anyone who is interested.
Malawi Project Inc	192533		/users/profile/251413	pollyg	Volunteer	5	01/14/2014	I have had the pleasure of following the activities of this organization from its conception to the present day. The passion and dedication of these people is just amazing to me. And I have no doubt that Malawi has benefitted greatly from their help. From the warm hearts of the US to the warm heart of Africa. 
Malawi Project Inc	192532		/users/profile/251412	Amy_140	Donor	5	01/14/2014	The Malawi Project is impressive in its history and its current approach to humanitarian relief and economic development.  The founders have a real gift for leveraging each possible donor's (both private and corporate) contribution to make it so effective.  I appreciate their ability to work with individuals as well as corporations and the great relationships they have built with political and social leaders in Malawi.  May God continue to bless and multiply their efforts!
Malawi Project Inc	192414		/users/profile/251228	Gladys2	Client Served	5	01/11/2014	The Malawi Project is definitely a bona fide, non-profit organization working with the people of Malawi to help themselves develop their nation. This Project was founded by Suzi and Dick Stephens 20 years ago and since that time a vast number of people in several nations have grasped their vision and joined this work. I have known of this work since 2012 when they helped me ship a collection of pencils to a new boarding high school being built in Malawi.  Suzi and Dick's zeal is contagious and has incited many churches and others to get involved in procuring supplies for Malawi, such as books, pencils, soap and bandaids, bed linens and girls dresses, wheel chairs and even a number of farm tractors and agricultural drip systems. Both Suzi and dick's perseverance over these 20 years in spearheading this project is outstanding and the team of people who have become involved are to be commended.  The Malawi Project is a best kept secret that needs to be made known far and wide from the roof tops to churches, businesses, government agencies and other organizations in order for them to get involved as well. These people work across all economic, religious and social lines in order to help the poor in Malawi.  I highly recommend this organization to all.                                                                                         Sister Gladys Marhefka, SGM
Malawi Project Inc	192329		/users/profile/251110	Davison	Volunteer	4	01/09/2014	When I first heard of Dick and Suzi working in the Malawi Project, I thought it was just like other charitable organizations in Malawi who seem to be good on paper and not on the ground. However, when I met them in person, our relationship seem as if we have ever met before  some decades ago. I saw how the Malawi project was saving lives of many vulnerable children and adults as they could help them with many supplies with food, clothes and medical supplies. I was impressed as the project aims for the locals to stand on their own feet in future by even training them in Agriculture activities and this has been possible mainly because those who serve in the project like Dick & Suzi are white when they are in America but here in Africa they are just Africans and when serving they do no look at religion, tribe, race or region thus why even  here in the northern part of Malawi  people have benefited through the provision of wheel chairs, clothes and now they will have a tractor to use in their gardens which they have ever had or dreamed to have it.
Malawi Project Inc	192236	1	/users/profile/250990	MEngel6	Volunteer	5	01/08/2014	The Malawi Project is a top notch organization with a leadership that truly cares about the people of Malawi. They've gone the extra mile to insure their hospitals, schools, and children get needed supplies. Malawi agriculture has been aided through the innovative tractor designed by the Malawi Project and donated to the country of Malawi. A cost effective and unique design has provided for a wheelchair that allows the handicapped children and adults of Malawi to have hope. Everything from tools, pencils, and dresses for the little girls of Malawi have been collected and dispersed through the Malawi Project. This is an organization whose service has kept pace with their vision. The organization is a continued mission project that puts the country of Malawi ahead of people's agendas. Even the name attests to this. It is truly about Malawi and not those, who started the organization. Much praise should be given to Dick and Suzi Stephens for this, even though they do not want it. I highly recommend the Malawi Project to congregations in order to form a partnership. It truly is a partnership as they provide the opportunities for individuals and entire churches to get involved. There are so many ways to help and so many opportunities, that it gives Christians a way to utilize their spiritual giftedness.  
Malawi Project Inc	192216		/users/profile/250955	shemcd	Volunteer	5	01/07/2014	My husband and I had the great opportunity to travel to Malawi with Dick and Suzi Stephens in 2006.  What a wonderful experience!  We got to see first hand all the wonderful work that has been done there.  The most interesting, is seeing how the people of Malawi work to help us help them.  The programs are set up so that the people have the knowledge that they did the work to make the gains.  We give - but they take what we give and do good things with it.  It's not a hand-out, it's a hand-UP!  Also, the programs are intended to help them make their lives better their way - not ours.  The Malawi Project doesn't make decisions FOR the people of Malawi; it works WITH the people of Malawi.  And one more thing.  All contributions go to Malawi.  Period.   Do I sound like I think this is a pretty terrific organization?  I DO!  Other organizations could take some tips from the Malawi Project.  Oh - guess what - they do!
Malawi Project Inc	192140		/users/profile/250828	KPatterson2014	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/06/2014	I've learned a lot about the Malawi Project during my time working in Malawi, seeing firsthand the deep commitment of the organization to helping the people of this country.   From a professional viewpoint, I've been absolutely impressed with the efficiency of their operations - support gets into the hands of families and communities with minimal administrative costs.  As important, the services provided by the Malawi Project are targeted in a cost-efficient and effective manner because of Dick and Suzi's in-depth understanding of Malawi.  This level of knowledge about the critical needs and great potential of Malawi can only be achieved through the decades of service that these two have given - a true rarity in the aid and development world. From a person viewpoint, I'm moved by Dick and Suzi's sincere desire to serve the people of Malawi.  This sincerity is reflected in the tremendous effort they put into this organization, as well as their consistent track record of placing the needs of their clients above any other consideration. I'm looking forward to seeing what the Malawi Project does next and will always hope to find ways to work more closely with this organization.
Malawi Project Inc	192040		/users/profile/250687	Brent G.	Volunteer	5	01/04/2014	I was fortunate enough to travel with Dick and Suzi to see Malawi first hand. We were able to see many of the amazing things they have accomplished with God's help to improve the lives of many people in Malawi. It was especially amazing to see how true to the mission the Malawi project is. We were able to see the Namikango Mission and watch as Wilson carefully doled out supplies to local nurses and people in need. The most touching for me personally was a wheelchair that was given to a teenage girl who had become disabled by cerebral malaria. Prior to receiving the wheelchair her mother was forced to carry this girl, who was literally twice the size of her mother, on her back to the market, church, etc. I remember sobbing as the mother told us about how much she appreciated the wheelchair for her daughter and how much it had changed their lives. I was simply floored by how great the need is and how the things that we take for granted are so greatly appreciated there. It is because I have seen how great the need is and how wonderfully the Malawi Project works with Malawians to fulfill these needs that I continue to support them.
Malawi Project Inc	191989		/users/profile/250611	Skywatcher	Donor	5	01/02/2014	After Dick and Suzi visited our congregation in 2012 and informed us of various needs in Malawi, one of our families set about to engineer a drive to send textbooks and laptops to students in that African country.  With the Austin school district donating some 34,000 textbooks, the church raised the funds ($37,000)  to ship the books to Malawi.  The drive also led to the donation of about 100 used laptops, which were refurbished for shipment to Malawi. Dick and Suzi encouraged some of our members to travel to Malawi and see, first-hand, how these resources were being used.  Six of our members made the journey in the summer of 2013, taking with us medical supplies to distribute among clinics and hospitals.  We returned to the U. S. with several thousand completed Bible correspondence courses for processing by a team here in Austin. Our team returned with something more as well--a deep affection for the kind and appreciative people of Malawi.  Dick and Suzi meticulously arranged our 15-day sojourn within Malawi and accompanied us every step of the way.  We interacted daily with a variety of folks, from faculty and students at a pair of preaching training schools to medical administrators and members of a number of churches in the country.  We made optimal use of our time, distributing resources while witnessing firsthand the impact that textbooks, laptops, "baby packs," and medical supplies had with the people of Malawi.  The team also had time to interact with the fascinating wildlife that help make the country so attractive to guests. It is obvious that Dick and Suzi's work has had an indelible impact on the country--and its leadership.  Countless people, and evangelistic efforts, have been helped through their tireless efforts to see that as many needs of the people as possible are addressed.  They understand the people, and their personal interest in the well-being of Malawians--both medical and spiritual--is on display at every turn.
Malawi Project Inc	191986		/users/profile/250607	lmrobin	Donor	5	01/02/2014	The Malawi Project was born out of love and compassion  for the people of Malawi in the hearts of Dick and Suzi Stephens. I have known Suzi and Dick for over 25 years. Suzi and I worked together as nurses at an Indianapolis Hospital. While I am still there, she and Dick are being used for a greater good in the nation of Malawi. With hands-on help from the people themselves and with the expertise, guidance, and support of folks who care in the USA, lives are being changed and the entire country is benefiting in an amazing way. Malawians are a sweet people and many are personally involved in effecting positive change through the Malawi Project. There have been great accomplishments and there are more needs to be met. Read about what the Malawi Project is doing and hopes to do. You will fall in love with the people and will want to be an encouragement to them. Suzi and Dick are amazing in the sacrifices they have made over the years for this work. Their hearts and lives have been totally focused on this work and they have surrounded themselves with an awesome group of individuals that share the vision and the hope for the people of Malawi! They are reviving hope in the hearts of the people themselves. I cannot say enough! A very worthy cause!
Malawi Project Inc	191889	1	/users/profile/250465	Nathan88	Volunteer	5	12/31/2013	I had the pleasure of working with Dick and Suzi a few years ago as they grew the nonprofit into the excellent organization it now is.  They have a very good understanding of the needs in Malawi, as well as the realities and difficulties to providing adequate assistance.  Their continued development of Malawian human resources as they provide charity is exemplary, and has set the foundation for continued successful interventions for country into the future.  I believe they far exceed the efficacy and impact of many other nonprofits, and I whole-heartedly recommend them as a great nonprofit.
Malawi Project Inc	191827		/users/profile/250374	preachtheword	Donor	4	12/30/2013	I learned about the Malawi Project about five years ago through Dick and Suzie Stephens. We found it to be a well run organization providing many opportunities for Churches to make donations to the country of Malawi, its children, and hospitals. 
Malawi Project Inc	191824	1	/users/profile/250371	lwferrell	Volunteer	5	12/30/2013	I have known Dick and Suzi for several years and their dedication to helping the people of Malawi.  They started with supplies that we take for granted, like gloves, clean sheets and even beds to better serve these people.  Every dollar given, but not only dollars and cents, but the donations of materials and supplies go directly to the Malawi Project effort of serving.  There are not many nonprofits where the director is right in the middle of helping, rather than setting in an office and directing the work from there.  Here is a project that helps the very basic needs of countries individuals.
Malawi Project Inc	191821	1	/users/profile/250362	tstarkey61	General Member of the Public	5	12/30/2013	I have learned a great deal about the country of Malawi and the needs of the people through my relationship with the Stephens and The Malawi Project.  I continue to be amazed at the impact that this organization has had not only regionally, but on the  entire country over the years.  I like their philosophy that its more important to teach the people to fish for themselves rather than to fish for them.   I also like the fact that The Malawi Project works with the people and are keenly aware and sensitive of the Malawi people's  culture and they respect it by not offering American solutions to Malawian problem's.  I like that The Malawi project works with the people to assist them in solving their own issues in their own way. The medical, educational and agricultural programs are exceptional and were developed with the concept of being self sustaining from the start and not  to simply to supply aid  and therefore the people become  dependent on The Malawi Project rather then themselves.   
Malawi Project Inc	191819	1	/users/profile/250358	dang0	Volunteer	5	12/30/2013	The Malawi Project has been in existence now for almost 10 years.   I personally know Dick and Suzi Stephens, originating founders of this ministry.   In James, it says that "true religion is to visit orphans and widows in their distress" and this would fully characterize the efforts of many people on behalf of the Malawi people.  If anyone would take a moment to look at the website, you'll find so many ways this small African Country has been helped - The Hospital and Clinic, the home for orphaned children of parents who've died from HIV, the Wheelchair manufacturing business, the agricultural program with the invention of the "community tractor" with help from business-people from the U.S. and around the world.  I like this ministry because everything that is done by the Malawi people is not done once, but people work alongside each other to learn how to do something new and then their work is rewarded with more responsibility and trust.  The efforts of the Malawi Project are sustaining because the work is indigenous.  The Malawi people have tremendous pride in learning from the Project leaders and then doing more year after year on their own.  Dick and Suzi also have done a tremendous job working with the local and national leaders so that this ministry will flourish and be sustained for years to come.  God is glorified and honored in this small place.  The Malawi Project is an example of mission work done very well.

And not only do they bring tons of medical aid; they partner with the locals and value their imput and seek to eqip them to become more productive.

Malawi Project Inc	191767		/users/profile/250274	markandera	Professional with expertise in this field	5	12/28/2013	I served as a missionary in southern Malawi from 2003 to 2011. While serving in that country, I  had the pleasure of seeing the Malawi Project in action. Without a doubt this is one of the most outstanding ministries of Churches of Christ in Africa. I witnessed the distribution of tons of food to the hungry during times of famine, the donation of hundreds of thousands of dollars of medical equipment and supplies to dozens of clinics and hospitals across the country which before lacked even the basics, the care of homeless orphans  who would otherwise have no hope at the beautiful Mtendere Village, and the compassion of that island of healing called Blessings Hospital with its brilliant and cheery sign above the front entrance offering loving care to a community in which decent health service is hard to find. All of these and the many other ministries of the Malawi Project were so successful because of the love and involvement of Dick and Suzi Stephens, the ministry's founders. It was exciting to see the Lord work through them as they traveled across the country, personally making sure that the Lord's love was being brought into action through the ministry and that goals were being met. We found this same spirit in others who served with the Malawi Project. 
Malawi Project Inc	191624		/users/profile/250114	bhuffindycon	Donor	5	12/26/2013	I learned of the Malawi Project roughly 4-years ago through a friend of mine.  I thought it sounded interesting and asked to meet the founders.  When I first heard Dick and Suzi Stephen's story I was blown away by what they had accomplished in Malawi, but what impressed me even more was the humility with which they told there story.  They were nearly single handedly feeding an entire nation and giving them the knowledge and tools by which the people of the country could begin sustaining for themselves.  The incredible part about what they were doing was that the Malawi Project had no one full time in the country and that all of the efforts were being sustained by the people of Malawi.  They are truly fulfilling the popular saying of "teaching a man to fish" and the people of Malawi were doing the fishing after being taught.  The work that they do is making a permanent change.  
Malawi Project Inc	191475		/users/profile/249971	Bene	Professional with expertise in this field	5	12/25/2013	I met Dick and Suzi Stephens, the founders of Malawi project so many times since becoming a Hoosier in the mid 2005. As a Hoosier with a strong Malawi connection, I have always been impressed with their selfless and giving spirit. They always walk extra mile to have a very significant impact to the less fortunate people of Malawi. Apart from sending millions of dollars of aid and medical supplies, Dick and Suzi's presence, sacrifice, dedication and their regular visits to Malawi ( as they did last summer), have been immesurably insipiring and outstanding. Please continue to support them and this project as they continue to make effeorts to make a huge difference in people's lives over there.May God continue to Bless and protect them all the time. And thank you to all people who support them and all those with intentions to begin....
Malawi Project Inc	191470		/users/profile/249960	Nolan R.	Volunteer	5	12/25/2013	When I first had the opportunity to meet Dick and Suzi Stephens, the founders of the Malawi Project, in the fall of 2011, I had no idea what a significant impact the Malawi Project has made on so many peoples' lives, both in Malawi and here in the United States.  In fact, upon hearing their story and how the Malawi Project has been able to send millions of dollars of aid, particularly in medical supplies, and learning of all of the people that have visited and work done from numerous visits to Malawi, I knew this was an organization that was working both in their mission to support both the churches and people in Malawi as a whole, and I knew I had to find a way to help.  Now, after devoting my Eagle Scout Project to the organization and to Malawi, I have had even more of an opportunity to work with the Malawi Project, and I must say, I am really impressed with everything the Malawi Project has been able to accomplish.  What a fantastic organization that is doing great work.
Malawi Project Inc	191416		/users/profile/249883	c_bischoff2002	Donor	5	12/23/2013	A couple of years ago, my husband and I got introduced to the married couple that founded and runs this organization.  We've spent quite a bit of time reading about their work (they are published authors too!), their plight and cause to change Malawi's economic status and healthcare, and have given some time to help secure more donations.   This is one of the VERY FEW organizations out there that has zero overhead - your money goes directly to those that need it in Malawi.  The reason being...they are literally donating their lives, love, and time to help the people of Malawi.  And why?  Because the people of Malawi are hard working, honest, giving, and in need of help for their economic and healthcare structure.   I intend to get more involved as time goes on because I've worked in the non-profit world and donate to a handful of organizations.  This is one organization that truly speaks to me since it doesn't go to Malawi and just dump a bunch of money in their hands like some relief organizations do...it also doesn't have a ton of overhead to pay for...and quite frankly, this organization helps manage other relief efforts that would otherwise go mismanaged.  Instead, the Malawi Project is streamlined, effective, and helps the lives of those in Malawi by teaching them how to take care of themselves better through improved agriculture, economic growth, and healthcare assistance.   The Malawi Project doesn't just go to build a hospital and staff it with American doctors...they go to build a hospital WITH the people of Malawi and have those same people staff it.
Malawi Project Inc	191378		/users/profile/249833	jorf	Donor	5	12/22/2013	Having worked with the Malawi Project Inc. for nearly 10 years, I can honestly say that they are doing great work in Malawi.  Not only do they provide lifesaving food, medicines, medical supplies and basic necessities, they also are teaching thousands of individuals to be self sufficient.  I have traveled to Malawi and visited their programs, and as I was flying home, I realized I was a changed person.  The love and compassion shown by everyone associated with the Malawi Project touched my heart and renewed a fire in my soul.  I knew then that I wanted to continue working to help those less fortunate.  Their water projects, gardening projects, entrepreneur projects, educational projects and support of hospitals have impacted countless numbers of lives.  Every individual receiving assistance is treated with respect and all donations are handled with honesty and integrity.  I am proud to be a partner with this organization.
Malawi Project Inc	191339		/users/profile/249777	elmcg	General Member of the Public	5	12/21/2013	I am an Elder in one of the Mobile, Alabama Church of Christ congregations which has worked in Malawi for over 35 years as missionaries.  We built a mission in Northern Malawi shortly after beginning this work and have had continuous involvement until the present.  I have personally traveled to this mission and taught there during my three week trip in 1989.  Throughout this time we have also assisted in helping Malawi citizens meet their physical needs, particularly during famines and floods.   We found the Malawi Project in one of these efforts.  We observed that their humanitarian work was both outstanding and extensive.  We contacted them and have been involved continuously with them from that time to the present.  We now partner with them particularly in shipping to Malawi.  I strongly support their efforts and recommend them for your consideration.
Malawi Project Inc	191316		/users/profile/249751	jerrywinstead	General Member of the Public	5	12/21/2013	I traveled to Malawi in 2004 and 2007 and saw the plight of the people first hand. I can say from personal experience that the Malawi Project has had a great impact on many people there, so much so that the present president, The Honorable Joyce Banda, and the Mother of the nation, C. T. Kadzamira  consider Dick and Suzi Stephens personal friends. They have a relationship and access very few people outside the government have. The most vivid picture in my mind is the time we spent on a trip to village in the bush country south of the capital. We went there to see a village garden. It was the dry season when the only green plants were the trees. We walked about a hundred yards from the village through a field of brown grass and weeds, in dusty red soil, to a fence made of reeds. Looking over the fence was the village garden full of green plants. Rows of corn (maize) that was about six inches high, next to that was rows two feet high, and then rows that were just putting on ears of corn. Next were rows that was ready for harvest. It was the same for all of the plants in the garden. At the back of the garden was a hole in the ground the people had dug. It was about fourteen feet deep and ten feet across with three or four feet of water in the bottom. Before the Malawi Project gave them drip irrigation kits and taught them how raise food all year, some of their people would die of starvation in dry years. Now, not only can they feed themselves but also have food for others. We have been on trips to Malawi, Mexico and El Salvador, but the people of Malawi have been helped more and appreciate it as much or more than anywhere we have been. We will be willing to share more or answer any questions if we can.

Malawi Project Inc	191281		/users/profile/249704	JC1234	General Member of the Public	4	12/20/2013	I have been associated with the Malawi Project from a time before there was a Malawi Project.My best friend had chance to go to Malawi and began sending simple things he and his family could package together.  Today the Malawi project continues to send the many needed item the poor of this small nation dearly need.  The Malawi project is a little different from most not-for-profit organizations in that people are what makes the difference.  A doctor may send unused medical equipment and a hospital will donate beds for use in clinics.  A young child may involve his class to donate books and paper. From this simple begining the Malawi Project has been able to provide millions in aid to the poor in a nation half a world away.  If you have the chance visit the Malawi Project website you may find a way you can help someone that can truly use a hand. John ClarkLafayette, Indiana
Malawi Project Inc	191275		/users/profile/249693	gremyachev	Donor	5	12/20/2013	My experience with the Malawi Project Inc. over the past ten years has been totally positive. The dedication, sacrifice, long suffering and integrity of this charity is proven in the results of millions of less fortunate Malawi people being fed, clothed, healed, educated and given hope for a brighter future for them and their country. The Malawi Project truly sees each Malawi person as an individual put on this earth for a special purpose and having the right to live with dignity within his or her own land. The amazing follow up on all donations and accountability to each donor and sponsor has made all involved feel very much a part of their mission in a personal way. Although I have had opportunities to work with other charities in helping the need in Malawi, The Malawi Project Inc. has proven to be the most reliable and gratifying in seeing our donated resources being used to the best end result. 
Malawi Project Inc	191272		/users/profile/249687	jcwinsor	General Member of the Public	5	12/20/2013	We have been associated with the Malawi Project and it's leadership for well over 20 years.  The Malawi Project is not only an encouragement to the Malawi people but to all associated with them.  From the youngest child to the oldest adult one can participate in donating, volunteering, and supporting this ministry.  We, too, are most impressed with the leadership and hard work in achieving the Ministry's goals.   We believe the best way to share the gospel of Jesus is to show love through attempts to meet peoples needs.  Food programs, caring for orphan children, strengthening hospitals, etc. provide a valid backdrop for sharing the Great Good News of Jesus.  The Malawi people know Christians through demonstrated love.  In short, the Malawi Project demonstrates the values we share.

They get involved in health and agriculture. These two are very important in human life. The project managers always go an extra mile with personal sacrifice in order to achieve results. Working with them always make the world a better place for others. Without Malawi Project some families in Malawi would have been living in a very unbearable conditions. Keep on the good work please.

Art With A Heart	318075		/users/profile/409216	saraharizona	General Member of the Public	5	11/02/2016	WE LOVE ART WITH A HEART! Our daughters have been active members of AWAH for 5 years. It is not in the most convenient location for us. So, I will be honest, I have asked them EVERY YEAR if they'd like to continue. They always answer with a resounding, "YES!!! It's our favorite thing!" The instructors have always been patient and helpful. Both of our children have learned so much and I feel like the creativity they express at AWAH seeps into all other areas of their lives! 
Art With A Heart	317729		/users/profile/408865	Val W.	Volunteer	5	10/31/2016	My involvement with AWaH came about when my daughter, a student at BU got an internship lasting several years. Not only did I come to realize the amazing work AWaH does with the youth of Indy in expanding their horizons through the creative experience in the Arts, but I also came to realize the amazing person my daughter had grown to become as she was mentored, encouraged and helped throughout her time through this organization and the wonderful people she came to know, the experience was truly a blessing for her  So when the opportunity came along to volunteer and attend last years gala event, I was 100% on board! It was such a grand event, seeing the children's art exhibited, but even more seeing the children experience their hard work, new skills and creativity being enjoyed by so many. The event truly captured what it means to invest in our youth and that investment grows throughout the community and into their future. A huge fan of the organization and it's directors and when able, very excited and thrilled to support all it has to offer!

The large group instruction offered in his classroom did not engage him. The small group instruction Art With a Heart  offers is just what he needed. Finally he felt successful in school. This built his self esteem and helped him in all areas. AwaH is the one thing my child looks forward to each week. Thanks for helping my child feel successful so he can be successful. He views himself as an artist and I cannot thank you enough.

As a teacher AWaH allows me to connect with small groups of children and for 90 minutes each week put aside the pressures of education today and just let my children be children!

As corny as it sounds they truly do have a heart for making a difference in kids educational experience through art instruction and integration within the school setting. I have found their organization and leadership to be hands on , adaptable and approachable only solidifying my opinion of the impact they make on the communities who get to utilize their expertise .
Art With A Heart	186450	1	/users/profile/243457	Freedom V.	Donor	5	10/31/2013	My first involvement with the AWH was when I attended the annual gala a few years ago.  It was an amazing evening and was a great showcase for the gifts these kids have.  The organization is truly a fantastic gift to the kids it serves.  These kids are provided a creative outlet that is usually desperately needed.  It provides them with a chance to not only improve their skills, but their self confidence as well.  We proudly display a large painting created by one of the kids that we bought at the gala, and it brings a smile to our face daily.  Thrilled to support the organization and all that it does!
Art With A Heart	186252	1	/users/profile/243250	Gemma B.	Volunteer	5	10/30/2013	As an art-loving Senior in high school, Im extremely happy to be involved in Art With a Heart. I've been with the organization for about two years now, both volunteering in the classroom, and fundraising and recruiting volunteers as a member of the Junior Board, and I have nothing but good things to say about Art With a Heart. Art With a Heart gives its kids an opportunity to exercise their creative minds, and the finished art projects give each child a feeling of success and confidence. Enter an Art With a Heart classroom and youll likely see happy little hands hard at work on a project, such as the yarn bowls made during the 2013 summer program, or selecting crayons to make a blank white paper blossom into a unique illustration during a free drawing opportunity. When volunteering in the classroom and on the Junior Board, it's clear to me that the staff and board members are truly dedicated to the cause and care deeply about the children they're serving. The teachers treat each student with respect and affection, supporting them in their artistic process. I cannot overemphasize, Art With a Heart is a wonderful nonprofit.

Art With A Heart	186208		/users/profile/243199	Emma13	Volunteer	5	10/30/2013	I first became involved with Art With A Heart when I was a sophomore in high school, and it has changed my life. By serving as both a Junior Board member and a two-year summer volunteer, I was able to work firsthand with the staff and experience what was going on behind-the-scenes. My time spent volunteering in an Art With A Heart classroom in a homeless shelter has been a blessing as I've gotten to know kids who thrive doing art in a way that is totally unexpected, even to them. Art With A Heart provides kids (many of whom do not even have access to simple materials like crayons at home) with the opportunity to genuinely understand and explore different art forms, and that is incredible. Moreover, I have loved my time with Art With A Heart because of its fantastic people. The staff is wonderful, full of quirky and passionate people who are no-holds-barred dedicated to their cause. Their enthusiasm is infectious.

Art With A Heart	184570		/users/profile/241508	Amy_129	Board Member	5	10/29/2013	I first learned of Art With a Heart through a friend who served on the board. The mission to offer QUALITY art education to every child regardless of her situation spoke to me. Personally, the opportunity I was given to experience art in school helped to steer me toward a career in art direction. Time spent creating art made me feel confident and capable as well as joyful. Every child should be given the opportunity to see how art can fit into their lives. We hear stories about schools removing art education from their curriculum every day and it is a beautiful and hopeful thing to know that an organization is working to keep art in the lives of every student. I joined the board this summer and have been delighted by the commitment and passion of the staff and administration that I have worked with. I have also been impressed by the many different programs that service the children of this city in the ways that meet their specific needs, as well as the specialized training that the instructors receive. This organization has a huge heart and is doing great things.

I have worked with the Art with a Heart staff and board for the last year and a half in a consulting and advisory role. The organization has grown tremendously during that time and I know that they are making solid and sound business and program decisions that equate to lean operation and reaching more people with their programs and services.  Art with a Heart is a life-changing organization for underserved youth. The programs are not focused just on artistic product but on personal growth and development - meaningful engagement and personal development through arts education.  I have been so moved by the work of the organization that, after offering advice many times from a consulting standpoint, I found myself giving of my own time and money to help the staff better achieve their ambitious goals. The organization is one of the most well run I have encountered in Indianapolis and I am honored to be associated with their powerful mission to provide hands-on visual arts experiences that educate and inspire at-risk children. Those who have not witnessed their work yet are missing a remarkable opportunity.

You never know how much talent your child really has until you get them involved in something educational, exciting, challenging and fun all at the same time.  That is what AWAH has been for me and my daughter's experience and it's been our 1st year with the group, my daughter Maxene has learned a lot with the group, she's 12 yrs old and loved the different projects AWAH presented each weekend, techniques learned aside from painting.  I encourage anyone with a child interested in art, painting, drawing or culturally inclined to bring their child to AWAH program.  I'm the parent of an AWAH student and I LOVE being involved with their activities and working with the children.  Happy 10 yrs AWAH and many more to come with future artist.  Lyz Wilkins

The organization provides many beneficial services to the youth of the Indianapolis area as well as to children in need from other areas of the world. True compassion and care is shown by each individual that is associated with Art With a Heart, the curriculum is carefully selected and concentrated to meet the needs of every student that participates the Art With a Heart afterschool programs and summer workshops.

The staff truly cares about the children that they work with, and they really want to make a difference in their lives. Since the children that AWAH works with are all at-risk, it's essential that they continue to be exposed to organizations like AWAH in order to give them a positive outlet for their emotions.

At a very young age children are given very high quality art supplies to use where their ideas pop off the page and are vivid!  The atmosphere of smiles, confidence and calmness fills the classrooms.  My 13 year old child is a student of 5 years now and has used more quality supplies and more mediums (printmaking, ceramics, charcoal, various paints, pencil, wax) then a college student.  What amazes me most the diversity of students from low income families that this organization serves.  They bring together all races creating another level of support.  Amazing leader of the organization who digs to find funding for them.  We are fortunate to be a part of Art With a Heart.

We are an inner city school with many students that have limited oppportunities.  AWAH has been volunteering in my classroom for the past several years and I have seen such a tremendous improvement in my students.  They offer numerous art activities that not only use many types of mediums, but also incorporate stories and literature that go hand in hand with their projects.  They come weekly with experienced teachers, materials, and volunteers leaving me with nothing that I need to prepare or purchase.  AWAH has been able to provide our students with educational art experiences that are absolutely amazing.

She loved the oppurtunity to express herself and to learn more about art even in her young age. She has currently been a part of Art with the Heart for the last 3 years and it has been such an important part of her life. She is shy, yet very smart and expressive. The Art with the Heart classes allows her to learn about her feelings and how to express them through art. As a parent, Art with the Heart is great because its first and most importantly AFFORDABLE, then it is great because it teaches my daughter different forms of Art, including drawing, painting, 3-D models, ect. In addition, they had a course at our local art museum which allowed the kids the oppurtunity to see other artists and learn about them first hand. The teachers are patient, kind and really enjoy helping the kids.  With art programs being cut, Art With the Heart is an exceptionally strong program for young children to develop their artistic and expressive side no matter their skill level.

I know nothing about art, so it was truly a blessing that Kaitlin (lead AWAH teacher) was able to organize the program and obtain the art materials from donors.  As is the way of the developing world, plans changed numerous times throughout the trip and Kaitlin was able to adapt with ease. If it weren't for AWAH, AWAH students who helped with preparation, and Kaitlin, art would have never reached the lives of orphans and child-headed households in Swaziland.

My daughter and I have been in the program provided at her school for three years now, and I could not ask for a better program for her to be in. The way she is interacted with while there is amazing she really has been given the opportunity to express herself artistically. She has never felt more free to do the type of art work that comes to her mind at that specific moment.She loves being there every Monday and I hope to keep her in the program as long as they offer it.

I found the experience very enlightening and could tell that students need this program. I enjoyed getting to know each of the children and also their attempt to know me. The art projects were surprisingly advanced but the children ate it up. I sometimes wished I had a name tag especially at the beginning. I was actually happy to have smaller class sizes because the day in which we had both the tuesday and wednesday class was a bit to much.

Art With A Heart	22480	3	/users/profile/23502	playnice09	Volunteer	3	11/13/2009	I absolutely loved working with Art With A Heart. The kids are fantastic (as children always are)and through our time spent on art, a lot of underlying anxieties they had were able to seep out and be handled in a positive way. That was my favorite part; watching these kids learn about themselves and their capabilities through the skill sets of art. I worked at IPS (86?) and I believe it was a really good school choice for this afterschool program.The reasons I gave it 3 stars rather than 5 was because:1- equipment was needed, If there could be some kind of organized donating for simple things such as pencils, a few scissors, or a few hand held pencil sharpeners... that would help a lot.2- I felt that other people working with the kids didn't know how, or simply declined to really instruct them. As important as compliments are, I saw that they weren't much taken to heart if the kids didn't feel they'd been challenged at all.3-I know there was some kind of incident with a child being kicked out of the program, and for legitimate violence I could see that being necessary...but in any other case, these are high-profile candidates for kids you do not want to give up on.4-I wish the program were longer! But maybe that's just me... =)All in all I am very grateful for this program being made possible.

I went into it mostly just because my friend asked me to, but after that first week of working at  the summer day camp, I was in love with what we were doing. Not only did I get to spend hours in an art room surrounded by colors and happy creative chaos, but i got to spend quality time with each of the kids and watch them grow and become enthralled with their work. These kids are such blessings to me and I can't wait to see their sweet faces every class. They love that they get to create art; it brings some of them out of their shells, makes them think, and allows them to have a sense of control and make decisions for themselves. AWAH is a fantastic program, its all about the students and a pure love for art. :)

Know I had more potential than the school's art program could offer, they encouraged my parent to seek out art lessons. They did and I developed a fondness for art which led to a degree from a top design school. I was lucky. I had the help of others to discover and develop my talents. Now working with Art With a Heart I help other young people discover and develop their talent for the arts. And these people are not as likely to have the situation I did.

I have had many opportunities to sort and label food for distribution with my team from work, which is great for team building for any work group.I also reached out the them to see where my sons Cub Scout group could help.  FFFB helped identify about a half dozen areas/Projects that they could help our community outside the FFFB facilities since they were to young to be in one of their facilities.Our scouts were able collect food donations totaling over 400lbs the last couple years.  The food drive for our scouts has become a great tradition for our entire pack.Our scouts also made laundry detergent for FFFB, which is needed for several FFFB clients in our local area on a monthly basis.  The scouts had to first collect plastic bottles for the detergent which aligns with our efforts to teach the scouts about the importance of recycling.   Our den was able to produce 234 bottles of detergent for FFFB.  We now plan to expand this to our entire Scout Pack in the future.The opportunities that FFFB has provided for our scouts has helped educate them on the importance of helping out and giving back to our community.  The scouts learned that there are a variety of ways they can help as an individuals and the importance of giving back to their community.  They also experience first hand how big of an impact they can make when they team up to help others.

They opened their doors to us on a Sunday morning so that we could "Workship" there; volunteering to repackage food, then staying for worship. We have also hosted a Food Finder's Mobile Pantry in the parking lot of our church. They are able to provide hands -on volunteer opportunities for our students, while sharing the political and social reasons why there are so many food insecure people in our community.
Food Finders Food Bank Inc	288482	1	/users/profile/378677	jimsmith	Volunteer	5	05/04/2016	I have now volunteered for a number of days at Food Finders.  I find this organization is very well organized and managed with the focus on delivering food to where the need is.I am proud to say I volunteer and work with this organization.  
Food Finders Food Bank Inc	287350	1	/users/profile/377436	Writer	Volunteer	5	04/26/2016	This week I had the opportunity to dedicate some of my time at the local Food Finders Food Bank, Inc. in Lafayette, IN. Food Finders is responsible for distributing food not only to Tippecanoe county, but to fifteen surrounding counties in Indiana as well. The program is funded by the United Way, grants, foundations, corporate sponsors, USDA, and private donors. These organizations help Food Finders distribute more than 7 million pounds of food annually to non profit organizations that work to alleviate hunger throughout North-Central Indiana. They do this through a variety of programs. The Agency Partner Program is responsible for providing the single largest source of food for over 160 hunger relief agencies such as soup kitchens, food pantries, and shelters. The mobile pantry outreach program has a farmers market style distribution. Food Finders takes a truck load of food across the central 16 counties to efficiently reach the Hoosiers who need it most. The Senior Grocery Program provides for seniors who are in need and have special dietary restrictions. This helps if they are unable to utilize certain food resources such as pantries and soup kitchens or if they have mobility issues. Another helpful outreach initiative is the Backpack Program. Shockingly every 1 out of 5 kids in Indiana alone struggles with hunger. Even with free or reduced lunch programs, these children have no food on the weekends. This program dedicates a backpack of food so the children have something to eat between Friday afternoon and Monday morning. Food Finders is responsible for over 4,000 backpacks each week. A majority of these programs are not possible without the help of volunteers. 	Walking in to Food Finders Food Bank, Inc. I was not aware of the impact a single person can make in an organization such as this. First, I was introduced to a few staff members and about 8 other volunteers ready to make a difference. My assignment for the day was to package Pinto beans from a large 2000 lb. sack, into smaller 2lb. portion sizes where the bag was then sealed and placed in a box ready to distribute. Before I began, I had to apply a disposable hair net, gloves, and even an apron. Although, the task was as easy as dividing and weighing this mass of beans into small 2lb. packages, I still felt that what I was doing could potentially be making an impact on someones life. By the end of the day I was solely responsible for about 100 bags of Pinto beans ready to be sent to people in need. 	By participating in this service learning activity it opened my eyes to not only the hunger issues of the world, but the very issues that are happening right where I live. I am now aware that 20% of children in the state I was born and raised has issues getting one of the main necessities of life. This not only deeply saddened me about my fellow Hoosiers, but it also brought to light how important this issue is globally. If children in the United States are having trouble eating, I can only imagine the trouble this issue is causing on a global scale. I am thankful I never had to grow up with such a tragedy, but now I am aware the impact this holds with the rest of the world. I am thankful that I had an opportunity to make a difference even if it was only 100 bags of pinto beans. I hope that some day the people of the world can take a few hours out of their week to volunteer for a good cause like Food Finders.

I always have a great experience. The instructions are very clear, the work is not too physically demanding, the people are very nice, and I always feel appreciated. Signing up is easy (every time you sign up, you are committing to one day, one time, it is easy to cancel if you need to, and you can sign up for as many events as you want), and there are so many options for time slots and activities. There really is something for everyone. I would recommend volunteering here to anyone. I have brought several of my friends along with me, and all of them have enjoyed the experience, too.

The business side of things need to change. It is sad when the executive director thinks that she is better than everyone and belittles all of the staff. They fire people all of the time for no good reasoning other than a friends of theirs may need a job. Directors there have said anyone and everyone is replaceable. If people knew what went on behind those walls they would honestly think differently. There are some people that know the truth but are to afraid to speak up for what is right, the turn over rate in the last 12 months is around 87%-110%. That should say something all in itself.

But then I got hurt & now live on $732 SSI each month. Even with food stamps, it's challenging to make money stretch.  Food Finders not only fills in the gap when needed but I've learned to be creative with what I receive. I got a large amount of fresh produce once and canned or froze it, making it stretch even further. Thanks for blessing those in need.

I would drop her off and wait outside.  Then she started talking me into going; I only get $708 per month in SSI and $147 in SNAP.  It has helped both of us, so much so we have helped out with the Mobile Pantry our church sponsored and took some home to our neighbors because there was so much left over.  They are a young couple with two small children and they really appreciated the extra boost.  Foodfinders also supplies food to our local homeless shelter, Emmaus Mission Center's food bank, which recently won a grant of $20,000 from WalMart, which was deposited in their account with Foodfinders.  What an awesome partnership!

My first volunteer experience with this organization was that I walked into the room and saw three ladies working on a "cereal mountain." The atmosphere was very friendly and depended on team work, I was glad to be volunteering in an environment like this. The lady on a ladder at the top of the "cereal mountain" was Stacy. She welcomed me and helped me get started. From my first impression, Stacy is very informative, organized and a great manager.  I definitely plan to volunteer in the future!
Food Finders Food Bank Inc	202540		/users/profile/264259	DawnSchwarz	Volunteer	5	06/11/2014	I began volunteering with Food Finders shortly after the passing of my older brother.  He had, on occasion, needed the assistance.  I have worked at the warehouse and my family of 7  worked a "Families Feeding Families" event.  What really gets to me though is the Tuesday Whistle Stop, to be there with the people and show them kindness and a commitment to them; as someone once did to my brother.  it means the world to me as I see the same faces each week and they know that someone cares.  What I once did in honor of by brother, I now do for us both.  I thank the volunteers and staff af Food Finders for their non-stop work in obtaining and delivering food and for being a presence in the lives of so many.
Food Finders Food Bank Inc	194241		/users/profile/253787	IWFKBM	Board Member	5	02/13/2014	Over the past 2 1/2 years I have had the opportunity to work closely with Katy Bunder , Executive Director, and on occasion various members of her staff.  Without hesitation I can share that Katy and her Team are mission driven, as well as, very smart and very innovative.  Using their own innovations and the best practices of others they constantly procure and distribute the maximum amount of food in the most efficient and cost effective manner. But just as importantly and perhaps more importantly, Katy and every member of her team care deeply about those families and children who do not have adequate food and nutrition.  Having served many times on the mobile food pantry team, I have seen first hand the sincerity of the compassion felt by those serving the less fortunate.  I believe I am privileged to be a small part of this great organization.  I strongly encourage everyone who has an interest in this most fundamental of needs to become a part of this enormous effort.  Together we will climb the mountain.

The organization, professionalism and care that Food Finders puts in to their methods shines through during this type of event. They were extremely coordinated, making it easy for us volunteers to participate and always have a role. The way they care for each individual as they go through the line shows they are dedicated to really serving the people and not themselves. There's nothing exciting about experiencing people in need, but Food Finders is a glimmer of hope to those that otherwise would be without nourishment for them and their families. It was a rewarding and enlightening experience and I am proud to have them in our community.

We purchase the vast majority of our food from Food Finders, not just due to their low prices per pound or per case but also due to the caring and dedicated nature of their staff and volunteers.  The mobile food pantries that Food Finders operates are a godsend to our local friends and neighbours ; delivering much needed food directly to the hearts of our communities.

Food Finders Food Bank Inc	159259		/users/profile/172834	tfitzwater	Volunteer	5	06/02/2013	Food Finders food bank helps distribute nutritional food to those in need. They have mobile pantries that commute to various towns in several counties in the northern half of indiana. They are a support unit by means that they assist by giving nutritional food to accomondate times when nutrition may be lacking in a home. The summer months are the hardest for families due to children being home and that extra food is needed, where normally a meal is provide at school. I have volunteered at several mobile pantries near by and I helped others who needed the food by telling them, taking them to the pantry and picking up food for those that cant get it themselves. I have seen pregnant women, children, the elderly and the disabled recieve nutritious food from Food Finders. I am thankful for this organization and believe that it is a tremendous support unit for the people of these communities of northern Indiana. It is a God sent organization for these individuals that need the extra assistance.
Food Finders Food Bank Inc	127736		/users/profile/172834	tfitzwater	Volunteer	5	10/22/2012	Food finders food bank travels to many small towns with there mobile food pantries. I have had the opportunity to volunteer with the mobile food pantries at several different towns. I have seen families of young and old receiving assistance. The individuals get to pick out their own preferred taste of food out of several  boxes and in each box their contains meat, vegetables, breads, and maybe fresh produce. It all depends on what people donate to the facility. It has been a pleasure and a memorable experience to help distribute food to those in need of food. To me food finders is a safety net kind of for those that just dont have enough funding to buy food for the month. Thank God that the food finders food bank exist, because with this economy and the lack of employment many families have a dire need for this type of support. Thank you to the food finders staff and all who donate! Love in Christ, Tammy

We could not feed everyone in the house but found we made too much money for food stamps. They only have one part time income so their resources were limited. I use to get help from Food Finders for a non-profit agency when I was the Executive Director and had remained on the email list. I found we could get help at the local Food Finders trucks. It has been a great resource for our family and a God-send when we are struggling. Not only do they have food but often we get special treats that make life better. Thank God and all those supporters of Food Finders for helping us when we could not find help anywhere else.
Food Finders Food Bank Inc	159187		/users/profile/211304	jbay	Volunteer	5	05/31/2013	Food Finders is a model nonprofit organization in the Greater Lafayette community. Over the past five years, they have greatly increased the amount of food distributed to local food pantries. They have also started the mobile food pantry, an innovative means to distribute more food to people in need. I can think of very few other nonprofits in the area that continuously innovate and tirelessly work to improve their operations as Food Finders does. Lafayette is lucky to have caring volunteers and staff at Food Finders who are committed to alleviating hunger in this community.
Food Finders Food Bank Inc	159161		/users/profile/211283	Lynn Johal	Professional with expertise in this field	4	05/31/2013	My name is Lynn Johal and I'm the Director of the St. John's/LUM Food Pantry (a choice pantry)  in Lafayette, IN.  We are one of the largest pantries in the 16 county area served by Food Finders (FF).  Last year we served a whopping 8,397 households. May of 2013 we served 694 households, representing some 2,179 family members.  We have ~60 volunteers that help out at our pantry. Last year 47% of our food came from FF + another 36% came to us as USDA/TEFAP (free commodities) via FF.  Our pantry therefore relies heavily on the resources available at FF.  I'm impressed with the staff at FF; they are always helpful to answer questions quickly and respond to the unique situations that arise at our pantry.  The online ordering has really streamlined our process as we shop twice each week at FF.  I've met on ocassion with Katy Bunder (FF director) and Kier Crites (FF outreach) and they have listened to our pantry's specific needs and given us helpful suggestions to make our pantry even more efficient.  Right now we are holding monthly cooking classes for our clients, with the help of Purdue Extension, and FF staff is watching closely to see if this might be a model for other area food panties.

Food Finders Food Bank Inc	127618		/users/profile/172694	Deanna A.	Client Served	4	10/22/2012	Food Finders is an exceptionally valued resource in surrounding communities.  It has helped thousands supplement their food budget and keep from going hungry.  Their food is quality items and the volunteers are happy to help each person.  They do not make you feel like a beggar.  Personally I wish they would run each stop the same such as giving out numbers to the people in line so the ones that have been waiting for 3 to 4 hours (yes we have to wait that long to have a place in the line) could keep their place instead of ones coming at the last minute and line jump in front of those waiting for so long.  This is so unfair to those waiting.  And the person needs to be there to get their number.  I have seen friends or family members take 3 to 5 numbers and then hand them to people who come at the last minute.  Some of us have appointments to keep and try to get food but are pushed further back and then after waiting for hours have to leave just before we can get to the food truck.  Also it would be nice if the sponsoring business had a place for clients to sit out of the sun or bad weather while waiting.  due to health issues and the hot sun - I almost had a stroke one day in the sun.  Otherwise this is a fabulous and much needed resource and has helped thousands of people.  You get something from all the food groups and sometimes little surprises also.   I hope they make the Top Rated Nonprofit list as they well deserve it.

I am disabled, and have only a limited amount of monthly food stamps, and even with that being given to me, it is just not enough to get me through the month. I really appreciate this Mobile Unit to help get me through every new month. I most certainly appreciate the Mobile unit going around to help so many of us right now, I don't know what I really would do without the help of everyone to  make this happen for people such as myself so in need of food just to get by. I do have to budget my money with gasoline in my car to get there, and someone gave me a form to fill out for requesting delivery service to my home if needed, and I may really need to turn in this form for during the winter time in case I can't get there myself. Thank you so much for your time, efforts, and donations to make this possible for anyone in need of food for whatever their dire situations are just so we can have that little extra to help get us through in our time of need for food. Thank you.  P.S...From what I understand, you can call, (765)471-0062, and ask for this form of requesting delivery service to your home if you truly cannot make it there that day.

These people are awesome!  They are easy to work with, dependable, and truly believe in their mission to help feed those people less fortunate.   I know my money is being well spent first hand, having helped with the food distribution at my church the last three months.  I have committed myself to not squandering the Lord's money He has entrusted to me, and have a grateful feeling in my heart when the MFPTruck arrives because I know so many needy people will get helped.  I am so personally convinced about the Food Finders' mission, I am going to sponsor a year's worth of MFPTruck visits.

Food Finders Food Bank Inc	125648		/users/profile/170879	Archie03	Board Member	5	10/16/2012	I have been involved in youth related community service for over 30 years.  One of the most satisfying experiences I have is being part of an entity that makes sure over 3,500 children will not go hungry over the weekend because they are part of the Food Finders Back Pack program.   Hunger is a big problem that many people do not seem to acknowledge.  Anything done to alleviate this problem is welcomed.  However knowing what you do is not only feeding hungry children but also helping them obtain an education that will allow them to better themselves really hits home.  Food Finders is truly a place where you receive so much more than you give.
Food Finders Food Bank Inc	125643		/users/profile/170875	Linda117	Volunteer	5	10/16/2012	I first met the FoodFinders Food Bank when I was working with the summer lunch program at our church.  Each day we provided cold lunches for the children of the neighborhood who normally would have eaten free lunches at school in the winter.  It was marvelous to watch these children eat a healthy lunch then play, but it broke my heart to watch some of the parents who obviously needed a lunch too, but were excluded from the program.  Our pastor got hold of Food Finders and they came to the church with food for us to give to the families.  To watch the kids jump up and down because they got "tuna helper" in their sack for dinner made me want to cry! Many parents went away with heartfelt gratitude for what they recieved.                                                                                                           Now my situation has changed, and my husband lost his job.  Now I am the one who follows the food truck and waits in long lines to get the produce and tuna helper.  We don't qualify for food stamps because we are drawing from retirement savings to keep our house.  The food I get at give-aways gives us variety and produce that I can't afford to buy.  I am grateful for the Food Finders truck!

Throughout 2011 and 2012 I volunteered to help with several mobile food pantry events - where a truck loaded with food and household items heads out into the communities that need assistance. I helped distribute over 15,000 lbs. of food to those in need.  The staff and volunteers at Food Finders are to be commended in every way... from their tremendous organization and leadership to the compassion they exhibit every day - kudos. Volunteering and being on the front lines was a truly eye-opening experience to the food insecurity of our community and I recommend to others that they volunteer their time, raise donations or contribute food items to such a great organization.

The kids, about 50, have the best time learning about animals and being able to touch and pet them, well, that just makes it all the better.  Not only do the animals entertain the kids, but so does the zoologist.  I am already planning on having them come back next year and can't wait to see the animals they bring.  
Animalia	244052		/users/profile/330927	corcom	General Member of the Public	5	06/01/2015	Our 8 year saw Animalia at the Indiana State Museum and immediately wished that she could have an Animalia Birthday Party.  After speaking with Ratul, a board member, we immediately scheduled Animalia to come to her birthday party and be the main attraction.  It was a smashing hit.  We scheduled two 45 minute sessions and it flew by while capturing the attention of 15 8 year olds the entire time. The animals were spectacular and Joel and Zach were fantastic with kids and with the size of the group.  Joel was unbelievably accommodating as during the first 45  minute session, it started to pour and we moved into the garage.  Animalia provided almost 8 animals and each was a smashing hit. We would definitely do this party again and strongly and whole heartedly recommend Animalia for birthday parties.

They are fabulous!  Joel and his team are enthusiastic and entertaining, and they have an incredible ability to connect kids with the animals they bring, while tying the program back to the wizarding theme.  They are an incredible resource and are always a hit with kids, parents, and staff!

I first began using them for programs at the Children's Museum of Indianapolis, and was constantly impressed with their professionalism, their ability to work with all age groups, and the overall quality of their programs. As the director of the Johnson County Museum of History, I continue to use them time and again with rave reviews from our visitors. I simply cannot recommend them highly enough!
Animalia	225226		/users/profile/288995	drpickett	Board Member	5	10/22/2014	I first learned of Animalia at the Hoosier Outdoor Experience a few years ago at Ft.  Benjamin Harrison where Joel talked to our group of Scouts.   The boys loved it.  My son loved it so much that I contacted Animalia to do a birthday party at my house for my son's 9th birthday.  Both times,  not only was the event informative,  but it offered a unique opportunity to get up close and personal with animals that you might not otherwise be able to and to learn about these animals and nature in a very engaging way.  Animal's mission is real because of the hard work and passion that the volunteers,  Joel, and Ailigh  put into the organization each and every day through these outreach events, wildlife rehabilitation, animal training, and behavior consultation.   I am now honored to serve Animalia  as a Board member and be part of this amazing organization that connects people to nature.

As a volunteer, I have had the opportunity to interact and learn about several different animals and I would not have been able to have this experience anywhere else. It has helped me to understand animals and overcome some of my fears of certain animals such as skunks and snakes. They put on great programs for groups all across the state where they teach others about these animals.  Once they raise enough money, Animalia is planning to expand its facilities and build the Global Center for Nature which will be better housing for the animals and will include an education center. This will be a great addition to Animalia and will be very beneficial to the community.

From there I learned about their mission to further the appreciation of animals, and thus their care both in the home and in the environment, through education. I knew that this was an organization I wanted to be a part of and to learn from, so I became an intern with them. I can not even begin to describe how much that summer, and the proceeding volunteering, meant to me on both a professional and individual level. I learned so much about animals, animal care, educating, and myself that I would rightfully call it a life changing experience. Joel and Ailigh are two very fantastic people who are making a difference in this world and deserve all of the support that they have given and spread out into this world.

With wild animals, you never know what might happen and that makes each experience that much more memorable.  The staff and volunteers are extremely knowledgable and dedicated, both to the welfare of all wild and domestic animal life.  They even know how to handle the human animals as well.   :-)  Everyone should take this opportunity to visit an Animalia event.  You may never get this close to a wild animal ever again.  You won't be disappointed.  Grade = A++

He had them up moving and acting out different animal behaviors and traits.  The best part was the parents and other adults that were there took time to tell us how much they enjoyed the show and what they learned.  It was wonderful to have them.     We have also been to several of Animalia's public shows from PBS Kids in the Park, to the Children's Museum, to library events.  They bring the same fun and learning to all their shows that they brought to our boys' party.  We try and catch any shows we can as we always learn something.

I then adopted a cat who is also the love of my life then I adopted a Collie mix.  These 2 I adopted 3 years ago and they are best of friends.  This place cares, truly cares!

I can't believe how dedicated the volunteers are to their duties.  Walking the Dogs in the rain and snow can't be too much fun but you would never know it by watching them and even talking with them.  I routinely drop off my newspapers and shredding once a week along with plastic grocery bags that they use to pick up after the dogs.Their resale shop is an especially nice place to check out.  I find the donations they receive to be of a much high quality than I first expected.I just wish more people in the community would at least take the time to bring their newspapers over to the containers.  It takes no time at all if you are out and about.  This facility is a no-kill shelter and needs all the help our community could provide.  Humane Society-Calumet Area Inc truly cares about the animals.

They offer services that include canine training as well as human training for the first time dog owner. People are encouraged to come to the cattery and relax while reading to a cat or just cuddling with a feline friend. Fundraisers are held to support the shelter while bringing people together to share ideas and information regarding rescue, adoption and care. I could go on but I think that all of the work that HSCA does is designed to support every aspect of an animal's well being....and they do it with love and compassion.

They go above and beyond to help animals get adopted and make sure they go to good homes. Now that I live on my own and ha e my own house I wanted to get my own pet. Normally they want you to be 21 to adopt cuz most people at 18 still live at home and aren't stable enough to keep a dog. Me being 19 at the time, I was sad I couldn't adopt but I went in anyway and cell in love with the dog I have now. They worked with me and let me adopt after proving I had my own house and what not. They didn't just give me a dog they gave me a best friend. I was at a low point before I got her and bcuz of them I'm beyond happy. My dog has an amazing home and amazing family now. The people that work there are some of the few good people left in the world. Come to work, don't get paid and they take money out of their own pockets to help support the animals there. 10000000 thank yous, to you guys. Keep up the good work.

Humane Society-Calumet Area Inc	209838		/users/profile/272584	Timber	Board Member	5	08/09/2014	I have been with the Humane Society Calumet Area for 20- years.  When I started working with them the building on Columbia Avenue in Hammond was barely standing.  There was room for very few dogs and even fewer cats.  The miracle which has been created at HSCA today is almost unbelievable.  There have been times when there has been as many as 450 animals housed in the facility on 45th Avenue in Munster.  Each and every animal is tested, treated, fed and given loving care until they can find their "forever home".  This is due to an amazing staff, employees, outstanding volunteers and donors.  The volunteers at HSCA are the most dedicated, hard working, patience, loving people you will ever find.  The most important people who keep the shelter going are the donors and the volunteers.  Without those two groups of people, the advancements of adding an Intake Center, then a clinic, PAWS move to bigger quarters, then joining in with other rescue groups to aid in animal welfare across the region would not have been possible.  I feel HSCA is and will continue to be at the forefront of animal care in the Calumet Area for years to come.

I didn't feel comfortable with any of the other shelters, and didn't feel like they actually cared about matching me up with an appropriate dog. After looking through and finding the dog I wanted, they worked with me to make sure she was right for me and I was right for her. I could tell they really cared about not only me, but the forever-home that the dog would end up with. I would recommend them to anyone else, as I have had such a great experience and ever since I adopted my dog in 2008, she has been my best furry friend since. Thank you Humane Society Calumet!

I currently work with our Humane Education Program which was established to teach the children of our area (through schools, scout troops and Critter Camp) the humane treatment of all animals.  Through this program, children not only learn about humane treatment of animals but, also, humane treatment of each other.  HSCA values every animal life.  I work with the foster program caring for special-needs animals.  My experience  has shown me that the medical staff gives each of these dogs or cats the specialized care they need  so that each of them can reach their full potential.  There are no animals that leave HSCA not feeling loved and well cared for.  The staff and volunteers are a team with the goal of making the shelter experience for each animal a positive one.  I am very proud to be associated with the HSCA family.

They made the process easy to understand, supported my daughter throughout the process. And continues to offer exceptional service to us.  I am a birth grandmother, and what I thought would be one of the most difficult things of our life, has turned into one of the most beautiful through open adoption. And if we ever have trouble navigating, Meg is always there to help if needed. I would highly recommend Adoptions of Indiana  
AD-IN INC,  Adoptions of Indiana	317329	1	/users/profile/408502	StephanieW	Client Served	5	10/31/2016	My husband and I were led to adoption to grow our family.  Finding adoption professionals to work with that we trusted were doing the right thing for all people that would be involved in our adoption process proved more difficult for us than expected.  We wanted our adoption to be child-centered, and we also wanted to ensure that an expectant mother was receiving education and counselling before, during, and after the adoption.  We wanted so much care and kindness shown to her.  We as adoptive parents also wanted someone we could lean on to help us become educated on open adoption and stay with us as we navigated open adoption in the future.  We had almost given up finding this with an adoption agency or attorney, and then we met with Adoptions of Indiana.  We knew nearly immediately we were right where we were supposed to be!  Although ultimately Adoptions of Indiana did not match us to an expectant mom because of their encouragement for us to do our own networking, in their words, we are still a part of their family.  And the three ladies that had worked with us on education and our home study were there the day we finalized our son's adoption six months ago.   I have already reached out to Adoptions of Indiana several times with questions about how to, in a child-centered way, handle different aspects of our particular open adoption.  They are always a phone call away and have extended their services to our son's birth mom even though she did not work with them before the adoption because of the circumstances.  They have helped guide us to solutions that are generous and compassionate.  They welcomed us with open arms to their "In It For The Long Run" 5k event for families, which was wonderful.  It was amazing that they worked so hard to bring families together that shared adoption as part of how they were formed - the event was so fun and family friendly.   Adoption can be complicated and there are many elements and emotions that span lifetimes.  I feel so confident, however, having the Adoptions of Indiana team to help guide our family through our open adoption as our son grows.  They set the tone through the thoroughness of their home study and education, and then they continually deliver services to all whose lives are touched by adoption. Adoptions of Indiana changed our lives!  I do not know that we would have had the courage to proceed with adoption without them because we fully realized the magnitude of adoption and the impact on the lives that would be a part of our adoption.  And we are so grateful for their continual presence in our lives.

All these things, and too many others to name, encompass Adoptions of Indiana and its staff. My husband and I are in the last states of adoption (our little one will be here any day) and we couldn't fathom using any other agency in the state or country. Meg and her team are A-Class, extremely involved in each of their cases. And often, the team is involved and sincerely interested in those that aren't their assigned clients. AOI embodies servitude and phenomenal stewards of love and concern. We interviewed 6 agencies, and we knew after 5 minutes into our meeting with Amy that this was the agency for us. The very first thing we remember is walking into AOI and being greeted by the Executive Director, Meg. That is unheard of and she didn't just greet us, she was immediately vested in us and our potential journey. How could we not feel welcomed. We left AOI from our initial meeting and felt like we were "home." Two days later, we submitted our application. Thank you AOI - thank you for changing lives of children and families.

The team at Adoptions of Indiana immediately put me at ease & made me feel like family. The moment I walked in the door I knew I could ask any question that came to mind & they would help me find my answer without judgement. The workshops provided clear information & opportunity to talk with adoptive families and birth parents. That training made a big difference when I began talking with an expectant mother about our shared hopes for her baby's future. We have a beautiful relationship because of the support of Adoptions of Indiana.The support that Adoptions of Indiana provides to birth families is fantastic.

We met with other agencies and were left overwhelmed and lost.  After our first meeting with Adoptions of Indiana, we began to feel excited about the journey and finally had hope.  They have always told us what we needed to hear, even if it wasn't what we wanted to hear, and gave us the tools we needed to navigate and cope with each situation we encountered.  We didn't have an easy journey, but we can't imagine going through the process without Allison, Amy and Meg being there for us every step of the way.

Of all those we spoke too, Adoptions of Indiana was clearly the best choice for our family. They were completely honest about what the process was going to look like and didn't sugar coat the fact that it would take time and could be messy. They did do everything they could to prepare us for what we were going to experience both during our adoption and as adoptive parents. The education they offered truly made us more equipped to be parents. On top of that the counseling they offer prospective birth mothers helped us feel that the women we would be dealing with truly knew what they were getting in to.  We waited almost two years before bringing our daughter home, but Adoptions of Indiana was with us every step of the way. They were extremely understanding of our frustrations and always willing to listen. When the time came for us to meet our daughter (with only 12 hours notice) they went above and beyond to be there with us and coach us through everything. I honestly don't think we could have done it without them. Now it makes me feel good to know that our daughter's birth mother is still able to get the counseling she needs to help her adjust to the choice that she made. We are so happy with the service Adoptions of Indiana provided for us and can't recommend them enough.

I couldn't have picked a better group of people to help me along my way. Meg Sterchi is extremely dedicated and loving to everyone she comes in contact with. She always went above and beyond to make sure I understand my rights as a birthmom. The best part is, after placement, the relationship doesn't end. Adoption through AOI is not a business transaction at all. It is the beginning of a whole new chapter in life. As difficult and painful as adoption can be, I couldn't have made the best choices possible without someone making sure I understood everything. From deciding adoption was best, to finding and meeting my son's parents, to the moment I gave birth, Meg was the strongest support system for me and held my hand so to say all along the way. I know I can always get hold of her if and when I need and she will be there to listen and offer advice now just as she did when I found AOI and was researching my options.  Overall, I can't honestly rate how gentle and loving Adoptions of Indiana is but I can say I was extremely blessed to have found them and I couldn't have done it any other way.

Meg knew me as an infant, and I even knew her children growing up. When I found myself facing an unplanned pregnancy in 2013, Meg lovingly welcomed me into her office with open arms for counseling and support.  Throughout my pregnancy, I experienced a nonjudgmental atmosphere at Adoptions of Indiana that truly fostered my freedom to choose whether or not I wanted to parent or go through with my adoption plan. Meg was extremely knowledgeable, which was a very comforting aspect. I ultimately went through with my adoption plan, and I actually chose a family who completed their adoption training classes through Adoptions of Indiana. When I was in labor, Meg came to the hospital to visit me, and she was there for support afterward, as well. I still attend counseling sessions with Meg periodically, which are free of charge to me as a birth mother, and I also attend other birth mother events that Adoptions of Indiana so graciously puts on. I am so grateful to Meg and all of the staff at AOI for giving me such a wonderful experience, both during my pregnancy and post-adoption. They all genuinely care 100% for every single client they have, and their passion for adoption is clearly visible. I am so grateful to be a birth mother who was blessed to work with Adoptions of Indiana, and I highly recommend their services to any prospective adoptive parents or to those who are experiencing unplanned pregnancies. I didnt feel like I was just one of their clients, but rather I felt as if I was a woman whose needs were cared about every step of the way. I felt like a friend.

I was 15 years old and experiencing an unplanned pregnancy. When I first met her, I had not yet made my decision on if I would keep my baby or make an adoption plan. Meg was very kind and supportive throughout the process of my decision making. I did decide on an adoption plan and she has been there every step of the way for me. From the first time I called my birth child's future adoptive parents letting them know I had "chosen" them, to meeting my birth daughter for the first time after she turned 18, Meg has been there for me. I have always felt supported by her. A few times over the years when communication was lacking, Meg knew just the right way to intervene to get things back on track with my child's adoptive family. I have always appreciated the respect she showed me even when I was a scared, pregnant 15 year old.  I can't imagine going through the adoption process without Adoptions of Indiana.

From the first call, Jennifer Morrissey, was so patient and helpful, answering our multitude of questions. We were in unfamiliar waters and Adoptions of Indiana helped us navigate our way through it. From selecting our International agency to being a liaison between that agency and us, we felt cared for at every step. Our home studies were relaxed and helpful and the required classes contained a wealth of information, as well as available experts in the field of adoption. We met others through our classes that were also adopting- and have since formed relationships with others who have adopted through Adoptions of Indiana and Ethiopia. There is great support after the process is complete, as well. I absolutely recommend Adoptions of Indiana to anyone seeking an agency with big resources, but a small family-like feel!
AD-IN INC,  Adoptions of Indiana	220558	2	/users/profile/284222	JamieSM	Client Served	5	10/07/2014	Our family cannot say enough about Adoptions of Indiana (AOI).  We have worked with them for all three of our adoptions, both International and domestic.  We came across them back in 2010 when we started the process of adopting from India.  We were working with an agency in Texas for the adoption but needed to find a local agency that could do our homestudy, was Hague accredited, and could work with us after the adoption for all of the post placement requirements that India has.  Adoptions of Indiana was so easy to work with.  They jumped right in, assigned us a social worker, got us all the information that we needed to start working on and called our TX adoption agency to make sure everyone was on the same page.  International adoption is never a short process but we had wonderful support from AOI the entire time while we waited for our daughter to come home. A year or so later, we wanted to give our daughter a sibling and decided to do a domestic adoption.  We looked into some programs and decided to go with a partner agency to the International agency we'd used before in Texas.  Once again, we called AOI and started the paperwork!  Long story short, the domestic agency we were signed up with in Texas didn't end up working out for us so when I contacted our social worker at AOI to see what our options were, she let me know that their domestic program had been launched and we were welcome to sign up with them.  We thought and thought and after many months we decided to make the switch.  We ended up getting matched to a wonderful young couple and brought home our baby boy a couple of months later. We were lucky enough to be matched to a couple that we have an open adoption with and are blessed to have in our lives and our children's lives.  Unexpectedly, 9 months after the birth of our son, I received a call from AOI.  Our son's biological parents were pregnant again and wanted us to adopt their child ... our son's full biological sibling ... that was due in 2 months!!!  We thought about it and prayed about it and brought home another son 2 months later.  Without the support and love and dedication from the staff of AOI none of this would have been possible.  I cannot say enough about them.  They care about the clients.  They care about the birthparents.  They care about the children.  You are not a nameless being to them or a fee or a client.  You are part of their family and you feel it the second you walk through their doors or speak to them on the phone for the first time.  They are absolutely wonderful to work with!

Our social worker helped us understand the process, and was a perfect fit for our family's personality.  Pre- and post-adoption, Adoptions of Indiana was always there to give direction and ask questions, no matter how big or small.  When we decided to adopt from Ethiopia again, we couldn't imagine working with another agency.  We were very relieved that our current process's homestudy could also be served by Adoptions of Indiana.  They have a wealth of resources available, know their stuff, are very on top of time frames, and are quickly responsive to any needs that come up.   We feel our social worker and Adoptions of Indiana is a very important part of our family, not just another agency.

AD-IN INC,  Adoptions of Indiana	220410	2	/users/profile/284059	Frank41	Client Served	5	10/06/2014	Our daughter Lauren turned 15 months old just a few days ago and I thought I would take a few minutes to thank Adoptions of Indiana for not only making our family possible, but for standing with us for both the good and not so good parts of our adoption journey.    My partner Andy and I had to live through the pain of an adoption that we were not able to finalize and ended up having to give up our child that we had cared for, for over a month.    They were there with us when we needed them.  A few short months later Adoptions of Indiana matched us with a wonderful couple and that was the beginning of our adoption journey leading us to our beautiful daughter Lauren Elizabeth.     When we first started our adoption journey I wondered, like many, why the cost was so high to adopt a a baby.   It was during this time that I realized just how much was involved in an adoption.   The A of I team was focused not just on us, but on the well being of both the birth parents and the unborn child that would become our daughter.   It was after this experience that I never again complained about the cost of adoption... it has been worth every penny.  In fact the love and care of the Adoption's of Indiana crew is priceless!     Love,Frank and Andy

We truly felt the women at this agency truly cared for everyone involved in an adoption plan. We felt like they would be a resource for us long after the adoption took place. Their adoption classes are amazing and gave us extensive resources and information on adoptive parenting. They make you feel very comfortable and work with you on any questions you may have throughout the process. My husband and I became pregnant unexpectedly and have put our adoption plans on hold for now, but we still stay in contact with our Adoptions of Indiana family and we recommend them to anyone we know thinking about adoption. They are a huge blessing to us.

They have been wonderful working with us and they are super flexible. After working with other adoption agencies and organizations we have found that Adoptions of Indiana truly care about the children and also us! It's remarkable how blessed we feel to have found them. They are personable and professional and this is not easy to find  these days. The staff has been great. We have worked with Meg, Julie, and Jennifer. Al three are wonderful. We have had so many ups and downs in our adoption process and every time we felt like giving up we find AOI to be there supporting us and willing to go the extra mile with whatever we need. Jennifer has constantly been available to us and she is so quick to respond to our emails(we live overseas) and she is so knowledgable and experienced that we can rest easy knowing she is working on our behalf. Meg has been so flexible in working with us and even when she is busy as director she has taken time to help us on a personal level. We would recommend AOI hands down to anyone who asks. Thank you AOI for caring about us and our family and working with us in our unique situation! We truly love AOI:-)

Their incredible staff really care about adoptive families and women who are considering an adoption plan.  They offer counseling for birth mothers before and long after birth.  There are certainly many ways to make an adoption match but my wife and I felt like AOI provided more care and compassion to us and the birth mother/family than any other organization would have offered. My wife and I didn't feel like a number when working with them.  Prospective adoptive families who are looking for an organization to help them with an adoption match should consult Adoptions of Indiana.  Thank uou Meg, Amy, and Jennifer

We chose adoption for our daughter, and it was a difficult situation. They trained the parents we chose to adopt her, so we all had a very smooth and comfortable transition. They were willing to drive to our side of town to meet with us for counseling, which helped more than I could ever express. They offer a support group, they do events around holidays to help us heal and they are the least judging people I have ever met. They are a sweet and caring group who go above and beyond to help families who chose adoption. I would definitely recommend them to anyone who chooses adoption!

AD-IN INC,  Adoptions of Indiana	125545		/users/profile/170756	MaggyK	Client Served	5	10/15/2012	I encountered Adoptions of Indiana as a birth mother. They did a fantastic job of helping me come up with my adoption plan without being heavy handed or trying to push me in a certain direction - supportive rather than directive. The pre-birth counseling was done in such a way that I could have determined that adoption was not my best option - I wasn't just being helped to live with a decision that was what others wanted for me. Follow up counseling and support groups  were also great. I loved having the opportunity to sit on a panel for a nursing in-service to help obstetrics nurses understand how to be more sensitive with their birth mother patients. Overall the spirit of the organization is to make sure all 3 parties (birth parents, adoptive parents, and infants) have the best possible outcome.

After a few weeks of attending a few events I was not too impressed, seems that most of the Statewide stuff are either orchestrated by the outdated motorcycle rights group and the local rides by some clothing stores and vendors. A total let down in my book. But lo and behold, I stumbled across an event site that featured cool bike rides and get this, they were riding choppers! I noticed at the bottom of their page that all proceeds are donated to a group called Bikersinc.org so I went there and here I am. I have found a new group of friends, choppers come and go, and they have cool bike nights where they show classic movies. I even volunteered for events now and then. They totally get 5 stars. 
Bikersinc	287187	38	/users/profile/377272	Writer	Client Served	5	04/24/2016	As a lifelong rider, I have been involved with my share of bikers groups, this one is hands the best I have seen. They really care for the people they encounter on a daily basis. They get my good review.  
Bikersinc	287185	38	/users/profile/377269	Writer	Client Served	5	04/24/2016	What a fun and wonderful organization for bikers, we need more like this.  
Bikersinc	287122	40	/users/profile/377198	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	04/23/2016	I was fed up with the other biker groups so I went to see what these bikersinc riders were all about. After spending some time at a cookout they had, I rode away very impressed. Good group of riders so far. 
Bikersinc	287121	40	/users/profile/377197	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	04/23/2016	I am very impressed by everyone I met associated with bikersinc, great job guys!! 
Bikersinc	265864	48	/users/profile/354589	Melissa_25,	Board Member	5	10/20/2015	Since moving back to Indiana from Florida a few years ago for a career change, I soon realized that I missed all the motorcycle events back in Florida and sought out a few here. Times certainly do change and the motorcycle rights organization that I loved for so many years  changed too. I stumbled onto Bikersinc at an event, met the Director, Secretary and a few volunteers and I have been hooked ever since. I attended lots of meetings, helped with program ideas and literately fell in love with this organization and the people are real. I took a leap of faith and became a board member in 2015 and I am glad I did. 
Bikersinc	287120	40	/users/profile/377196	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	04/23/2016	Great group of people, anybody who rides motorcycles should be involved with the bikersinc.  
Bikersinc	287093	40	/users/profile/377171	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/22/2016	Great organization, would highly recommend bikersinc to everyone. 
Bikersinc	287092	40	/users/profile/377170	Writer	Volunteer	5	04/22/2016	I have donated both money and time to this organization. It is comprised of some of the finest people who are truly dedicated to making a difference. Most people think of bikers  just as  2nd class citizens but it is not the case here. The people I see volunteering  for this organization make me realize more and more that this is one of the best ways I can invest my time and money. It is put to good use and is greatly appreciated. I would also like to add I have recently bought a motorcycle and I am very appreciative for all the experiences and knowledge I gained. THAT is why I continue to give back to Bikersinc Incorporated. 
Bikersinc	287091	40	/users/profile/377169	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	I continue to be amazed by the ways in which Bikersinc show a positive image in our neighborhood. When they moved in, many people did not know what to think with all the all motorcycles coming and going. But in just a few short weeks they have won over our neck of the woods. The building is kept nice, they have helped a couple of my neighbors do job searches and more.  I hope they stay around here for a long time. 
Bikersinc	287090	40	/users/profile/377168	Writer	Volunteer	5	04/22/2016	I LOVE working with Bikersinc and their crew of volunteers. Having worked with  other organizations like goodwill and some of the bigger ones, it is refreshing to find a group so passionate about their cause. Bikersinc to me is now like another family.  
Bikersinc	287089	40	/users/profile/377167	Writer	Client Served	5	04/22/2016	I found them on a facebook and sent them an email about my husband need some medical care and the va would not help. They contacted some local veterans group and within a few hours our phone was ringing with offers of help. Thanks to bikersinc. 
Bikersinc	284861	40	/users/profile/351546	Navy Vet	Volunteer	5	04/06/2016	Since I have been involved with Bikersinc, I have relocated closer to their headquarters just so I can be more reachable. I was once active in a much larger National Veterans organization but since I came here, seen the work that they do I have become a full time volunteer and cut all ties with the other. The leader is a Navy Vet like myself and we both ride motorcycles to several events. Do I like it it here? What do you think?  
Bikersinc	262852	40	/users/profile/351546	Navy Vet	Volunteer	5	10/10/2015	As a Veteran myself, I was impressed that this organization is ran by a fellow Navy Veteran. The "Bikers Helping Veterans" program is really good. I am now directly involved with helping other Veterans with housing. 
Bikersinc	284788	40	/users/profile/351658	BikerBob	Volunteer	5	04/05/2016	Everyone calls me Biker Bob and I am back with another great review of this amazing organization that I am proud to be a part off. This group is bar none the best group of people I have ever encountered. JD, the director is a person that has solidly earned my respect as he has pretty much turned Bikersinc into what it is today. If you are looking for a motorcycle orientated place to worship then stop by the Biker Church, you will not be disappointed. Biker Bob   
Bikersinc	262963	45	/users/profile/351658	BikerBob	Volunteer	5	10/11/2015	Having been involved with other motorcycle related nonprofits in Indiana in one capacity or other I was curious how this one was any different when I stumbled across their website. Fast forward a few months, I met a few folks from bikersinc at a motorcycle event and I was blown away, the director rides a Harley chopper. After shooting the breeze for about an 20 minutes I mentioned that I am an ordained minister, they asked me to if I was interested in volunteering. Long story - short. Be sure and stop by and visit our bikers outreach, jeans, leathers and tattoos welcome. Biker Bob 
Bikersinc	264869	40	/users/profile/353594	Writer	Donor	5	10/17/2015	This is an excellent organization and they have a really high profile in the local motorcycling community. Keep up the good work.

Bikersinc	264308	40	/users/profile/353023	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/15/2015	I've donated clothing and money, in the past, to Bikersinc for their Indiana Youth Works. But, after attending a fantastic meeting last spring, I decided to donate time, as well. The staff is very gifted, recognizing the stress so many youths experience being out on the streets. As a mom (and one that has my own personal story), I appreciate what they have accomplished and will continue to support this great organization! 
Bikersinc	262595	41	/users/profile/351275	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	10/08/2015	Having met and spoken 1 on 1 with several of their volunteers at a recent event, I was VERY impressed with this organization and the work they are doing. 
Bikersinc	261897	40	/users/profile/350541	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/06/2015	I like what they do to support our Veterans. Proud to be a volunteer for this great group!
Bikersinc	261892	42	/users/profile/350536	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/06/2015	A great organization and they consistently develop new programs as the needs arise. Nothing is wasted with this organization's use of funds.

They are currently under multiple state and federal investigations at this time.  Please be careful in uploading your documentation to this organization-not only is it not necessary, it is being uploaded to an unsecure site that is shared with their children and game devices.Also see this site for an interview with another of their former admins and combat veteran--http://www.breachbangclear.com/combat-vet-yard-signs-follow-up/
Military with PTSD Inc.	224064	13	/users/profile/287817	armywife	General Member of the Public	1	10/18/2014	I have followed this page for a few years and questioned some of their tactics regarding their status and categorizing themselves as mental health and counseling.  I am glad to see that all of this is finally coming out.  IRS fraud-making fake profiles-fake suicide attempts by those accounts are just a few other issues.  I pray that no other veteran will be scammed by this organization.

On one hand I want them shut down NOW to stop the horrible damage they are inflicting.  Then on the other hand I want them to continue in order to gather as much evidence as possible.  They are in scramble mode right now .
Military with PTSD Inc.	232818	7	/users/profile/296423	WorriedVet	General Member of the Public	1	11/04/2014	This non-profit is a scam and a danger to veterans. They 'help' only those they want too, and have purposely induced, severe PTSD responses from myself and possibly others. I am scared to think of how their actions have affected many veterans on the verge of suicide. I am full belief that this site should be taken down a charges filed against the owners.
Military with PTSD Inc.	232722	9	/users/profile/296293	Maria121	Professional with expertise in this field	1	11/03/2014	I would have given 0 stars if allowed. I warn anyone who has dealing with the administrators of this organization. The owner is constantly asking for donations or money from Veterans with promises to provide them with a service, and the service never happens. This organization has done nothing for Veterans, but steal their money. There is not one action this organization can prove they have accomplished anything towards helping Veterans, but to manipulate them or their families. There is factual paperwork proof of their scams though. Please beware and stay away from this organization and Facebook page. 
Military with PTSD Inc.	232613	17	/users/profile/296162	SmithP_LFT	Professional with expertise in this field	1	11/02/2014	I am an actual licensed therapist who works with PTSD every day.  I am not only angry about the information that they have had revealed, buy I am concerned about the danger this organization poses to Veterans with PTSD.  So many take their lives while battling PTSD, and the leaders of this group rroutinely get into fights and cause nore problems for Veyerans seeking them out for help.  It would be no suprise to learn that this group helped to contribute to a situtation that led to a suicide. This group turns away help offered by professionals, yet lists their site as a "Mental Health" facility.  This needs to be shut down and charges filled against their leaders.

Military with PTSD Inc.	226848		/users/profile/290582	Curtis F.	Board Member	5	10/26/2014	I learned about MWPTSD through a friend who was publishing The War At Home for the founders.  I read the book and knew they had first-hand experience living through life with PTSD.  Their compassion, capacity for observing what is going on around them, and their blunt self-awareness were clearly what our culture needs to deal with the PTSD epidemic that has been created.  I have watched them reach out to a collective that is, by design, paranoid and terrified, and sadly with very good reason.  The courage that I have seen in their determination to help and to stay on the forefront of a compassionate challenge impresses me every day. As a Veteran who does not suffer PTSD, I have many friends and loved ones who do have PTSD, and I felt that being on the board of directors was one way I could help the next generation to move through this awful time in our history with hope. I believe in MWPTSD.  I believe in the people who founded MWPTSD.  I encourage you to read all the reviews here, and come see how it is run for yourself.  I am finding transparency and clarity to be key parts of the organization, and it is only through diligence on our part, and open-eyed participation on your part that MWPTSD can rise above a few paranoid and terrified people to serve our veterans.
Military with PTSD Inc.	224967	12	/users/profile/288612	GreenAndGold	General Member of the Public	1	10/22/2014	I joined MWPTSD in 2011, and within a year made a conscientious decision to discontinue accessing this group.   It became very evident that this site was a forum for the Gourleys to promote themselves and completely exaggerate their "expertise" on PTSD.  Granted, they ARE experts on PTSD in their own family, I give them that.  However their responses to members were often  very unprofessional, incredibly narrow-minded and opinionated, and they would often end up back-tracking to cover for ignorant responses by themselves or admins.   The constant self-promotion and over-the-top idolization of Ms. Gourley  was truly disturbing, and for me, discredited this group significantly.  I am not at all surprised to read (and believe) the well-researched allegations of fraud.  Spouses were often berated and told that they were "triggering" veterans.  I must ask the question, then:  while Ms. Gourley was fabricating fake member profiles, and fabricating suicide attempts so that she alone could race in and "save" yet another veteran's life, how many veteran's suffered increased symptoms of PTSD?  How many veterans did SHE trigger, simply in an attempt to build her own pedestal higher?  How can someone who professes to be about helping veterans play such a cruel and dangerous joke on them?  Please read all of the fake profiles and all of the evidence.   Make an informed decision to shut these destructive, power hungry people down.  We love our veterans!  We love military families!   None should be exposed to such con artists whose goals are glory, fame, and fortune at the expense of our veterans and active duty military, and the families who love them.    No, I'm not surprised at all.....

Military with PTSD Inc.	224285	13	/users/profile/288029	VeteranWarriors	Professional with expertise in this field	1	10/19/2014	Tampa, FL  One of the most difficult things veterans with PTS deal with is Trust. We struggle to trust even those who we care about. Learning to trust others takes enormous effort and timelots of time. For civilians, trusting people with your money is equally risky. When you choose to support charities, you do the research but in the end, it is the smell testthat good feeling you get when you believe you have made a good choice. When veterans are the focus of the charity, it is almost guaranteed that people will trust the charity ~ this can be beneficial to both the charity and the veterans they serve. It can be a recipe for disaster when the motives of the charity are self-serving. Less than a year ago, many will recall the actions of Bobby Thompson. Thompson was convicted Nov. 14 of racketeering, theft, money laundering and 12 counts of identity theft (he was) convicted of running a charity scam that stole millions of dollars intended for Navy veterans The outrage in the veteran community was palpable. Charities and veterans advocates across the nation suffered downturns in donations as a result. We all were a little more jaded and cautious when donating or offering assistance to Veterans in need. Several weeks ago, VeteranWarriors was contacted by an agent of a Federal law enforcement agency, investigating the actions of the leadership of a national non-profit organization called, Military with PTSD (MWPTSD). We cooperated with the agent, answered questions to the best of our ability and thought the matter was concluded. Shortly afterward, a Whistleblower (former employee of MWPTSD) contacted us as well. This person had worked for MWPTSD for 3  years and had accumulated a large body of evidence of fraud and unethical actions by the leadership of MWPTSD, in the name of wounded Veterans suffering from PTS and their families. We have been given copies of the evidence and have reviewed it carefully before making this decision. VeteranWarriors had a brief working relationship with the leaders of MWPTSD, solely for the purposes of an isolated project. These recent revelations have proven that to be ill-conceived.

Military with PTSD Inc.	224037	9	/users/profile/287789	Rmarie	Client Served	1	10/18/2014	This is a very obviously fraudulent organization. With evidence that has come to light, I have lost ALL faith in them. Just awful. 
Military with PTSD Inc.	224032	9	/users/profile/287784	Justagal1	General Member of the Public	1	10/18/2014	My experience with this organization started out very hopeful. I thought the Gourleys were "above board" and had a great mission. It has been devastating to me to realize that there are SO many misleading things going on with them. I am so upset about how all of this appears to be hurting the greater Wounded Veteran Community.
Military with PTSD Inc.	223573	7	/users/profile/287316	Earl Hayes	General Member of the Public	1	10/16/2014	I am personally Involved Directly in what happens at MWPTSD and I will stop at nothing to make sure they are 'EXPOSED" for the CROOKS they are. I operate an online Internet Radio Station in love and support for Our Hero's and it's 'CROOKS' like this that cause THE REAL DEAL like me and the radio to struggle. I never ever ask anyone for funds for any reason, as I do have a donate button on the radio website in plain view and I figure that if people want to donate, to help support the radio, they will on their own, No need for me to hound them to do so. MWPTSD, Instead if addressing a serious issue, that happened in plain view of everyone on that sight, Chose a side and defended that side, (Of which the 'F' Bomb for no reason was dropped upon me for no reason out of hate and anger). I did nothing to earn the 'F' bomb, and the ADMIN of the group, after I notified them about this happening in public in that group, came in and CHOSE THE SIDE OF THE PERSON THAT DROPPED THE 'F' BOMB. They refused to even begin to understand what the original issue was, THEY CHOSE A SIDE AND DEFENDED IT STILL TO THIS DAY..The Admin of the group SHAWN GOURLEY is not licensed to operate any type of group like this, and by the way my case was handled in the group, it clearly shows they are incapable of handling or helping anyone. YOU NEVER CHOOSE A SIDE. and that's exactly what happened. I have it all saved with dated screenshots.  >>>> MILITARY WITH PTSD - "Beware of This Group" !!  This is not me Just being upset with something and posting angryly here. As anyone can remember, I am Involved wirth the PAUL ANDREW REYES Case in Oregon, and I had made a 1 paragraph post in over 100 military groups on FACEBOOK for possible help and sharing of this information on Andrew. I had Posted 2 days in a row, (24 hrs between each post), and I got a VERY NASTY AND VIOLENT response from this MENTAL HEATH Group. I had contacted the OWNER of the Group, and this OWNER represented the PTSD MENTAL HEALTH GROUP in the most wrong fashion. "THIS PERSON TOOK A SIDE". In a PTSD mental Health Group, You NEVER PICK A SIDE !You hear BOTH SIDES and come up with a resolution that is acceptable by both, (ALL) parties involved. NEVER PICK A SIDE. >> I have since found out that this is BIGGER than I ever could've Imagined and I am PROUD & HONORED to be a part of the ONGOING, (Long before I ever got involved), investigations into this group. The OWNER/ FOUNDER of the Group IS NOT a Licensed Practitioner of ANY PTSD/ MENTAL HEALTH issues. The ONLY Ties this person has to know anything at all about what they are trying to provide help for, is that this person is MARRIED to a soldier/ Veteran who is claiming PTSD Due to the fact the Veteran was told to watch TRAINING VIDEO'S in Boot Camp and in Schooling after Boot Camp. This FOUNDER has Created several FAKE PROFILES, (Each of which claim to be a different veteran suffering from some sort of PTSD issue), and the utilize this as demonstrations as to how this "PTSD MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT GROUP" has helped save their life. It's the same person, One claiming to need serious help and the other is providing expert trained and educated care, and BOTH ARE FAKE !! We have the DOCUMENTED & SCREEN SHOTTED Proof, (Lot's Of Pics and Documents), and The people in Charge of this investigation have already, (Before I got Involved), contacted all the correct people and Organizations to have this group investigated By Professionals and they are in the middle of all this now.  >> This is very serious to not get involved with this group.  They are on FACEBOOK, LINKEDIN, & Other places on the net. They, (THE PTSD GROUP), are falsely representing and are also taking donations under a 501(c)(3) Registered Non-Profit Status. They are only using all this to "SELL A BOOK" That the Founder of the PTSD Group has written about PTSD, (Keeping in Mind the Founder is 'NOT" anything other than the "WIFE" Of a PTSD VET....NOTHING MORE). Please avoid this group.

Military with PTSD Inc.	221810	8	/users/profile/285505	TheWife	General Member of the Public	1	10/10/2014	When I joined this site a couple years ago I was chased off by Shawn's "clique" because I had opposing views at times and if I disagreed with Shawn ever (which, we've been living with PTSD and treatments longer than Shawn and her husband had so I felt my views and experiences were just as valid as hers), all of a sudden I had these same people jumping down my throat and even cussing at me!  I left.  Come to find out that those "friends" of hers that jump to back her up so brutally are possibly fake accounts that she has created.  Very disappointing.  Their initial behavior and attitude towards me wanting to help (if you're looking for help you're invited to the page but if you want to try and help others you're not welcome apparently) was unacceptable.  Wish I had kept proof back then of their ridiculous behaviors so I could help spare others from falling victim to their abuse, but I did not.  Use this group at your own risk.
Military with PTSD Inc.	219502		/users/profile/283109	Chrissy C.	Client Served	5	10/02/2014	When my husband was diagnosed with PTSD, I had no where to turn, no one to talk to for years. While researching a program, I stumbled across Military with PTSD. After doing some reading on them and reading the book written by the founders, I finally felt like I found a place my husband and I belonged. They have been tremendously supportive and kind in their email correspondence with me. They opened my eyes to a world that I thought I existed in alone. Thank you, Military with PTSD. Together, we can get through anything!
Military with PTSD Inc.	270302	3	/users/profile/359019	TL P.,	Board Member	5	10/31/2015	As a board member, I am in the unique position of helping shape and implement new programs, helping Shawn and Justin continue to help our veterans and their families, and making sure that everything we do is what is best and safest for our members. Being on-page with our members, I get to watch the thinking process, see knowledge being shared, see the written evidence that someone else found a suggestion intriguing enough to pursue, or hearing from someone who's already used that idea and used it successfully. The almost constant learning and education process we have on-page is different but effective. I'm so proud to be a part of Military with PTSD as both a board member and an admin. While we do have 'I'm human, I made a mistake' moments, like with our fireworks signs, we do our absolute best to learn everything we can from our successes and mistakes so that we can continue to grow and continue to make the best possible decisions in and for the future. 
Military with PTSD Inc.	219257	4	/users/profile/282885	Mdixon16	Volunteer	1	10/02/2014	It was brought to my attention that this organization has been committing fraud on numerous occasions in various ways. I took time to review all of the evidence presented to me regarding this fraud and concluded that I can no longer be a part of an organization that would do such a disservice to our wounded warriors and the veteran community as a whole. This organization appears to be about nothing more than self-promotion and self-interest. I can only hope that this organization does not cause any more harm to the veteran community and that no lives are lost due to their manipulation

As the head of a company that deals daily 24/7 with the PTSD community as well as with Vets, I can not say enough about the down to Earth, hands on effort this organization brings to the table. Few understand the life and challenges of those who walk the day to day issues involved with being a Vet with PTSD or their partner, that to include relationship focuses,  suicide realities,  or V.A/ accessing medical the way I've witnessed this Nonprofit bring real life tools & examples to those looking for help. They don't just talk the talk, they walk it out as practically and tangibly as anyone could ask for. We refer people to them constantly, and have staff who've turned to them for assistance as well.

I've seen the lenghth Shawn has went through helping veterans in need. She managed to make a page where Veterans can reach out instantly and help support each other.  she has stayed up nights on the phone with a veteran in crisis. With our Military suffering with PTSD  in the beginning had no where to turn.  VA didnt know how to help them,  Shawn stepped in on her own and made huge strides in bringing ptsd intothe public view, helping spouses, families they  learned thry are not alone in this. Saving families everyday. Let me say in closing, no one deserves this more . When you can say youve saved lives from suicide. That says it all.

I work for a VA and am a Veteran myself, I am able to get a "pulse" as to what is going on in the community.  I also comment personally the number to the Crisis line, it is on this site, having it given is a reminder that it is OK to get help.

Fountains of Hope International, Inc.	294438	4	/users/profile/385180	Sara142,	Volunteer	5	07/01/2016	I have been with Fountains of Hope to install purification systems in Haiti and Nepal after their earthquakes.  This being said, FoH is known for more than just leaving purifiers at sites and leaving.  Each site is chosen to be central to a large group of people in need; such as a hospital, orphanage, school, or church.  Their purifiers use a tablespoon of salt to separate the molecules Sodium from Chloride using electrolysis.  The chlorine can be used to purify large amounts of water at once, depending on the need of the community.  In both of my trips, fifty-gallon tanks are used to maximize the amount of water available, and the purifier itself is very lightweight and mobile in order to cleanse multiple tanks at once.  After installation of these tanks, leaders in the community or facility where the purifier is installed are trained extensively on knowledge to operate and maintain the devices in order to give them self-sufficiency and autonomy until the next time FoH can visit the country.Volunteers themselves are encouraged to bring in and implement their own knowledge and skill sets in order to give more to those who have been impacted by disaster or poverty.  While I've been on these two trips, I have had the opportunity (as an EMT who has studied physical medicine and mental health all my life) to give Health and Hygiene presentations to the people of Haiti and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder identification and treatment training to the people of Nepal immediately following their earthquake.  FoH has used their reach to touch thousands of lives already and makes the experience personal for everyone involved.

This is the second time I have had the chance to partner with FOH. The first was last year when they came up north to our mission and put in a water filtration system for the mission I work for to provide clean water to our facility. He also brought an OT Professor from ISU and a ST to serve alongside me for the week. It was a blessing to my therapy ministry to have them work alongside me. This past week I helped Bill lead a group of  ISU occupational therapy students on a service break trip in Port Au Prince, Haiti to help provide therapy to disabled children in 2 orphanages. They did evaluations and wrote educational and therapy plans for 1 orphanage that is opening a special education school and fixed/built equipment for positioning at another orphanage.  FOH allowed the group  to commute between the orphanages, as well as explore the culture and community in Haiti. FOH helped with all the logistics of travel. It was a great week and the team made a sustainable difference at both orphanages. While we worked in therapy world Bill the founder helped build tables and shelves for the special needs school and put in a water filtration system at a church.

This will provide clean water for the children as well as the families nearby.  We can not thank Fountains of Hope enough.  It is so important for the future of this community to have clean drinking water.  Some people have to travel long distances to get clean water so we feel very fortunate.

Bill was helpful and knowledgeable about the culture and area. The students had so much fun during the service trip, and accomplished a lot. My one criticism would be that not all students had tasks at every time, the project was too small for our group. We found other areas for them to help, but it took some rearranging and logistics. Overall, a rewarding experience.

The staff show a deep concern to positively impact the community in every way they possibly can.  The need is great but with the partnership between the community and the mission, amazing progress is being made. Over the course of five days, we managed to install two 500 gallon tanks and one 1,000 gallon water purifier at a new orphange.  The genuine love and concern for the community is demonstrated by the kids who rush to see staff and volunteers as they step outside the mission gates.  The community has been a great partner with the mission, many members of the community have worked by our side and would translate for us.  This program is a heart felt program that provides way more than it takes in. The need is very great, but the passion of the mission to serve the community is greater.

People always see pictures of Haiti on T.V and the news, but experiencing it first hand opens your eyes and really makes you think "OMG this is real". The people in Haiti really need help. Unlike the homeless people in the US, the homless people in the US the people in Haiti do not have homeless shelters if they have nothing they have nothng. What my group and I did was install a water purification system in an orphanage that will give the people in the village thousands of gallons of pure water for years to come. My group and I accomplished more than we thought we could. I learned how to use cool tools and I also got to get inside the water purifier. The experience that I got in Haiti was a unique and awesome experience that I got to make with awesome people. I know that I will never forget this tripand niether will the people that we helped.

While I've been on these two trips, I have had the opportunity (as an EMT who has studied physical medicine and mental health all my life) to give Health and Hygiene presentations to the people of Haiti and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder identification and treatment training to the people of Nepal immediately following their earthquake.  FoH has used their reach to touch thousands of lives already and makes the experience personal for everyone involved.

Fountains of Hope international gave me a water purifier last year, it was a big blessing for my community in Montrouis. Less people got sick from drinking bad water, I am actually an official. When I visit my home town, there used to be a lot of saying that they have diarrhea. But after having the water purifier installed there for them to use, they did not complain about diarrhea the way they used to complain. CELISSA DESROSIERS RN,BSN 
Fountains of Hope International, Inc.	197028		/users/profile/257551	jcarroll7	Client Served	5	04/03/2014	As a staff member of a mission Fountains of Hope has been invaluable.  They have provided several water purification tanks in our mission and the surrounding area.  As I, along with my wife and kids, have had the opportunity to help, we have seen the quality of the products first-hand.  I am always amazed at the extra time Bill spends teaching and educating whomever is around, whether how to use a simple tool or how electrolysis is used to convert table salt into chlorine, his goal is to educate. He always uses the best-available products.  He is also just a great guy.  I am so blessed that he is now a friend not only to me but my entire family.  My kids love this guy!  It has been such a blessing to work along side this ministry and look forward to partnering with them on many more systems to come.  Thank you Bill Farrar for the vision that God has given you to provide clean water for millions of people around the world.   
Fountains of Hope International, Inc.	197027		/users/profile/257550	jazzserrano	Volunteer	5	04/03/2014	I felt like I was running out of ideas on where/how to volunteer, when this opportunity came up. This service was one that I will definitely remember for the rest of my life. I came on this trip, not really knowing how things would happen, or what exactly would happen. However, once I got here it seemed like everything fell into place. Installing the water purification system was challenging at first because of certain tasks, but aside from that everything went well. Fountains of Hope made this trip to Haiti possible, and I really thank Bill Farrar for this. :)
Fountains of Hope International, Inc.	197026		/users/profile/257549	ahmadboatman	Volunteer	5	04/03/2014	One word for this trip is WOW! Fountains of hope is something I will remember for the rest of my life. I will remember this place because this was my first out of the country trip, I got to help/build, and I had a chance to be with a great leader ( Bill Farrar). With Bill he really was a good leader and he really made this trip great. I could not have asked for a better trip. With Bill he taught me so much in just one week. 
Fountains of Hope International, Inc.	197024		/users/profile/257547	nagarigari_phil	Volunteer	5	04/03/2014	Fountains of Hope really changed my perspective on what a glass of water means. Bill Farrar, our team leader helped us set up a 1000 gallon water tank on a roof , something that will help the people of the village for years to come. FoH has been an awesome experience and I really learned a lot through helping the people of Haiti and it changed my idea of the word "help".
Fountains of Hope International, Inc.	197023		/users/profile/257546	Fabio_P_Cruz	Volunteer	5	04/03/2014	This has been the most amazing experience of my life by far it is life changing it changes your life in so many ways it makes you think about what you got back at home and you might complain about the things you have, I have always thankful about what I have back at home but this trip made me want to show more on how I can be thankful about what I have this trip really makes me want to help my mother as best as I can because she this everything she can to give me all the things I need and she struggles so much to that, it made me more determine to be a nurse and to be a nurse not just in Chicago but places in need of medical care like Haiti because the children here need it you see children who have really bad wounds and they are really infected and they ask me look and it really hurts it hurts so much because I could not help them in that moment but I know I can in the future by becoming a nurse. This trip has change me it is and will be the best experience of my life it is life changing.
Fountains of Hope International, Inc.	165353		/users/profile/219804	Jessica_24	Donor	5	08/19/2013	I was actively researching nonprofits in order to find a cause that I felt compelled to donate to when I first discovered Fountains of Hope.  When I read about the work that Bill and FoH were accomplishing, it struck a chord.  Like most of us who are fortunate enough to have clean water at our disposal, I can't imagine a life where consuming water can actually cause more harm than good.  I love that the water purification systems are sustainable and provide for so many.  To me, they are like a gift that keeps on giving. I felt so inspired by the ministry that I sought Bill out and am happy to say that I've since joined the Fountains of Hope team, working in the office part-time to help where needed. As both an outside donor and inside member, I can confidently say that Fountains of Hope International is a worthy ministry investing in a worthy cause.
Fountains of Hope International, Inc.	165345		/users/profile/219794	Alora	Volunteer	5	08/19/2013	I recently began interning at Fountains of Hope and I am so glad that I did! Bill Farrar is a wonderful and engaging individual with tremendous passion for the ministry of serving God's people across the globe. He certainly implements fulfilling "Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven"! This ministry that God gave to Bill is an astounding creation--to meet the most basic needs of the poor is valuable indeed, but to stop and show compassion and understand that their parched hearts need nourishment is truly priceless. Bill has a kind heart overflowing with God's love toward everyone that he meets, and with a twinkle in his eye and a big smile on his face, it is easy to see how God uses him to bring more than safe water to those who need it. He is a vessel for Christ's Living Water, too, and watching Bill at his work in Fountains of Hope, one can never forget it. The chlorination system that cheaply purifies 55 gallons of water in a matter of minutes (!) is impressive to be sure, but the FoH stewards joining in alongside in relationship with the people even after returning to the States makes this even more a worthwhile ministry to be a part of. I look forward to being a servant alongside Bill and Fountains of Hope into the future. ~ Alora

I was part of the of team that helped to take safe water to communities in the poor urban (slum dwellers) and villigers in western kenya Kisumu. The people in these said areas have fo long been suffering fom water related problems. the testomonies clearly demonstrated the intensity of silent suffering that they undergo.  I want to confirm that FoHI has salvaged many people from death especially the children under five years of age. From the previous installations, I have tried to collect statistics on the differences realised before and after installations of the purification systems by FoHI. It is incredible! All those involved in the mision of FoHI, have done a commendable job.    Jared Ochwangi Motanya KENYA
Fountains of Hope International, Inc.	123435		/users/profile/168092	Jared Ochwangi Motanya	Volunteer	4	09/27/2012	One of my most memorable and powerful experience as a Kenyan National is when I got the solemn opportunity to accompany and lead the FoH Inc. in installing purifiers in Kisumu, a centre for the orphan and widows, in Neema (Grace) Children Home in Eldoret Kenya and in my Church , a poor Surabaya in Nairobi Kenya. The wonderful team of Bill, Brian, Ann and Allen did all these representing the many who joined hands in giving for the success. I want to confirm as a living testimony that the Kenyan fraternity served by FoH Inc. has been blessed. My the Good Lord Bless you all      (Jared Ochwangi Motanya- jadmot@yahoo.com)
Fountains of Hope International, Inc.	161077	1	/users/profile/213570	BPB1	Volunteer	5	06/20/2013	My son and I recently traveled with Bill Frarrar on a Fountains of Hope trip to Haiti to install and repair water purifications systems in remote areas.  My goals were to better the lives of people by helping Bill provide them clean water, show the Haitian people they were loved by us, share the love of God with them and spend time with my son.  All my goals were exceeded and I gained much more.  I havent had this much time with my son or had so many good conversations with him in years.  We prayed together each night about what we experienced during the day and I truly believe it brought us closer together and closer to God.  It made us understand the many gifts we have been provided and that we have a lot of opportunities to help others who are truly in need.  We witnessed people with more faith in and love for Christ than I have ever seen anywhere.  The people in Haiti we met in the churches and villages truly showed us more love and encouraged us more than we did them.  Bill made this trip incredibly enjoyable, safe and rewarding.  I would recommend the experience to anyone who wants to help others, share their love with others, understand how many people there are who are in desperate need of resources, and are looking for more meaning in their lives.

Fountains of Hope International, Inc.	294438	4	/users/profile/385180	Sara142,	Volunteer	5	07/01/2016	I have been with Fountains of Hope to install purification systems in Haiti and Nepal after their earthquakes.  This being said, FoH is known for more than just leaving purifiers at sites and leaving.  Each site is chosen to be central to a large group of people in need; such as a hospital, orphanage, school, or church.  Their purifiers use a tablespoon of salt to separate the molecules Sodium from Chloride using electrolysis.  The chlorine can be used to purify large amounts of water at once, depending on the need of the community.

What an amazing thing to bring pure water to the people of the La Digue community.  Bill, Founder of Fountains of Hope, is a wealth of knowledge and was so easy to work with.  He is very caring and has a tremendous passion for bringing pure water to least of these all over the world.  The system that we installed will provide about 3,000 gallons of water an hour!  Simply amazing.  River Oaks would highly recommend using Fountains of Hope and Bill Farrar to anyone interested in purifying water.  We definitely will be!

The vision and work of Fountains of Hope, to integrate and teach safe water solutions for the poorest and most marginalized people on earth, is saving peoples lives each and every day.  Bills involvement and willingness to travel the globe to personally address the world water crisis is a reflection of his deep love of humanity, his commitment to God, and helping others.

Fountains of Hope International, Inc.	143497		/users/profile/189955	grandmag	Volunteer	5	11/27/2012	I have been interested in Fountains of Hope ever since I first became aware of Bill F's organization.  He is so good with people, always working somewhere to help provide safe water.  Bill takes the time to know the people in the community, teaches responsible citizens how to care for the water system and then finds time to play and visit with the kids that are hanging around, interested and expectant.  It has been nice to see  his son/sons involved with this wonderful cause also.  My daughter lives in Indianapolis and has had contact with Bill and my grandson was with a Catholic group that visited Bill's Fountains of Hope display in Indy.  The world would be a better place with more people like Bill Farrar and his Fountains of Hope.  I follow all of Fountains of Hopes events on facebook, the computer and e-mail.  (I am becoming too advanced in years to add working with Bill's group to my endeavors but I do visit and help with a non-profit Christian school in Haiti yearly.)
Fountains of Hope International, Inc.	143234	1	/users/profile/189672	Ron D.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/27/2012	After the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, as a Disaster Assistance Response Team Leader, I had the privilege to partner with Fountains of Hope, Bill Farrar and his team, in serving the displaced.  One of the most crucial on-going physical needs of the people we encountered was for clean, safe water.  FOH offered well-concieved, consistently-executed solutions to the need, with flexibility for each installation site.  Bill's team was driven, in it's focus to provide workable, cost-effective solutions even in the most trying of circumstances -- when much of the infrastructure was in ruins and the social structure fractured.  His experience in crisis situations allowed Bill to plan which items to hand-carry into the country, which items to ship ahead, if possible, and which items to purchase locally (supporting the local economy.)  I was thoroughly impressed with their methods, professional drive and determination, but even more with Bill's personal desire to connect with the people, include them in the process, train them in the operation and maintenance of THEIR system and the personal follow-up he makes with each installation.  Fountains of Hope lives up to it's name and mission.  They are truly an example of effective humanitarian assistance, as it should be done.    
Fountains of Hope International, Inc.	143171		/users/profile/189599	juliana2	Board Member	5	11/27/2012	FOH goes above and beyond to "answer the call" for those in need of clean water. Bill Farrar takes a due diligence approach to insuring that each water project meets the guidelines for success. For FOH this organization is not just about the installation of purifiers, but more a ministry that is a reflection of the love first shown to us through Christ. To the team that make up the FOH organization, hats off for a job well done and much success in the years ahead.

This ministry is benefiting generations by bringing the Lords living water to so many around the globe.

I felt it was a gift from God to not only the people of Haiti but also to me. 'Fountains of Hope' is the Catalyst in which this blessing is delivered. Bill Farrar is one of God's deliverymen and has installed many of these systems across not only Haiti but across Africa, India and other countries.

Our team partnered with Bill and Fountains of Hope to drill wells and install water purifiers.  I experienced first hand the ongoing effort of Fountains of Hope to bring clean water to Haiti.  The effort was organized and implemented efficiently and effectively.  On a personal note, I was impressed with Bill's professionalism, compassion and dedication to the cause.  He was very understanding of the present needs of the country while thinking of future plans.  I observed his sensitive and encouraging attitude while interacting with both the missionaries and people of Haiti.

Last fall, I was able to bring a group from Dots in Blue Water and help Bill at the National Catholic Convention.  Bill is a great person to work with and he has a huge heart.

We installed a couple of the water purifiers in a rural northwestern village. I must say,  with no question, that this is an organization you want to work with. With a heart for all the people, work, and challenges we encountered, Bill showed my colleagues and I what it really meant to make a lasting impact by serving others. This organization is well organized, competent, and most importantly is out doing the work of providing clean water for those in need, with a passion that comes from the heart.

Volunteer	5	09/26/2012	One of the most insightful, powerful, and positive experience of my life was traveling with FOH to Haiti, with a group of 8 high school students. I feel that the work FOH does truly helps save lives, by empowering people and giving them the resource to provide life sustaining water to their community. There is so much injustice and economic disparity in the world, it is important that FOH and groups like it help educate the next generation to continue to reach out across boarders, to share resources and cultures. My students and I learned so much more from our experience in Haiti than we ever could have in a classroom. My students can now empathize with people around the globe, want to learn new languages, explain the process of chlorinization and how to assemble a water filtration system, as well as knowing more about themselves and how they can help others. Plus, Bill Farrar is an an amazing person to work with!
Obat Helpers Inc	239326	3	/users/profile/325075	adil93,	Volunteer	5	03/17/2015	When we first arrived in Bangladesh, we visited a camp in Adamjee where OBAT has not yet done any work. I was extremely disheartened to see the state in which people were living. Seeing all this made me feel overwhelmed, the situation was so bad and I felt as if it would be impossible to help resolve such an extreme situation. But in the following days, we visited other camps in the area where OBAT has helped establish schools, vocational centers, clinics as well as access to clean water and proper sewage systems. The difference was extremely motivating. Despite still living in these difficult conditions, the children in particular showed a huge amount of promise. Being able to attend proper schools will not only allow them to get educated and find good jobs, but also brings about a very important change in attitude. They are taking on initiatives to clean up their camps and help those who are even less fortunate than them. They are becoming better integrated into the greater society and will not allow themselves to be marginalized and live in these conditions for much longer. All of this made me realize that no matter how small of an effort we make, it can make an incredible difference in peoples lives. Despite the short amount of time and limited resources, the effect of OBAT's efforts is apparent and will change the generations to come. We heard many stories from orphans and widows that made me feel truly grateful for what we have been blessed with here in Canada. As difficult as it was to hear some of these heart wrenching cases, it was also amazing to see the resolve and determination of these people. Despite all that they have faced, they still have a positive outlook on life and are extremely thankful to those who are trying to help them.  We met a successful local businessman who is also very involved in philanthropic activities, and he said something that has stuck with me: Helping others with the excess wealth that we have been blessed with should not be considered charity - it is our obligation. Those less fortunate than us are entitled to this wealth more than we are.  I was extremely impressed with the work that OBAT has done, and would like to thank Anwar Uncle and the entire OBAT team for their tremendous efforts.

Professor John Clark, Saima Hassan and the Obat folks began publicizing the plight of Muslim on Muslim violence in Bangladesh and suddenly, wham!, Bangladesh was in the news for gruesome machete attacks by one outlying Mulslim groups against blogging Muslims,  secular Muslims and marginalized Muslims and basically any differing Muslims.  Obat not only predicted this type of violence and this type of victim, but was already in Bangladesh trying to alleviate it. Bravo!

This experience gave me valuable insight into the situation of stranded Pakistanis in Bangladesh. The mission of OBAT is pure in heart and their impact in the camps is measurable. With the efforts of OBAT and its donors, the camp dwellers should reach self - sufficiency within the upcoming decade. OBAT not only benefits the community as a whole, but has initiatives directed at empowering women and engaging youth. They created OBAT Media Productions, a project ran by youths living in the camps, as well as Think Tank in which camp youth take responsibility for improving their communities. OBAT and its staff are highly competent and trustworthy and are making a remarkable difference in the lives of many.

Recently they arranged a seminar in Dallas in which a few other distinguished US citizens like Dr. John Clark and Dr. Maureen Lynch, Dr. Pail and Dr. Ayaz Malik gave an eye witness account of their visit to the camps in Bangladesh. They all confirmed that OBAT helpers are doing an extraordinary job for the welfare of people in the camps.

The staff is effective and easy to communicate with regarding any questions or concerns. Happy to have been a volunteer!

The initiatives that they have started to empower the people in the camps have made a tremendous difference in many lives and will continue to do so in the future.

Volunteer	5	05/15/2016	OBAT Helpers takes a uniquely innovative path to addressing the marginalized Urdu-speaking population living in Bangladesh. Deeply introspective, OBAT internally addresses the needs of this population in order to reestablish the basic necessities. Looking forward to see this population flourish and to see OBAT grow as an organization. Keep up the good work!

What was most impressive for me was how OBAT Helpers took advantage of opportunities as they arose, making sure every resource was used to its maximum benefit. 
Obat Helpers Inc	239326	3	/users/profile/325075	adil93,	Volunteer	5	03/17/2015	When we first arrived in Bangladesh, we visited a camp in Adamjee where OBAT has not yet done any work. I was extremely disheartened to see the state in which people were living. Seeing all this made me feel overwhelmed, the situation was so bad and I felt as if it would be impossible to help resolve such an extreme situation. But in the following days, we visited other camps in the area where OBAT has helped establish schools, vocational centers, clinics as well as access to clean water and proper sewage systems. The difference was extremely motivating. Despite still living in these difficult conditions, the children in particular showed a huge amount of promise. Being able to attend proper schools will not only allow them to get educated and find good jobs, but also brings about a very important change in attitude. They are taking on initiatives to clean up their camps and help those who are even less fortunate than them. They are becoming better integrated into the greater society and will not allow themselves to be marginalized and live in these conditions for much longer. All of this made me realize that no matter how small of an effort we make, it can make an incredible difference in peoples lives. Despite the short amount of time and limited resources, the effect of OBAT's efforts is apparent and will change the generations to come. We heard many stories from orphans and widows that made me feel truly grateful for what we have been blessed with here in Canada. As difficult as it was to hear some of these heart wrenching cases, it was also amazing to see the resolve and determination of these people. Despite all that they have faced, they still have a positive outlook on life and are extremely thankful to those who are trying to help them.  We met a successful local businessman who is also very involved in philanthropic activities, and he said something that has stuck with me: Helping others with the excess wealth that we have been blessed with should not be considered charity - it is our obligation. Those less fortunate than us are entitled to this wealth more than we are.  I was extremely impressed with the work that OBAT has done, and would like to thank Anwar Uncle and the entire OBAT team for their tremendous efforts.
Obat Helpers Inc	287791		/users/profile/377926	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	04/30/2016	I worked with the president of OBAT Helpers to coordinate the first San Francisco Bay Area event held on April 9, 2016.  The organization was able to get very high quality speakers that were flown in from the East Coast and Midwest for a panel discussion that was very informative and in-depth for the audience members who had very little exposure to this crisis.  The volunteer team that helped to put on the event was also very committed to its success and a lot of planning and work went into creating a very successful initial event for this region.  I hope to see this turn into an annual event so that the improving conditions of the stateless people in Bangladesh can continue to be front and center in the minds of the Bay Area residents and they too can work with OBAT Helpers to hasten the closing of the camps.

Obat Helpers Inc	254933		/users/profile/343295	Hcroucher	Board Member	5	09/04/2015	Five days until I leave for Bangladesh, and I couldnt be more excited. This was the first entry I wrote in my travel journal, and thinking back to the feelings I was having then and throughout my trip with OBAT Helpers, Im filled with happiness. Im very passionate about Islamic societies, culture, language, education and human rights; however, this was my first international experience. Visiting the schools was what I was most excited to experience. I was anxious and curious to hear stories from the children and their families, and to be able to witness first-hand, their living conditions. Were their living conditions, lack of access to jobs, discrimination and socio-economic status eye-opening to me? Yes. But more eye-opening and empowering than anything was the energy and light that came from the children. The schools, programming, teachers and team members were incredible. The love and feeling of duty that they felt are things that I have never seen and will never forget. It makes me tear up now thinking about them. Looking back in my journal, I wrote about our visit to the school in Rangpur, and how one of the teachers said that she didnt know these children could be so smart and wonderful, and how she loves them so much, loves her job and is so proud of them. Who knew such light could shine in darkness? OBAT Helpers allowed me an opportunity to join their team, and bring programming that could support and aid in their work in girls and womens empowerment and education. I figured, I would feel excited and motivated after I arrived back to the States, but I had no idea I would feel as passionate and determined as I do. My pulse quickens at the memories and at the stories I tell when talking to friends and family. OBAT Helpers is striving to create change and provide support to break down barriers of inequality, discrimination and injustice, and I feel honored and privileged to be able to tell my experiences and the stories of those involved and effected by OBAT Helpers.
Obat Helpers Inc	254775		/users/profile/343138	mmasum	Volunteer	5	09/03/2015	I visited one camp and one school in Dhaka and two camps and one school in Syedpur in July this year where OBAT is working and trying to bring a positive change to the people who really need external support for a better living. 20 years back when I was a college student, I was very frequent near the market camp in Mohammadpur, Dhaka. I have seen the sufferings of the camp dwellers back then. Now I am really happy to see the changes that OBAT has bought to them. It is not adequate and a lot of work need to be done but I have seen hope in the eyes of the people specially the children. I met with the students and alumni of the OBAT English School in Dhaka, talked to them for hours, interviewed them and noticed the confidence that they have now which was not there before. OBAT helped to build this confidence by providing education and financial support to the deserving students.  I also met with the OBAT Think Tank  the youth group from the camp who are determined to bring change in their life. They took this opportunity to nurture their communications and leadership skills by engaging in volunteer activities inside the camps. I went to the market camp and interviewed one women who is a beneficiary of OBAT Helpers. I have seen the clean water facility and the drainage system built by OBAT inside the camp. My visit to Bashbari camp and Munshipara camp in Syedpur were exciting too. In Bashbari camp, OBAT established a Sewing Training Center, Computer Training Center and a Tutorial Center. It was surprising to see the number of women from nearby camps who came to learn sewing and basic computer operating so that they can work or find a job to support their families. My last destination was Munshipara Camp where I attended a weekly collection meeting where OBATs microfinance beneficiaries and staff met to collect the weekly installments of the small business loan.I interviewed a couple of people who took small business loans and started their business. They paid back timely and took a bigger loan to expand their business which is really inspiring. I have seen the eagerness among families to be financially solvent and get out from the camp to live a better life. They are grateful to OBAT for helping them to become integrated into the mainstream.  OBAT has surely made an impact with its limited resources in these camps but still a long way to go. I hope that OBAT would be able to increase its footprint in all the camps in Bangladesh soon. I would like to thank from the bottom of my heart the OBAT team here in Indiana and the team who are working hard in the camps in Bangladesh.
Obat Helpers Inc	253549		/users/profile/341761	fhussain	Volunteer	5	08/20/2015	Very few organizations have the sort of cross-generational impact that OBAT Helpers has had. From the young volunteers who gather to help with events and mailings to entire communities who sponsor schools, clinics, and other projects - OBAT has inspired countless individuals around the world. The staff, volunteers, and donors perfectly embody the organization's mission of empowerment. While the population living in the camps have lived without basic means and necessities for decades, I have personally witnessed their true hope and trust in OBAT Helpers as the organization begins to slowly transform the quality of life for thousands.  If you are looking for an organization to support, volunteer with, or work for - you will not regret your contributions for even a moment!  
Obat Helpers Inc	253528		/users/profile/341737	Immad_Ahmed	Board Member	5	08/20/2015	I was honored to be on a team, that visited the camps in Bangladesh last year.  The trip was an emotional rollarcoaster. Witnessing the legacy of the IDP camps and the psychological and physical toll on 3 generations, growing up in a 8x8 brick room, left me very perplexed.   I had the opportunity to personally visit a lot of the initiatives run and managed by the wonderful staff of Obat Helpers in Bangladesh, a team of dedicated and driven people working towards the betterment of their community, working day in and day out.  It was amazing to be in the middle of such inspiring individuals. The dedication to their work was evident on the faces of the people they help everyday.  Watching and hearing mothers, express their desires to educate themselves, so they could help their kids with their homework, was so unbelievable to hear and a true testament to the empowerment evident due to all the hard work of Obat Helpers.
Obat Helpers Inc	253510		/users/profile/341718	Sohel	Board Member	5	08/20/2015	Obat Helpers is doing a fantastic job in helping out the poor in different camps in Bangladesh. I had a chance to evaluate several programs Obat is running, including education. I can say that there is no other NGO that has done the level of work in education and other vocational programs as Obat.

Obat Helpers Inc	253444		/users/profile/341638	jimboclark	Volunteer	5	08/20/2015	I had the honor of working with about 40 young people who are participating in a think-tank run by Obat Helpers in the Fall of 2014.  I was blown away by their enthusiasm and optimism for their future, the clarity of vision that they were making a difference for themselves and their community, and a deep commitment to improving the lives of those around them.  My experience was one of the most memorable and enjoyable in my 28 years of living in and traveling around Asia.  
Obat Helpers Inc	250438		/users/profile/338282	nab94	Volunteer	5	07/28/2015	I am so thankful for OBAT Helpers for giving the opportunity and the resources to spend time in the camp-dwelling Urdu-Speaking community. My main purpose was working with women and trying to understand maternal care access and use. I spoke with women of varying ages, backgrounds and camps. I was fortunate to spend time in various camps in Dhaka, Chittagong and Syedpur. Immediately, I understood that various factors and problems the women faced on a daily basis intersected with their access to proper maternal care. The conditions were appalling: the cramped quarters, limited access to bathroom facilities, and cooking fumes that filled the tiny alleys. However, I was thankful to see the amount of work OBAT Helpers is putting in to address these factors and access to maternal care itself. The importance of clean water for babies who need to be bottle fed is essential for their health. The multiple deep water wells and water point OBAT was working to provide for clean water came as a relief.  There were specific problems women faced and it was inspiring to see OBAT taking into consideration their specific issues and working to address them. Being able to talk to OBATs directors who had experience in this field and explained how the plans they were implementing would be the most effective in the long run was immensely educational. The workers were some of the most hard-working, compassionate and patient people I have ever seen. I can only hope to do half of the work they do and be half of who they are as human beings. I was overcome by the love the children would show at every OBAT school I visited. You could see in their eyes that they were grateful for the opportunity they were being given and were motivated to work hard and overcome their conditions. The investment OBAT is putting into the children of the camps in absolutely necessary for the growth of the communities, they stand as a hope out of the devastating conditions. This organization is one of the most organized and dedicated I have ever seen and believe that they will continue to do amazing work. Their changes to the community were apparent in the way the community members would speak about the changes and the hope they had.  I am looking forward to continue working with OBAT Helpers and offering any help I can.

Obat Helpers Inc	247498		/users/profile/335044	atifg	Volunteer	5	07/05/2015	I spent three weeks in Bangladesh, volunteering with OBAT in the camps for stranded Pakistanis. I was impressed by the dedication of OBAT's field staff and walking through the camps with them I observed how they were well liked and appreciated by the community, with many people coming up to greet us with smiles. Although, camp conditions were really shocking for me to see (a Canadian visiting such place for the first time), it would have been absolutely horrendous if OBAT was not doing such great work. I saw the water points and deep tube wells that OBAT had established and was operating, the repairs and construction of public toilets and sewage systems, operations of a medical clinic and pharmacy (dispensing subsidized medication) and how all of these were vital to the community. The camp residents we met were so thankful to have these facilities and mentioned how it made their lives easier especially the water points where previously they had to walk far, wait long and the water quality was not as good. However, for me the best part was seeing a generation of children that were educated through OBAT schools. The young students we met in OBAT run schools were so positive and seemed so motivated to study. The older students who were volunteering with us had so much confidence and hope in their future despite the difficult living conditions and this is where I feel OBAT has really left a mark. They have provided a generation of kids hope that they can dream of good jobs and better living conditions due to their education. In particular, the girls were so brave and told us that with the help of OBAT staff they had convinced their parents to let them pursue their education and not marry them off at a young age. The social change brought by education cannot be represented in numbers and dollars, but it is such an important intangible in reversing the trend of impoverishment in these communities.
Obat Helpers Inc	206969	1	/users/profile/269485	hsholder	Professional with expertise in this field	4	07/22/2014	Since 2009 I have been working in Bangladesh with members of the camp-dwelling Urdu-speaking community, who OBAT Helpers serve.   My encounters since that time with OBAT have been consistently positive, observing strong leadership and vision, enthusiastic and invested community-based staff, and youth who are just as enthused to get involved in activities and be empowered to become change makers in their community.  Understanding the current needs of the camp residents and being in tune with global develop best-practices,  OBAT has created the ''OBAT Think Tank" as a vehicle of youth activism and their "Clean and Green" campaign which emphasizes the role of the built environment in public health and safety.  Well done OBAT Helpers and keep up the good work!

A few years later I am still trying to make to make a simple footprint.  The president of the organization Anwar Khan is one of the hardest working people I have ever met.  His vision for the forgotten people grows ever year.  This organization is dedicated to making the world a better place, by building the people in need.

This organization is moving forward  and bringing hope and changes in the lives of  most forgetable people.  One of the goal is to return a sense of dignity and self empowerment to these victims of history who live in these camps without hope for the last 40 plus years.  OBAT works in the areas of education, health, and micro-finance.  With the help of Obat helpers, I believe that these people who are in camps will get back soon their identity and pride.

It is an honor for me to be a part of OBATwho are working with stranded Pakistanis known as Biharis in Bangladeshi camps.  The projects that OBAT is working on such as the Education, Micro-financing, family assistance and healthcare is just phenomenal.  May Allah grant OBAT more success in the upcoming years :).

I have witnessed and seen the lives changed, empowered and inspired by the programs this organization runs.  I will continue to support as a donor and one-day as a volunteer to the best of my ability.   Until then, i continue to watch on the sidelines and become inspired and awed at the wonderful work OBAT has enabled.
Obat Helpers Inc	200619		/users/profile/261908	rhatt	Donor	5	05/20/2014	OBAT Helpers' story, remains the most inspiring story for me.  It is a story of taking action to make the world a better place, for people who have known nothing but hard life.  The dedication and selflesness of the people in OBAT, the mission they take to heart, the hard work and their energy to live true to the organization's mission, does indeed far exceeds my expectations and by far, of all the people of have heard of the organization and its mission.  OBAT is not merely a non-profit organization, it doesn't take donations and buy "stuff" for the displaced Pakistanis (Biharis) who live in the camps in Bangladesh, OBAT empowers, educates and builds foundation to improve the lives of the Biharis. I consider myself lucky and honored to be part of OBAT and to know the people who work for OBAT.

Obat Helpers Inc	200035		/users/profile/261120	vfoulk	Volunteer	5	05/10/2014	When I first leaned of OBAT Helpers I was not familiar with the story of the stranded Pakistani people they serve.  As I became more involved, my heart was overwhelmed by the enormity of the challenge OBAT has taken on in addressing the needs and helping the lives of these people.  They have built schools, provided medical help, sanitary bathing facilities, opportunities for small business ownership to bring income into the community and much more.  Thanks to OBAT, the children of these communities have hope of a better life outside the camps.  They are able to achieve academically and even have opportunity to gain college education. Something which would have been far from a goal for previous generations.   OBAT Helpers is the only organization in the world that focuses on this area of the world and these people who have lived in abject poverty for generations.  It is an honor to participate in events with OBAT to bring awareness to people of the wonderful work they do.  I hope to travel with them in the near future to visit the people who from a far have touched my heart with their vibrancy despite unthinkably difficult living conditions.  Anyone who is looking for an outlet to serve and give has a gem in OBAT Helpers.

His passion and perseverance has inspired hundreds of volunteers and  hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations that are making a monumental difference in the lives of the "forgotten" people in these camps.

Micro-lending, training, education, healthcare all help these people transition into Bangladeshi society as productive members.

The staff were well trained, the students were bright and intelligent and the experience was extremely positive. In fact, I'm not sure I've visited a non-profit before where I felt so much good work was being done. The organisation doesn't just run schools but also training centers, health clinics, and infrastructure projects in the camps. It is well run, efficient, cost-effective and makes a practical, tangible difference to the lives of those living in the camps on a daily basis. I only hope it can continue to do such good work, without which the residents of the camps in Bangladesh would suffer terribly.

It's one of the only NGOs in the world working to empower the still stateless Urdu-speakers in Bangladesh. It has inspired the youth and others in the camps in Bangladesh to think of solutions for the challenges they face.

But in the following days, we visited other camps in the area where OBAT has helped establish schools, vocational centers, clinics as well as access to clean water and proper sewage systems. The difference was extremely motivating. Despite still living in these difficult conditions, the children in particular showed a huge amount of promise. Being able to attend proper schools will not only allow them to get educated and find good jobs, but also brings about a very important change in attitude. They are taking on initiatives to clean up their camps and help those who are even less fortunate than them. They are becoming better integrated into the greater society and will not allow themselves to be marginalized and live in these conditions for much longer. All of this made me realize that no matter how small of an effort we make, it can make an incredible difference in peoples lives. Despite the short amount of time and limited resources, the effect of OBAT's efforts is apparent and will change the generations to come. We heard many stories from orphans and widows that made me feel truly grateful for what we have been blessed with here in Canada. As difficult as it was to hear some of these heart wrenching cases, it was also amazing to see the resolve and determination of these people. Despite all that they have faced, they still have a positive outlook on life and are extremely thankful to those who are trying to help them.  We met a successful local businessman who is also very involved in philanthropic activities, and he said something that has stuck with me: Helping others with the excess wealth that we have been blessed with should not be considered charity - it is our obligation. Those less fortunate than us are entitled to this wealth more than we are.  I was extremely impressed with the work that OBAT has done, and would like to thank Anwar Uncle and the entire OBAT team for their tremendous efforts.

These works are increasing day by day and things are in progress, but due to lack of funding, OBAT is not able to expand its project.

Ashe believed that tennis was a life long sport and by learning the game he could not only teach kids the game of tennis, but at the same time develop other necessary skills to enhance a child's life such as his/her character and healthy lifestyles. The NJTL of Indianapolis continues the legacy set forth by Ashe by offering low cost tennis lessons for children ages 5 - 18 at various venues across the city.   Currently, the NJTL of Indianapolis serves over 1,00 children.

Over the 8 years, I have been blessed to know several people committed to making this program as successful as possible. The staff genuinely care and have a passion for making tennis available to youth throughout the city. They also don't intend just to make tennis possible, but they also seek to use tennis as a way to capture youth and teach them about important life lessons such as responsibilty, humility and generosity. As an instructor for this program, I teach with hands-on instruction, strive to know and speak with each player about their strengths and weaknesses, encourage all participants to work hard, and hope that they reap the benefits of working hard... I know for a FACT that at least 8 participants are currently using skills they learned from NJTL at their local high schools: Beech Grove, Lutheran, Warren Central, North Central, Arsenal Tech and Broad Ripple. I still keep in contact with them, coach them and am so excited to see the next steps in their tennis career... which one is now an NJTL instructor and another seeking to become an instructor. I think that our program continues to get better year after year, despite financial challenges. We try to implement new games, drills and our advanced player program is gaining strength very quickly.Why is our program so great? Because we offer low-cost quality instruction and still care about the things that are most important in life...

I have never been as satisfied with a children's program in 8 years of participating in ballet, soccer, softball, tennis, swimming, etc. The children are taught by professional, patient, involved, and knowledgable staff. They are encouraged to participate in match play. The parents are kept informed and updated through email and the website. The cost is incredible. I love that they use the bigger balls and half size courts to start them out on. This program is a wonderful way to expose your child to tennis and I highly recommend it.

My child's desire to play tennis was my dream too. The same time I made a decision to go back to collage to pursue a four year degree.  I have checked numerous possible sites where my child could play tennis. Unfortunately, I could not afford even a week worth of lessons there. There was no spare money in the single mom's budget for the expensive tennis lessons. Then, a small miracle has happened. I have learned about NJTL from a flyer in the Indy Parks brochure during the summer. We have joined few weeks after the summer session has already started, and have been a part of the program since. It is a program that gives us both a lot of personal satisfaction. Every time a session ends, my child asks: "Mommy when will my tennis class start again?" It is a dream come true not only for my child, but also for me. Thank you!

At all times they have been friendly, courteous, helpful, and display a genuine devotion to serving the community through tennis related activities.  During these annual banquets I have been witness to the results of the efforts of the NJTL.  Seeing the faces of kids that are being honored is enough to know the value of NJTLs work.   Also, by listening to adults who are past participants in NJTL, it is obvious this kind of involvement with kids has a lasting, positive impact on their lives.  100% of these alumni said the NJTL had become their family and made them better people and better members of the community.  Many had given back through tennis and beyond.  There is no greater proof than that.

He jumped up and down when I told him that the program was also offered in the fall.

This past winter of 2011, I taught anything from 5 year olds through 18 year olds. My experience was great! I worked with other talented instructors with both high school and collegiate tennis experience. We taught and reinforced fundamentals, strategies and concepts of the game while also implementing life skills and healthy living instruction. Parents enjoy the low cost of our program as well as instructors who genuinely care about their children. While our program is not as strong as others in terms of developing ranked tennis athletes, I do believe our program has the best mission of all of them... and we are beginning to form a stronger advanced program with athletes now emerging to play competitive varsity high school tennis. I am a proud instructor for Indy NJTL. My life-changing story has been a girl I taught my first summer in 2005 who is now playing for her high school team -- varsity 2 singles. 
National Junior Tennis League of Indianapolis Inc	75223		/users/profile/82168	renellehui	Donor	5	02/24/2011	I worked for NJTL the summers of 2005-2009. Because of NJTL, I was able to teach very affordable instructional tennis to youth of the inner city ages 6-18. The most striking memory I have of these summers is spending time with kids who were often in daycare programs... some of them up to 12 hours a day... I vividly remember Friday match days in which I typically would pick up children from their daycares and/or homes so that they were able to gain more experience in match play. I witnessed numerous instances in which kids felt success (like rallying over the net more each week), persevered (in hard matches), sensed community (as kids cheered for each other in the end of summer tournament), and were cared for (in the hugs and high fives from instructors).Our teaching staff learned to bond together and create friendly competition among participants from all sides of the city by tye-dying tshirts, having park picnics with water balloons, using sidewalk chalk to create enthusiasm and chants to boost team pride.This program is about much more than just tennis. NJTL strives to provide a safe environment that fulfills its founder, Arthur Ashe's, legacy of using the sport as a way to, "teach [young people] about matters more important than tennis."

They talked about how NJTL made a tremendous impact on them and how the instructors that taught them helped shape them in to who they are today. Being at the auction dinner, made me realize that NJTL is all about the children and who they become. Yes, they teach tennis lessons, but their mission is so much more than that. I could see it in the children receiving awards, and I could see it from the adults who participated in the program when they were little.

The years of experience taught me many things beyond hand-eye coordination.  I learned patience and perseverance, because achieving an overhand serve from the baseline is not a task conquered in one lesson or one week.  Integrity was instilled in me through line calls and scoring.  As I got older, my passion for tennis continued to blossom.  In 6th grade I made my middle school's tennis team, and continued to varsity in high school.  However, participating on the team not only furthered my skills as an athlete, but more importantly kept me out of trouble.  My school dismissed students around 3pm, but my mom didn't get off work until 5pm.  Thankfully, the social skills I learned from the positive role models at NJTL and the passion I gained for the sport, kept me on the tennis court and away from the peer pressures faced by an unsupervised teen.

The instructor to student ratio is godd and the drills are structured so that the kids have a lot of practice time.  I am really happy that my daughter is able to learn tennis through JNTL.
National Junior Tennis League of Indianapolis Inc	65687		/users/profile/71800	nwinings	General Member of the Public	5	02/09/2011	The NJTL is a great organization that teaches life long skills and gives young people a strong foundation to start with in life.  Tennis is a sport that can teach a youngster how to have fun, build confidence and work hard.  It also teaches them how to compete with sportmanship,  both as an individual (singles) and a team member (doubles).   The NJTL is an organization that allows our nations's kids to have fun and learn life lessons!
National Junior Tennis League of Indianapolis Inc	65670		/users/profile/71783	Chad Winings	Board Member	5	02/09/2011	NJTL is such a great organization.  It not only focuses on teaching tennis in the urban Indianapolis area, but it teaches young children important life skills like hard work, education, responsibility and other skill necessary to succeed in having a fulfilling life. The tennis instructors are great.  They're enthusiastic and they love giving back to the community.  Most of them had grown up playing in NJTL tennis themselves. I wish every young person in Indianapolis would play NJTL tennis.  They would be so well "served".

They both look forward to playing tennis every week, it's one of the highlight's of our week! NJTL is doing a great job here in Indianapolis and my kids are learning and having fun.     The instructors are helpful and friendly, and the management is too.  I sit with the other moms and we're all pleased with the program and plan to come back every year.

Kids spend time learning about health and ways to make healthier choices in their daily lives.  They also learn about team work and getting along with others. I've servied on the board of NJTL for the past two years and it's been a great experience for me.  Not only have I been able to help the organization, I've also learned a lot about NJTL's role in the community to keep kids engaged in positive activities.
National Junior Tennis League of Indianapolis Inc	65626		/users/profile/71738	tommy2	Board Member	5	02/09/2011	NJTL is a great organization. I have been involved with tennis from a very early age. I was a tennis instructor for NJTL at the age of 16. In all my affiliations with tennis over the years. The most cost effective way to learn tennis is a ball, a racquet and a big backboard. The backboard is something you won't come across much these days. And garage doors to play against aren't what they use to be. With NJTL not only do you receive top quality tennis instruction. But, you will also get life skills. Food choices, exercise routines outside of playing tennis alone. All this from an experienced staff. Trust me when i say. "You will not find this low cost program for tennis, anywhere except NJTL". Enroll your kids today. Tell all your friends. You won't be disappointed. Tom Bennett

Safe Sitter Inc	318607	2	/users/profile/409822	tgillig	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/09/2016	I am a registered nurse.  I am also AHA certified and have been a safe-sitter instructor for over 10 years.  Safe sitter offers so much practical advice for our youth!  I have thoroughly enjoyed teaching students how to "stay safe, stay calm and provide comfort".  Students learn behavior management tips, how to screen an employer, how to preform basis first aid, how to decide if they can handle a problem or if they need to contact a back up adult or call 911.  We also teach life saving skill such as, how to preform the choking maneuver  and CPR on both infants and children.  It is such a wonderful experience to empower students!  To watch them demonstrate the skills they have learned on a manikin and to see the confidence in their faces when asked "do you think you could do this in real life"?  Safe-sitter is a must, not only for future babysitters, but also if your child is old enough to stay at home alone.
Safe Sitter Inc	318605	1	/users/profile/409818	02132	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/09/2016	I have been teaching Safe-Sitter at Aultman Hospital in Canton, Ohio for about five years.  I work in the Lab and I also have my Bachelors degree in Early Childhood Education.  Safe sitter does a great job of teaching young people how to care for young children using methods that are developmentally appropriate.  It teaches them how to be responsible for themselves and the children they care for.  It is an excellent way to help these young people be more self reliant and confident that they can handle any situation that may arise.  They learn how to keep themselves and those they care for safe.  And they have fun doing it!  It is wonderful to see how their confidence grows in the short time we are together.  Theyare empowered simply by having all the information they need at their finger tips.  When they have completed the class they know what they can handle themselves, when theyneed some adult assistance, and when they need professional help from 911.  This program definitely has the potential to SAVE LIVES and enrich them.  I am proud to be part of the Safe Sitter program.                                                                                                                           Valerie Davis
Safe Sitter Inc	318603	1	/users/profile/409816	dkopec	Professional with expertise in this field	4	11/09/2016	Offering Safe Sitter class to the youth in your community is a great way to promote independent thinking, build self esteem, teach valuable life skills and have a lot of fun with this age group! The curriculum is easy to follow and lends itself to important discussions. Getting down on the floor with these kids for roll playing, diaper changing instruction, playing games, or learning first aid techniques is just a wonderful way to interact and get this information across to them. I highly recommend this course to both instructors and parents. I wish I had taken this course before I had begun my babysitting journey.
Safe Sitter Inc	318599	1	/users/profile/409813	wsanjari	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/09/2016	I've taught the SafeSitter class for 3 years now and it is FANTASTIC. There are interactive games to play with the students, the SafeSitter student handbook is colorful and well organized, and the overall class is very engaging. I've taught other babysitting courses where students watched several hours of video and it was all I could do to keep them awake. As a health educator, I've written and presented many public health programs and SafeSitter meets all of the best practices I use as an educator. I've also been very impressed with the customer service from SafeSitter and if I have an issue or any questions they have always responded within 24 hours (most of the time within 12 hours). The staff is knowledgeable and the marketing support for the program is great. Thank you SafeSitter! I'm excited for another year of teaching and to try out the updated curriculum!

What a fantastic program which evolves and changes with the times - the up to date information the students receive is a focus which I appreciate. How the students are educated with repetition, role playing, and reading out loud shows how knowledgable the program creators are in how to teach and have students retain.

It has been a most enjoyable and rewarding expereince.   We have served adolescents ages 11 - 13 in our community every summer for over 20 years--even before I joined our community hospital.   Young people at this age are very inquisitive and, for the most part, eager to learn.  The content of the course  is very good information to have at this time in their lives.  Actually, it's good information for anyone to have.  As the Safe Sitter motto says--"Better Sitters Today, Better Parents Tomorrow."

It has been a great experience working with Safe Sitter Inc.  We are a Volunteer Fire Department and wanted to add Safe Sitter to our Injury Prevention Programs.  We contacted Safe Sitter and they were an excellent resource in helping us get out program up and running.  We were able to get our staff certified to teach the program at our pace with a lot of assistance from Safe Sitter Inc.  We have taught a couple of classes in our local area and the participants have had grave reviews about the program.  One of the best reviews I heard was when asked what you would change about the program, the answer given was Nothing it was perfect the way it is.

The program is well designed to engage children's interest and attention for the training. The evaluations of the kids are enthusiastic and they are excited about learning how to take care of children. We now have former Safe Sitters teaching as volunteers. The organization is responsive and professional. They provide comprehensive training and support to their sites, reaching out to organizations to spread the word and teach as many students as possible. It's a valuable service to every community to help students become responsible sitters (and future parents!)
Safe Sitter Inc	204741		/users/profile/266781	Debbiekicinski	Volunteer	5	06/30/2014	Safe Sitter is an excellent program for boys or girls to attend. Even if  they never baby sit all the material presented is medically accurate and they are learning life skills. The skills learned are important in every aspect of life from learning how to make positive first impression to how how to call 911 and preform CPR and clear the airway of a choking child. I recommend this program to every one I meet with children as soon as they reach the required age. 
Safe Sitter Inc	200676		/users/profile/261988	Sharon105	Client Served	5	05/21/2014	I had taught Safe Sitter in my previous hospital since my daughter was old enough to attend the class.  (She's 28 and mom herself now) When I changed facilities I brought the program into my new hospital.  I found 2 other nurses who were now not just parents but new grandparents as well as a Respiratory Therapist to help me kick off the program.  We are so excited to offer this course to our service area.  Not only are we able to offer life-saving skills to these kids but it enables us to reach out to their parents in a positive way and market our hospital to them.  I found Safe Sitter has continuously kept the curriculum current with new trends such as social media and cell phone usage but always encouraging the students and instructors to have fun while learning.All the support staff are very responsive and helpful.  Their resources seem endless and ever improving.  They listen to what the kids and the instructors say about the course and continuously improve it.I'm proud to say I am a Safe Sitter instructor.

We have received an outpouring of requests for this course.  Its reputation precedes itself and many parents took the course when they were young and now are sending a second generation for this most important training.  The kids are so excited about learning how to save a life and if I can make a difference in even one childs life then I am upholding the mission of this program.  As a nurse and a mother I want all babysitters to be prepared for the worst but also HAVE FUN.  I would feel more comfortable entrusting my childs life to a Safe Sitter and hope to train many more to come!  The staff that run the program are extremely helpful and responsive.  They are willing to assist in any way possible to ensure that the program continues to reach the community.  What an awesome program!

Safe Sitter Inc	197039		/users/profile/257570	Jaci F.	Volunteer	5	04/04/2014	I introduced Safe Sitter to our rural community through my family practice. I am so impressed with this program! It provides a great foundation for the basics of child care and choking rescue, but also teaches the sitter personal safety skills they can apply to other circumstances they might encounter.  I especially like the way Safe Sitter encourages the children to seek the help of adults, either a designated individual or the EMS system, while providing skills to act on their own as well. It is a great model for adults and children working together, and for youth development. The children's reviews of the program are very positive. We invite the Sheriff or the EMS director to the closing ceremonies to commend the children for learning to be Safe Sitters, and to make the EMS system have a face for them. The support staff at Safe Sitter is accessible, friendly and helpful. A great nonprofit I highly recommend!

Safe Sitter classes is one of the highlights of the year for us (instructors).  I often tell parents of prospective students about not just the life-saving skills that our students learn, but about the "life" skills we teach.  Two of our graduates have been instrumental in saving a younger sibling from choking, so that in itself makes everything we do worthwhile.  I am such a believer in the program that I am making plans to have a grandson who lives out of state come and stay with me this year so he can attend our classes.  All 11-13 year olds would benefit from taking this course.

Safe Sitter Inc	172639		/users/profile/228611	totlrec	Volunteer	5	10/01/2013	I thought that a babysitting certification course would help our local, church-owned camp.  I called another organization to determine the teacher certification and was told about the many pre-requisites and the perhaps 2-year time-delay, I found the Safe Sitter website.  It was perfect!  The curriculum partnered with my AHA first aid/cpr/aed teaching certifications and allowed up to  people to be trained in one session - by video!  The staff could not have been more supportive, and the materials are up to date and attractive.  Best of all, the related costs are low enough to be cost-effective for us.  We have added Safe Sitter certification to our summer camp line ups.  Campers spend 3-4 hours a day in Safe Sitter classes and also get to swim, do crafts (some SS related), and other camp-y activities.  At the end of the week, we have a graduation, and they are ready to start their own businesses.  We find that the camp schedule gives us more time to add even more information as well as certify the campers in CPR/First Aid/AED and give them more leadership skills.  A win-win!

The first day of the two day class, we get the usual 11-13 year old behavior and attention span but by the 2nd of the two days, they have matured enormously!  They have had real CPR and First Aid training from our instructors and really have a mastery of the skills they are taught.  They are confident and well versed in those skills and in the role they have taken caring for children.  Safe Sitter is presented with great integrity, is very carefully laid out and taught - and in my observation, it never disappoints!

Since1996 CRMC has graduated 363 Safe Sitter participants. Our coordinator retired last year and turned the reins over to me.   On July 30-31, 2013 we held our first class that I coordinated, with a total of 9 students.  During the class, I had occasion to go into the classroom and take a few photos.  While I was there, I was very impressed with what I observed.  The kids were fully engaged, asking questions, and doing hands-on exercises, which included infant CPR.  This program is excellent and provides such good information that I think it should be used outside of babysitting, such as helping with younger siblings.  Every child (and maybe even adult) should have to take this course. I also had several occasions to talk with Safe Sitter staff since it was my first class to coordinate.  I found everyone at Safe Sitter to be very helpful and walk me through all the steps.  They made the job much easier, and they provided all the forms and information to me.  They were great to work with. We look forward to being a Safe Sitter Site for many years in the future because this program is such a good community service.Susan

They all particularly respond well to the training they receive in emergencies that include choking, first aid and CPR. Safe Sitter is a great program. The educational materials are well written and provides important information that is needed. My most recent class I realized that I did not have enough course books only a few days before my class.

Prior to this opportunity, I had not heard of "Safe Sitters".  What an absolutely outstanding program!!  It has been so well-received in our community, and we continue to receive calls asking for another class.  The feedback from the students was also very positive!  One zealous student wrote "this should last for a week and all teenagers should take it".  They particularily liked learning CPR and how to use an AED.  They all indicated that they felt better prepared to take on the responsibility of becoming  a "bodyguard" for those who were entrusted to their care!  I give this program highest marks.

I have been impressed with the material provided and how thorough the resources are. Safe Sitter Inc. provides lots of assistance in helping instructors to get their classes started as well as follow up information. If I ever had questions the Safe Sitter team responded via email or phone within the same day, sometimes even the same hour. This made me feel like my community and the work I am doing was important to the Safe Sitter organization. I have used social media as one avenue of advertising my courses and have been notified by community members that this has been a desire for many people.  Registering students for the first course was a breeze, we even had to create a waiting list because our spots filled up so fast. It's been less than a month since our first course and we have already scheduled a second course! I have also received notification from residents in surrounding areas, that they too have been interested in becoming instructors and want to know more about how to contact Safe Sitter. I was pleased to share with these inquiring members that Safe Sitter is easy to start, the website is simple to navigate and the Safe Sitter Team is quick to respond. Safe Sitter has been a success in my small community. It has also been an easy program to work with and more importantly I believe in the difference I am making by teaching Safe Sitter. 
Safe Sitter Inc	163268		/users/profile/216737	christineatrout	Client Served	5	07/22/2013	Safe Sitter Inc. is a great company that provides full support for their program.  We carry out Safe Sitter for pre-teens in our community and since having updated the curriculum to include basic CPR training, our customer service scores have greatly increase.  Any time I have a question or a need, they are quick to respond and extremely helpful.  I feel very fortunate to work with such a great company!

I've been teaching classes for over 4 years.  Safe Sitter is an exceptional resource for teaching kids some very important skills; not only for baby sitting, but for life.  We always recieve very positive feedback from the kids and they leave the class excited about what they have learned.  Safe Sitter is a great confidence builder for kids as it teaches them how to act in the event they experience difficult situations.

I cannot say enough wonderful things about the individuals who work at Safe Sitter INC or the quality program they produce. It is the BEST community program offered by our fire department and continues to fill up each and every time we offer the class. 
Safe Sitter Inc	159404		/users/profile/211563	SusanLebel	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/04/2013	Rutland Regional Medical Center in Rutland, Vermont, has been a Safe Sitter teaching site for over 15 years. We provide 15-20 classes per year both on-site and at local schools & Rec. Centers.  We are very happy to be able to offer Safe Sitter. Students are learning important life skills and having fun as they learn. It is so popular in our area that we rarely have to advertise to fill our classes. Children come from all over the state (and even from other states) to attend our courses. Safe Sitter's curriculum is medically accurate, overseen by a physician and registered nurses are on staff and able to answer any questions that may arise.  All of the staff at Safe Sitter are kind, enthusiastic and very responsive to the needs of their teaching sites. We feel fortunate and proud to be part of the Safe Sitter organization and encourage anyone considering establishing a site in an area that does not currently have a site to do so! Susan Lebel, RN, Community Educator, Rutland Regional Medical Center
Safe Sitter Inc	124764		/users/profile/169773	Jane Connors-Geddes	Volunteer	5	10/08/2012	I have taught the Safe Sitter program for 8 years. I wish the information I have learned and then taught to the students was available to me as a new parent. The information on how to handle yourself as a baby sitter and how to handle the child will then be used as a parent making the family strong and better.  If this class was taught to new parents, I feel there would be less child abuse. Safe Sitter was perfected the way to teach these young teens without boring them or losing their attention.
Safe Sitter Inc	124099		/users/profile/168900	Leslie22	Volunteer	5	10/01/2012	I have served as a Safe Sitter instructor for several years.  As a registered nurse,  I can vouch for the great information taught these young men and women.  They learn important information needed to babysit anyone from an infant to an older elementary school child. They go thru various scenarios involving first aid triage, dangerous situations, and problem child care.  I feel that teaching Safe Sitter provides lifetime skills for these students.
Safe Sitter Inc	109820		/users/profile/95456	lynns	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/13/2012	I am a National Trainer for this organization and I teach new instructors how to teach this course.  In the past year, we have completely revamped our curriculum to better reflect society at this time.  We have added more technology info etc..., however the core principles and values have never wavered from what they originally were in 1980.  I find that to be the most beneficial part of this organization- it holds firmly to it's values and it's mission even though society changes around it.
Safe Sitter Inc	85520		/users/profile/95456	lynns	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/13/2011	Safe Sitter is a medically accurate and comprehensive curriculum that teaches sitter safety, along with life and parenting skills.  It is a critical growth step in the life of the target students (pre adolescents) and a major asset to the community.
Safe Sitter Inc	88097		/users/profile/98943	Gwen L	Volunteer	5	04/29/2011	My first experience with Safe Sitter was conducting an evaluation of the organization. I was so impressed with the organization I became a volunteer. I was a trainer and National Trainer for over 16 years and enjoyed it immensely.  In fact, my husband became trainer and our son is a Safe Sitter graduate.
Safe Sitter Inc	87935		/users/profile/98750	Amy P.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/28/2011	My first experience with Safe Sitter occurred in the late 80's when I attended a training so I could volunteer teach with the organization. As a new mom with a degree in education, I had enough a-ha moments that day to convince me that this should be mandatory training for ALL youth! What I love most about the Safe Sitter class is that it is not just a babysitting class...it is a life skills class for young adolescents. Everything from business skills to child care skills to first aid/CPR to safety skills is covered in an age-appropriate, fun, hands-on learning environment. What I love most about the Safe Sitter organization is that the safety of all children is the first priority in every aspect. The class has evolved over time, stays current with what's important and real in the lives of young teens, and will never, ever compromise on medical accuracy. 
Safe Sitter Inc	87862		/users/profile/98661	Leah	Board Member	5	04/28/2011	Safe Sitter lives up to its name, consistently and with great integrity.  Not only does this organization train young adolescents to care for younger children, Safe Sitter also makes sure that the sitters themselves know how to be safe.  Safe Sitter helps young people be good caregivers today, and good parents tomorrow.

all for One productions inc	261214	1	/users/profile/325097	Teresa63	Volunteer	4	10/02/2015	Onstage and off, the relationship makes the difference at all for One productions.  Whether it's lighter family entertainment or hard hitting drama, exploring authentic relationships is key in all their presentations.  This concern for authenticity is true offstage too, where cast and crew uniquely bond and encourage one another, not only in their work but also in their personal lives.  afO provides a safe environment for local artists to grow in their craft as well as a place to grow in community. 
all for One productions inc	239341		/users/profile/325097	Teresa63	Volunteer	5	03/17/2015	all for One productions is a beacon in our local cultural landscape.  While always entertaining, their theatrical presentations  are also consistently thought-provoking.  Whether light-hearted or more dramatic, each selection   illuminates human struggles and triumphs in a distinctive way.  Bottom line: all for One represents integrity, both artistically and in the messages they convey to their audiences.  The casts/crews and audiences are moved and changed by the work afO presents; it isn't "business as usual" community theater.
all for One productions inc	260979		/users/profile/349570	Writer	Client Served	5	10/01/2015	All for One is both thoroughly professional and thoroughly Christian.

Our family includes theater enthusiasts and aspiring actors, writers and directors! All For One has provided excellent opportunities for each of these. From the Young Playwrights, to acting opportunities, to apprenticeships, to great shows! We count it a privilege to be part of this group. Thank you for fostering my son's love for theater and giving him a positive environment to spread his wings!

It has been an honor to work with them as an artist.  It is thrilling to see and hear the buzz in the lobby after each show as the audience is inspired by the theatre arts.
all for One productions inc	260288	1	/users/profile/348865	AmandaGordley	Volunteer	5	09/30/2015	I have had multiple wonderful experiences with All For One. Unlike other theatre company's I've been involved with, there are never any big egos to deal with. They strive to create a group that acts more like extended family than people competing for recognition. Truly a family friendly organization that presents thought provoking and high quality theatre!

I've seen the organization develop from a theater company scrounging high school stages to perform on to a multi-faceted, faith-based  theater ministry that produces a full season of quality community theater shows, hosts Northeast Indiana's only K-12 annual Young Playwrights Festival, and mentors the next generation of believer artists through a program called Faces of the Future. Keep an eye on all for One. It's going places.
all for One productions inc	239961		/users/profile/325964	Greg.Livengood	Board Member	5	03/26/2015	As of this writing I am the newest board member of afO.  Having attended and participated in two board meetings and one weekend retreat, the board appears to demonstrate a very appropriate balance of oversight between near term opportunities and obligations versus longer term strategic planning.  Further, the artistic vision of afO Homestage Productions is top notch, being well-planned and knowledgeable of resources, both physical resources and talent.  It seems likely strategic board planning and oversight as well as the artistic vision of Homestage Productions will contribute to the established longevity of afO.  
all for One productions inc	239552		/users/profile/325412	afOvol	Volunteer	4	03/21/2015	After attending a handful of allforOne productions in their early years of presence in our community, my husband and I began volunteering regularly as ushers throughout each theatrical season.  As a professional educator whose passion is stoked by seeing growth, it has been exciting to see the growth of afO in terms of audience.   With every passing production, the numbers and variety of people who pass through the venue doors is like an ever-widening circle after a pebble is dropped in a pond. When we first began volunteering,  we recognized many in the audience as  "church people" that we knew.  We also discovered that many people were attending their first afO production; indeed, there were many people in our circles of influence who had never heard of the company.  Now, for any given play, we notice that there are large numbers of tickets from season ticket holders, people from throughout our community who have discovered the organization and are so certain that they will be treated to a whole season of quality theater, that they happily commit themselves in advance for the entire season.  Each time we volunteer, we notice a wider variety of attendees--people we see at other arts events, students, families.  It appears that the word is getting out in our community that an afO production is the place to be!  An afO production is one event I know I can confidently invite a friend to attend, knowing they will experience something worthwhile--entertainment, inspiration, intellectual stimulation, and emotional connection.  It is a pleasure and honor to be affiliated with this group.
all for One productions inc	239536	1	/users/profile/325386	Jeff98	Professional with expertise in this field	4	03/20/2015	I have been involved in theatre for over 26 years. My degree is in theatre and I worked in the professional world for about 10 years. I have performed in all kinds of venues and had all kinds of experiences in theatre, I have to say that all for One is something completely different.  I have never been a part of an organization that , top to bottom, cares about the actors, the audience and the staff as much as they do. If you are in a show you are pushed to be better than you thought you could be. The directors push you and yet are patient and willing to take the time to teach you and help you find a depth you didn't know you could reach. They also allow an actor to play and create a lot of the character on your own. That is a big plus when a lot of directors are strict with their vision and stifle an actor. I believe in what they do and joined their staff in 2012 as their Technical Director. From that side of things, I was blown away at the unflinching willingness of people to lend a hand whenever one was needed. Set, props, costumes, everyone works together so well toward the finished product. Even the actors take their extra time to help build or sew or paint. In most places, you don't see the actors getting involved unless they have to.  On top of all this, the directors, staff, and actors all take the time to really learn about you and what you have going on in your life. It's not just a "How ya doin?" kind of thing, they truly care and will sit down and talk with you, pray with you help you if it's  needed.  All of us on the staff are volunteer. We don't get paid a penny but we give a big chunk of our lives to all for One because we believe in what it offers and are proud to be a part of it.

Even AFO senior staff members are on hand to greet guests and build connections that further the arts community. In sort, All for One knows how to entertain!

all for One productions inc	239518	1	/users/profile/325362	psytoad	Volunteer	5	03/20/2015	I came to afO as an actor because I loved the play; I stayed as a costumer, prop-maker, set worker, dresser, and all around gofer because of the people.  Not only are the plays top notch, but the people are wonderful to work with.  When you see a play put on by this group, you not only know that it was well-researched, professionally directed, and acted with integrity but also that everyone in the cast had a great time!
all for One productions inc	239514	1	/users/profile/325356	godsbooklover	Professional with expertise in this field	5	03/20/2015	I have directed nearly 30 full-length productions for afO. One of the things which stands out to me is the great kindness that our casts and crews demonstrate to one another. I have seen seasoned actors encouraging greenhorns, adults taking child actors under their wing, and generally an esprit de corps which is consistent and which makes working with afO sheer joy. I am also so impressed with the dedication of actors to making each production the best it can be by their investment of personal time:  doing outside reading, research, memorization and practicing skills such as accents. Three members of the most recent cast spent untold hours mastering a convincing Polish accent.  All this without shows of temper or ego,  but with a genuine desire to create something special.

I've also directed and acted on the afO stage.  I have found this company to be a rare exception in the arts.  It is an organization that values artistic excellence and also individual people who hold the image of God.  I highly recommend any afO show.  They have integrity from the seats to the backstage!

all for One productions inc	89266		/users/profile/101200	Kayla R.	Volunteer	5	05/26/2011	In our modern era of video games, tv, and electronics, kids don't have much exposure to live theatre, or even writing.  ttyl, lol, g2g -- that's how kids write!  What are punctuation, capitalization, grammar, and spelling?  Idk.  They don't know how to communicate face-to-face or show emotion without an emoticon.  Challenging kids to write plays teaches them not only how to use the English language, but give them the experience of live theatre where they can see communication through tone and body language as well.  Kids have important things to say, and the Young Playwrights Festival is helping them learn how to say it in a rewarding, safe environment. I've been involved with YPF since it first started three years ago.  Every year I come back because I believe in its purpose.  When I read the play entries, write playwright bios, or step onto the stage, I keep the playwright's picture in my mind.  I've been in the shoes of a young playwright.  Anticipation and excitement build as the stage is set for their play, and once the last line is done, their mind is filled with wonder and a determination to write more.  Doesn't every young writer dream of a chance to see their work published?  I think it's so cool to see this opportunity for kids even as young as Kindergarteners to have their work not only published in a book, but performed for a live audience of family, friends, teachers, and even complete strangers who just have a passion for theatre.   With groups like afO, the next generation of children are going to do something great.

Your plays are thought-provoking, professionally staged and the performances superb.  I have been involved in radio and television production most of my career and enjoy live theater very much.  At one point in time, I wrote and directed promtional ads for the Civic Theater, so I know good production values when I see them.  Yours are the best!!!  God bless you for honoring Him.
all for One productions inc	52483		/users/profile/53409	mom5x	General Member of the Public	5	09/15/2010	The plays are very captivating.  The adult performance plays are not just entertaining, but also thoughtful, leaving you with conversation afterwards.  The student performances are so professional and the kids really seam to enjoy themselves.  I especially enjoyed the young playwrite's festival.  We will be attending again this year!
all for One productions inc	52196		/users/profile/53050	TaliJo	Volunteer	5	09/11/2010	I love afO. As a young person who enjoys all aspects of theater, I search out any and all opportunities to act or just be around the stage. I actually first encountered afO when I saw their production "Crime and Punishment" (which was probably the most heartbreaking and well-acted play I've seen in my short life), but I only really became involved when my director for summer Dramatics asked if I'd be interested in helping stage scripts from the Young Playwrights' Festival winners. I was. The one week I spent at the main library practicing was a great time and I learned a lot about acting, God's provision, and myself. The way we would pray before each practice was so encouraging and I could feel the love in every corner of that place.I wasn't really sure what to expect, but I enjoyed my time with afO and I hope they'll consider me for roles in the future, and maybe look favorably on the play I'm planning entering this year for YPF ;)
all for One productions inc	51801	2	/users/profile/52547	krysta	Volunteer	5	09/04/2010	I have been interested in theater ever since I was a little girl, but when I first started out, I got discouraged because most of the productions I was involved in (with other companies) required me to do things that contradicted my values. But when I was fourteen, I auditioned for allforOne Productions' Character Counts program  and the rest is history! They cast me in a major role, and helped me develop my acting ability. A couple years later, they promoted me to the position of Director's assistant; at first I wasn't sure if I liked that idea, because I thought that acting was the only element of theater I would ever be involved in...not! Working side by side with a professional director opened up a whole new world to me. But the most incredible experience I've had with allforOne has been the Young Playwrights Festival (YPF). I've loved writing since middle school, but I had never shared my work with anyone before. I decided to enter a play my senior year, thinking that I wouldn't win but it would be a good idea just to try. To my astonishment, my play won first place in the 10-12 grade division! You can imagine the confidence boost that gave me; and ever since then, I have been using my writing skills more and more! Each May, the winning plays are staged by local professionals. There, I was able to see my own work come alive, and it was unbelievably encouraging and exciting to me - I would recommend YPF to any young writer, because it lets you visualize your own imagination and see how it plays out on stage. During YPF, I was also invited to direct the K-2 division winning play. I had never actually directed anything by myself, so I was really nervous. But it turned out so well that now I hope to direct many other shows in the future, because I discovered that I really enjoy it! allforOne, and the Young Playwrights Festival in particular, has really been the jumping-off point for me as an actor, writer, and director. Sharon Henderson and Lauren Nichols are my mentors, and they've helped me develop and pursue the talents, abilities, and dreams that God has given me. But most importantly, they share my values and my faith in Christ. I know that although working with allforOne will most certainly challenge me to achieve new levels in my personal theater journey, I will never be forced to do anything that goes against what I believe. I am deeply grateful and blessed to be a part of this professional, God-centered company.

For a team made up of volunteers that put together beautiful theatrical works of art.  It is awesome to see that they take the arts seriously and use their gifts to share history and thought through the theatre arts.

all for One productions inc	49370	5	/users/profile/50535	michaelw	Volunteer	5	08/06/2010	For me All for One has been a delightful theater company work with.  They hold them selves to a high standard of excellence and integrity.  Being a faith based company they flesh out material that is thought provoking and insightful.  At times they present timely issues that are controversial and other times they present family dramas that are inspiring.  But everything they do has a thread of hope and a promise that things can be better, that God does hear.As an actor I have been challenged, inspired and prayed over by the group.  I have performed in several All for One productions and I feel quite spoiled to work with such a talented and optimistic group artists.If you have not had the pleasure of experiencing an All for One presentation I entreat you to do so.  This coming season is rich with drama, insight and comedy.  Dont miss out.

Sam Ward is such a director.  I had the opportuinity to be cast not once but twice as Juliette in "I Have Before Me A Remarkable Document Given To Me By A Young Lady From Rwanda".  I was fortunate to work with Sam because he knew the play so well and helped me to learn it too.  Sam and Sharon Henderson gave me the chance to shape my character into a fleshed-out human being with hopes, dreams and deep emotions.  I had a wonderful time working with Sam and the rest of the crew for my first play with allforOne productions.  Sam had a very interesting show technically as well.When I played the role the second time, it was not as technically sound aas Sam's.  These are comments from other people.  For instance, the lighting was too dark in some places where the actors' faces were in shadow and the ending of the play was misunderstood by the director who changed the ending when Juliette throws the paper on the floor.  Juliette really comes into her own by the play's end and for Lauren to take this out was an oversight.  I had a great time showing who Juliette is to all those who came to see the play.  Kudos to allforOne for bringing it back a second time.  allforOne is an important voice in the Ft. Wayne community.
all for One productions inc	49129	11	/users/profile/50412	themnetim	Donor	5	08/04/2010	All for One performs an important function in our community in providing dramatic productions with uplifting themes.  Plays with historical content like the life of John Adams have been especially enjoyable and uplifting.  They reach out to the general public but also have a creative impact on school children through plays and other related activities in the schools appropriate for that age level. I know the leaders personally and know them to be people of the highest integrity in all aspects of their work.

I first got involved when one of my daughters was an actress in one of their plays.  I can honestly say that I love attending the plays.  The productions are professional from first to last.  The acting is spectacular.  The choice of plays make them family friendly.  They vary in content from light comedy to thought provoking works.  If you have not seen one of their plays, then you owe it to your self to do so.

But since this is a given, I want to go in a different direction. The thing that always blows me away about this organization is their dedication to high quality, they are disciplined, professional and amazingly proficient.

All for One also sponsors an annual Young Playwright contest in which we have participated. The prizes are motivational, and the recognition of the writing students is done in such a professional, realistic and authentic manner. The kids get the sense they are truly doing something big when putting their thoughts on paper and watching them come to life on stage. Each story is performed 'all out' as if a pro wrote it. Our kids have glowed as a result of the program and are literally constantly seeing ideas for a play now. This is very much an educational organization. They teach children to write. Then they allow them to see and critique their plays. They also educate the public by performing plays with depth and thought provoking historical content. Their work in the schools is for the purpose of teaching students how to deal with real life crises. Great Organization. I've convinced myself to support them financially.

Their plays are always thought provoking, professionally done and acceptable to all audiences. I like the variety of plays they perform.  Some make you laugh, some make you cry, some make you think. Much thought goes into the material they choose.  We are blessed to have such an organization in Fort Wayne, IN.

They bring culture to the community while making it relevant to people unfamiliar with stage plays. Much of their work is written locally. The group has worked together so much that they are a very cohesive group which is very adept at what they do. Their plays are always very enjoyable.

Not only do they produce full-length dramas for adults or families that are thought-provoking as well as entertaining, but they have programs specifically designed with children in mind.  I have seen this working on both their Character Counts series, and their Young Playwrights Festival.  Of all the many venues they use to impact Fort Wayne, the YPF is my personal favorite.  I love to see the glowing faces of the beginning writers as their plays are produced for the first time.

This is an amzing group of idividuals working together to entertain and spread the love of Christ through theatre.

Then we continued to hear of the other programs they provided for schools in the area.This past spring my daughter was asked to be Stage Manager for the production of Crime & Punishment. So a new relationship formed other than just being a theater patron. The inner workings of this organization in preparation for a season of theater is what ultimately shows up on the stage in a production with talented actors, very knowledgeable and creative director and crew, even outside the theater doors with hospitality volunteers providing refreshments and an atmosphere to meet/greet and carry on discussions regarding the drama inside the theater, as well as the initial greeting of the ticket sales staff. From up front to the very back and behind the scenes this AFO organization is branded for excellence in serving God and His people with a rich theatre experience that changes lives.

I was invited by one of the cast to the first production and then I won tickets that were mailed to me for the second.  Both performances were high quality and I thouroughly enjoyed and personally gained from the experience.  I felt welcomed and also received a personal invitation to the Meet and Greet which I thought was an awesome way to build and encourage community.  I look forward to attending shows in the future and if time allows would love to get more involved.
all for One productions inc	48751	2	/users/profile/49939	suzanneg	General Member of the Public	5	07/27/2010	I was invited by one of the actors in a two-person play with a very long title which I may not get totally correct, "I hold before me a letter from a young woman from Rwanda." The performance was totally captivating, moving, entertaining, inspiring. One the charming stage at the Library was some of the bet acting I've seen in this town in 15 years. What a refreshing surprise. The play was brought back the following year and I told many friends about it, some of whom attended. I felt badly for those who did not attend - what a treasured performance they missed. I attended the second year's performance and was still enthralled by the play and the production company. I've attended other productions by "all for One" and they were inspired plays and performers. This company needs more publicity and reviews published so they can be more visible in our community. Advertising takes money and if they had it there would be no limits to what they could accomplish on Fort Wayne's stages. I highly recommend the general public to attend this company's performances!
all for One productions inc	48750	3	/users/profile/49938	sarah32	Former Volunteer	5	07/27/2010	All for One is a one-of-a-kind, professional-quality faith-based theater company in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Their home stage is in the main Allen County Public Library in downtown Fort Wayne. The shows they choose to perform are always the highest caliber, both in content and performance quality, and hit on a variety of relevant and important issues. Therefore I have felt confident inviting friends and family, Christian and non-Christian, because everyone can glean something thought-provoking from their performances. Recently I have seen "Crime and Punishment" and "American Primitive" about the life of John Adams, and was involved in an All for One original production, "A Sentimental Journey" about a radio program during the D-Day events.My hope is that a larger part of the region can find out about All for One, because they may want to be involved, and should take time to see the productions of this theater company which I believe produces the highest quality work in the Fort Wayne area.
all for One productions inc	48742	3	/users/profile/49924	theaterbuff	Volunteer	5	07/26/2010	allforOne Productions feeds my soul.  The plays which they choose are always filled with hope and inspiration. Theater should not only entertain and inform but also uplift especially during this economic downturn.  I am never disappointed.In addition, the plays allforOne chooses to produce promote and reinforce patriotic values, appreciation of family, steadfastness of purpose, and all those other vlues that seem to be missing from the general entertainment lists.It is exciting to know that when I attend a play with this company that it will be one not only of value  but also a script that has not been produced or rarely produced in this area.In addition, the company takes risks--although very solid and wonderful risks--by producing new scripts by Indiana playwrights.This is a considerable feat because there are only two or three theaters in the state which are dedicated to developmental theater.  It is a risk because Indiana patrons are not acustomed to seeing scripts 'not quite there' and not acustomed to supporting the work of a playwright as s/he attempts to perfect a script.In addition, this great company pays attention to young artists and has a fine program for the youth of the area.  It sponsors a seminar to interested youth K-12 who have the interest in learning how to write a play.I could not enthusiastically support allforOne if the quality was not outstanding.  This company is worthy of support because of values, their developmental program for emerging playwrights, and for their youth programs.
all for One productions inc	48733	3	/users/profile/49911	sam14	Volunteer	4	07/26/2010	I had the honor of directing the live theatre production of "I have before me a remarkable document given to me by a young lady from Rwanda".  It was a small two person show with an equally small tech crew of 6, but the impact on the group and our community was huge.  The show told the story of a woman who survived the Rwandan genocide in the '90s and was able to share her experience so it would not happen again and in the process gained new friends and found some of her family.  Telling this story helped us bring this issue to light in our community and how we can reach out to refugees in Fort Wayne.I found all-for-One Productions to be an excellent non profit organization that has really worked to focus their mission and effectiveness in producing quality theatre with a positive message.
A Rosie Place	316704		/users/profile/106590	Christa C.	Client Served	5	10/30/2016	Our family has been involved with A Rosie Place for many years.  We are very grateful to have this wonderful resource in our community.  Our 2 medically fragile daughters have been able to stay for respite weekends which has allowed my husband and I to have a break and even take a short trip to NYC, something we could not have done without help from A Rosie Place.  And the girls enjoy tons of love and attention from the nurses and volunteers during their stay.  They always come home with an amazing art project after their stay.  We feel comfortable knowing the staff listens to our tips and special requests for their care.  We can call anytime during the weekend and get updates, which is very reassuring.  Aside from the weekend respite, A Rosie Place has been doing a great job of identifying resources in the community for families with medically fragile children.  We have gotten to take our girls to some playgroups, learned about different organizations we can join, and get advice from experts and other parents.  Today we get to take our girls to a Halloween party for kids with chronic medical issues at Notre Dame.  We learned about this activity at A Rosie Place.  We enjoy being able to involve our kids in activities, in spite of their limitations due to their medical issues, and A Rosie Place supports us in this mission!

It is a safe environment and a place where they can go to have fun.  They require constant care and it is difficult to spend more than a few hours away from them.  The O'hana Heritage Foundation's "A Rosie Place" is one place that the girls can go and we can a little freedom to enjoy a night out or relax a bit.  They have a very dedicated staff and have put in much time and effort to do something new for families with medically fragile kids.

The things I like the best are the family events and playgroup. My son gets to play with kids just like him. He gets to see other kids with tracheotomy's, kids eating using a feeding tube, and kids rolling around in wheelchairs and other adaptive equipment just like him. I get to talk to other parents just as exhausted and stressed as me caring for their medical fragile child 24 hours a day. They truly understand what it's like to celebrate the small accomplishments their child makes that most people take for granted. I can talk to someone that really knows what it's like to worry that you're back won't give out, so we can continue to transfer our growing children. They understand a simple trip to the store involves packing all emergency equipment, suction machines, transferring the child from wheelchair to car seat, and not to mention lifting the wheelchair in and out of the vehicle because most of us can't  afford wheelchair accessible vehicles. A Rosie place is a great organization to help medically fragile kids.
A Rosie Place	169736	1	/users/profile/224958	jdopey	Client Served	5	09/14/2013	A Rosie Place is a great organization that helps families with severely handicapped children. At A Rosie Place we can make connections with other families dealing with the same medical issues and know we are not alone. They have resource information and support to aid us in this difficult journey we are in. Most of us are to busy caring for our handicapped child we just don't have the time or energy to seek out the information and support A Rosie Place has developed for us. The minute you walk in the door they accept and treat your child as the great gift you have been given. This is a gift in itself because most people look at our children's awkward movements, noises, feeding tubes, wheelchairs, they can not see past the physical issues to see the true normal happy child within.  They are creating a great community to support the children that are blessed to be alive due to modern technologies and advances in the medical field. Thank you A Rosie Place for everything you do.

A Rosie Place	269972	3	/users/profile/358703	Writer	Board Member	5	10/30/2015	I am one of the founders of this non-profit organization which started as a round table conversation between many representatives of our community in an attempt to meet a huge need.The families of medically fragile in our community needed  support to maintain the integrity of their households and respite from 24-hour care for their loved ones. We educated friends and families around us and raised the funds to build a home that serves the needs of this vulnerable population and continue to support the mission with fund raised dollars, even as we recruit highly trained nurses to care for these special fragile children.The growth has been remarkable and the impact on families has been huge while the need for funding continues to grow each year. The small, but wonderful staff who have volunteered  countless hours and work harder than we could ever pay for remain the reason why A Rosie Place has become a gem in our community.Medically fragile children and families deserve this support, but it is expensive, labor-intensive care and with  more support and funding we will get better each year.

The staff is experienced, organized, and very knowledgable about caring for medically fragile children. They are all wonderful examples for me as a nursing student. Everyone involved with ARP works very hard to stay connected with the community, organize events, and make sure there are always tons of fun activities for the kids to do. The kids are an absolute joy to be with and I never leave without a smile on my face.  I couldn't be more thankful for the opportunity to be apart of A Rosie Place's family. I would not think twice about recommending A Rosie Place to anyone and am confident they would love the organization just as much as I do!

It is truly an amazing place with the most wonderful, caring staff and volunteers you can imagine.   The children and family members we have met provide us both with such an amazing experience and feeling we continue to talk about it year round to our family and friends.  They provide such an wonderful environment for all who attend the event and make sure that each and every child is made to feel like the most important person in the world.  Having 5 healthy children and 5 healthy grandsons of our own, it makes us feel even more blessed to be a part of it.  The outpouring of love and compassion the staff show to all is beyond words.  All the children we come in contact with are so warm and caring even though they are battling such handicaps.   Thank you Rosie Place for our wonderful experience!  We hope to have a long relationship with you!

A Rosie Place	91289	1	/users/profile/104373	Cyndy	Client Served	5	06/18/2011	O'Hana Heritage Foundation is an absolutely wonderful organization. They truly care about and understand the trials and tribulations families go through when caring for medically fragile children on a daily basis. I am the parent of a medically fragile child and what O'Hana Heritage Foundation has done for me and my family is priceless. They gave us a much needed break and a weekend my husband and I could spend together with our other two children. Caring for a medically fragile child usually requires skilled nursing care. However, most of us are not nurses, we are just moms and dads learning nursing skills so we are able to take care of our children in our homes 24/7.
A Rosie Place	90859	1	/users/profile/103778	cjorow	Client Served	5	06/14/2011	A Rosie Place is a facility whose time has come. I had been looking for a place to take my daughter Mary Mae, who is 16 years old, and completely dependant on me for everything. I am a single parent, I work and I care for both of my girls (twins) myself. I do not get much down time. Relaxing time where i can regenerate and regroup is nearly unheard of. So when a Rosie Place opened up I was one on the first ones in line to sign up my daughter. The staff is very well trained and professional. The doctor and nurse on staff that day were Mary's former caregivers! Can you beat that!? The facility is state of the art and beautiful also. There were seperate rooms for each quest, a large play area and even a "quite" area with books and computers for enjoyment.
A Rosie Place	90753	1	/users/profile/103625	Jeremy K.	Client Served	5	06/14/2011	As the grandfather,guardian, and sole caregiver of a medically-dependent child, I have made many sacrifices to provide a level of care to my granddaughter that will help her to achieve her full potential.  One of the most difficult sacrifices that I chose to make was that I would no longer have much free time to spend with my teenage daughter, helping her learn and grow into a happy and responsible adult.   I am seldom able to leave the house for an extended period of time, other than working hours.  A Rosie Place allowed me to be able to spend a weekend away from the 24/7 caregiving responsibilities that consume so much of my waking hours, and spend that weekend taking a mini-vacation that has helped me to strengthen my bond with my daughter.  Because of my granddaughters special needs, it is very difficult for me to find qualified caregivers for her.  She requires a highly-skilled medical professional to care for her.  I do not entrust her care to many people, and I am very selective in the places that I allow her to go.  A Rosie Place, however, won me over almost immediately with their warm and welcomig atmosphere, skilled and knowledgeable staff, and the overall feeling of peace and home that pervades the facility.  It is obvious to anyone who walks through the front door that A Rosie Placehas been, and contunues to be, a labor of love.

This so very important to their own health!  Many winners - the medically fragile child and their family!

Paws and Think Inc	275348	2	/users/profile/144980	Kathy J.	Volunteer	5	01/01/2016	Our Reading Education Assistance Dogs program got a late start at IPS 42, Elder Diggs Elementary.  This school is in one of the poorest neighborhoods in town, but the kids don't know that.  We had only been there the week before and were just getting to know the kids, and they were just getting to know the dogs they were reading to.  These first few visits are most important in building relationships, then the reading will follow.  I was surprised and warmed when one of the little 2nd graders reading to Harriet leaned over and gave me a hug as she left to go back to class.  I felt warmed as though I'd been touched by an angel.   I think we can make a difference in their lives, one at a time.  And I'm proud of that.

The Youth-Canine program, always felt to be what set us apart from being just another Pet Therapy group, has enjoyed tremendous success this year at the Juvenile Detention Center.  Touching the lives of these kids with the unconditional love of a dog produces amazing changes.  Many of them have never known such love before.  And the Reading Education Assistance Dogs (R.E.A.D.) are helping kids achieve grade-level reading, so critical to success in life.   More volunteers are needed to serve additional Title 1 schools with this great program.  I can't think of a more meaningful organization to devote my time and energies to!

Our programs include Youth-Canine education workshops that help kids learn listening skills, following directions, and positive training benefits.  They instill a sense of pride in children that may never felt successful before in their young lives.  Paws and Think also provides Pet Therapy with registered, insured therapy teams.  We work with memory care units, adult day care centers, libraries and schools.  We have recently become affiliated with Reading Education Assistance Dogs (R.E.A.D.) and are bringing that program into the schools where the need is greatest.

We offer therapy dog teams for schools, libraries, hospitals, group therapy and other needs as they arise.  Our teams volunteer their time for reading programs within schools as well.  The second part of our mission is to match the potential of at-risk youth and canines to enhance the lives of both.  We use temperament -tested shelter animals in programs for at-risk youth to demonstrate and teach the power of positive reinforcement and responsibility.  This becomes a win-win when the dogs become more adoptable and the youth benefit from positive reinforcement and an increase in self respect and confidence.

When an organization is headed by such a team as this, it will thrive and make a difference in others' lives.  I have witnessed that in the elementary school that my dog & I have volunteered in as part of the R.E.A.D. program (Reading Education Assistance with Dogs).

We all look forward to Miss Susie and Lucy or Miss Kathy and Mater coming every week to spend time in our classroom.  My students all have time to read with the therapy dog and adult as well as just talk, pet the dog, or have the therapy dog do tricks.  ALL of my kids have improved their reading abilities SO much, which was not really the real reason we started this program.  Two of my kids were afraid of dogs and hadn't had any interactions with dogs.  Now they all know appropriate behavior with animals and always show respect to the dogs and their owners.  I am so hopeful to continue this partnership next year with Paws and Think.  Miss Susie and my kids have really bonded and she even brings gifts to the kids, picks out books for the kids and donated materials for our class.

I happily found Paws and Think, and am so pleased to be serving in an organization that is true to its vision, purpose, and goals.  I have a Golden Retriever who has brought great joy into my life, and now I get to share him with others in meaningful ways.  We go to elementary schools as part of the READ program where Sailor listens as children read aloud to him, we visit the VA Hospital weekly where Sailor comforts patients, staff, and visitors to the hematology unit, and we also visit area nursing homes and even colleges to help students de-stress during finals.  As an organization, I was impressed right off the bat with the follow through from the staff -- I was contacted very soon after I applied to become a volunteer and was encouraged to get involved right away.  I have developed a great respect for the other volunteers who spend a tremendous amount of effort and time in making the organization successful and run smoothly.  The canine - human bond is an extraordinary relationship, and it's delightful to be a part of an organization that seeks to serve the Indianapolis area in creative ways through the utilization of well trained and well loved dogs.

As an educator for 40 years, I have seen many trends in education be implemented, some with great success and some without.  After watching children interact with the Paws and Think program, I can honestly exclaim that I have seen nothing like the experiences these folks, both 2 and 4 legged, brought to the table.  This program touched the lives of many children in a caring and nurturing manner.  I witnessed children who showed no interest in reading become actively interested and involved.  Further, children with special needs, socially, emotionally, and academically became inspired to enhance their abilities on a very personal level.  In all of my years of teaching, I have never experienced what the Paws and Think program gave to our students.  On behalf of my former students and myself, thank you for touching our lives.
Paws and Think Inc	176330	2	/users/profile/232738	rhayashilts	Board Member	5	10/10/2013	My involvement with Paws & Think began when I volunteered for a Youth Canine program. These programs consist of using dogs from Humane Societies or Animal Care & Control, and matching them up with kids (such as those in detention centers, pregnant teens, etc.) who teach the dogs basic commands. Not only does this make the dogs more "adoptable" but it also teaches the kids how to use positive reinforcement -- while boosting their self-esteem. Watching the bond form between the kids and these dogs is simply magical.
Paws and Think Inc	172441	3	/users/profile/228344	Hollyhal	Client Served	5	09/30/2013	I'm a children's librarian at the Carmel Clay Public Library. We've had monthly visits from the dogs and volunteers for a few years now, and this has been one of our best-received programs ever. For so many reluctant or struggling readers, the simple act of reading aloud to these dogs has opened up a whole new world. One parent told me that she struggled to get her son to practice his reading even for a few minutes a day , until he got involved with our "Paws to Read" program, which inspired him to practice at home for a full hour! He told his mom that he wanted to be ready for his appointment with the Paws and Think dog. And just this past weekend, a mom watched in amazement as her child had her first chance to read to a dog--her daughter ordinarily didn't like reading aloud, but there she was, confidently reading to Ginny, the little dog who listened happily with no judgment! 
Paws and Think Inc	172272	3	/users/profile/228020	Caring4others	Client Served	5	09/28/2013	Paws and Think is a wonderful non-profit organization that is constantly looking to benefit others. Their pet therapy dogs visit residents in nursing homes several times a month and are excellent therapy for those suffering from dementia. The volunteers reminisce with the residents about their own pets that they owned at one time and being able to touch an animal brings back poignant, happy memories. A true blessing to have Paws and Think as volunteers!
Paws and Think Inc	167298	3	/users/profile/222151	MWooton	General Member of the Public	4	09/05/2013	Paws and Think dog teams volunteer weekly at the Glendale Library branch, helping children practice their reading skills.  We have dogs come in three nights per week, and have met a variety of teams.  Although our staff are dog lovers and many patrons enjoy just petting the dogs, I truly know that specific dogs have made a huge difference in the lives of some of our children and their families.  One little girl, who came to the program barely speaking, can now read fluently and donated all of her Lemonade Day money to the Library for Paws and Think.  We recently met a mother and daughter who just moved to Indianapolis -- her mother said that coming to the Library and reading to the dogs really helped her daughter adjust to all of the changes in her life.  She could not thank us and Paws to Think enough for offering the program.  The teams have also helped us reach out into the community, attending Nite Out Against Crime events and walking in a local parade!  We enjoy have Paws & Think teams come to the Glendale Library -- they truly add to the identity of the branch and impact the lives of our patrons.
Social Promise Inc.	305276		/users/profile/396518	mfennell	Donor	5	09/18/2016	The work being done in Uganda is so impressive and impactful.  And Social Promise really leverages volunteers to make the donations go far. The Uganda education events for students in the U.S. are an important component of this organization's work.
Social Promise Inc.	305196		/users/profile/396442	Maureen56	Donor	5	09/17/2016	Social Promise is an amazing charity and one where you can really see your dollars put to real life use.  I have had the pleasure of knowing and supporting this charity for a few years now, and have even run the NYC marathon in support, because I was so impressed with the work and aid this charity provides to the people of Gulu.  The people behind Social Promise are some of the most passionate and hard working around.  They have made a difference in the lives of many.  
Social Promise Inc.	305067		/users/profile/396289	Writer	Donor	5	09/16/2016	I took my children to Social Promise's annual "African Adventure" event, and it was a tremendous learning experience for them.  This event was a great way to raise awareness about African culture among even the youngest of participants.  The organizers of the event had come up with very creative ways to fully engage the children, and teach the children about their peers living in rural Uganda.  This helped raise the children's cultural and socio-economic awareness.  It was fantastic,and we will go back every year! 
Social Promise Inc.	305062		/users/profile/396281	avk8m	Donor	5	09/16/2016	Our daughter, Eliza looks forward to the African Adventure every year.  She runs around with her passport getting it stamped at all the different countries. She has a blast!
Social Promise Inc.	304810		/users/profile/395995	MacDPU	General Member of the Public	5	09/15/2016	The work that Social Promise does is so important, and the staff is so professional and committed. Their fundraising and awareness-raising activities in my campus and wider community has been first-rate.
Social Promise Inc.	304571	4	/users/profile/395760	Writer	Donor	5	09/14/2016	I have known the founder of Social Promise, Sharon Crary,  since she was in kindergarten.  Last year, we discussed the possibility of us going to  Uganda so I could see the hospital and orphanage  Social Promise supports.  This year, the two of us traveled to Gulu and spent ten days observing their needs and deciding what Social Promise would do in  the upcoming year. Both the hospital and orphanage are incredible places.  The majority of the people working in the hospital which has a nursing school are Ugandans.  There are very few similarities between the Lacor Hospital and a hospital in the United States.   All of the people I had the privilege to meet were so caring and dedicated to their work.  The orphanage has approximately 100 children.  They live with a "mother" in a cottage with 6 or 7 "siblings".  It was designed to mimic a home with children of varying ages.   They are all surrounded by love, but have very little in the way of possessions.  Neither the hospital or the orphanage would meet our standards. But both are filled with caring people.  My trip to Uganda filled me with awe of Sharon.  Sharon was always greeted with smiles and thanks for what Social Promise has accomplished. She has done so much for the people of Gulu.  Yet, there is so much more to do.  Our donations will make it possible for Social Promise to continue and increase the special things that are done in Gulu.
Social Promise Inc.	304218		/users/profile/395393	ahoward37	Volunteer	5	09/13/2016	Social Promise provides many benefits to not only Ugandan nonprofits, but also educates our community about the culture and needs of Uganda. I enjoy volunteering for Social Promise every year during the educational outreach program.
Social Promise Inc.	303894		/users/profile/395051	nshifa	Volunteer	5	09/13/2016	Truly speaking, I am totally impressed by the hardworking, caring members of this organization! I see their love for the underserved communities around the world. I see the members giving up their vacation and working with these underprivileged populations. I see the members in all age try to create consciousness around them! I see young members make necklaces, bracelets and other crafts to sell and raise money for the needy communities. I am fascinated with their love and care. Also I am encouraged to think about the disadvantaged community around me!
Social Promise Inc.	296805		/users/profile/387583	bshifatu	Volunteer	5	07/17/2016	Social Promise is a wonderful organization that helps promote awareness about the disparities in healthcare and living standards in Uganda. What I love about Social Promise, that is so different from most non-profit organizations that work in developing countries is that Social promise partners with already established organizations in Northern Uganda in ways that do not perpetuate the white savior mentality and create further dependency on the community for outside help. Social Promise allows people that actually live in the community to decide what needs need to be addressed and the ways that they can be addressed to benefit the community in the best possible way. As someone from a developing country as well, I know the importance of dismantling the "white savior mentality"  and viewing the people you are helping as equals and I believe Social Promise does a wonderful job at this.  
Social Promise Inc.	227094		/users/profile/290825	petercc	Donor	5	10/27/2014	Social Promise is a fabulous non-profit.  Their dedication to the people they have charged themselves with helping is unmatched.  Having seen the conditions and need in northern Uganda first hand I truly understand why Social Promise had to be started, and I know that they are doing a great service the people in that area.
Social Promise Inc.	227057		/users/profile/290786	Bob34	Donor	5	10/27/2014	Social Promise is a wonderful and unique organization. First, they have deep knowledge of the people they serve in northern Uganda. The Board travels there to review the organizations they support and currently a Board member is living and helping at St. Mary's Hospital Lacor.  Secondly, their partners in northern Uganda, St. Jude's and St. Mary's are wonderful, well-established social organizations that meet the wide-ranging  health, education and living needs of Uganda's most needy...orphans, the disabled, women and the desperately poor.  Finally, the Founders and Board of Social Promise take no compensation for their work other than the love, gratitude and thanks from the many, many people whose lives they have touched.  Social Promise is indeed a "great non-profit" worthy of support. 
Social Promise Inc.	226072		/users/profile/53462	cmm384	Board Member	5	10/24/2014	I have never met a group of people more dedicated to a cause. Sharon and Sarah, the founders of Social Promise, take time every day out of their very busy schedules to think of ways to raise more money for our partners in Uganda. Both women are so intelligent and hard working and are a pleasure to be on the board with. Our partners in Uganda do such a wonderful job using the funds we raise to better the lives of so many in Uganda, that even though we are a small non-profit, a little really does go a long way and it feels like we are making a big difference. Lacor hospital is able to provide health care to so many people in Gulu at an affordable cost, and St. Jude is able to educate not only the children at the home, but other children in the village. It feels great working with such motivated, inspiring people. 
Social Promise Inc.	225834		/users/profile/289586	Tom_73	Donor	5	10/23/2014	The work being done for this organization is tremendous! I found out about this organization through a family member.  All the work being done to help this wonderful organization is shown through its dedicated members.   All the tireless efforts they do to raise funds for this charity shows that they really care about what they do.  The events they put on gives a person an "awareness" of the struggles and hardships these people face everyday.  I strongly support their mission  and will support them in any way that I can.
Social Promise Inc.	225738		/users/profile/289497	ELMG	Donor	5	10/23/2014	Amazing charity that helps  Ugandan  hospital, orphanage and school, and also teaches even little children in the U.S. About life in Uganda. Truly worthwhile and led by devoted board members!
Social Promise Inc.	225686		/users/profile/243079	AB14	General Member of the Public	5	10/23/2014	Social Promise is a wonderful organization that truly helps people in need in Gulu, Uganda. It also goes to great efforts to educate people in the US about how people in Africa live--and that we need to be aware of how easy it is for us to help make their lives even just a little bit better. 
Social Promise Inc.	186099		/users/profile/243079	AB14	Volunteer	5	10/30/2013	Social Promise makes a difference in the lives of children in Uganda and in the US. By organizing educational fundraisers, Social Promise helps American kids learn how children in Africa live. They learn about their struggles and their beautiful cultures. Social Promise raises money to send Ugandan girls to school, to help Ugandan people pay for healthcare, and to help support children with special needs. This nonprofit truly is a special organization with wonderful goals and a genuine mission.
Social Promise Inc.	225336		/users/profile/289112	shmc	Board Member	5	10/23/2014	Social Promise is an organization you can trust.  This is evidenced by the fact that 100% of our board members are also donors.  We believe in the mission and we support the mission.  Because we are a volunteer only run organization, the contributions you make to the organization go directly to the people of Uganda- our overhead costs are very low.  
Social Promise Inc.	225305		/users/profile/289079	jrae	Donor	5	10/23/2014	Social Promise is truly an amazing organization! All funds collected are helping to improve the lives of children in Gulu, Uganda.  If you haven't already, please donate to this wonderful nonprofit. 
Social Promise Inc.	220543		/users/profile/284203	ekirkwood2	Volunteer	5	10/07/2014	I had the opportunity to travel to Gulu, Uganda with the founding Board Members of Social Promise in 2011, which had a huge impact on the way I now view non-profits who support areas in Africa. Social Promise works to understand the issues that people face on a daily basis through listening to community leaders, parents, and children. From what they hear, they provide sustainable structures that will support the community down the road. One of the most important workshops that I was involved with during my 2 week travel  was getting the surrounding community of St. Judes Children's Home and educating children and adults on physical and mental disabilities. This had an enormous impact on how individuals viewed those with disabilities and was one of many conversations that Social Promise initiated but allowed the Director of St. Judes Children's Home lead. Social Promise is an organization that listens to the community, thinks how they want to have an impact and finally acts to provide support to the communities in Gulu. Social Promise is a wonderful organization that continues to grow and share the love of giving. 
Social Promise Inc.	209361		/users/profile/272121	franciskfordjour	Board Member	5	08/08/2014	I joined the board 3 months ago. This is an organization that genuinely enjoys helping. Last year, Social Promise sent $80,000 to their partners in Uganda thanks to the generosity of our donors and well wishers. Social Promise does not only provide financial support to our partners in Gulu, but we also send medical supplies such as wheel chairs for use by the disabled in the community. One great thing about this organization is how we make sure that all the donations go to benefit the community we are supporting. One way by which we do this is by sending at least one board member each year to Gulu to check on our partners (St.Jude Children's Home and Lacor Hospita)l. These visits enable us to see and experience the impact our donations are having on the community.  I will encourage everyone to support this great cause and if possible join us to Gulu on our next trip there.
Social Promise Inc.	186598		/users/profile/243610	nydonor	Donor	5	10/31/2013	This is an organization that truly makes the most of its donations, putting every dollar directly toward improving people's lives. Social Promise holds wonderful family events that will allow you and your children to learn about life in Uganda and support those in need while having a great time. 
Social Promise Inc.	186410		/users/profile/243422	Skurita	Donor	5	10/31/2013	Social Promise is a ground-up organization with high goals of improving lives in need in Uganda. Their people are passionate and they are making an impact. In addition, they operate with very low overheads so the dollars are put to the actual cause not office supplies.
Social Promise Inc.	186237		/users/profile/243235	hawk43	Board Member	5	10/30/2013	I believe we all struggle in life trying to justify where we fit in as individuals and as a species.  What can we truly do to make a difference in such a vast and unforgiving world?  What impact do our actions and decisions really have on the path our planet and its inhabitants travel down? These are questions that I constantly look to answer for myself as I try to find my place in our world.  Despite the uncertainties I may have with my place in the world I know that the work Social Promise does to support the children of St. Jude and the community of Gulu is nothing short of  miraculous.  Social Promise connect people from across the United States and the world that feel a need to serve those that are currently in need of immense support.  When I was in Gulu on behalf of Social Promise I shuttered to think where the children of St. Jude would be without the help of Social Promise and others like it.  Social Promise provides hope to kids that otherwise would likely be deceased or worse.  Social Promise was built on a foundation of love and caring and the desire to construct positive outcomes in a community that is in need of great support but that is full of extraordinary individuals.  I still dont know where I belong and what I should be doing to leave a positive impact on this world but I know that when Im working towards supporting the people of Gulu, and especially the children of St. Jude, I know Im headed in the right direction.
Social Promise Inc.	186200		/users/profile/243189	Mbadelson	Donor	5	10/30/2013	I couldn't feel more strongly about this charity.  It is truly an organization that believes in getting its "hands dirty". They've made such great strides in improving the lives of the people in Gulu, and I am so proud to have been convinced to become a part. 
Social Promise Inc.	186195		/users/profile/243183	Douglas M.	Donor	5	10/30/2013	Social Promise has recently held two events in New York to raise funds for health and educational needs in Uganda.  The event held at Brooks Brothers at the Miracle Mile in Manhasset has generated an ardent group of supporters who are sincerely interested in engendering positive change.  The African Adventure event in New York brings together families responsive to the needs in these Ugandan communities, and interested in giving their children a sense of life in Uganda.  I have been very fortunate to have seen the hard work that the Social Promise volunteers have put into these events to make them so successful.    
Social Promise Inc.	186147		/users/profile/243127	Amybeal	General Member of the Public	5	10/30/2013	This is a wonderful charitable organization.  They are providing much needed help to Uganda.
Social Promise Inc.	186127	1	/users/profile/243107	Sally321	Donor	5	10/30/2013	I became aware of Social Promise through my son, who traveled to Uganda to help the people that this charity supports. For the past year he has shared stories and pictures of the children and adults with desperate needs that are benefiting from the funds from Social Promise. While the stories shared are often heartbreaking, it is evident that many of these people have a much brighter future because of what Social Promise has been able to do for them. I love to follow this charity's Facebook page and read inspirational accounts and see beautiful pictures of those who are benefiting from Social Promise.  It is clear that the Board is made up of dedicated and highly qualified people, who by virtue of their respective backgrounds, have a good understanding of the needs of the people in Northern Uganda, as well as a deep desire to support them and make a difference in their lives!  I completely trust Social Promise to steward my funds honestly and well!!
Social Promise Inc.	186126		/users/profile/243106	Howard99	Donor	5	10/30/2013	  Social Promise is a relatively new nonprofit dedicated to assisting the poor and young children in Uganda, particularly in the city of Gulu.  The donations are funneled directly to a hospital and school / orphanage in Gulu.  There is very little overhead as the directors and other individuals helping with the fundraising serve without remuneration.  The impact of the donations is very significant as a relatively few US dollars goes a long way in Gulu toward providing medicines, wheelchairs, books, educational facilities and scholarships for continued study.  Donations are not used for salaries either in the US or in Uganda.  I would strongly urge people to look at the great work this nonprofit has accomplished in a short time with relatively few dollars.  If you can't contribute, perhaps you can contact the directors about other ways they can help these needy people, particularly the children.
Social Promise Inc.	186059		/users/profile/243041	DMcEvilly	Donor	5	10/30/2013	Social Promise has helped open my eyes to true everyday struggles of children and families in Africa as well as the good that comes from those who really care.  The dedicated drive of Social Promise inspires me and my family to help financially.  Even though my children are young, I anticipate that they will grow to feel the connection as strongly as I do.  I have witnessed the life long dedication of those behind the drive of Social Promise and am proud to help aid their momentum!  
Social Promise Inc.	185818		/users/profile/242789	Ellen48	Volunteer	5	10/30/2013	Social Promise is dedicated to improving the lives of impoverished people in Northern Uganda.  It partners with both St. Jude Children's Home and School and Latour Hospital and it has helped to build a school and homes for the disabled and to send students to secondary schools. Innumerable children have learned about the needs of children in Africa through Social Promise's African Adventure, and communities all around the United States have been inspired to help.ation young'sI have been touched to learn of the need for wheelchairs in Africa, and the children's excitement at receiving the books that teens in a local church collected, boxed and sent to St. Jude.
Social Promise Inc.	185661		/users/profile/242631	jonny123	Donor	5	10/30/2013	Social Promise is a great organization that not only helps families and children in Uganda, but educates children here in the US through its fundraising activities and events that children are children wherever they may live, and that having a connection to and an appreciation of the experiences of others make all of us better world citizens.
Social Promise Inc.	185585		/users/profile/242553	Sarah153	Board Member	5	10/30/2013	I am a member of the board of directors at Social Promise, and being a part of this organization has been a life changing experience for both me and my family.  I have had the privilege of inspiring change for a community of people that are truly in need.  Not only have i benefited from my work at Social Promise, my children have as well.  They have learned that not all people in our world live life with access to food, medicine, clothing and school.  Even though my children are young, they too are eager to help others in need.  I am planning my first trip to Gulu in June of 2014, and I couldn't be more excited to meet the people living there and to see first hand how important the work we are doing here at Social Promise impacts families living there.
Social Promise Inc.	185571		/users/profile/242541	Ranika C.	Donor	5	10/30/2013	I took my young daughters to a Social Promise event - it was by far the best family event I have attended.  The children learned about different issues through interactive experiences - carrying a jug of water from the well, tying a baby doll to you while you are working, making toys out of water bottles and string.  They still talk about it and ask questions about things they learned that day. 
Social Promise Inc.	167736		/users/profile/222601	mbhudson7	Volunteer	5	09/05/2013	I spent some time in Gulu, Uganda with Social Promise and the work they are doing is incredibly important to the community there. St. Judes has an indelible effect on Gulu and the surrounding area, without which, the community would be missing a truly essential need.
Social Promise Inc.	167510		/users/profile/222373	ekirkwood	Donor	5	09/05/2013	In 2011, I traveled with the board members to Uganda to provide support to Social Promise. The impact that Social Promise has on the community is outstanding. The relationships that have been built with the board members of Social Promise are everlasting and continuing to grow. Social Promise truly cares about working with Lacor Hospital along with St. Judes Children whether it be providing them with wheel chairs for children or educating the community on self care. 
Social Promise Inc.	167483		/users/profile/222350	Auntie Deb	Donor	5	09/05/2013	i learned about this organization through a family member and saw many pictures of the many sweet little happy faces surrounding the people who work for social promise.   i feel the help people give to social promise, goes directly to help thieir people.

The have seen first hand the needs of the people.  I hope many can give to educate more children and provide basic neccessities like wheelchairs so that the people can rise above the severe poverty.   
Social Promise Inc.	164091		/users/profile/217974	forjawsco2005	Volunteer	5	08/02/2013	I visited the Children's home in Gulu, Uganda which Social Promise supports. The people there are cheerful and grateful for the little things. Everyone was very hospitable and they welcomed me into their home with much joy. They were willing to share their stories and plans for the future. Directors of the home take very good care of all the children and provide each child with his/her basic needs with the little funds they get. I will therefore encourage everyone to donate through Social Promise to the Children's Home. Every dollar and penny can help make life a bit more comfortable for the children. I would also commend the directors of this great organization for the great things they are doing. Please follow the organization on Facebook for updates and events.

One day hope house came to pick up like 3 bags of clothing we left outside with a note saying "hope house" they felt the need to look for more bags around my house and take that to which was NOT okay . My father travels a lot for work and left a bag of his clothes near the back door,not the same kind of bag the donation clothes were in, and hope house took all of his work clothes and even took his LUNCH BAG. If we leave clothes for you guys specifically with a sign on it saying hope house why take anything near by? After noticing his stuff was gone I tried calling day after day after day with no luck reaching a human being. Never donating to them again stay out of our property we will donate to a more professional donation.

Hope House was our family's savior and helping my family get back on the right track and heal many wounds.  It has been over a year and half  ago since my 2 daughters were there and they are still living a clean life both have graduated from college this year something I thought we would never see, they have become very successful  in there jobs as well.  This organization has taught them how to live normal lives and clean one as well I know I cannot even come close to expressing my words for this organization.  Thank you Hope House for giving back the girls I raised love all of you guys! Carrie Gumbiner
Hope House Inc	127882		/users/profile/173003	cgumbiner	Donor	5	10/23/2012	Hope House has saved my families life they helped two of my daughters learn how to get off of drugs they were addicted for five years and made me and my husbands life miserable and broken hearted.  We came to the point that we knew we needed to kick them out of our house cause we were doing them no good just enabling.  Thank god for Hope House cause no parent wants there girls on the streets especially in the condition they were in at that time but Hope House did take them in and taught them how to live again and that life is much better than being addicted to something you need to have everyday.  They taught them how to become responsible adults and how to take care of themselves but best of all they taught them that they have self worth and that they are good people.  But most of all they also helped me as a parent to start saying NO to my girls and that it would get easier to say the NO word to them.  Also the support they gave me and my husband I could call about anytime and they would talk with me and counsel me as well with what I should be doing to make my girls recovery more successful.  I love there staff so much this place is AWSOME to me!!  Thanks Hope House for giving me Hope as well.    Ken & Carrie Gumbiner

Also I collaborate and meet with local agencies to develop and be part of programs that offer solutions to reduce homelessness.  Hope House is a top achiever in my field. I am constantly reminded of their professionalism when I receive documentation that is complete and accurate. The management is leading the conversation in the community and sharing expertise to eliminate barriers to employment not just for their clients, but with all the community in mind.

They are committed to working with the women that they serve and extremely knowlegable about their needs a well.  I have seen many innovations over the years, one of which it the Beads that help women develop skills that they can use when they have learned to live a drug free lifestyle and no longer require the intensive support of the Hope House.

Hope House Inc	157560		/users/profile/208953	Janicec	Volunteer	5	05/10/2013	I worked as an intern for 7 months. I grew and changed along with the women that Hope House Services. I watched the broken hearten and hopeless women come back to life.  I watch the emptiness in their eyes change; into hope and happiness. As I watched the women confront their issues it also taught me to confront mine. To see the face of a woman when she can hold her baby again and be clean when she does is amazing. The staff was wonderful and willing to embrace anyone that that walked through the door. You truly feel like you belong. Words alone can not describe what the Hope House gives to women everyday. It truly is a House of Hope. I will be forever grateful that I was permitted to experience life through the eyes of the Hope House.

If not for Hope House my BFF would not be able to enjoy her children who have been through the program and have become successful young adults. I have had the opportunity to participate in several functions that help to fund this program with great support.  Hope House is a top notch organization with a staff that have hearts of GOLD.  Thank you for saving my friend and her family from addiction.

It takes a holistic approach and caters each treatment plan to meet individual needs. Hope House prepares their clients for life in the outside world. I volunteered at Hope House for an internship for school. I learned so much while volunteering at Hope House and I really enjoyed getting to know the women that lived and worked there. The enviornment is warm and welcoming. I would highly reccomend Hope House to anyone woman struggling with substance abuse. 
Hope House Inc	124528		/users/profile/169415	Mlhunter	Volunteer	4	10/04/2012	I was a counseling intern at Hope House for about 15 weeks, providing group and individual counseling to the residents. I was amazed by the dedication of the staff to the clients, providing resources, a listening ear, and "tough love" when necessary. The clients told me often how much they appreciated the staff. As a student, I was so thankful for the supervision and advice given to me by the staff. I felt free to grow and try new things while interning there. Most importantly, I saw first-hand how the lives of the women are dramatically changed by going through this program. The program has so much to offer their clients, including groups, volunteer hours, and daily plans to help organize. The women are not only supported by staff, but also by each other. I often left from interning extremely excited to be a part of this organization. 
Hope House Inc	124527		/users/profile/169414	Cindy Dohm	Client Served	5	10/04/2012	Hope House is the most amazing recovery program that there is.  When I came to Hope House 15 years ago I had no hope of staying clean and I had no desire to continue drinking and living the way my life was.  I found myself making a choice: choose to live or choose to die.  Those were the only options I had at that point.   Though I had had completed several drug and alcohol programs in the past, I just couldn't "get it" , long term.  I had no doubt that I had the right information.  In fact I could have probably easily facilitated the actual drug and alcohol group sessions.  I just could not "take it out of the book" and put it into action.  Hope House taught me how to do that.  At Hope House I learned what had been missing all of the other times I had tried to get clean and sober.  Upon arriving at Hope House the one major difference between this program and so many others is, "I actually felt that I belonged and the people really did care about me.  This made all the dirrerence to me.  I learned how to apply the principles of Alcoholics Anonymous to my every day life, not just my drinking but to all areas.  I was able to learn why I drank.  I discovered I had a "thinking problem" not just a "drinking problem". Hope House gave me true Hope.  I gained the will and desire to "Live", not just exist.  I was able to get and keep a job and become self-sufficient.  This enabled me to take care of my financial and legal obligations and eventually to re-gain custody of my oldest daughter.  That eventually led me to  re-unite with my ex-husband and youngest daughter.  Because of Hope House I was able to become the wife, mother, daughter, sister and mentor that I was always meant to be.  since my journey began 15 years ago I have been able to maintain my sobriety and have a positive influence on my children and my immediate family.  My children have successfully completed college and are now following their hearts in doing what they truly love to do.  It's is ironic that they both work in the field of social work and or with adults and children with mental and physical disabilities.  I must say that I have worked for Hope House now fsince 1999 and through the help of Hope House and "the grace of GOD", my biggest "curse" has become my greatest blessing and I have been able to positively affect the lives of not only my family but also play a small part in the daily miracles of the lives of so many others.  There is no doubt why Hope House should receive 2012 Top Rated Awards.

That goes for both co-workers and my residents! Everyday great things are happening in the lives of women who are in recovery and it is so special to be a part of it. To watch each of these individuals grow as women, as mother's, as a productive member of society is truly a humbling experience. If it weren't for Hope House and the services we offer, these women would continue to struggle down the path(s) of desctruction and inevitably death.

The abundance of clarity, skill, knowledge, guidance, reassurance, support, sense of achievement, love, community, opportunity, etc., etc. cannot be matched! The staff, lead by the Executive Director, Mary Etheart, is like no other! The way they believe in the women living there, the compassion and personal experience they bring in to every encounter, the structure they instill, the encouragement and navigation towards new beginnings, self worth, and HOPE each resident receives is nothing less than magical! Hope House is a blessing to so many in and outside of the community. They CERTAINLY deserve this award!!!

The staff provided excellent care to the women they serve.  I saw life changing moments that helped solidify my desire to become a counselor.  These life altering moments can be seen during their annual Celebration of Success where women share their stories of hope through the services provided at Hope House.  This organization allowed me to see the importance of creating a caring environment conducive for recovery.

My friends mother was dealing with addiction and it was costing her her family.  They first time I saw her after Hope House had helped her get clean I barley recognized her!  She was like a new person! My friend has her mother back and her grand kids have their grandma back.  Hope House is an amazing place and a great asset to the community.

They know what the residents need are willing to help them get there. They are loving enough to push when the residents need to be pushed and supportive enough to support them when they need it as well. They have such a well balanced approach to addiction. They give just the right amount of healthy support and corrective direction in order for the most effective change to happen. Staff is welcoming to anyone who volunteers there. They make you feel right at home which in turn helps you connect with the residents. The executive director is outstanding at what she does. She is very adapt at explaining the actions and behaviors of the residents and the overall addiction process. 
Hope House Inc	124215		/users/profile/51222	heather17	General Member of the Public	5	10/02/2012	The Hope House Saved My Family -- and most importantly my Mother! If she wouldn't have had the Hope House to guide her, direct her and teach her that she can OVERCOME her past obstacles. I know that my children would not have a NANNY SHELLEY! They saved her life and her family! She still has them backing her helping her along with all the others who come through the program. Many programs find it hard to see addicts succeed -- but it's not the program it's the person and I feel like the Hope House gave my MOM hope and she was finally ready to take ahold of it they set all the points to succeed and move forward in front of her. She is a MIRACLE and so is every aspect of the HOPE HOUSE, in my eyes and I'm sure in the eyes of any successful person in recovery who has and is in the continued process of RECOVERY! 
Hope House Inc	50688	6	/users/profile/51222	heather17	General Member of the Public	5	08/19/2010	Five years ago my mother was incarcerated for meth use. That left me in a very hard situation. I had a 1 year old of my own and a baby on the way! Then on top of that..I had two teenage sisters who came to live with me during my mothers struggles w/ the system and herself. It didnt' take, but a couple months to see "my mom" come back to life..with smiles and confindence in herself. The HOPE HOUSE of Ft. Wayne saved her life..and we couldn't express how much we believe that the HOPE HOUSE saved her life and our family from falling apart. She is our "Miracle Mom" and we "Luv her More and More Every Day!" We luv you Shelley Mitchell (5 years clean - August 23rd, 2010)

Hope House Inc	70394		/users/profile/76953	Onca	Volunteer	4	02/17/2011	I think Hope House has such great results because they educate the women.  Many facilities give shelter, but with out giving them the tools how to change there is little results.  I was surprised with all the rules, but it  help the women with dicipline and direction for when they live on their own.  It is important to have the structure that they have not had for a long time in their lives.  It teaches them to be responsible for their actions and how to work as a team and care for others.  I was pleased to see their faith, friendship, and support of each other.  
Hope House Inc	68355		/users/profile/74685	Lisa Boyd	Board Member	4	02/15/2011	As a Board member of Hope House, I have gotten to see first hand how they have changed the lives of many chemically dependant women. Their program has helped many women who have hit the lowest point of their lives, usually involving homelessness, jail time or even losing custody of their children. The program gives the residents structure, training, counseling,  and strength to turn their lives around. These women have gone on to earn college degrees, own their own homes and most importantly given back to help women who are currently in a situation similar to theirs. They do wonderful work! 
Hope House Inc	68139		/users/profile/74459	KG777	Donor	5	02/14/2011	There are few places for woman, homeless and coping with addiction to turn in our community.  Many are willing to help for a price but few are willing to provide the care that Hope House offers to Fort Wayne, Indiana woman with no means.  Hope House offers a path to a fulfilling life for those that have no place to turn.  Historically, Indiana has dealt with addicts by incarcerating them but jails and prisons provide no real solutions and are widely believed to have a negative impact on the potential for recovery.  Our prisons are overflowing with non-violent drug offenders at a substantial cost to the public.  Imagine what Hope House could do with a fraction of the money that is wasted on such incarceration.  Perhaps one day our legislators will see the light and begin to fund programs that actually make a difference.  Until then, let those with loving hearts be the good Samaritans and support Hope House.  
Hope House Inc	41201	6	/users/profile/42077	karen23	Board Member	5	05/27/2010	Hope House is a great organization with a high percentage of success.

Hope House Inc	39872	9	/users/profile/40821	connie8	Client Served	5	05/21/2010	I lived at Hope House INC back in 1989. They had a good program, though it was lacking in some areas. Hope House has grown in so many ways, for one it is more individualized to the clients needs. The focus originally was strictly 12 Step based. Hope House is still 12 Step based, but it treats the whole person and supports the client in becoming self-sufficient. One thing that hasn't changed, is (even though it is a transitional living facility) that is feels like a home.
Hope House Inc	39736	1	/users/profile/40708	stephrees	Client Served	4	05/20/2010	My name is Stephanie and I have been addicted to crack cocaine for 20 years.  I had never been in trouble with the law before the age of 36 and by the time I was 41, I had been arrested 13 times, sent to prison twice and was facing a third trip.  I wrote to the Hope House and my judge and begged for help.  The only thing that was going to change would be the date and time upon another release.  The Hope House staff helped get me approved to be a resident and I can never thank them enough for saving my life and giving me another chance at how to learn to live life again.  It was the HARDEST thing I have ever had to do, but the BEST.  I have tools today that I didn't know were out there and I know how to be honest today and talk to people about where I am at on a daily basis.  I have been sober for 3 years, with one short slip up, and my life has never been better.  Because of the lessons the Hope House taught me, when I slipped, I knew where to go and who to turn to.  I will forever be grateful to them and my Judge for believing in me one more time.  Life is getting better day by day, one day at a time!

Board Member	5	11/30/2014	Our Hope for Parents Program positions potential candidates to the store itself and to the Midtown Neighborhood Network. Like our friends at Focused Community Strategies and other like-minded individuals and organizations that understand the difference between a crisis or chronic need, we believe that investing in a community and journeying along side new found friends is the ultimate Matthew 25:40 directive. While giving may seem like the kind and Christian thing to do, it often ends up undermining the very relationship a helper is attempting to build.

We want and need people who are not afraid to dream and look at the big picture, in fact it is imperative! Because building relationships is the best way to build a stronger community; hope, love and a communal rhythm are great emancipators and essential because people will come from everywhere for the experience.

Clean Socks Hope Inc.	233878	1	/users/profile/297888	Friends_of_Midtown	Client Served	5	11/18/2014	So, what is Midtown Neighborhood Network? A Food Cooperative? Yes! A Community Ministry? Yes. A church? Yes. A social justice ministry? Yes. A community development organization? Yes. Please join us as we continue to act creatively in response to the injustices of the world and participate in transformation. Its our experience and common for upper and middle-class people to compartmentalize certain activities: like going to church, then volunteering at a soup kitchen for homeless people, then donating to their local food bank. Likewise, it is common for people to compartmentalize the various social issueshomelessness, hunger, crime, social marginalizationthat these charities address. While charity organizationslike traditional food banks, soup kitchens, and homeless sheltersare helpful, they sometimes fail to address or acknowledge both the systemic problems that cause these injustices and the interrelated nature of such injustices. Addressing these realities might enable us to creatively transform them.

We learned that we need to listen to the needs of those we serve and not what we think they want. A fellow missionary who said that the Romanian mission that he visits twice a year had torn down almost all of their westernized out houses and used the wood on their own homes and used parts for kindling during the winter. The team never thought to ask them what they needed, but assumed they knew what they wanted. The 1st step of repentance of pride is, Im broken. Poverty is the result of relationships that do not work, that are not just, that are not for life, that are not harmonious or enjoyable. Poverty is the absence of shalom in all its meanings. ~Bryant Myers, Walking with the Poor We are a community that radiates hope for all residents through empowering relationships. If you spend yourselves in behalf of the hungry and satisfy the needs of the oppressed, then your light will rise in the darkness, and your night will become like the noonday.

It's an incredible partnership with our Midtown families and Dare To Care has had a steady 12 family benefit for over 45 adults and children since July 5, 2013. By being a member of our MNN Food Co-op we enable Midtown families to have food security through the model of food co-ops. Through our collaborative guaranteed food deliveries members of our cooperative always know when, and how much food, they will have, allowing them to budget accordingly and avoid the slippery slope that often begins with food insecurity and lifestyle poverty. They buy into it, leave local food pantries and work and run the co-op themselves.

Robert Woodson said, that, "..because its not something thats understood on either the left or the right of the political center.

Prison Greyhounds Inc	287521		/users/profile/377628	Writer	Volunteer	5	04/28/2016	My involvement with Prison Greyhounds goes back to 2012 when the first group of greyhounds arrived and were whisked off to the prison.  My husband and I had previously adopted from a prison program in Ohio so when we heard that Indianapolis was going to start a prison based greyhound program we wanted to be a part of it.  We started as Adoption Team volunteers and have since gotten involved in every aspect of the program.  My husband is Co-VP on the Board of Directors and I am the Adoption Director.  We also volunteer for the Prison team, the Meet & Greet team, and the Social Media team.  At that very first drop in March 2012 I fell in love with a little dark brindle  female greyhound that handlers later named Rosy.  She came home to live with us three months later after her release from Putnamville Correctional Facility.  Since then we have adopted two other greyhounds from Prison Greyhounds.  Yes Man came to live with us in February 2013 after he completed the program at Putnamville.   In July 2014, Corleone, a repaired fracture greyhound came to our home as a foster and never left.   My husband and I are proud to be part of this program and we believe in its mission.  It is a well-oiled machine fueled by great volunteers and dedicated leaders.   ~ Paula Conarroe
Prison Greyhounds Inc	287473	1	/users/profile/377572	melrn	Volunteer	5	04/27/2016	Sharing my Volunteer Experience:  After completing the required Indiana Department of Corrections Volunteer Training, I had my first experience entering Putnamville Correctional Facility in Greencastle, IN as a Prison Team Volunteer with Prison Greyhounds.  March 26, 2016 was a memorable day.  I entered the prison to witness an extraordinary event connecting the lives of some of its inmates with some former racing Greyhounds who just arrived earlier that morning from Daytona, FL. Although the program is limited in the number of participating inmates, it is clear there is a ripple effect throughout the prison grounds that can be seen upon just walking the dogs from the prison entrance to their inmate handlers dorm.  The dogs bring what seems like an instant calming effect as well as ear-to-ear smiles on the faces of both staff and inmates.  Absolutely everybody involved in the Prison Greyhound Program  the volunteers, the Assistant Superintendent and staff, the inmates, the dogs, and everyone in their vicinity  is transformed by it. Less than 10 retired racing Greyhounds in each class. Approximately 8 weeks each.  Increased compassion.  Responsibility. More patience. Improved relationships. Smiles. Opened hearts and a dogs unconditional love. In a prison. I am thrilled programs like this exist to allow people such as myself, to be a part of something bigger; to give back to my community; all while working together as an organization to help former racing greyhounds find their loving, forever homes. Melissa C.Prison Team Volunteer | Meet & Greet Volunteer Proudly adopted by former racer/prison graduate Carolina Glare | August 2015
Prison Greyhounds Inc	287457		/users/profile/377555	Writer	Client Served	5	04/27/2016	Prison Greyhounds is such an incredible organization.  My husband and I always discussed adopting a retired racer, and we finally took the jump four years ago.  We adopted our first greyhound from Prison Greyhounds and he changed our lives!  A little less than two years later we adopted our second from Prison Greyhounds. Our boys are forever grateful for those that helped with their transition to retirement! The volunteers were always so helpful and always there to answer our questions before, during, and after the adoption process.   I tell everyone about this incredible organization and highly recommend to all! 
Prison Greyhounds Inc	287444	1	/users/profile/377541	actualparamedic	Client Served	5	04/27/2016	My wife and I had never considered a Greyhound until a family friend from Illinois adopted several retired racing greys over the course of a decade.  After the loss of our dachshunds, we began to seriously consider the possibility of  a retired racing greyhound who would be willing to 'adopt us'.  After initial research, we reached out to Prison Greyhounds in Spring 2015, receiving a quick and detailed reply within 24 hours about the adoption process, about the breed, expectations of adoptive families...and also found ourselves invited to an upcoming 'Drop Day'.  Drop Day is when retired racers make the  18-hour journey from an adoption holding kennel to the Prison Greyhounds program in a customized, climate controlled trailer (provided by a partnership with the Tony Stewart Foundation).  Drop Day provided us a no-pressure, inviting atmosphere to interact with other potential adopters, recent adoptive families and involved members of the Prison Greyhounds organization.  We asked every possible question and met adopted and 'adoption pending' and 'available' greyhounds.  We left our first Drop Day completely convinced that this was the only organization we wanted to work with.   We have been so impressed by the structure, knowledge base and attention to detail shown by every person involved with Prison Greyhounds.  They have created a transparent, comprehensive and balanced adoption program which equally addresses the needs of recently retired racing greyhounds and the persons who wish to adopt them.  We brought our greyhound, Hula, home in August following her completion of the 8-week training program inside the prison.  Were provided support, attention and feedback before, during and well after our adoption took place.  We felt so strongly about Prison Greyhounds that we applied to become part of outreach and, on a limited basis, participate in New Dog Day at the Putnamville Correctional Facility.  Once we were approved for these roles, we were provided comprehensive orientation and training.  This next level of involvement confirmed to us the organization's commitment to providing the best experiences and outcomes for everyone involved with Prison Greyhounds - dogs, adoptive families and prisoners.  We highly recommend Prison Greyhounds as a sound, trustworthy and ethical organization for those who are newly considering greyhound adoption as well as those who have previously adopted retired racers. *Disclosure - not only are we satisfied clients, we serve in volunteer (non-Board) roles with Prison Greyhounds*
Prison Greyhounds Inc	287392		/users/profile/377482	TRock	Client Served	5	04/27/2016	There are not enough positive words in the vocabulary to express my fondness and appreciation for Prison Greyhounds, Inc. They are a first class organization who puts the needs and care of each dog that is given 'a ticket home', as their first priority.When I first discovered them (via Facebook) I was hooked. That fact that the dogs are taught how to go from athlete to family pet via training from non-violent inmates - well, what's not to love about that? I seriously don't know who benefits more - the inmates or the dogs. When you read the graduation letters that each inmate writes to the potential adopters as the dog nears graduation you can feel the love and pride in each sentence. What a wonderful gift they give each other. There have been more than a few times I've shed a tear as I read those letters. We adopted Cosworth (Atascotia Worth) last August. I'd never had a large dog but had always had a love for Greyhounds. The entire process was very detailed and thorough - all for the benefit of both the dog and the potential adoptive family. From the application process to the phone interview, to the home visit - their priority is to make sure you are well prepared to adopt a greyhound and that the dog you are interested in is a good fit for your family. We have a very small Italian Greyhound and IG/Terrier mix so it was imperative that the Greyhound we were interested in did not have any 'prey' instincts for small animals. Cosworth is a repair fracture so he didn't go into the prison program but a foster home upon his arrival from Daytona. Paula brought him with her to visit us on our home visit. She had us put our little guys on leashes and bring them to the front yard sidewalk so everyone could meet on neutral ground. As soon as we could tell the initial intro was going well, we took everyone to the fenced backyard and I took the little guys off their leashes and Paula kept Cosworth on his leash as they all sniffed each other and wondered around. We could tell after several minutes that Cosworth really had no aggressive interests in them, so Paula slowly took him off his leash and it just couldn't have gone any better. We adopted him ON THE SPOT! He found his forever home that beautiful Saturday afternoon. I can't even tell you how much we love him and his gentle ways. He loves his little brothers and they love to run around the yard together (or relax together as you can see in the photos).Thank you Prison Greyhounds for the fabulous work that you do with the inmates, the dogs, and the families who love them. I seriously cannot wait to adopt another. Every chance I get, I tell the Prison Greyhounds story and I've yet to find a person who doesn't think it's an incredible organization.
Prison Greyhounds Inc	287384		/users/profile/377474	Anjanette S.	Volunteer	5	04/27/2016	We found out about Prison Greyhounds through some acquaintances. We decided to follow their fun and informative posts on Facebook over the next few years and joined their e-mail list. When the call went out for emergency fosters and we decided to answer the call. We were easily approved as a foster family after a quick home visit since we were veteran grey owners. The nice thing about being an approved foster is that you are an approved adopter. We were assigned Rock and had the pleasure of keeping him a few weeks while his new family was away. It was fun to watch him exploring and learning about his new environment. He did have some trouble adjusting to life off the track, but the volunteers were very helpful with our questions and concerns and assured us that what he was experiencing was normal.  Also, because we were approved adopters, we found and were able to bring home a new member of our family. Ryn (Kiowa Heart) has been a great addition to our home. She is a silly, crazy girl that thinks she is a lap dog and helped Rock adjust to home life. Due to the wonderful experience we have had, we made the decision to be fosters when one is needed for Prison Greyhounds and are making the commitment to attend meet and greets to help spread the word about this organization and their mission. We look forward to these volunteer opportunities and hope to become more involved.

They genuinely care about the lives and quality of life of the magnificent breed. Everything is done with a purpose; well executed and efficient.  They were friendly and helpful as possible with our adaption of Kay City Benji (mentioned in another review) and Delta Tamer, both retired racers. The well-conceived program, the staff, the offender-handlers, volunteers, fosters and others constitute a well oiled machine with a wonderful purpose........Indeed a class act.  May they exist as long as there are greyhounds in need of a home.
Prison Greyhounds Inc	287159		/users/profile/377241	Writer	Client Served	5	04/24/2016	I researched Greyhounds for a long time before settling on the breed as a future pet. When it came time to find a rescue organization to go through, I was excited to find Prison Greyhounds. As someone that works in the social services field, I was happy to see an organization working with non-violent offenders in order to build the inmates skills and have access to the benefits of pets in prison. Prison Greyhounds goes beyond placing a dog with you, aside from the phone interview and home visit, they are not afraid to say "this dog isn't the right fit for you." They also have volunteers check on you and the greyhound after adoption to make sure everything is going well. In the end, I found a great fit with my greyhound Roy. He has fit in so well and we have a great bond. I love telling people about Prison Greyhounds and I love being part of the Greyhound community. 
Prison Greyhounds Inc	286352		/users/profile/376466	Writer	Client Served	5	04/21/2016	It took two tries, but Prison Greyhound volunteers were there every step of the way with me! My first grey, Benji (Kay City Benji), was a wonderful dog but had severe separation anxiety. Prison Greyhound volunteers and my family did all that we could to make it work, but he just needed another grey in his home. He is happily retired with a retired couple that can dedicate more time to him and a lovely female grey companion. (Last time I saw them, they were hugging, neck in neck and looking inseparable.) Now on to the good news! Good things come to all who wait  (and persevere!!). My husband and I are now the proud owners of the perfect fit to our family, Kaia (Kiowa Kay Hazey)! She made adopting a greyhound easy peasy! She is full of love for all kinds, dogs, cats, children, people, and if you don't stop to pet her, you've simply broken her heart! Oh, but if you do, you will get a lot of chattering, nipping, air snapping, and a wonderful wagging tail! (And sometimes a jump, sorry we're still working on that!) Prison Greyhounds is the reason I have this wonderful girl and the reason I am so successful with her! They are there every step of the way to help make the adoption a rewarding and successful experience!

I have enjoyed all of the time I have spent and will continue to enjoy time spent volunteering for this organization. For a group of volunteers, they go above and beyond to make happy adopters and happy greys! They are not afraid to step up to answer questions and solve problems, even if that means a being put in a difficult situation. They honestly want to see each adopting family have the best fit and experience, while keeping the all greys happiness and healthiness in mind!

The hardest part was waiting for her to graduate from the program, watching for pictures and postings on Facebook kept us informed on how well she was doing.  We have fostered  Greyhounds right from the track  and seen the adjustment of the dogs from both programs and how much faster Macy adjusted to her home life.  The only problem we had to watch Macy with was electronics, remotes and cell phones etc, as they inmates don't have them in the Prison, lol.  This is a win, win situation for the inmates and the graduating Greyhounds.  First time Greyhound owners really benefit from the Prison program and the dogs also. Barbara Beltinck

I've loved them since I was little so I had to stop. I loved on the dogs and talked with the volunteers, grabbed an info sheet and went home.  I was trying to decide if the time was right to adopt, when they put out a call for emergency fosters. Now was the time, sadly I didn't get my application in on time for the fostering but started the preapproval for my grey. I will admit I was a bit excited and tried to pay my deposit way early, causing a bit of confusion. The director refunded my money and we had a good laugh. The phone interview was great, you can tell they really care where these greys are placed. Our home Vista went great, Paula beat me to my apartment by just a few minutes so my family was enjoying her and her grey when I walked in. She knew what was on my application and what happened on the phone interview with out looking at notes, she did her homework. We got our approval and went to new dog day. What an amazing event. Everyone was polite and friendly answered all questions. We got our grey, and his foster mom Stephanie is amazing. Sent up pics and updates. She's been great, I've asked her several questions since our George came home. It's great knowing I have this amazing group to turn to with questions and help. I tell everyone about them when I'm showing off George.

My experience with their program has been top notch-from their communications to adopters and potential adopters; their events; education initiatives; the greyhound community they have created, and the adoption experience. I was drawn to the program for two reasons-their reputation as committed and dedicated to their cause, but more importantly, the underlying mission of hope and restoration-not only for the dogs, but for the inmate handlers who are paired with the dogs. Anyone who asks me about my dogs and their story, is immediately drawn into the cause behind the organization and, falls in love with the dogs and their sweet spirits.I would highly recommend the breed, and the program, to anyone looking for a great dog. Our greys are beloved (and okay, a little spoiled) members of our family. The fact they were part of a mission makes them even more special.These are our babies: Trust-a brindle female; and Power, a blue brindle male

Prison Greyhounds has a large, active, highly structured volunteer base. The hierarchical network of volunteer directors keeps each aspect of the organization running smoothly. The group is dynamic--always seeking to add new, talented volunteers. Each adopter is invited to join in efforts to bring more dogs to more homes. It's all about the hounds, though, and Prison Greyhounds has mastered two routes for homing the hounds: training in the prison and fostering in homes. I owe the group a debt. My sweet boy, Parks, is the best companion ever. But he doesn't stop there: he himself works every month to help more greyhounds find their forever couches.

Ferb after he graduated the prison program.  Responses to our inquiries were addressed very promptly and everyone we had correspondence with was great to work with.  The information and support that is given to the adopters before, during, and after the adoption is incredible. This organization truly cares about their cause and it shows in everything they do. From the retired racers to the inmate handlers, volunteers, and adopters. I have not experienced such organization within a non-profit as there is with Prison Greyhounds.  This is a top notch group of individuals.  The Prison program is such a wonderful way to provide growth and experience to the inmates. Watching the stories unfold from the day a new class of dogs enters the prison until grraduation is a very moving experience for everyone involved.  I cannot say enough about how wonderful our experience was with this organization and it continues to be.  It takes more than volunteers and a cause to create a successful organization, it takes having a true passion for your cause, and that is what sets Prison Greyhounds apart.  A true passion for what they are doing and for everyone they come into contact with.  
Prison Greyhounds Inc	286138	2	/users/profile/376207	sh4d0wp4w	Volunteer	5	04/18/2016	We are approved adopters and fosters with Prison Greyhounds. We first found them on facebook and quickly fell in love with their mission as well as how they actually serve their calling. We are 'greyhound' people and have been for years, but just found this organization within the last couple of years and have enjoyed our experience volunteering and working with everyone involved.

Spay-Neuter Services of Indiana	289984	1	/users/profile/380255	Writer	Client Served	5	05/15/2016	We cannot express to strongly what an amazing organization SNSI is.  We first contacted them in the early spring of 2015 regarding their Community Cat Program.  Our organization is a small, 501(c)3 with a focus on the spay/neuter of feral/stray cats in our community.  Being newly founded in 2014, our financial resources to pay for the altering of the 1,000's of cats in our town and surrounding area was very small.  To become more known in the area and to make any immediate impact, we needed to be able to alter many more cats than we could afford to do alone.Our experience then, and every experience since, has been supportive, encouraging, user-friendly, professional and more helpful than we could ever hope for.  The staff are amazing, and the programs they offer save so many lives!  Since that first contact, SNSI has been responsible for the spay/neuter of 100 of the stray/feral cats we have trapped!  100 lives irrevocably changed for the better, and through those 100, 1000's more will not be born to contribute to overpopulation and homelessness. 1000's will not die, alone and unseen on our streets and in our shelters. By supporting SNSI through donations and their licence plate program, lives are being saved and improved!

Online virtual hugs and pats on the back are great for the recipients' egos but in the end money is what gets things accomplished.  As with all animal-related non-profits, they have to squeeze every penny for all that it is worth and SNSI is doing an admirable job of that.

I have seen many, many families benefit from this program, who otherwise could not afford a full price surgery.   The benefits of this program extend beyond helping pets and their families, but communities benefit as well.  Pet overpopulation is a problem we CAN do something about.

The wonder of Beauty for Ashes is that it operates as nearly a 100% volunteer organization. The home  has only 2 employees - the House Manager and a Fund Raiser.   The CEO and the board are all volunteer.  The hundreds of volunteers within a year range from craftsmen, psychologists, dietiticians, churches, and students. Self-improvement classes include Safe Friends, Shame Resilience, and Boundaries.   Church attendance is required of the residents and 5 churches are within 5 blocks and many more churches are located within 1 mile.   Beauty for Ashes has been a safe haven and a blessing for many women and deserves support.

To those ladies who were scared not knowing which way to turn to survive.  This world can be hard especially when you have fallen so far from the Lords side.  Many lives have been changed.  Not only those who come to Beauty for Ashes seeking help but for those who have been there to help.  I think those who give and help guide receive just as much as those ladies in need.  Those who walk through the doors of B.O.A. are all in need and all are blessed.  Whether you are there for shelter and guidance or to volunteer your time, all are blessed and lives changed.  How could it not be?  Both residents and volunteers will see life a little differently and know The Lord's power and love.  All will know they are not alone.  Sharon Kay Renfro and Janice Kay Busby listened to The Lord calling them to reach out to the homeless women and children.  In doing so, many have been given a new life when otherwise may have never found peace, happiness, and heard the word of The Lord.

Bountiful Harvest Ministries Inc	204952		/users/profile/108998	Kathy G.	Volunteer	5	07/02/2014	I came to Beauty for Ashes in 2010 as a resident. After a life of drug addiction and alcoholism I found refuge and salvation in Jesus Christ and through a personal relationship with Him I was lead to Beauty for Ashes. I had roamed around for years from house to house, relationship to relationship as a result of my addiction but when I got sober I began to realize that my lifestyle was not only abnormal but was irresponsible. However, when I began to desire to change, I was unsure just how to do that as I came to see that I had no idea how to live responsibly. The most important thing in life is having a personal relationship with God through His Son Jesus Christ and that is the key to freedom, so I knew that I could not go just anywhere. I was excited when I found Beauty for Ashes because of their faith based Biblical foundation. I was able to learn things like, boundaries, safe people, and nutrition. I needed balance in many areas of my life, I was able through many classes, groups and studies to gain the ability to begin to balance many areas of my life and find more peace. I really needed the structure and discipline that was foundational to the ministry of the house and I found peace and assurance through such structure.     After graduating the program, I transitioned into a residential staff position where I stayed on another year as onsite night staff, where I learned even more. I moved out in 2013 but stayed connected and returned in 2014 to take on a position as staff. I was so blessed by the passion, vision and heart of Jan Busby and Sharon Renfro. I believe in the vision God had given to Jan and I pray that this ministry continue to grow and prosper and that the vision the Lord gave her will continue. Beauty for Ashes is a blessed and safe place to come and find healing and to find, strengthen or even renew faith and a relationship with Jesus Christ which brings great peace and serenity.

I first came upon it when I was looking to do some volunteer work.  I wanted my girls (ages 12 and 16) to get involved in some kind of charity so that they would learn about giving, and doing things for people just out of kindness of their heart.  Since then we have helped with many fundraisers and both of my daugters have babysit for some of the kids that has stayed there.  I love that this charity is faith based and it is about women.  It helps teach the ladies that there is hope,  that there are people out there that will care for you and let you know that you are not alone.  That is what Jan and Sharon and all of the other volunteers do!  Plus the women that stay there are great!  I just cant go on enough about how wonderful this chairty is!

I have worked with Beauty for Ashes for years.  I go in to teach a group or an individual the nine-lesson series.  The focus is on quick, inexpensive, healthy meals.  They spend time learning nutrition information and then we prepare meals together.  Over the years, the women have reported to me that they benefit from the program by eating healthier and saving money.  Most of the women in the house are always very thankful for the information and the time we spend together.  I have also observed changes in the women as they live there and partake in the classes and the daily routines of the house.  They become more assertive, outgoing, and in control of their lives.  The staff at Beauty for Ashes is very supportive by providing resources and expecting the clients to benefit from those resources.

Just as their Mission states, the ministry provides transitional housing, accountability, and life management education in a nurturing environment to homeless women with or without children.  I have volunteered at various levels and have attended a weekly Bible study with the residents.  I have been an eye witness to the transformation that has taken place in the residents as they are nurtured emotionally, spiritually, and financially during their stay at Beauty for Ashes.  This Christian, non-denominational ministry is supported financially by many churches, one of which is the church I attend.  When you partner with Bountiful Harvest Ministries, you can have confidence that your gift will be used wisely and effectively for the residents at Beauty for Ashes.  I support their efforts and encourage others to do so as well.  It benefits our entire society when caring people answer Christ's call to help bring His life-transforming power to those God sends to this ministry.
Bountiful Harvest Ministries Inc	100665		/users/profile/123923	Karen23456789	Client Served	5	11/15/2011	 My life was locked in fear, depression and anger. I survived many things as a child, but at a price. I felt worthless, insignificant, alone, and ashamed. It was my intention to end my life when I came to BFA. But, I was pulled out of my overwhelming despair by the dedication, compassion and love of the people at BFA. And, the classes of Boundaries, Safe People and Anxiety & Depression have given me the structure that I desperately needed.   Most of all, the staff at BFA helped me to embrace a new life with my Lord and Savior. I had carried my Bible since a teenager but I never read it. They opened my eyes and heart.   I now look forward to every day that God gives me to learn and grow as a person. I believe that God planted me at Beauty for Ashes for a reason, besides saving my life. I am more open now to all that is waiting for me.   I arrived in June and the people that run the home and the volunteers who hold the classes were instrumental in helping me to come out of the darkest time of my life. The classes and bible studies that were offered, opened my eyes, mind and heart. They helped me to face my past, head on and encouraged me every day to battle many things that almost destroyed me...my fear, anger and depression.   I received great benefit from the Anxiety & Depression class, as well as Safe People and Boundaries. It is my belief that these classes, if taught in school, would have guided me to a different life. These classes helped me to overcome loss, low self-esteem and the abuse that I endured as a child.   I owe a great deal to Jan Busby, Sharon Renfro, Brittany Sievers, Kathy G. and all of the volunteers and class teachers that showed me that I deserved to look toward the future, which is something that I never did in my life.   Most of all, I wish to thank Beauty for Ashes for showing me the way to know my Lord and Savior. I am truly blessed to have been brought to this home. I believe that God placed me here so that I could get the help that I needed.

I thought I had done all I could but nothing was good enough.  I knew I needed to change but wasnt sure how to start.  I didnt have the resources.  In December 2009 I went back to church, thinking I could do it on my own.  Well, that didnt work.  By April 2010 I was severely depressed & staying with a friendit wasnt working out.  I was tired of going from house to house & it wasnt good for my daughter.  I finally broke down & opened up to 2 people at my church and they told me about a shelter.  I said, Im not taking my daughter to a shelter.  But I knew God was talking to me.  I found out it was a Christian transitional home.   Even after I was accepted by Beauty for Ashes, it took me a couple weeks & a man to attack me to get me there.  When my church friend dropped me off at BFA I was very nervous but Jan & Sharon made it very easy to relax.  I was a very paranoid& negative person.  All the classes they give help with all my problems.  Anxiety/depression, Boundaries, Safe People, Nutrition, Battlefield of the Mind, and spiritual warfareall are Christian based & I love them.  Ive never in my life been in such a positive place.  It was almost scary at first but only because I didnt know how to feel or what to expect.  Since Ive been here, Ive gotten a part time job, started my GED, & learn more & more everyday, literally.  My bad days here are nothing compared to my bad days on the street.  BFA is not a shelter, its a transitional home.  Big difference.  They teach us how to deal with life and give us structure for when we do get out on our own so we can live a happier, healthy, Christian life.  Not just anyone can come here.  You have to be ready & determined to change your life. I believe God brought me to BFAonly through God can I change.  If He will change me, He will change anyone. . . But its in His time.  I thank God every day for blessing me & my daughter with a home like this.
Bountiful Harvest Ministries Inc	23480	2	/users/profile/24585	sharon	Volunteer	5	12/07/2009	As a co-founder and volunteer at Beauty for Ashes Transitional Home, I have served as a board member and currently track the financial operations of the ministry.  The Home, est. in 2004, provides a Christian alternative to housing for homeless women and children.  The ministry is funded by church, business, organizational, & individual donors as well as fund raisers and grants with 40% coming from local churches and 28% from fund raising efforts.  The highest integrity is maintained in the financial management and great stewardship is used in spending any money.    I have worked in the administrative end of the ministry doing everything from creating forms needed in working with clients to writing grant proposals, supervising/organizing fund raisers, attending meetings,corresponding with donors and more.  Women are housed for up to 18 months as they reestablish stability, improve self care, participate in counseling, learn life and emotional management skills, get education, get a job, mature spiritually, and move toward self sufficiency.  This is a challenging journey for clients and staff as well.  Accountability is a key factor in progress forward.  More information about the organization can be found at www.bountifulharvestministries.org  I have confidence that Bountiful Harvest Ministries will continue to grow, incorportating more staff and advisory and board members in its operation.  I feel the Lord has opened many doors and provided opportunities for this ministry that are beyond explanation.  This ministry has no debts or liabilities and continues to operate within its income restrictions.  A new roof, garage restoration, new windows on the first floor, weatherization, and client room reburbishing/furnishings/redecorating have all been accomplished within the last 3 years in addition to meeting the needs of the clients and the minsitry as a whole.   The ministry needs to move into more significnt fund-raising endeavors which will allow growth and expansion of services.  Requests for service have increased 50% in 2009.
Bountiful Harvest Ministries Inc	26409	6	/users/profile/27442	DHerrmann	Donor	5	01/28/2010	I first became aware of Bountiful Harvest when my husband served on the board and donated funds to this wonderful ministry. I'm mission's president at my church and I have been able to hold services and actually have some of the women who live there share their testimonies and it is so inspiring to hear their stories, but more inspiring to see their lives change and eventually become independent and living on their own.This ministry is so important to our community because the need is great. There are so many homeless women and children. Also the level of support services they offer is why I believe they are so successful. They offer self-help classes and training on parenting, health and nutrition. They also offer addiction counseling and/or substance abuse seminars. They offer boundary setting skills and job placement help etc. They encourage continued education not only for personal life long skills but for the "whole" person. Each person must seek out a change in their moral character then seek out our Nation's Godly Heritage. (Entered by GreatNonprofits staff member on behalf of reviewer)

It is amazing what 2 ladies, Jan Busby and Sharon Renfro, can accomplish. Each resident has an individual plan based on their needs and preferences. Residents are supported not only with food and shelter, but with love, encouragement, spirituality and friendship. All monies go to support of the transitional home and residents. No salaries are paid to anyone and much of the work needed is through volunteers. (Entered by GreatNonprofits staff member on behalf of reviewer)
Bountiful Harvest Ministries Inc	24157	9	/users/profile/25261	jbusby	Board Member	5	12/16/2009	My dream as a 19 year old woman was to provide women and children in need with a transitional home to guide them through their spirtual journey with God. In 2004 my dream came true. As of five years we have offered stability and guidance for homeless women to become independent and to be able to have a stable life for their family.It has been so rewarding to me. As a Christian Program we see the growth and success as the women that pass through our spiritual program suceed in life on their own.
Bountiful Harvest Ministries Inc	23894	4	/users/profile/25028	Tamra	Board Member	5	12/12/2009	I am a very educated and hard working person that once had it all. "Had it all," that is a phrase that I have come to re-evaluate in my journey thru life. I had all of the material things I could ever want or need. However, I had lost my relationship and guidance from my almighty Savior.   Since coming to BFA I have learned that what I was trying to give my family was not what they needed. They needed me. The me that put the Lord first in my life. BFA has taught me the skills I need to go on with my life. The importance of putting the Lord first, dealing with the depression and anxiety and having the faith to move on. The support and support and spiritual guidance that I receive her has changed my life. I thank the Lord, and of course, Jan and Sharon, who work tirelessly to put women's lives back together so that they may have the emotional balance and skills to walk thru life.   I am always amazed and thankful for those that have the heart and compassion to donate their time and supplies needed to continue this blessed establishment.
Bountiful Harvest Ministries Inc	23754	9	/users/profile/24885	carrie6750	Client Served	5	12/11/2009	About a year ago, I came upon Beauty For Ashes for I was homeless and didn't know where else to turn to. Since my stay at the home, I have found myself to be more knowledgable in the works of our God and how we are to serve him. Janice Busby, the director, and Sharon Renfro, the assistant director, have made it such a wonderful ministry to be a part of, for they put so much time and love into all of the residents at Beauty For Ashes and things they do behind the scenes. Dedication is the key, and that is something that they have as well as the volunteers who give donations, transportation to the residents, and a shoulder to lean on. This house is far more than just a home for women. It's the house of love and the house of the Lord.
Bountiful Harvest Ministries Inc	23735	2	/users/profile/24864	Nancy	Volunteer	5	12/11/2009	About three years ago I met in the Beauty for Ashes home for a Bible study.  During this time I met the director and assistant director, both of whom are dedicated to the vision and mission of this transitional home for women and children.  I was asked to assist in the clerical work of the ministry.  I have seen the leadership work tirelessly, with no compensation, to see that the needs and concerns of Beauty for Ashes are met. The wise and careful stewardship of this ministry is unquestionable. The needs of the women and the home are always the top priority for the resources that come in.  It has been a walk of faith for this ministry and God's hand has blessed the women leaving Beauty for Ashes with further education, jobs, housing on their own and a renewed life in Christ. This ministry is blessed with dedicated leadership, women who want a change in their lives and supporters who willing give to further the vision of Beauty for Ashes. It is my prayer that God would continue this ministry of giving hope to the women and children who come to the doors of this life changing ministry.
Bountiful Harvest Ministries Inc	23424	2	/users/profile/24515	Hunter	Volunteer	5	12/05/2009	My most clear observation of Bountiful Harvest/Beauty for Ashes is that it is a 100% volunteer organization.  The Staff, Board, and volunteers operate strictly as that - volunteers.  Volunteers include churches, businesses, individuals and now also a foundation.  With this type of task force, since 2004, the organization has provided long term (6-18 month) shelter, to include its various programs, to 50 women and 10 children.  The underlying challenge to the organization, is the maintenance and improvement of the shelter - a Victorian type home, a boarding house 100 years ago, of about 3000 square feet with a basement.  The founders bought the home through a fundraising drive.  Maintenance and utility costs keep fundrasing as a primary effort.  The organization has strong community support and is highly respected by individuals, businesses, and churches.
Bountiful Harvest Ministries Inc	23390	4	/users/profile/24481	Jimspcservice	Volunteer	5	12/04/2009	I was looking for an organization that would benefit from my skills with computers and networking. One of the board members went to my church so I asked him about the organization. As he explained I felt this would be a great place for me to help. Over the past few years Ive seen a lot of womens lives helped and changed for the better. I say hands off, to all of the staff and board members for a job well done in helping these women.

It has been my privilege to encourage them in the process of locating a suitable facility and designing a program to address the needs of homeless women and children in the Madison County, Indiana area.  I have at all times been impressed with the integrity of these leaders and their ability to create a safe and supportive environment in which the needs of women and children can be met.  I know personally many clients who have benefitted from the services provided by this agency.

Their commitment and dedication to help kids and animals  in need has had a direct impact on several families I know, including my own. Long live TSF and may Tony enjoy his years to come as much as he has enjoyed the past!  He earned (deserves) it!!
Tony Stewart Foundation, Inc.	315337	1	/users/profile/406663	Andrew109	Volunteer	5	10/27/2016	TSF has been involved with some fantastic causes over the years, including animal rescue and rehabilitation, various therapy programs and camps for individuals dealing with difficult medial issues, and even the overlap: animal therapy for individuals in need. TSF has realized their philanthropic vision with outstanding holism, and excels at providing healthful, productive outlets for those most in need.
Tony Stewart Foundation, Inc.	315319	1	/users/profile/406644	mdda28	General Member of the Public	5	10/27/2016	TSF is one of my favorite charities!  The Tony Stewart Foundation has taken action to help provide love and support to underserved critically ill children, or those living with disabilities and their families.  The foundation also cares for animals who are endangered in one way or another.  In times of disaster or times of distress people often half to make the heart wrenching decision to  leave their beloved pets because they cannot provide the care that they need.  It makes my heart feel good to know that there are people out there willing to step up to the plate and provide support for them.  Everyone who loves animals know that they are not just "animals", but are family.  Many depend on us for their care.  And, their love for us is unconditional.  They love us and accept us just as we are.  In addition, the foundation helps drivers in their time of need.  Many of us love racing, not many of us provide support for them after they suffer an injury.  For many, racing is the only source of income.  We need to extend our love to them in their time of need, just as the provide entertainment for us when they are at the top of their game.I 100% support these causes and efforts to help those who really need our help the most.  Often children with disabilities are overlooked as are the animals that we love so much.  Both are unable to provide for, or take care of themselves, and need our help, our love.The best part of this foundation?  100% of the money goes to helping those in need.  I am a proud supporter of the foundation and only wish there was more that I could do.#Acceleratechange

With the numerous funds, there are wonderful opportunities to donate to a preferred cause or set up a benefit program.  Our ancestors, students, private groups, service clubs and more have benefited by financial assistance and information that is allowing Martin County to maintain cemeteries, organizations and for people to grow and prosper.  Each year we see our finest graduate and go out into the world with a benefit from the Loogootee Schools Schlorship Trust.  We have outstanding programs, sports facilities and an auditorium at Loogootee.  These facilities serve our students and the community.  Each year the schlorship trust provides the studens with some starter support as they prepare to leave for higher education.

I believe that if the residents of this county were aware of the type of work being done on their behalf, that they too would hold the MCCF in high regard. The Martin County Community Foundation promotes charitable giving and supports nonprofits focusing on areas of education, youth development, workforce preparedness and more. The Community Foundation works to develop and implement initiatives that bring about positive change and find solutions to pressing issues such as education and emergency preparedness. The Martin County Community Foundation has helped and continues to help Martin County citizens in a myriad of areas. The Martin County Community Building that so many Martin County residents enjoy and use for a variety of reasons-- such as; wedding receptions, business meetings, philanthropic organizations, 4-H members to display their 4-H projects and numerous other entities. We owe a great deal of thanks to the Martin County Community Foundation, for without them, we would not have such a wonderful facility in which to host worthwhile community activities. A grant that the Community Foundation helped to secure is the main reason that we are privileged enough to have the Martin County Community Building.

Our students have benefitted from program support; our teachers have benefitted from curriculum support.     Because of employment issues due to job loss as well as general poverty, our students have been able to participate in programs they might otherwise have missed due to the generosity of the Foundation.   Too, many students have been able to be assisted in post high school studies due to the scholarship program supported by the Foundation.

The Partnership offers opportunities for individuals and/or groups to establish permanently endowed funds to benefit the not-for-profit group or agency of the donor's choice.  The Partnership also provides a leadership role in the communities.  I have been on the board of a community foundation in two different counties and have seen many good examples where the proceeds from permanent funds have provided the fuel to assist volunteers for organization to achieve their mission.

However, after watching several riders interact with the horses over the years I now understand this connection. The riders have become more confident, responsible, respectful and determined individuals. Ponies and Kids has assisted 5 to 10 riders each year to become exposed to these benefits. They have also touched numerous lives through its outreach programs. Ponies and Kids is ready to grow by leaps and bounds with the addition of a barn with an indoor arena and proper drainage for their outdoor arenas. Please consider helping this great community organization grow to assist our community's youth and young adults with their specific needs.

It was the first time that he had ever ridden a pony!  I had tried to take him for a pony ride elsewhere before - but it didn't go so well.  I am ever so grateful to Ponies and Kids that my son was able to have this experience.  When I asked about future lessons, the owner told me that they are struggling financially to keep their doors open as they are a nonprofit agency.  They are in desperate need of an indoor facility.  I would hate to see this organization close its doors as they provide a wonderful service to the community.   They truly make a difference in the lives of children with developmental/sensory problems.  I would hope that our community could find a way to support this organization and help them to thrive.

While I've been with PAK I've been able to grow stronger in my abilities on how to properly care for these horses as well as learning the proper management techniques required to raise these animals. PAK has been able to teach me valuable safety precautions needed when working with horses as well as the responsibilities required to take care of horses. I've also been able to grow in my teaching abilities when I've assisted with the many lessons and parties offered through this organization. Ponies and Kids is a very welcoming and friendly environment that allows people to relieve their daily stresses as well as finding peace and quite when working with these amazing animals! I highly recommend that anyone who wants to get more involved in horses and learn the important responsibilities needed should come to PAK! The teaching and management at PAK is done in a professional and friendly manner and are openly willing to teach and accept new riders and volunteers every day! This organization is a family owned and family friendly place that allows kids of all ages to enjoy the special qualities that these animals can give us! I highly recommend that people donate, volunteer, and become involved with Ponies and Kids!

But shortly after the adult supervision decreased significantly and became a safety concern.  The high school instructors are responsible for almost all the lesson objectives.  Riders are encouraged to volunteer for maintence duties while often being unsupervised.  The monthly lesson payments were due even if lessons are cancelled due to weather or riding conditions and not rescheduled as promised.  Often these cancellations were communicated very poorly.  The overall quality of lessons and conditions have much to be desired.

The barn provides a safe haven for many children, and it teaches important life skills such as responsibility, hard work, and patience. The horses get kids off the couch and outside where they can breathe the fresh air and get much-needed exercise. The barn becomes a family, a place where strong friendships are made between humans and horses. PAK builds future leaders.

My daughter has attended their summer camp two summers in a row and would spend all of her time out there if we could afford it!  She has learned so much from them--not just all aspects of horse care, but also confidence and self-worth.  It has been such a positive experience for her and in turn, for us as her parents as well.  She always comes home so happy with the care and treatment she has received from everyone at Ponies and Kids and then being able to ride and take care of the horses while she's there is just the best!  It's been amazing to see the transformation that she goes through while being a part of the Ponies and Kids family.  It has really helped her self-confidence and brings her out of her shell. She is going to start volunteering at Ponies and Kids and taking lessons.

She is thoughtful, sensitive, anxious, a lover of animals, and doesn't express interest in a most typical activities in which a child her age would have an interest.   She had the opportunity to go to Ponies and Kids as part of a summer camp a couple of years ago and it quickly became clear she had found her passion.  She returned the following summer, and again this past summer.  She spent as much time at Ponies and Kids as we would allow and was feasible.  When she is unable to go to Ponies and Kids she misses it a great deal.  My daughter feels safe at Ponies and Kids and has developed a relationship with the horses and everyone there.  She continually asks when she can go see one horse in particular because he calms her.  It is clear Wilene and Scott have poured their hearts and souls into this organization and this is what makes being there special.

It has been wonderful to follow this horse's progress via PAK's facebook site, and I am incredibly thankful to this great organization that helps not only kids but also horses unlock their potential!
Ponies and Kids	218940		/users/profile/282548	djfox319	Volunteer	5	10/01/2014	Having recently moved to the West Lafayette, IN area from Illinois I was looking for just the right volunteer opportunity to get more involved with my new community.  I found Ponies and Kids using the volunteer database on the United Way of Greater Lafayette website.  Part of their vision is to give kids whose families' might not have the financial means an opportunity to become a part of the horse world - learn about their care, how to ride and show, and more.  My daughter was painfully shy growing up and caring for her own horse, learning to ride and show, and helping out at the barn is what kept her grounded.  I'm not sure either one of us would have made it through her teenage years without her involvement with horses.  Experiencing firsthand the expenses of this sport I wanted to help other kids have the opportunity to participate in activities with horses.  I admire the dedication of Wilene and Scott Gillim to this organization and its vision.
Ponies and Kids	216487		/users/profile/279982	adeno	Client Served	5	09/23/2014	My daughter has been a part of Ponies and Kids for nearly 2 years.  It immediately became her home away from home.  I am quite sure she would rather be there than anywhere on earth. She has a strong connection with the horses and her "barn friends".  She has learned work ethic as well as riding skills.   The true value at Ponies and Kids is not measured by the student's riding skills but rather the impact that the organization has made in their lives.  I have seen my daughter's confidence soar, her leadership skills grow daily, and she has learned many lessons in respect.  Ponies and Kids truely has made a significant impact in the lives of many youth.
Ponies and Kids	215861		/users/profile/279316	The-Momma	Client Served	5	09/19/2014	My daughter has gained so much from going to Ponies and Kids. She, of course, has gained riding skills. More importantly, however, she has gained skills that will help her through her teen years and beyond. For example, she has a high confidence level from working with the horses.  Because of the opportunities that Ponies and Kids has provided, she has developed leadership skills. She was able to work as a junior counselor for the horse camp, and that opportunity shifted her entire perspective of herself. She started growing in self-assurance and showed great pride in her work (no small miracle when you consider the typical self-esteem of a middle school girl). From doing barn work she now has a good understanding of what it means to care for animals. This has motivated her to think about veterinary medicine as job. She has many years to decide what she will do for a career, but I am just happy that I have a young, teenage girl who is willing to work hard at math and science for a goal. Thank you, Ponies and Kids, for making this happen!
Ponies and Kids	214872		/users/profile/278189	cpetkov	Volunteer	5	09/12/2014	Ever since my daughter Anna was a small little toddler, living just outside the big city of Chicago, she has had a great fondness for horses. Honestly, I don't remember how her love of them came about ~ after all, we really hadn't had much exposure to horses where we lived. She would trot around our small backyard doing what looked like a horses' gallop moving her head forward and back, making horse noises! It was really a funny sight to watch. Anna is the youngest of three and unfortunately gets pushed around a bit by her older siblings. I think it is difficult for the youngest to figure out exactly how they fit in, what role do they take in their family, in life.. etc. When we moved here to West Lafayette we were fortunate enough to learn about Ponies and Kids. One thing led to another, and we seem to spend quite a bit of time with the horses there. It was never in the family budget to allow Anna to pursue her love of horses, Lord knows we can't afford to purchase one! Ponies and Kids has made it possible for us to allow Anna a few lessons that are within our budget. Anna is almost 9 now, and she is in her element being around the horses and ponies! She is really becoming a super confident girl and I'm so very amazed at how she can take charge of such a large animal! I even see differences in her at home when interacting with her older sisters. Because of her sense of accomplishment when she is able to command her pony,  being able to feel responsible for them (it is quite a job to feed and water), Anna carries herself differently.  She has a great sense self worth and purpose! She's a great student in school, but beyond that, if it weren't for Ponies and Kids, she says she'd be bored! And you know what they say "idle hands..."  So, thank you Wilene and Ponies and Kids! What a positive influence you've been in our lives. I hope you get the funding needed for the indoor arena the kids and horses so desperately need!

I never knew what an impact it would have on her.  Wilene is a great instructor who has taught her so much not only about horses but also life lessons such as respect, team work, trust, dedication, and what she can achieve with hard work.  Ponies and Kids has quickly become our favorite place.  I love volunteering for them as it is truly a great organization!

Bloomington Symphony Orchestra	112231	2	/users/profile/152695	Kate27	Volunteer	5	05/16/2012	The first time I ever saw the BSO was from a performance on CATS. I wondered who they were...when I found out it was Bloomington's own community orchestra, I couldn't believe it. They were so much better than any community orchestra I'd ever heard. Several years ago I auditioned for the second violins. Suffice it to say, I've never looked back. I have never been so impressed with a nonprofit's musical direction, choice of repertoire, dedication, congenial spirit, contribution to the community, and level of excellence. I have seen Maestro Latshaw make music accessible to untrained listeners,  volunteers give all they have and more, participated in "side-by-side" concerts with budding high school musicians, children's smiles at the "meet the instruments" program, etc.  None of the eight Indiana University Orchestras, the POPS or Camerata (to my knowledge) do these things. Plus, the BSO affords those of us for whom music is an avocation the best possible orchestra opportunities in a town where there would otherwise be very few. I thank my lucky stars for the BSO!   
Bloomington Symphony Orchestra	112187	1	/users/profile/152651	MollyMo3	Volunteer	5	05/16/2012	I have performed alongside the Bloomington Symphony Orchestra several times as a fill-in and was amazed each time at the level of musicianship and passion involved! Rehearsals (and concerts) have a clear structure and the musicians are focused on the end goal of delivering a great concert to the public. Their children's concert was brilliantly delivered, had an outstanding turn-out, and, best of all, gave dozens of kids the opportunity to have invaluable one-on-one learning experiences with the instruments! This is one community group that unites to perform their best and deliver enlightening, educational, and enriching concerts to members of the community.

It is also my pleasure to donate to the Bloomington Symphony Orchestra and to serve as their sometime consultant on governance and strategic planning.  I also helped paint their office!!  In the end, this is a great volunteer-driven organization with a terrific artistic director, an energetic board and volunteer cohort, who produce amazing concerts.  If you attended their Berlioz Symphonie Fantastique last month, your hair would still be standing on end.  Go, BSO!!

From the musicians and director to the board members, talent and dedication abounds at the BSO.  Few other cities can boast of such a well run, talented, and positive organization. 
Bloomington Symphony Orchestra	112079	1	/users/profile/142378	victory	Volunteer	5	05/15/2012	I have been playing violin in The Bloomington Symphony for many years and have experienced its influence on the community first hand. Of special value is its exposure and hands-on experience of music to children. But audiences too get to a treat, not only by listening, but gaining fascinating backgrounds to the music they hear and in an entertaining format. For the musicians it is a wonderful chance to make music, to involve family and friends. The Bloomington Symphony is a true intergenerational community, a celebration of sharing, among one another and with the community.

Bloomington Symphony Orchestra	112016	2	/users/profile/152430	ralf8	General Member of the Public	5	05/14/2012	For many years the Bloomington Symphony Orchestra has provided accessible concerts with a lovely combination of the classic and the challenging. Living in the shadow of an internationally known school of music, the BSO plays an essential role in reaching out to the non-university-affiliated and in working with high school students to help them see how to keep music in their lives. In recent years, the concerts have been especially engaging and informative. The collaborations with other arts organizations, the players' enthusiasm for their conductor, and the great music they make together have been a truly wonderful gift from the orchestra to the community.
Bloomington Symphony Orchestra	111902	2	/users/profile/152299	Catherine17	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/11/2012	The Bloomington Symphony Orchestra provides the opportunity for both amateurs and professionals to share in the glorious art of music making.  There is something for everyone at every concert, and usually some surprises along the way.  A great group of people conducted by the talented and fun-loving Charles Latshaw.
Bloomington Symphony Orchestra	111888	2	/users/profile/152290	brendang	Board Member	5	05/11/2012	The Bloomington Symphony Orchestra offers a rich and supportive outlet for amateur musicians to join together and share their talents, but it provides a much broader series of meaningful services for the local community. In my time with the orchestra, first as a volunteer musician and now as a board member, I've been able to take part in a series of remarkable musical musical events, from tackling monumental works in the standard classical repertoire--i.e., Mahler's first symphony--to introducing stringed instruments to children at an event designed to let kids "Meet the Instruments." Without deviating from its core mission of creating a space for musicians in the community to gather and perform, the BSO supports a series of educational and arts advocacy programs. For example, the orchestra maintains a collection of instruments that it repairs and loans to you musicians in Bloomington, it regularly collaborates with community artists and arts organizations, and it presents a free annual children's concert. Plus, I would be remiss if I didn't mention the incredibly dedicated, dynamic, and welcoming people who the make the orchestra special. The BSO is truly a gem.

Bloomington Symphony Orchestra	111832	1	/users/profile/152233	Donna Lafferty	Volunteer	5	05/11/2012	The Bloomington Symphony Orchestra has been able to build a phenomenal sense of community - not only through its performances, but also through outreach programs like the Children's Instrument Recovery Program (ChIRP), side-by-side concerts with local schools, a youth concerto competition, and Meet the Instruments (where school kids get to try out the different instruments of the orchestra). Volunteers and audience members all agree that the BSO is something special in our community, and I'm very proud to say I've been a volunteer with this organization for the past 15 years. There really is something special about the BSO.

It's dedicated to bring music to the world, and it is a huge benefit to the whole community.  It's a place for people to play music with one another, and a way for those who don't play instruments to learn about music.  I am very proud to be associated with the BSO.

Small groups from the Symphony also bring performances to retirement communities for those who can't attend the entire Symphony performances. The small groups bring a special treat to all who get to hear them play. They are all very special people and performers. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Bloomington Symphony Orchestra	111671	1	/users/profile/152052	20pluscellist	Volunteer	5	05/09/2012	Bloomington Symphony is an unique, and extraordinary musical group. Our conductor leads and rehearses us in a way which brings us to a higher level than we have ever played. Because he believes we can and cheerfully challenges us, we accomplish an incredible concert every single time. The results are remarkable because most of us play well, but very few of us can claim professional status. Our results are the most professional of any community orchestra I've ever seen. We play for the joy of performing such wonderful pieces.  We also often have students from different parts of the world. I have shared a stand with Russian, Chinese and German cellists and it has always enriched me.  It is a fabulous group with which to perform.

Bloomington Symphony Orchestra	111631	1	/users/profile/151997	jessica.rooney1	General Member of the Public	5	05/09/2012	There are many great things you can say about the BSO: its broad repertoire, its high level of technical skill, and its professionalism in performance, to name a few.  However, my favorite part of the orchestra is its heart.  From the energy of the performances to their community outreach, the BSO brings a level of passion and personality that demonstrates that these musicians consider the group to be much more than a simple organization.  I highly recommend that the community continued to attend its fantastic concerts, and that any interested musicians join!  Ever since I moved away from Bloomington I have missed the BSO dearly.
Bloomington Symphony Orchestra	111626	1	/users/profile/151989	denisevalkyrie	General Member of the Public	5	05/09/2012	It was my pleasure to have served the Bloomington Symphony Orchestra as first a Stage Manager and then as General Manager. In these capacities I witnessed firsthand the dedication of each of the volunteer musicians and board members. Not only do these musicians provide exquisite music for the residents of Bloomington at affordable concerts, they provide a free concert in the park for every citizen that chooses to experience a live symphony that they would otherwise not have the opportunity to enjoy. These concerts have been so successful that after a year experimentation of moving it to a more intimate location the citys parks department chose to move it back to a larger location to accommodate all of the people that bring their whole families to enjoy the music in the park.Additionally, this volunteer organization receives donated instruments, rehabilitates them and provides them to children along with lessons given for free by dedicated musicians. These children would have little to no ability to rent instruments or pay for lessons in their communities.Furthering this mission the BSO, as it is fondly referred to, conducts side by side concerts in which children from the local schools play side by side with the orchestra members, providing them with an experience that they may never forget and inspires them. Not least the BSO provides a small prize to a local child who shows talent and dedication with their instrument of choice. Perhaps most notably a very young Joshua Bell was awarded this prize many years ago.I reiterate that this is a volunteer orchestra, with musicians that are professional as well as those who have other careers yet play at a professional level. It is, in my opinion, a shining example of volunteerism in the arts community. 
Bloomington Symphony Orchestra	111609	1	/users/profile/151974	Charles Davis	Board Member	5	05/09/2012	Having served both as a player and a member of the Board of Directors, I have been privileged to participate in different capacities with this outstanding community orchestra.  Composed of professionals and accomplished amateur players, the BSO has consistently performed at a high level since I first joined the group in the late 1980s.  Most recently, under the guidance of Charles Latshaw, this remarkable group has expanded its repertoire and provided thoroughly enjoyable concerts.  Bloomington is fortunate to have such a dedicated and gifted group of people who enjoy sharing their talents with the community. 
Bloomington Symphony Orchestra	111605	1	/users/profile/151970	Ron_9	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/09/2012	The BSO is an amazing group of hard-working musicians with an inspiring, motivating conductor who pushes the group to be more, musically speaking.

Bloomington Symphony Orchestra	111582	1	/users/profile/151937	Ray_	Volunteer	5	05/08/2012	The Bloomington Symphony Orchestra has become an inspiring organization.  Players in the orchestra are primarily community volunteers practicing as a group only once a week normally.  And it has presented some amazing performances.  It is an enriching experience for me to be able to perform with the orchestra.  Bloomington is full of extremely accomplished musicians since it is home to the IU Jacobs School of Music.  So having a community based orchestra provides those of us that can play reasonably well a way of continuing our musical pursuits in a meaningful and rewarding way.  The current musical director, Charles Latshaw, has inspired us all to play to the very best of our potential.  And as each performance passes with success, that potential rises a little.  The BSO is an organization that can proudly represent Bloomington 
Bloomington Symphony Orchestra	105884	4	/users/profile/142333	MongoLuehring	Board Member	5	02/03/2012	The Bloomington Symphony Orchestra has changed my life. I play with the orchestra, support it financially, serve on the board and promote it every chance I get, because I love this group and am incredibly grateful for the many gifts it gives me. Our Music Director is a constant source of inspiration - he brings a depth of understand and sheer joy for the music that I've never seen anywhere else. He loves Mahler, Tchiakovsky, Beethoven, Ravel...all the greats, and he makes us love them too. I've been involved in other non-profits before, but this is the first one that has reached me in such a profound way. Music has become the single biggest joy in my life, and it's thanks to this orchestra that I can finally acknowledge that. 
Bloomington Symphony Orchestra	105412	2	/users/profile/141644	PeachTree2012	Volunteer	5	02/02/2012	It is amazing what this orchestra accomplishes even though it is entirely populated with volunteers. They have themed repertoires for each performance and meld together both familiar and unfamiliar pieces for each one. For instance of their current season their first performance was called "Brasstissimo (ma non troppo)" and featured Respighi's "Pines of Rome," Borodin's "Symphony #2" and Glinka's "Overture to Russlan and Ludmilla". Remember, these are VOLUNTEERS playing this!  The orchestra also does a free children's concert around Christmas and during the summer to introduce music to a wide audience. They also team up with local area high schools for a performance with the high schools' orchestras. Finally you do not want to miss the current conductor; he is a joy to watch and he always tries to do a bit of instruction in order to enhance your experience of the music. This volunteer orchestra is worth your time and money to go hear. For a full disclosure: I went to the performances of the BSO before I volunteered for them.

An HVAF outreach worker  met with me as I was being discharged from the VA hospital. I spent 13 months in their intensive rehabilitation program and another 2 years in HVAF supportive housing. During that time I enrolled in computer training courses and then into college, eventually becoming employed for the VA. The end of my time with HVAF came in October of 2011 shortly after I became employed with VAMC.  Although my parting with HVAF was not what I had hoped for I still give them 4 stars today. An unknown had made false allegations against me and mistakes were made. I cannot hold them accountable for the ill will of someone I do not know. Mistakes happen in organizations this large who work to help so many. I only know that because of them, I am alive, sober, and loved by my family again. Most case workers of that period are gone now and Dr. Haenlein is still a champion to me and so many other vets. He and HVAF will always have my respect.

I have witnessed firsthand the things they do and the clients they serve and it hurts my heart. To throw someone back onto the streets with nowhere to go and no help is not helping them get better. To put them out the minute they make a mistake is not helping them. These are people who have served and fought for our country and then they come home with all kinds of problems and can't even get a decent meal. Some need rehab.. But I have never seen a case manager or anyone make sure they get meds or get to the doctor. I witnessed a man get put out because he was off his meds and started doing irrational things. He had nowhere to go but that was of no concern to them. HELPING veterans and families my ass...its all about the money. Non for profit because the profit they get goes right back to them and not the people they are suppose to be helping. My father fought in vietnam..luckily for him he doesn't need this sad excuse of an organization to help.its good to know if he did that they would be here not to help.

Some have taken to drugs and alcohol as methods of dealing with such an abrupt change in lifestyle; as a result of these new behaviors, many have found themselves forced to leave their loved ones and turn to life on the streets.  HVAF and its staff help these homeless veterans (some of whom may actually qualify for VA benefits) to begin the process of taking control of their lives (emotionally, physically, spiritually, financially).   HVAF staff understand that it is a process, with some setbacks along the way.  However, the clients (veterans) understand that this chance might be their last and most want to take full advantage of the opportunities that HVAF provides.

As a veteran of Operation Enduring Freedom, I saw firsthand how war can negatively impact veterans, sometimes leading to a lifetime of struggles with drugs and alcohol.  To be able to provide a hand up to those veterans that are suffering from invisible wounds is an honor.  No person that ever fought for our nation should be left to sleep on the street.

Being a veteran myself I was excited about the prospect of getting a chance to work with a population that was very dear to my heart. I could not believe all the services they provide. They do so much for those who have served. Indiana is lucky to have a program like this one. I hope one day they are able to branch out into other states.

I've personally worked side by side with some of HVAF's members and I am truly inspired by the dedication they display on a daily basis to help those in need. Also their helping hand does not end with helping veterans only. HVAF has other team members that venture into homeless communities and camps to distribute food, resources, and a handshake so those who are struggling know there is help available. That's what I call going the extra mile!

This is important since veterans make up a staggering one-third of the entire homeless population, a fact that many are not aware of.  With our troops returning home, the need for an organization like HVAF is even more imperative.  I am fortunate and grateful to be part of an agency that really makes  difference in the lives of our veterans.

We give them a place to live for a bit, and link them with the services they need to become healthy and whole. They have to work hard in our programs, and when they do, are rewarded with a renewed sense of joy in living. Everything we do at HVAF centers around the mission of ending homelessness for veterans. The staff lives and breathes it, and our vets quickly realize how much we care. It is a privilege to be a part of this organization.

My job consist of helping veterans put their lives back together  while in our housing program by educating and helping them hone their coping, social and various other  skills needed to function in society. Skills that were forgotten or put on the back burner due to  homelessness, mental health,( addiction issuues ranging from drugs and alcohol to sex and food, yes food all these things can cause health problems. Being a former homeless veteran who dealt with all these issues and made my way back with help from organizations like HVAF I see first hand the accomplishment we as a team make on a daily basis, and  I am very proud to be a part of this team for the past six years. I shared a one and a half year  journey with a veteran who came into our program on disability, with a bad herion addiction, is bipolar, homeless and attempted to take his life with a gun, today he is working and off disability, has had his own apartment for over a year almost 2 years clean and sober, taking his medication like he should and is leading a productive life.

I come from a family of veterans and it feels good to give back to the veteran population.  I had no clue how many homeless veterans were out there and working for HVAF has been a wake up call for me!  I will continue to help those in need and provide a positive environment for veterans who feel that no one cares for them because I definitely do!  Thanks for allowing me to share my thoughts.

I was commissioned in 1989, went to war in 1990-1991 and continued to lead soldiers until 2000.  Just because I am no longer wearing the uniform, does not mean that I can disregard my duty to take care of soldiers.  I believe that duty lives on throughout my life. It is honor serve on the board of HVAF of Indiana and continue to take care soldiers in their greatest needs. Duty, Honor, Country Together we serve!

Scott Shipman and his team are constantly responding to someone in need. That need could be finding the next meal, repairing a leaky roof, building a ramp so that someone disabled or elderly can enter and exit their home, helping to clean-up or re-build after mother nature strikes.  This organization really does focus on giving a "hand up, not a hand-out."  Everyone who comes across Helping His Hands, either on the giving or receiving end, is better for it.  This world needs more people like Scott and those who volunteer for Helping His Hands.  I am proud to serve on the Helping His Hands Executive Board.

They are willing to go the extra mile for people and show them that someone really cares what they are going through.  Ive been on a few trips with them and it was wonderful every time. I dont know who was more blessed by the end of the week, the ones we went to help, or me.  I love that they encourage everyone to be a part: it doesnt matter how much experience you have, your age, or your gender. You may not think you can do much but let me tell you that you can. I didnt have much experience with construction and such on those trips but I learned a lot and was able to make a difference.  They are doing great things to help those in need in our country and our own community and I believe that this organization will truly change the world.

Helping His Hands Disaster Response Inc.	219561		/users/profile/283174	Jim_117	Volunteer	5	10/03/2014	Helping His Hands does exactly that. Help the hands of Jesus. HHH is one of the most diverse yet focused nonprofits you will find. There is diversity in volunteers from young children, college students, young adults, all the way to retired folks all with an amazing array of backgrounds. There is diversity in donors from corporations, to churches, to individuals, and to small businesses. The diversity also is reflected, most importantly in neighbors who receive assistance from Helping His Hands in short term and long term needs. Regional disasters: from Sandy to Moore, Oklahoma and Joplin, Missouri; from Georgia and Katrina to Henryville, Indiana have benefitted from Helping His Hands assistance and volunteers. Locally, a food pantry has been established to assist those in need of basic provision. The Salvation Army refers neighbors when they run out of resources. Other local assistance includes home repair, roof repair and replacement, and providing some furnishings for those who have had a fire or other destructive event. Temporary housing for those who have lost their home is being developed with a vision to assist the homeless in the future. A great organization in helping His hands.
Helping His Hands Disaster Response Inc.	217177		/users/profile/280704	azehr	Volunteer	5	09/25/2014	Helping His Hands is one of the best missional organizations thst I've witnessed. After disaster, most organizations just help with recovery and clean up but HHH stays through rebuild and sometimes is the last organization to leave a disaster area. Not only are they instrumental to the aid of disaster stricken areas but they provide many services in the local community and have a great vision for helping people recover and bringing people to Christ. My children and I went to family camp in Oklahoma this last summer to help rebuild a house. It was an awesone experience for them, at the ages of 5 & 13 to see how helping others out of the love of Christ is so impactful to those who need hope. I can't wait to see what Christ does next thru their organization.

The thing that captured my interest about this ministry is that the volunteers go into disaster areas, not looking to be 'in charge' but to help the hands that are already there. The local church knows the needs of the community and can lead us to the best ways of meeting those needs. I have had the privilege of serving as a board member, a field chaplain and a cook. Each of these roles has allowed me to see the lives that have been impacted by Helping His Hands. I consider it an honor to have served alongside the board and the many volunteers.

It was an invitation from Scott of Helping His Hands that we decided to make this trip.  Scott is a man that loves God and loves to help his people in their time of need.  All it takes is the willingness to help and serve to help another person.  Helping His Hands took care of everything, from arranging our sleeping quarters, providing transportations to the work site and they put us in areas where we could do the most good.  The people we helped we so gracious and we were blessed beyond words to be able to make a "hands on" contribution to those in need.  Everything Helping His Hands does goes to the glory of God!  
Helping His Hands Disaster Response Inc.	213730		/users/profile/276933	Xinderoth	Volunteer	5	09/06/2014	     Helping his hands is a great ministry. The director, Scott Shipman, has a most excellent vision and mission for the organization. I really enjoyed the authenticity and realism that happens within this group. Real people are impacted in very real ways by everything around them. They seek to offer a helping hand (as the name implies) to people in need, and that's exactly what they do. They go out and provide assistance and relief to those who need it.     Even if you're not that skilled at construction or the various actions in recovery, there is no need to worry. Helping his Hands has experienced workers able to provide guidance to those who may need it and can teach you a variety of skills that you can keep for a lifetime. Ideally, one could take what they learn and be able to use that knowledge in other areas, such as other mission trips or their own hometown.    In conclusion, HHH is the real deal.     If you have any questions, please email me at the links provided below.                     -dethdrummer@hotmail.com                     -Xinderoth@gmail.com     God Bless, and enjoy your day.

It also works well in conjunction with the typical therapy.  They help kids build patience, self esteem, coping skills, responsibility, and it is something for them to look forward to weekly. 
Strides to Success Inc	313220		/users/profile/404592	jjcowgirl2	Board Member	5	10/21/2016	Strides to Success is a place where great things happen through the healing nature of horses.  I've witnessed veterans describing their stories of PTSD and how hopeless they felt, burdened with the scars from their service to our country.  I've heard their stories of healing through working with the therapists, counselors and the horses at Strides.  They describe how they see themselves, mirrored in the actions and behaviors of the horses.  As they build trust with the horses, they learn how to trust humans again.  These soldiers are able to break down the tall, mental walls built to protect them during war times so they can live normal lives again.  The staff at Strides works tirelessly to give back to those who have given to our country.  The counselors, therapists and staff demonstrate kindness, compassion, empathy and understanding to these brave and broken souls.  They build them up by giving them the tools and strategies needed to transition back into civilian life.  The veterans learn how to form bonds with family and friends that were broken and never healed.   The STRIDES they make through coming to this facility are miraculous.   Hearing these men and women tell their stories of SUCCESS is truly amazing.  I'm honored to be an advocate for this organization and am so proud of the work that happens here!

The staff has a collective knowledge and experience unsurpassed by any other program. The facility is a haven, a safe place where real change can happen.  The horses are so powerful in their ability to bring out the confidence and courage in children, adults, veterans and survivors that help them move past trauma, social and life challenges.

Although my initial interest was being with the horses, I was soon drawn in even more by the atmosphere that the staff clearly went out of their way to create. Every creature, great and small, equine, human or otherwise, is consistently treated with the utmost respect. While Strides main work is to help students move forward from places of weakness, the focus instead, is all about helping the student to build skills from the unique strengths they bring with them. I find Strides to Success to be a place God has blessed with a wonderful nurturing spirit!

As a person with aspergers I am absolutely not a fan of change. I loved being in the marines; it was structured. Coming home to the chaos of America was a really hard adjustment for me. It was even harder because they recycled my k9 partner, I was hoping to adopt her permanently. I eventually got over it the best I could and I bonded with a new dog and now I train dogs here thanks to Debbie Anderson and Blair McKissock from strides to success. I love them dearly and still see them from time to time. They helped me to become grounded because my brain runs like a run away train constantly. I can be in a room with 50 people and keep up with their conversation while having my own. It sometimes becomes too much for me to handle so we came up with several techniques to try and handle that. They deserve to be awarded something and I wish I had the money to make them a plaque myself. Because of their help I've been able to focus a little bit more than I used to.

Muncie Mission Ministries, Inc.	170553		/users/profile/225992	NLasley	Donor	5	09/19/2013	Muncie Mission Ministries is my favorite charity.  Muncie Mission Ministries works in cooperation with other agencies and services, as well as providing shelter and food for homeless and down-and-out men.  They serve their community by providing lunches to all who come in need to their door.  Their Attic Window stores provide low cost clothing to the community, as well as raising funds.  They cooperate with the Paul Revere Chapter, Daughters of the American Revolution and Valentine Hollingsworth Chapter, Colonial Dames 17th Century to have annual Stand Down for Homeless and In-Need Veterans.  Again, they are my favorite charity.
Muncie Mission Ministries, Inc.	170255		/users/profile/225615	Julie131	Volunteer	5	09/18/2013	Muncie Mission is one of the very best ministries available in the Muncie area. They fill a growing gap in our society and provide compassion and necessary training to help these men reenter society as productive adults. The teachings of Jesus Christ are essential in getting lives back on track. Muncie Mission never falters in this. If you are looking for a nonprofit to donate to, this should be your first choice.

Muncie Mission Ministries, Inc.	134154		/users/profile/179936	Steve Perry	Volunteer	5	11/06/2012	I became involved with the Mission Videoing the Walk a Mile and In My Shoes event 5 years ago. Later I videoed some on the clients for presentation to potential donors. Videoed the Walk the next year and provided finished video to show the walk to churches and civic groups. Over the years there have been many other projects which exposed me to the fine work of Muncie Mission. They are changing peoples lives by giving them hope. Muncie is very lucky to have such an organization working with homeless men and families. I will continue to help in any way I can!
Muncie Mission Ministries, Inc.	131078		/users/profile/176616	Baldwin_Brent	Board Member	5	10/30/2012	The Muncie Mission is truly an amazing organization.  Behind the leadership of Ray Raines, the Mission is changing and saving lives on a daily basis.  I've been very fortunate to be involved with the Mission as a volunteer, donor and board member.  During this time I have also had the good fortune of hearing stories from men at the Mission and how this wonderful organization has helped change their lives for the better.  By gaining a trust and faith in the lord through the guidance of the Mission staff , these men are choosing a better path.  I can not say enough about this organization and the positive impact it has on our community.
Muncie Mission Ministries, Inc.	131047		/users/profile/176580	jaimefaulkner	Volunteer	5	10/30/2012	I am a member of a church who meets in the same community as the Muncie Mission. For years now, our church comes to the Muncie Mission one night a month. We cook dinner, serve the men, then eat with them. As a volunteer, we have been showered with an incredible amount of love from this group. The staff always expresses their appreciation, but more importantly, the men who reside at the mission express their appreciation. They are always so grateful. I think this is a testament to the kind of leaders this organization hires. The example of leadership, gratitude, thankfulness, respect and love is given to the men and in return, they extend the same grace to those who visit the mission.  We are serving them, but they give so much back to us. They send us thank you notes, they give us hugs and over time, we've developed great relationships because of the environment the leaders of the organization create and the expectation they have on the men. This is one of the best volunteer experiences I've ever had.  
Muncie Mission Ministries, Inc.	129699		/users/profile/175096	Jerry P	Volunteer	5	10/26/2012	One of the very best experiences of my year is helping make one of their most important fundraisers a huge success.  As a committed Christian myself I am always overjoyed to witness first hand the significant life changing experiences of so many men with serious issues have discovered through The Muncie Mission.  Each staff member is fully devoted to ministering to each man and helping achieve a better life and it is obvious as soon as you enter the building or listen to any staff member witness to a visitor.  My life has changed also as I make time to assist with their mission.  It is truly an experience from God that I truly cherish and will continue as long as possible.
Muncie Mission Ministries, Inc.	128868		/users/profile/174140	mbhosier	Volunteer	5	10/25/2012	I started volunteering at the mission about 4 months ago.  Ray, Missy, and the staff made it work for me so I could work it into my job's schedule.  I have thoroughly enjoyed the time spent there and would recommend it to any one that has a heart for the Lord and for people in need!!
Muncie Mission Ministries, Inc.	128788		/users/profile/174029	Ed Burgauer	General Member of the Public	5	10/25/2012	My experience with the Muncie Mission has been very positive.  Over the past several years I have had the opportunity to participate in functions both inside the facility, as well as witness the benfits of outreach programs.  I have always enjoyed their Holiday functions, especially helping with the Thanksgiving Meal needs and more.   I personally know Don Ford and Ray Raines and the outstanding job they do helping this community and men in need.
Muncie Mission Ministries, Inc.	128330		/users/profile/173484	Nancy70	Donor	5	10/24/2012	A true mission of service and honor to our Lord Jesus!  Organized, clean, excellence in programs to help men needing a place to stay and hopefully open their hearts to the love of Jesus, in addition to helping those in the community who may just need a good meal or item of clothing, etc., etc.  It is such a blessing to be a small part of this ministry who serves, serves and serves even more . . . a ministry with our Lord's mission!

Muncie Mission Ministries, Inc.	128322		/users/profile/173472	Mary113	Volunteer	5	10/24/2012	I started volunteering at the Muncie Mission about 2.5 years ago.  I have always shopped at their clothing store and enjoyed attending services when our church has the responsibility of Sunday afternoon chapel.  I volunteer on Mondays for 5-7 hours.  I look forward to my time there each month.  The full time employees and all the administration  personal have become my friends and the men who live there are so kind to me.  I have been trained to do many different jobs and I try to do my best for the Glory of the Lord.  I do give my time to volunteer but I am more blessed by what I receive than what I give. Ephesians 2:10 - For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.  This is where God wants me to be right now and I am thankful.  I plan to be there Monday as usual.
Muncie Mission Ministries, Inc.	128313		/users/profile/173465	vs110622	Volunteer	5	10/24/2012	The Muncie Mission is a great organization that not only provides a great service to our community and those in need, but also provides great opportunities for my family to be involved in our community.  I have served on the golf committee and played in the tournament in the past, but the most impactful opportunity that I have been involved with is delivering meals on Thanksgiving morning.  This opportunity is great for my entire family.  I have children who are 12 and 10, and this is one of the few opportunities that  they can participate in.  They love going to the homes of individuals who may not otherwise get a Thanksgiving meal or have family to share it with, and spend some time with these people!!  We even sang happy birthday to one lady!!!  My family is very blessed to have a great organization like the Muncie Mission to volunteer for in our community!!  Sincerely, Eric Baize

Even though he lost his fight & his life to his addiction, it is always a comfort to know they are there for others who seek help.

This commitment goes well beyond the standard vocational level of service to a true sense of "mission". Our community is better because of the work of the Muncie Mission.  
Hello Gorgeous of Hope Inc	270847		/users/profile/359588	Writer	Board Member	5	11/02/2015	I became involved with Hello Gorgeous about 5 years ago through my salon.

They are simply angels on earth. Once you have been a part of one of these makeovers and/or become involved you cannot begin to comprehend the magnitude of the impact this organization has on these women.  What they give to them in just one day can't be out into words. All I can say is get involved.. This terrible disease has touched all of us in some way. But Hello Gorgeous restores the beauty that cancer steals and gives them a day of hope, peace and faith.  Thank you for what you give to us!!!

Hello Gorgeous of Hope Inc	252647	3	/users/profile/340745	Pamzahrt	General Member of the Public	5	08/11/2015	Cancer is such an ugly disease and when someone you love is going through treatments in the battle of their lives most of the time they lose their reason to feel good about their appearance.   Then Hello Gorgeous shows up and like a fairy tale you watch the disease take a back seat and you watch some volunteers perform their magic and find the smiles and sparkle that was stolen by chemo, medication and radiation.  I recently watch a co-worker be made over and even more then the physical transformation from the make over I watched her walk a little taller and with more confidence.  There was happy tears and a little more fight to continue to beat her disease.   Hello Gorgeous continues to lift up those that need so selfish me time.   What an awesome ministry and I look forward to watching the future.  
Hello Gorgeous of Hope Inc	252637	2	/users/profile/340734	Aggy	General Member of the Public	5	08/11/2015	One of our office managers is going through cancer treatment.  She was very self conscious about the way she looked.  When HG came to take her away for her surprise makeover, we didn't think she would actually go with them, but they were gentle and persistent and took her away with roses and in a limo.  Although she was beautiful to us before her makeover, you could tell she felt beautiful at her reveal  She loved her new clothes, makeup, mani/pedi, wig...she just radiated joy!  HG made a huge difference in this one woman's journey with cancer!  I can't thank them enough for this priceless gift!

I have seen Hello Gorgeous bring smiles a thousand miles long to people who are barreling one of the toughest fights of their lives. I watched how my grandma a long time supporter of Hello Gorgeous fell victim to the horrible disease that is cancer and I watched her have a day a few months before she passed where she forgot that she was in pain, forgot that she lost her leg, forgot that she was dying, forgot she had cancer and for a day she felt like a queen. It was a special moment for us, for her and for Hello Gorgeous. They are an incredible company. Genuine people and they truly believe in enriching lives and making them better. This is an organization near and dear to my heart. Incredible organization with loving, caring, amazing people!

Hello Gorgeous is all about the women who need some uplifting and support.  It is all about how the women with cancer are feeling, about what the women need, about what works for them.  It is about how good they should be feeling about themselves in what is probably the worst time in their lives.  At the end of every visit, there are smiles, tears, joy, excitement, and most of all, hope.  The founders, the volunteers, the donors, the Gorgeous women, they all see this.  Talk to the founders, talk to the volunteers, talk to the creative staff, talk to the organizers.  Hello Gorgeous spills from them every second of every day.  It is hard not to get addicted to the excitement of helping Gorgeous women!

Hello Gorgeous of Hope Inc	252471	2	/users/profile/340541	bklemm	Client Served	5	08/10/2015	My mother was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer. She did try treatment but it was very difficult for her. Her tiny body became frail. She had always been the woman to help others. She found herself in the difficult position to be the one in need. My sister and I cared for her as she cared for us all of our lives. The smallest things that used to bring her pleasure now made her sicker. She started to loose her sparkle in her eyes. She dreaded getting out of bed because the pain was just too much. The mother that we new was fading. She was nominated for a Hello Gorgeous makeover by a dear family friend. My sister and I along with our brother helped to surprise her. I will never forget what that day meant to our mother. She got her sparkle back. She felt beautiful again. She smiled, she laughed. We were able be there and watch her. We enjoyed the experience as much as she did. The staff at Fix Salon/Spa became like family to us. Looking at the before and after photos were amazing. You could see the woman that we have always known. She was happy. She felt special. She felt like she had some pride again. That feeling stayed with her for a long time after the makeover was finished. She loved her nails and showed them off to everyone who came to visit her. This was much more than a makeover for my mother. This allowed my mother to feel alive again at a time when she was dying. This allowed our family to have some great memories with her and to see her smile again. That smile is how I will remember my beautiful mother. I will forever be grateful for the opportunity to share this experience with my mother.

Love At Work Ministries Inc	153563		/users/profile/174570	Carolyn27	Volunteer	5	04/08/2013	I have served with this organization both locally and in Costa Rica. They serve many people in need through their programs. They have a strong base of donors and have done several successful fundraising events as well. Donations go directly to strengthening programs and helping children and adults in need. This organization seeks to build strong relationships and friendships with the people they serve, too.
Love At Work Ministries Inc	129205		/users/profile/174570	Carolyn27	Volunteer	5	10/25/2012	I have volunteered with Love at Work Ministries on several trips to Costa Rica. I have been amazed at the many ways this organization helps the community there and at the many things they have been able to accomplish. I am also a donor, donating monthly to the ministry's education program which serves deserving children in Costa Rica who cannot afford to attend a good school. The scholarships provided by the education program not only help students attend a strong school, but the program also encourages these students to be leaders in their community. I have recently joined the advisory board for this ministry and hope to work as a volunteer with the ministry again in the future.

My eyes were opened on what we all are supposed to do to take care of all our brothers and sisters in Christ.  God put in my heart a desire to help out with building homes, feeding the poor, and most of all Loving them.  The satisfaction that God puts in me to help his children is simply amazing.  The fund raising we do here in the states is growing and we need to keep getting the word out to help God's children in Costa Rica.  I am so grateful to be apart of Love At Work Ministries and I know my serving is making a difference.  God has shown me how to serve in so many ways.  Thank you Love At Work, Scott Hinshaw
Love At Work Ministries Inc	153131		/users/profile/175804	WCB2	Board Member	5	04/07/2013	Love at Work Ministries proclaims the good news of Jesus Christ in both words and actions in Alajuelita, Costa Rica.  2013 promises to be an amazing year for Love at Works through its work with the needy through its housing, education, feeding center, and health care ministries.   This summer will be a housing build of 12 homes for 12 needy families currently living in unstable shacks in a dangerous slum area.  Work continues on a new feeding center that services hundreds of children per day, and their youth ministry brings so many young people to know Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior.  Love at Works is doing outstanding work for the Kingdom, and I recommend it highly.
Love At Work Ministries Inc	130332		/users/profile/175804	WCB2	Volunteer	5	10/27/2012	Love at Works Ministries serves the forgotten people of Alajueleta Costa Rica by feeding children, educating children, building homes, and supporting men's and women's rehab centers.  Their mission is to spread the good news of Jesus Christ and follow his commands to help the poor on this earth.                    I have been able to travel to Costa Rica on one mission trip and was able to observe the great work they provide the poor and lost in the shanty town they serve with love.  I have also been able to work with Love at Works in the USA in fundraising including the recent Race 4 More, which raised over $100,000 to start building a new children's feeding center which provides many children their meal of the day.     I highly recommend Love at Works as an outstanding, efficient, and effective nonprofit in serving the needy.

It has not only affected others lives but my life has changed alot since I have expierienced Love at Work.
Love At Work Ministries Inc	132718		/users/profile/178378	Stefabeth	Donor	5	11/02/2012	Love at Work is an absolutely amazing organization. They work with a Church down in the slums of Costa Rica; a church that does what a church should! It reaches out to the community, giving food, shelter, and love to the people. They have a school for the children, a home for recovering men and women, a feeding center, a church for people to congregate at at any time, and so much more(and I got to see it all firsthand by going down there)! I have been donating for a while now and have gotten to see my money go towards children getting to have a good education, children getting fed, and a family having a dry, stable home. There is not doubt that Love at Work makes possible amazing things in Costa Rica through it's donations, friendship trips, and love.
Love At Work Ministries Inc	132235		/users/profile/177853	PMH3	Volunteer	5	11/01/2012	As a volunteer and donor, I cannot think of a better organization to spend my time or money with.  This organization is truely making an impact and changing the lives of the people they work with and their communities, the people who work for them and those of us fortunate enough to be volunteers and donors.  My family and I took our first trip with Love at Work in 2010 and were changed forever.  We make it a priority to support the amazing work of this organization in whatever way we can and hope to take another trip with them in the future. 
Love At Work Ministries Inc	131155		/users/profile/176707	nicole.beer	Volunteer	5	10/30/2012	Love at Work has been near and dear to our hearts for almost 4 years now.  We took our first trip with the organization back in April of 2009 and our hearts have been forever changed since.  Through the incredible leadership of the Love at Work team, we had the amazing experience of serving alongside fellow brothers and sisters living in some of the most extreme poverty conditions my husband and I had ever seen.  Love at Work continues to diligently serve this area of Costa Rica providing not just the "fish" to eat but also teaching this community how to become "fisherman" and self sustain.  Our hearts will truly never be the same again.

Love At Work Ministries Inc	130665		/users/profile/176149	daryl h	Volunteer	5	10/29/2012	I have been involved with Love at Work for 5 years.  It's without reservation that I can say this organization is truly engaged in showing the love of Jesus to the people of Alajueleta.  Of course there is a financial element.  However more important than that is the willingness of Love at Work to be personally involved with those in need of help.   They truly represent the hands and feet of Jesus to the people of Alajueleta.  It's with respect and integrity that Love at Work serves and honors the name of Jesus.

It changed our lives  and our daughters dramatically .   Our hearts have a  new love not only for the people of Alajueleta but all people.  The emphasis on Christ and Education is incredible and makes this mission focused on changing  lives of the people of Alajueleta today as well as future generations.  It is truly an organization run by God.
Love At Work Ministries Inc	129605		/users/profile/174982	K Hawkins	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/26/2012	Love at Work Ministries uses a holistic approach to serve the poor and underprivileged living in the slums of Costa Rica.  Through housing, nutrition, education and youth ministry Love at Work builds relationships by sharing Christ's love in tangible ways.  Those who benefit are drawn to understand the motivation behind such love, and this opens the door for evangelism.  The result is an eternal one.  Love at Work's transparency and stewardship create trust relationships with donors who come to know their funds are being used to the maximum to change lives.  Love at Work is a nonprofit like most hope to be:  efficient, effective and inspiring.

My life will be forever changed by this ministry. I have visited Costa Rica 5 time with Love at Work, where I helped build homes for the poor & Miserable, served in a children's feeding center, and built relationships with families living in the shanty towns there.  I also contribute monthly to the scholarship program, which gives hope and a way out by giving children a full scholarship, tutoring, school supplies and meals. What most sets Love at Work apart from other ministries is that they are constantly adapting to the needs of those they are serving. Love at Work is run primarily by volunteers.

They have done an excellent job at connecting western and local scholars, organizing lectures and conferences. The grants available through ARISC are some of the few available for research in the SC specifically and many have benefited from these. Their grant for Collaborative Cultural Heritage Management in Armenian is of particular importance, since such grants are quite rare (most grants are meant for conducting original research). The officers of ARISC and general and their Executive Director in particular, have always been ready and willing to answer both academic and logistical questions related to conducting research in the SC. They are also very proactive in getting their student members involved in various activities,  which is tremendously important for young scholars.  They have my outmost support and gratitude.

Their financial support is only part of why I'm grateful to ARISC, though. The effort ARISC officers have made to make a community of scholars in the US, as well as in Georgia and Armenia (my countries of research) has significantly eased my introduction to working in the region.
American Research Institute of the South Caucasus	235590	2	/users/profile/319229	DNI527	Client Served	5	12/17/2014	ARISC support has proven essential to my research in the South Caucasus from my first visit to the region. The in-country representative, who coincidentally shared the same research interests as me, was extremely helpful in arranging meetings and introducing contacts to me. I look forward to working with him more in the future. Several years later, ARISC provided me with a travel grant, which allowed me to develop a new project, and arranged for me to present my research in Georgia. These grants, though relatively modest, are extremely useful to graduate students and recent graduates, since they allow us to obtain pilot data for more substantial grant applications. Moreover, meeting and interacting with others whose research was supported by similar grants had proven beneficial for my research, and provided me with a great community of scholars while I was abroad.

I came across the organization during their launch, and was delighted to see an organization dedicated to making Life Coaching accessible to those who could not afford regular coaching rates.  Not only is W4C3 helping to make the world a better place one person at a time, they are bringing Coaches together in a warm and welcoming community of support.  I am honored to be involved with such a passionate, positive community!
Women For Change Coaching Community	122557	3	/users/profile/166929	Linda107	Client Served	4	09/19/2012	I am proud to be part of this emerging and unique organization.  I am a single mother raising three girls and believe in the power created when one woman truly extends a hand in friendship and caring to another, one-on-one, --specifically in this case by sharing the gift of "perspective".  We all have times in our life when guidance in change (in thinking about, understanding and creating and being empowered in where we want to go and visualizing a roadmap for how to get there) can be helpful.  Being part of this community both as client and in the initial startup is rewarding, thus  I intend to remain active with this organization; I look forward to seeing the positive differences it makes like a ripple in our communities, one life at a time, for a long time to come. Bravo!

Donor	5	09/12/2012	I originally learned about Women For Change Coaching Community from Nora Whalen in 2011 shortly after they incorporated. I was happy to contribute financially to the cause because what Nora and Lynn envisioned seemed like it would greatly benefit women. I have worked with Nora as my coach and I know how powerful the coaching process can be and having a team of coaches giving back - the effect could be incredible. I have watched the growth of this organization in sheer amazement. I really don't know how Nora and Lynn do it. They are two powerful women, incredible role models, and outstanding leaders. I can't wait to hear about the success W4C3 clients have, because I know their lives will be changed for the better.

This decision is reviewed and selected based on goals of the organization, efforts, leadership and passion. We had an easy decision this year in selecting Women for Change Coaching Community (W4C3).  Knowing the co-founders personally, we felt compelled to help support their dedication and commitment to impacting womens lives. By working in partnership with women who cannot afford the benefits of life coaching, these devoted professional coaches are providing hope, offering a personal and positive experience, for women seeking to overcome that next hurdle or witness life-changing results. We believe in the mission of W4C3. We look forward to seeing how W4C3 continues to grow and strengthen womens lives in the years to come.

I've seen transformations occur in women who've received pro-bono coaching, and this organization allows those transformations to multiply.

Coaching is such a powerful process for women to discover their authentic selves and learn how to live their passion and purpose.  Unfortunately, coaching is often cost prohibitive.  W4C3 has found the perfect way to support women in coaching and eliminate the financial barrier.

The fact that she and other coaches like her have come together to provide coaching for those who are unable to access coaching other wise is an incredible gift. I love what these powerful role models are doing and while I have no yet signed up to be a client, the information that they share on their blog and in the upcoming workshops are continuing to support me in making positive changes.

Women For Change Coaching Community	120745	1	/users/profile/164259	loretta1959	Board Member	5	08/15/2012	Women for Change Coaching Community is changing the world- one woman at a time!  Professional coaches from all over the United States and soon to be Canada will be providing low-cost coaching to women of all ages who earn less than $40,000 per year and who want to make positive changes in their lives.  Coaches will facilitate asking the right questions and will help women come to their own conclusions about the changes that will be right for them.  I have witnessed the power of coaching with a woman who left an abusive husband.  Although she participated in support groups and an employment program, she needed help reaching the next level of growth and stability.  A coach provided this for her and she has since been promoted at work and has stabilized her life and the life of her children.  Women for Change Coaching Community is a wonderful investment!
Women For Change Coaching Community	120706	1	/users/profile/164199	merepowell	Board Member	5	08/15/2012	My experience with Women For Change Coaching Community has been amazing... Smart, capable women with a shared dream of helping others succeed and get to the next level is the purpose of Women For Change.  The organization not only fills a great void in our society (a strong support system for women who have the talent, and just need the support and guidance to get to the next level )but it does so through a structured process, that is well organized and supported. Helping women succeed has benefits beyond just the woman seeking the needed help. It set women up to succeed, which will impact their children and their families for generations to come. I joined Women For Change, to reach out and help women, but I stay because in of the way this organization is designed, run and the impact it has on the lives it touches. 
Women For Change Coaching Community	120647	1	/users/profile/164057	davidsmeridian00	General Member of the Public	5	08/14/2012	One of the coolest things I have noticed about Women For Change Coaching Community is their outreach to other non-profits. W4C3 has reached out to other non-profits, who's volunteers often make less than $40,000 a year and are doing amazing things in their communities. Providing these volunteers (of other non-profits) access to professional coaches strengths those volunteers making their impact larger than it was previously. W4C3 is not focused solo on making their non-profit bigger and better. They want everyone to have access to a community that provides support for women seeking to make positive change. I don't know of another non-profit like W4C3. They are truly unique and a gift to the world.

Women For Change Coaching Community	120613	2	/users/profile/164042	NoraWhalen	Board Member	5	08/14/2012	Creating sustainable positive change in one's life can be challenging. Those that can afford to partner with a professional coach are more than 3 times more likely to make sustainable positive changes.                      From personal experience I know the benefits that coaching can bring to one's life. Knowing the benefits of coaching, the median annual earning for a full-time, year-round woman working in the US in 2010 (less than $40,000), my co-founders and I created Women For Change Coaching Community to make coaching accessible to all women. Most women in the U.S. can not afford the cost of a personal coach, but we what they earn should not deprive them of the opportunities that those who earn more have. We have built a community of support to make coaching accessible to all women who seek to make positive changes in their lives.                                                                                                                          The core of the W4C3 program is the one-on-one coaching partnership. The coach and client commit to a round of 12 coaching sessions, which are delivered via phone or Skype. In addition to the one-on-one partnerships, W4C3 builds community through bimonthly calls for coaches and clients. Coach support calls may include case presentations, consultation or topics of special interest to W4C3 coaches. Bimonthly teleclasses for clients are geared toward skill building, such as money management, job search, self-esteem or other topics in which clients express interest.                                                                   Coaches from around the world have embraced our coaching model and the clients are starting to flow in. While the history of W4C3 is a short one the impact is being felt in all over the U.S., U.K., France, and Canada.

Hollys House Inc	101104		/users/profile/128254	Bonnie arent	General Member of the Public	4	11/27/2011	  I am not a victim of any sort of violence. I just wanted to say after watching Holly's story on 48 Hours what an inspirational person she is.  I am 41 years and lost my fiance who I was with for over 11 years, my Mom and my friends as well as relatives. I do because of my loses know how hard life can be, but to see a person go through such a horrific event as Holly did and to dedicate herself to help others instead of wallowing in misery, is by all means a hero in my eyes. Holly is someone who was the complete opposite of her attacker, she has a strong value for human life. I admire her strength and moral that she demonstrated by testifying against her attacker/friend's killer. It is awful to see that people can ruthlessly kill, unimaginable. On the other hand someone like Holly, with her value for life, wanting to help others, live for the victims of her attacker, represents the ideal human, a mentor, a hero.

To compound our daughters plight, she also has Aspergers Syndrome.  From the time we arrived to the time we left, this unbearable time in our life stood out as our first step to recovery.  We felt somewhat enpowered to know that the truth was heard and no matter what happened in the legal system, the crime had been reported and was now going forward for prosecution.  We, as all victims, are blessed to have a safe haven like Holly's House.

Not only does Holly's House provide the perfect, comforting, welcoming environment for victims but the building now houses space for additional resources too - Lampion and Albion Fellows Bacon Center.  Then there is the community outreach - Think First Stay Safe was a huge hit at my son's school.  Thank you to the staff, supporters, and board of directors.

They play a vital role in our community and fill a much needed niche. When I toured the facilities, I was most impressed with the staff and the premises and the extra effort and thought they have put into everything to make the experiences there the best they can be under very difficult circumstances.

I have prosecuted many cases that have been investigated utilizing the services of Holly's House.  The cases I am presented from this organization, are so much more thorough in their presentation, and therefore, much easier to prosecute than others.

Everyone one of the staff believes in the Holly's House mission and it is evident in the way they conduct every day business at the House.  Holly's House partner agencies are also fully engaged in the advocacy center.  A victim can be interviewed once, and in a safe place where everyone is focused on the victim.

I did a 5-day silent retreat in a quaint, private cabin. The staff tried very hard to get me a spiritual director that would be a good fit, and I ended up Skyping with a previous director for daily conversations. The staff gave me a private room for an hour each day so I could talk on the computer with him, and it worked very well. I was very impressed with the facilities, the setting, and especially the staff. I will try to go back again and highly recommend it for either personal or group retreats!
Retreat Campus Inc	124468		/users/profile/169323	Donna53	Volunteer	5	10/03/2012	I have been a student of the Course in Miracles for eight years and counting. I had attended various study groups over a few years and became affiliated with Louise Dunn a long time CIM student herself and founder of Heartland Miracles. When the last study group I was attending moved to the opposite side of town, I began looking for a facility where I could facilitate a study group. I talked to Louise about this. I did not know it at the time but Louise was preparing to introduce the CIM to The Campus Retreat.  The introduction created  enough interest  to begin a study group at the Retreat. Louise asked if I was interested, and I said of course, especially since the Retreat is located in beautiful Owen County, where I had lived and raised my sons previously. Judi Butler, owner of The Campus Retreat has generously welcomed others with a desire to study the CIM to her facility.    
Retreat Campus Inc	124067		/users/profile/168869	bmech	Client Served	5	10/01/2012	My time at the Retreat Campus provided crucial time to be still and listen to God.  As a missionary serving in HR/Recruitment, we are always connecting or communicating with someone.  Time in the cabins was a great way to be disconnected from the rest of the world and dig into God's Word and pray.  God used this time studying in His Word and meditating on a few sermons to speak to me about some obedience and healing that needed to happen in my heart and life.  Praise God for how He restores.  Quiet time before Him has been crucial as He has called me to move to a new assignment, serving overseas ministering with women and children impacted by poverty and trafficking.  I am so thankful for the ministry of the Retreat Campus!  And when I move overseas in January, it will continue to be a comfort to know that there are places like the Retreat Campus that provide time and space for not only missionaries but believers in general to get away and hear from the Lord.  It is amazing to know that this staff is committed to praying for others' renewal!

Judi Butler and her staff are some of the friendliest and most consientious people I have ever met.  This beautiful Campus is most certainly a Haven of Rest for the weary soul who needs quality time to get away and reflect on the prioritys of ones life.  The Retreat House is a most spacious accomodation with an interior decor that is top of the line as was stated to me by a Pastor who recently spent some quality time at our facility.  There are two cabins on the grounds named Trinity and Grace that reflect the same peaceful presence as the Retreat House and from all three buildings one can view the most beautiful lake that God ever created.  As you take time to meander through the many trails you will come across a most beautiful quaint Prayer Cabin where you can spend some quality time with the One living God who created you and spend time in prayer and Thanksgiving for all the many blessings He sends your way.  I highly recommend this Home away from home experience to refresh and renew ones quality of life.

I am a parish priest of a small rural church, leading a congregation on my own for the first time.  Having completed just over a year in this position, I was feeling exhausted, anxious about the future of my church and my ministry, and desperately in need of spiritual retreat.  I found the Retreat Campus on Google when both of the other places I was considering were full the week I wanted to retreat.  I know now it was God's hand guiding me to this remarkable place.  What struck me the most about the Retreat Campus was the fact that I could actually feel the love of the staff in every small detail of their ministry there.  Every interaction I had with them was kind and supportive.  They truly wanted me to have a peaceful and healing time with God away from the world, and in part because of their hard work, I was able to experience an intimacy with God that I have never felt before in my life.  The surroundings they created and the love with which they permeate the housing and grounds truly shines through.  I felt cared for and loved, which allowed me to let go into the experience God was creating for me.  My ministry and my life have been changed and improved by the experience I had at the Retreat Center.

I am a newcomer to Indiana from Northern California and a writer, speaker and spiritual director. The Retreat Campus reached out to me to offer a sabbatical time away. At the time I didn't know that part of their mission is to support those who serve in ministry. I had been doing my ministry for years and was guilty of NOT taking good enough care of myself. I was also tired from the move and the activity of getting my family settled and happy in our new Indiana home.  What a gift my day at The Retreat Campus was. I am looking for ways to collaborate and lend my own work and experience to this wonderful place and wonderful people who run it.  I will be back both to serve, and to rest in the Lord!

Americans For African Adoptions Inc	169985	1	/users/profile/225267	ts317	Client Served	4	09/16/2013	I was drawn to AFAA because of the way in which it started. For one woman to see a need and work on solving it--That was pure brilliance in my opinion. I adopted my son from Ethiopia in 2005.  The process was long and difficult and ever changing and frustrating, especially since I knew of him in 2003. But...My son was well cared for and loved during the time he was in AFAA's orphanage.  He ate, learned skills, and had lots of playmates.  The workers who cared for him daily, lived with him and created a loving environment for him.  I believe that made all the difference in who he is today and aided strongly in his successful transition to America and blending into our family.  While the adoption process itself was ever changing, bureaucratic, and maybe even not that forthright, the thing that make it tolerable, was that my son was safe, loved, and cared for. He bonded with the workers and had a family while there.  The wonderful care he received helped build a foundation for him be a loving, attached, empathetic person. Not to mention the fact that he has always been able to fit in with a wide variety of children age wise and he has excellent immunity!  My son's paperwork allegedly went to the court system 3 times, only to be "missing" something each time.  Is that because the judge changed what they wanted, the AFAA social worker didn't have her act together, or for some other reason? No one will ever know. What I do know is I have my son and I couldn't be happier with that outcome!  Thank you AFAA for bringing my boy home! 
Americans For African Adoptions Inc	51077	1	/users/profile/51660	brenda14	Client Served	5	08/26/2010	I adopted my son from Ethiopia through AFAA starting in 2004-1/06.  I had no clue what I was doing and at the time people were like?? Ethiopia?  wheres that.  The website had all the forms I needed and at the time there were just three agencies operating in Ethiopia.  I have to say I initially went with AFAA due to Cheryls personal story and the lowest fees:)  I had an extremely  smooth process and Cheryl even went out of her way to assist me in country when I had been ripped off by the taxi driver.  Over the years I have seen situations arise in different countries that resulted in snags in the process and I have seen the fallout it creates with people who although paying super low price meaning less staff meaning less time to contact you.  A lot of the time people complain about lack of communication. If you want your hand held then go with an agency that charges 3x the price and has 3x the staff.  I would absolutely go with AFAA again if I was to adopt.  I believe they are the only agency that does just African adoptions
Americans For African Adoptions Inc	50549	9	/users/profile/51057	angela17	Client Served	1	08/16/2010	My husband and I started working with AFAA in 2007.  We started in the Lesotho program and were very excited.  We had heard that AFAA tended to be slow, but that was the only negative feedback we had heard.  About four months into the process, Cheryl contacted us and told us that there was a hold on the Lesotho adoptions and we would be better off switching to Ethiopia. We agreed to switch.  Several months later she contacted us regarding a girl available for adoption in Uganda.  We jumped at the opportunity to adopt her. The months of waiting started.  We heard over and over again that our court date was coming soon and that our lawyer and country rep were working on the paperwork.  In the mean time we added a second Ugandan girl.  During this period we received a letter from a women in Uganda claiming to be our child's birth mother. We had been told by Cheryl that both of her parents had passed. We asked Cheryl to look into it and she assured us that it was a scam and the women was just looking for money.  A year and a half after the referral and following many empty promises we finally received a court date.  We traveled to Uganda and received guardianship.  I spent 6 weeks living with both girls while we struggled to get the paperwork done.  We had to complete most of the tasks in country on our own, with advice from another family that was going through the process.  AFAA did not inform us of what we needed for the embassy.The embassy stated at our interview that they suspected fraud in our case (and other AFAA cases), and they were escalating the AFAA cases to USCIS.  We traveled home and waited months for an answer from USCIS.  Two months later we received a "Notice of Intent to Deny" the case from USCIS, based upon their determination that AFAA knowingly committed fraud in obtaining death certificates for birth parents who were not related to the children involved in our case and the other AFAA cases.We then did our own investigation into the girls' backgrounds.  We found out that both girls had fraudulent birth certificates.  The women who had wrote the letter was in fact one of our girl's birth mother.  The other girl had living parents.  We were forced to give up the adoption of one of the girls and start the adoption for the other all over again at our own expense.  We are now three years into the process and still have brought no children home.I hope my experience helps others in making their decision.  It is hard to put your trust in another and I recommend looking long and hard at the processes that the agency you choose has in place.  Make sure they have a strong set of checks and balances in place and have completed many successful adoptions from your chosen country.
Americans For African Adoptions Inc	50444	8	/users/profile/51000	amy36	Client Served	5	08/16/2010	Dear Group, My name is Amy and I am adopting a little girl from Lesotho who I will be picking up in one month.  The road has been long and winding... In 2007 I completed all my paperwork and it was submitted to Ethiopia through AFAA.   Cheryl closed the AFAA/Ethiopian program.  She then suggested I switch to Uganda.  I was unsure because I didn't know anything about Uganda or its people.  In February 2009, I decided to travel there to meet three girls of whom I had received referrals and to see the country, see how I liked it and see how I felt with the people. Cheryl helped with some of my arrangements.  I was supposed to stay at the AFAA foster home and was going to paint the alphabet and numbers on the floor of the foster home for the children and things of that nature. Cheryl had arranged for Joseph to pick me up at the airport and he did.  He was pleasant and we hit it off right away.  His wife Harriet and his daughter had been at a wedding and we immediately went to pick them up somewhere on the side of the road where they were waiting for him dressed in magnificently detailed and colorful clothes. Joseph told me I could not stay at the foster home as Cheryl told me I could because the "caretakers of the children" would be uncomfortable having a foreigner stay there.   Well, I don't know their culture so what could I say?  He, along with Harriet and his daughter, took me to an acceptable place where I paid to stay and spent the week.   Each day, Joseph picked me up and we went various places together.  We always had interesting things to talk about and I felt we had a connection and I believed it was mutual. With Joseph, I met with all three girls of whom I had been sent pictures of by AFAA; who Joseph had referred to Cheryl, as referrals. One of the girls was a 4 year old whose mother worked at the rock quarry.  The description I received of the mother was that she was ill.  (I believe the descriptions that Cheryl received where given to her by Joseph)  I met the mother at a meeting of the rock quarry woman and I can only tell you Id be happy to be as robust as her!  The story I got when I was there was that her husband, a Muslim, had died, and as she had always had difficulties with his family, a matter of different religious views, they were not giving her any help for herself or her children since her husband died.  She was poor, yes, but she was healthy and had beautiful, happy children. I met the two other girls at Pastor Gerald's school.  The one girl who I was most interested in turned out to be more then twice the age I was given through the information that I received from Cheryl, through Joseph.  The other girl was almost twice the age as I was given through the information, again from Cheryl, through Joseph. The Pastor, Joseph and I went to the house of the first little girl.  We met her aunt and one of her brothers.  Of course I was at a disadvantage because I do not speak Lugandan and therefore could not understand the conversation.  However, the girl was not without siblings as I was told by AFAA (see above note).  She in fact has two brothers - one older and one younger.   She was an orphan and she was definitely in need of help.  I am no doctor but she needed psychological help.  I think she was withdrawn because of shock.  She  had two large burns on her stomach which given to her by a "witch doctor".  She was treated for stomach trouble by having a hot metal iron placed on her stomach where she had pain.  She was then given herbs to heal her condition.  I saw the burn marks on her stomach and I think that experience alone would be enough to send someone into shock  After our visit with the first girl, Joseph, the Pastor and I went to see the other girl.  This girl's uncle was a bad man.  I can only tell you I got a very bad feeling from him and I trust my gut.  The girl was treated like a slave in her own "home". Her parents had died and her brother was sent to live with a relative in the country and she was sent to live with this uncle in the city of Kampala. The uncle wanted money for her.  Joseph told me he was asking for it while I was there.  Joseph said it was crazy and said he explained to him that isn't how it worked.  I felt very bad for this little girl. It turned out that she was severely dehydrated and Cheryl sent her to the hospital where she received IV treatment for dehydration as well as treatment for malaria before she entered the AFAA foster home.  Although I had a feeling for her, I wanted to adopt a younger child. I was just as surprised as everyone when "all hell broke loose" last year with the Uganda program.  I was not affected the way others were affected.  I had not accepted a referral from Uganda nor was I paying foster fees.  However, I did fly there to meet three children who turned out to be different from their profiles (see above note) I, along with Joseph, took all the children, about 12, from the AFAA foster home on a day trip to the source of the Nile and some nearby waterfalls.  We all had a wonderful time.   Lots of food, new sites and experiences - it was beautiful.  I was very happy to be able to do this for and with the children.  Grace, one of the caretakers at the AFAA foster home accompanied us.   I visited Josephs home, ate dinner at his kitchen table with all the orphans that were living there.  I went with him several days to both pick up his own son at school as well as his wife Harriet at her job.  We had dinner together at a lovely place one evening, my way of saying thanks for all his time.  All, I can say now is, I will never know exactly what happened over there. I don't know Joseph well, and despite the fact that I had a good feeling for him and spent time with him - who knows?   I can tell you I don't think anyone of us is all good or all bad!   After this, Cheryl suggested I move to Lesotho and said she really thought I could get a referral there.  I switched to Lesotho, I did get a referral and I am leaving within a month to pick up my daughter. I can also tell you that I run a non profit in the Peruvian Amazon and it is very difficult to work in these types of places (poor, developing countries)  It is difficult to find responsible people; to find people that really get what you are doing and will follow your instructions; to find people who will not take advantage of the situation...   I am not here to lay blame, but just to say,  if your goal is to adopt a child, Lesotho has many orphans and it seems that the government is serious and diligent at making sure that the children up for adoption are truly orphans.   Feel free to contact me if you wish. And I'm sorry to all the people who have suffered because what's happened in Uganda.     Sincerely, Amy
Americans For African Adoptions Inc	50324	1	/users/profile/50914	sm4	Client Served	2	08/13/2010	I have to give the agency a little bit of credit due to the fact that we have one child successfully adopted out of Ethiopia. However, the entire process was horrible and mostly because of a complete lack of communication and total disorganization. I realize that adopting from Africa can be difficult but I am know dozens of families that also adopted from Africa and NONE of them experienced the issues that Cheryl always said were "normal". I could write page after page about the problems we had getting information out of her and the ever changing information that came our way (if it ever did). Had we not already started the process of adopting two more, we would have stopped as soon as we had our first child home.Then, enter the Uganda program and it made the first nightmare pale in comparison. We were directly lied to several times and not by the country rep, but by Cheryl. Not only that, we regularly heard about what was happening from other families, not from the agency. They never bothered to send e-mails or make phone calls. More than once we sat and waited for a court date then sat by the phone waiting for information on how our court date went, only to find out from other parents that the court date never happened and Cheryl knew it wouldn't be happening but didn't bother to share the information. She may in fact love the children but she certainly doesn't love the families they are going to and she shows no respect for their feelings.Trust me, I understand the desire to adopt a child. We felt it. I know how much you want to give someone the benefit of the doubt and take the chance that your circumstances may be more like the positive reviews here than the negative ones. But, with so many other options out there, why would you take the risk? Trust me, if you end up being one of the negative experiences, your heart and your finances may never recover. I've talked to many families who had horrible experiences with the Ethiopia program as well, so don't let people tell you that it's only the Uganda program. I kept constant contact with many families through the process and most experienced the same things that my family did.Save yourself the heartache and use another agency. It isn't worth the risk. If you're considering AFAA because it's less expensive than other agencies - remember, you get what you pay for . . . if you end up getting anything at all. The risk is too great!! Move on and find a reputable company that will care about your ENTIRE family.
Americans For African Adoptions Inc	50295	8	/users/profile/50872	lgmbk	Client Served	4	08/12/2010	I adopted two children from Ethiopia through AFAA in 2006 and decided to do it again a few years later.  I wanted to adopt from Ethiopia, but that program closed due to the high demand for adoption there and because AFAA is such a small agency, it was not able to meet the demands of the government to provide humanitarian work.  I changed countries to Uganda and received a referral there.  I knew it was a new program and understood that there may be unforseen challenges and risks because of this.  Ultimately, it was discovered that the Ugandan representative was taking money and misrepresenting himself and many of the children that were referred.  I was saddened and discouraged to the point that I considered not continuing my adoption plan.  Cheryl and AFAA offered me another alternative.  They did not charge me any extra fees to change to Lesotho and in a few weeks, I will be traveling to pick up my beautiful son.  Adoption is hard and it's expensive, but I don't believe that I could have adopted these 3 kids if it weren't for AFAA.  Cheryl didn't ask for any money from me until it was absolutely necessary- when I received and accepted the referral of my son.  Cheryl operates out of her modest home- I have visited several times and her life is dedicated to African adoptions.  My goal was to be a mom again and I get to do that.  For this, I am extremely grateful.
Americans For African Adoptions Inc	50204	8	/users/profile/50746	ss-in-pa	Client Served	4	08/10/2010	I was one of hte families that had an adoption fail in Uganda.  I was devastated.  However, it was not AFAA fault, Cheryl's fault, nor coudl the agency or Cheryl have seen or prevented the situation in Uganda. It is a sad truth that there are corrupt people who do terrible things - in this case a corrupt man in Uganda and a few American families created this heartbreak, not AFAA or Cheryl.  Cheryl and AFAA regularly told all of us families what was going on in Africa.  It was made VERY clear from the beginning that like all international adoptions there were things beyond the control of the agency or Cheryl.  MANY failed international adoptions through other agencies never offer a transfer in country either nad families have to start over. Tireless, thankless and dedicated to the children - that is my description of Cheryl and AFAA. Please do NOT read some of the negative criticisms from some families and take them as fact - to be honest some of them caused some of this heartbreak and made it clear they were not "in this" for the children.  AFAA is 100% committed to the children of Africa and has been for decades.
Americans For African Adoptions Inc	50036	5	/users/profile/50703	anne23	Client Served	5	08/10/2010	Ok people, I am really getting tired of all the negative internet reviews for Cheryl Carter-Schotts and the organization she heads called Americans for African Adoption.  I have known Cheryl for 25 years.  SHE IS THE MOST HONEST, TIRELESS, CARING, DILIGENT PERSON I KNOW WORKING TO SAVE ORPHANS THRU ADOPTIONS IN AFRICA.  SHE IS ALSO TOUGH, VERY TOUGH AND HAS TO BE BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY AS TIME HAS GONE ON WITH AFRICAN ADOPTION, DISHONEST PARTIES (ADULTS) HAVE FIGURED OUT HOW TO SCAM PEOPLE FOR THERE OWN SELF INTEREST..  I am a Veterinarian.  I adopted two sons from Ethiopia, a 15 month old boy and an 8 year old boy.  This is before the adoption program ended in Ethiopia after Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt paid millions for their daughter Zahara and the government and other adults their realized they could make millions selling Ethiopian Children.  Cheryl ended the program because of this dishonesty and selfishness.  I also have a Daughter from Sierra Leone who would be dead if it weren't for Cheryl and her tireless efforts to save her and 18 other children caught up in the horrible civil war that occurred there. (watch the blood diamonds movie).  we paid to care for our daughter in a foster home there for 20 months when the government was overthrown in a violent coupe.  The children and their caretaker had to leave the foster home and go to the grounds of a hotel to flee the rebels that were hacking people up with machetes.  All the paperwork was destroyed and the government officials had gone into exile.  Our state department was trying to block getting the kids out.  Cheryl found a way (President Clinton helped) and had the children evacuated by navy marine helicopters onto an aircraft carrier and placed in a foster home in Guinea until Cheryl could get humanitarian parole visas for the kids.  This took months and we had to be patient but we got our daughter and she is attending Wright State University majoring in Nursing.  THOSE CHILDREN WOULD BE DEAD IF IT WAS ANY OTHER AGENCY.THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS:  IN GENERAL, CHILDREN ARE CONSIDERED A COMMODITY IN AFRICA BY THEIR OWN PEOPLE AND CROOKS LOOK FOR ANY WAY TO MAKE MONEY OFF RICH AMERICANS.  THE UGANDA ADOPTION PROGRAM (AND CHERYL) WERE VICTIMIZED IN THIS WAY.  SO STOP WHINING,  IT IS THE CHILDREN WHO ARE REALLY SUFFERING, NOT LAZY FAT RICH AMERICANS.
Americans For African Adoptions Inc	49639	6	/users/profile/50700	jsj	Client Served	5	08/10/2010	We have 2 beautiful children adopted through Americans for African Adoptions - both from Ethiopia and adopted at separate times.  This means that we were greatly satisfied with our first experience with AFAA and went back for a second adoption that went just as smoothly.  The director, Cheryl Carter-Shotts, is an amazing woman who works incredibily hard to bring these children home and pays herself a pitance to do it.  Unfortunately, there are many people who have no idea what it is like to do business of any kind in a third world country, much less something as complicated as an adoption.  These people want things to move along at a set pace and schedule like in America, and they just don't.  AFAA has some of the most reasonable prices, which many find attractive. No agency of the size of AFAA can predict or prevent the hurdles that come with working in Africa where people are out to make a quick buck (and do so gladly at the expesne of innocent children and waiting families), where the rules change constantly, where the officials in charge change often, where courts close for months at a time, where the electricity is unpredictable and cultural norms are so vastly different than ours.  Cheryl has spent nearly 30 years fighting these issues and bringing home children to waiting families.  She works tirelessly to this end.

I spent 5 weeks in Uganda with a child that was referred to us from AFAA and wasnt able to bring him home.  Come to find out the child wasnt even an orphan!  Save your family a bunch of heartache and find someone with some ethics to conduct your adoption.  Cheryl has yet to even tell us she was sorry!!
Americans For African Adoptions Inc	49448	10	/users/profile/50663	jwh	Client Served	1	08/09/2010	Our family initiated the process to adopt a child through AFAA in August, 2007.  At that time, we entered AFAA's Ethiopian program. We were provided a time frame of 18-24 months for completion of the adoption.The Executive Director of AFAA subsequently contacted our family at the beginning of 2008 and encouraged us to enter AFAA's Uganda program.  At that time, she provided a time frame of 9-12 months to complete the adoption.As we continued to make monthly payments to AFAA without any evidence of progress, we began to question whether the alleged activities were truly occurring.  We were reassured on multiple occasions by the Executive Director that our case was progressing in Uganda.In the spring of 2010, we began to ask more frequent questions about the obvious lack of progress in our case.  We were again reassured that all was well in Uganda and urged to keep sending money.  We began to press harder with our questions.  The Executive Director then informed us that the Ugandan lawyer had quit because we were asking questions.In the summer of 2010, members of fellow adoptive families traveled to Uganda to investigate the situation.  None of the required work regarding our cases had been completed.  The lawyer stated that he had not been paid per his agreement with AFAA.  At our insistence, payment was finally made, and court dates were granted for our case.We traveled to Uganda in September 2009 to find the situation in utter chaos.  Our case was held at the US Embassy pending investigation.  This USCIS investigation lasted approximately six months.  Following the investigation, USCIS denied our prospective adoptive son's visa based on AFAA "knowingly and admittedly" committing fraud in preparing the paperwork for our child.  The boy that had been referred to us was not an orphan.  AFAA and/or its representatives had prepared false documentation to make it appear as though this child's biological parents were deceased.To our knowledge, judgment has been granted to two similarly situated families in South Dakota and Michigan in suits against AFAA alleging fraud and breach of contract.  Our family will be filing suit in the near future, as AFAA's actions have led us to expend approximately $40,000 in pursuit of a fraudulent international adoption.

She advocates for the older children, disabled children. She is a humanitarian who has sponsored children, helped with school fees, college tuition, medical needs. She works long and tireless hours for very little compensation. In fact, she keeps her fees so low so that many who might not otherwise be able to adopt, can afford to. She loves each one of these children and she treats each child as if that child is the most special child in the world to her. Cheryl is a loving, caring and honest person to work with, and I am proud to say I have known her and to have seen the work that she does.

We did our research and found Americans for African Adoptions. I'm so glad we did. AFAA really cares for the orphans and deprived of the countries they work in, and find families for children, not children for families. That is an important distinction for adoption agencies, and the dedication and from-the-heart caring AFAA provides is greatly appreciated.

Yes we have all donated our "stuff" that just sits around the house, and yes we have actually purchased some other people's "stuff" in the Goodwill store.  Until 12 years ago what I did not know was how valuable that "stuff" was... yes, your "stuff" brings in thousands of dollars that are in turn used to help those individuals in our community with disadvantages.  Every dollar makes a difference.  I would encourage you to not only look at the Goodwill store, but to inquire about the services that are provided everyday to children and adults with disadvantages.

In March I was in a production playing an 80 year old woman and found the perfect dress, shoes and hat for the character.My son told me I gave so many things to Goodwill that I might as well just take the bags from the department store directly to Goodwill because they'd end up there eventually anyway.This Christmas I found the perfect gift for my 14 year old granddaughter at my Goodwill store in Jeffersonville, IN.  I saw a silver jewelry box that was all tarnished and black.  Inside was perfect, like new.  In addition, there was a music box inside which worked perfectly.  It was $2.00.  I took it home and polished it with silver polish and it was absolutely beautiful with a soft lusterous patina.  She loved it.Two years ago I found a pale yellow London Fog Raincoat that looked new.

The quality of child care they provide and educational opportunities they give to children, young adults and adults in our community often times goes unnoticed.  They are not drawn to the limelight, but I believe a little more light needs to shine on this awesome organization.  The people I work with and come into contact with at Goodwill Bridgepointe are top notch, including everyone from the recepionist or child care worker to the CEO, Candy Barksdale.  They are always on the look out to help in any way by providing the best solution and services for the organization and the community.

They seem to be ever evolving to meet the needs of the community by giving a facelift to their stores, making tough internal decisions and being the ultimate "Green" company.  They continual lead the way through change and development to achieve their mission of empowering people with the skills, knowledge and opportunity to improve their quality of life.  Being associated with Goodwill Bridgepointe has definitely been and enriching experience.

Only last Apr/May did I spend 10 days there at the mission. The presence of Christ can be felt as one sees the people line up, even the night before, clinic opens, to get help. The 65 or more children in the Rescue center are loved and helped in many ways. Some need care for other reasons, but most have great malnutrition helped by the Medika Mamba(protein formula). Some of the earthquake victims were still being cared for in Lori's new/unoccupied home.

She has a passion for each child in the Rescue Center.  She is genuine and truly cares. She has put her personal needs completely on the back burner to help someone in need.  It may be holding the hand of a grandmother as she learns her grandchild may not survive, explaining to a mother of a nine month old who is expecting another child the importance of continuing breast feeding during her pregnancy, or even the way she cares for a child after he/she has lost its fight.  Lori is filled with knowledge, yet she is so open to those around her to learn yet more.  Lori manages the clinic.  She treats people both medically and spiritually. She has formed a community group to aid the people of Cazale in bettering themselves and their community.

I have been volunteering to help their organization for about 3 years now and we will continue to support them and everything they do in the future. They work tirelessly to help children and families in the mountains of Haiti and they are very resourceful. They not only do everything they can to help people in Cazale, but they genuinely love the people they care for.

Real Hope For Haiti	59564		/users/profile/64396	Nicole H.	Volunteer	5	01/06/2011	     Real Hope for Haiti is an awesome organization. They are doing so much for their community of Cazale and the surrounding communities that travel days on foot over mountains to reach them. Licia, Lori and Zach have such a passion for what the do and the people that they are serving. I was down there as a volunteer just after Thanksgiving in 2010. There are many different componets to the work that they do at RHFH. Licia is in charge of the rescue center for children suffering from kwash (malnurishment) and oversee the daily care of 60 children and staff. She does an amazing job, and even though she has to run the business side of it you frequently find her in the middle of it interacting with the children and caring for them, she has a knack to get even the sickest of kids to give her a smile that just warms your heart. Lori is the "rambo" nurse that runs the clinic. Clinic is open 3 days a week and see anywhere from 200 to 300 pts per day!!! Its truely amazing at the set they have. There they do prenatal care, well baby check ups, OB/ Gyne clinc, sutures, wound care, pap smears, HIV testing, Syphilis testing, Chlamyda testing, and Gonnerhea testing, they snip tounge tied kids, and there so much more!! But even as impressed as I was about the medical care these community members receive was the way its received, with compassion.  Theres also community education like sewing clasees, literacy classes, and after school tudoring.  Every time you open your eyes something is happening around there.   In Lori's spare time ( really that was sarcastic cuz shes on the go from 5am till 10 pm everyday) she opened a cholera house to treat the epidemic in that area.  That also is an amazing set up. There are 20 something beds, which at times are full, and for pts that are stable with oral rehydration theres the porch of the house, which seems overflowing with another 10 or so pts every day.  She has Haitian staff members to help care for the pts and American and Canadian volunteers that come into help, but its truely her baby project.  I worked mainly at the cholera house while I was there, and even if she was able to escape down to the clinic for the day to get some work done, she always came up at change of shifts to make sure everything was running smoothly, and was alway a cell phone call away if we needed her or her great knowledge and advice.  Then theres Zach, ZAchary Davis..... Lori and Licias dad. I loved spending time with him, and he always had great stories to tell. As he would say his role is to make sure his daughters are happy and have everything they need. My favorite quote from his was " I used to say happy wife happy life, but since my wife is now gone its happy daughters, happy life!" And yes he takes his job seriously.  For example Lori needed more soap to hand out at the cholera house.  So she put her dad on finding it. Later that day he came back with soap. There was 36 bars in one box.....not bad, but that wasnt the end of it there was 36 boxes as well!!! Zach believes in buying big and that he def. does well.    I have volunteered at many places in Haiti, but no where have I felt so at home.  RHFH treats thier volunteers as family and that meant alot to me.  When the go to the grocery store they ask u if you want anything special.... When people go to Haiti as missionary's the have the desire to serve others, sometimes while in big organizations this desire can fade over the yrs and turn into almost a business type environmont.  This is so so so far from what RHFH is about, they came down with a passion to serve christ and 15 yrs+ later that passion is still as strong as the day when they arrived!!! I love you RHFH and keep doin what you are doing.
Real Hope For Haiti	36103	1	/users/profile/36896	elosangel	Volunteer	5	04/18/2010	I was amazed at the work that is done by the missionaries and staff at RHFH.  They work in very harsh conditions to heal the sick, injured, and comfort the dying.  I was pleased to visit the literacy class where the Haitian staff have the opportunity to learn to read.  I enjoyed visiting the seedling area where trees are 'born'.  I loved on little babies - and left with a huge burden in my heart to return.
Real Hope For Haiti	19634	1	/users/profile/20836	jeanie	General Member of the Public	5	10/25/2009	My husband and I just returned from Haiti,and were amazed and humbled by the work of this organization. Located in an extremely poor, rural area, the workers at this clinic labor long hours to serve the community with basic health care and clean water. We can't say enough about the character and integrity that we witnessed, and it was clear that these folks are loved by those that they serve. In a country known for corruption and questionable motives, Real Hope for Haiti is a bright light.
Center of Wellness for Urban Women Inc	112389		/users/profile/152955	Januarie Y.,	General Member of the Public	5	05/18/2012	CWUW is a wonderful and positive organization for the community.  The ladies are intent on healing and helping to grow the Urban Woman via physical & mental health, which is very important in this day and age.  From community walks to gardening to Life Jam, CWUW deserves to be recognized, celebrated and supported!!!! Their mission is LIFE, and there couldn't possibly be a better mission to have!
Center of Wellness for Urban Women Inc	133056		/users/profile/178755	Joseph W.	Donor	4	11/03/2012	CWUW is an organization primarily geared towards the health, wellness & well-being of women, but as a man, I can say that their reach is definitely beyond that target market. We all can agree that the health of a community's women spills over into the family and friends that she loves. The CWUW programs that I have attended and participated in are wonderful examples of that positive overflow. Community clothing swaps, concerts, workshops and gardening events not only build the communities that CWUW serves, but also plants a seed in attendees to also find THEIR place in this world to also make a difference.

Volunteer	5	05/25/2012	CWUW IS A GREAT NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION AND IT IS A BLESSING THAT I WAS ABLE TO VOLUNTEER ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS FOR THIS GREAT ORGANIZATION.  A GREAT GROUP OF PEOPLE MAKE CWUW A SUCCESS AND RHONDA BAYLESS IS A GODSEND.  HER DEDICATION IS ONE TO LEARN FROM.  CWUW DOES ANNUAL CLOTHING DRIVES, THEY HAVE BUILT A BEAUTIFUL COMMUNITY GARDEN, PROMOTE HEALTHY LIVING, RUN IN SCHOOL PROGRAMS AT IPS SCHOOLS, AND MUCH, MUCH MORE.  EVERYONE LOOK CWUW UP AND SEE WHAT THEY HAVE TO OFFER!!
Center of Wellness for Urban Women Inc	42379	9	/users/profile/43097	akilah	Volunteer	5	06/01/2010	CWUW is an amazing organization, that is badly needed in our community.  Helping women with their total health by embracing the 7 Dimensions of Wellness is a wonderful way of reaching, teaching and impacting. In the short time CWUW has been in existence, countless women have already been touched by the organization. This organization will continue to grow, and I forsee it becoming a critical component of the health community here in Indianapolis.
Center of Wellness for Urban Women Inc	41674	11	/users/profile/42469	sydsyd	Volunteer	4	05/28/2010	I worked the LifeFit Health Kids Expo at the CWUW booth.  It was a great experience teaching children about health and wellness. CWUW had each child complete a "health pledge" before receiving a gift from the table. They also had to give an example of how they will make the world a better place. CWUW's director even got up and did Zumba with the kids. Its a great organization!
Center of Wellness for Urban Women Inc	41591	10	/users/profile/42400	shidabee	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/28/2010	I work in the HIV/AIDS prevention field focusing on women. I think that it is important for all women to access the programs that are provided by CWUW so that they can not only lower their risk for HIV/AIDS but also take care of their overall health. It has been my experience that better health will cause a better life and that is exactly what I want for myself and my clients. As far as I am concerned, CWUW is the best place to get the tools to lead us to that better life.
Center of Wellness for Urban Women Inc	41238	9	/users/profile/42099	bhella	General Member of the Public	5	05/27/2010	Center of Wellness for Urban Women, Inc is headed by one of the most positive, persistent and dedicated unsung heroes of our nation. Consistently, Rhonda Bayless wakes up early in the morning, so early that the birds have not begun chirping and the sun has yet to peek through the black night's sky. Peacefully, she begins with a positive update that I'm sure she typed with a smile on her face. Mid-day, she finds time to share bits of her heart through music and uplifting poetry, powering through evenings when she could be napping, until nightfall, she will work until her work is complete. (We all know that "A woman's work is never done," but we don't all know that this wonderful woman will put in more than her fair share, with a smile.) Her peace, her positivity, her love brightens my life. I imagine that those receiving services from CWUW receive the same loving inspiration that I do, and I am halfway across the country. :) I am so elated to know that an organization exists that is dedicated to the education and development of women. CWUW, Inc is an organization that is run by phenomenal women, so that more women will grow to find the phenomenal women in themselves. :) 
Center of Wellness for Urban Women Inc	39548	9	/users/profile/40502	ginnie	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/19/2010	As a mental health professional and Indiana native I appreciate and support the outreach of Center of Wellness For Urban Women provides for its community through a complete holistic wellness prospective. Through their commitment to providing education, awareness, resources and unity to women and their families this organization supplies a service needed desperately in all communities. I give this organization 5 stars and encourage any considering donating, volunteering or participating in a Center of Wellness For Urban Women event the utmost encouragement to do so. This organization represents true service to the people in action.
Center of Wellness for Urban Women Inc	39073	6	/users/profile/40007	mcbeth	Client Served	5	05/15/2010	C-W-U-W!!!! So many great things to say about this organization. I met Rhonda Bayless through a friend of a friend on the major social network Facebook. She had started a walking program with her organization & I was trying to achieve some personal goals so I said why not. So on Saturday mornings I got up, got my mama and we went walking and it made me feel great. I was exercising, meeting new people and engaging in "adult" mannered conversations ad it was wonderful. The walking was the start and I have almost accomplished my full goal. Since then I have done P90x and working on Insanity. They have great events and really are trying to help everyone not just women achieve their goals. I hope to one day join CWUW because they are a group of interesting goal determined people and I find it a blessing to have encountered this well rounded organization. If your ever looking to donate to a well deserved organization this is definitely it.
Center of Wellness for Urban Women Inc	39072	6	/users/profile/40006	dan9	Donor	5	05/15/2010	Nonprofits struggle for dollars these days, and I feel confidant giving mine to CWUW. Ms. Bayless is in tune with the needs of the communities she serves and is continually finding ways to better serve, inform, educate and reach those communities. Honest, holistic and empowering: all apt descriptors of CWUW.

Center of Wellness for Urban Women Inc	38710	3	/users/profile/39606	larona	Volunteer	3	05/12/2010	CWUW since its inception has been on the move to create relationships and alliances with community organizations that have the same passion for empowering women and their families to be proactive about their health. From clothing drives, to health fairs, workshops and "sister walks", we embrace health and all that it has to offer. I have learned what a great resource we can be to people in need, that collaboration is necessary for change, and that our labor is NOT IN VAIN! We will keep pressing to make our mark in the community and in the lives of those in need.
Center of Wellness for Urban Women Inc	38655	3	/users/profile/39544	ink29boy	Volunteer	5	05/12/2010	When I first starting walking in the Sisters Together Program, I thought I would have a hard time getting up on Saturday mornings to walk for an hour.  Who wants to get up early on a Saturday after having had to get up early during the week for work.  So, I got up anyway and started walking.  I enjoy talking, sharing and connecting with women while I walk.  I enjoy walking with this group of women.  This is a good program.  Sometimes its hard to do things like exercise by yourself, but with these other woman, I have been trying to make life long changes to my physical and emotional health.
Center of Wellness for Urban Women Inc	37944	4	/users/profile/38724	lisa18	Volunteer	5	05/04/2010	Fabulous experience all around.  It was a wonderful opportunity to serve (and be served) but more important to be around like-minded positive women is a joy.
Healing, Health, & Hope Inc	260373		/users/profile/348957	sragaishis	General Member of the Public	5	09/30/2015	I've had the opportunity to follow this group through Facebook.  Although I can't speak directly for the patients that are helped, I can say that everything seems to be done at a grass-roots and yet highly professional level.  They have taken an issue that was once difficult for me to connect with and made it personal through stories and photos.  It helps that I know one of the volunteers, but that is what grass-roots is all about - connecting with your immediate circle.  I'm happy to help expand that information circle by rating this fantastic organization with many, many stars.
Healing, Health, & Hope Inc	218658		/users/profile/282236	kawright77	General Member of the Public	5	09/30/2014	I know from personal experience the great work that Dr. Retson does. All of the people involved are the best people I know. To selflessly give up precious time to help those misfortunate is truly admirable. The pictures they come back with from their trips are eye opening. 
Healing, Health, & Hope Inc	218585		/users/profile/282163	Laura211	Volunteer	5	09/30/2014	People doing the right thing for the right reason.  This organization is 100% overhead-free, so all of the donations go directly to getting the team to the countries with all the equipment, medications, and supplies that they need for the week.  The number of children and adults whose lives are changed forever and for the better is astounding with each trip, and the team has been on 40 trips now.  The world would be a better place if there were more organizations like this one around.
Healing, Health, & Hope Inc	218558		/users/profile/282136	Diana71	General Member of the Public	5	09/30/2014	I have known the Healing, Health, and Hope team for many years and you cannot find a more compassionate, caring team than they are. What they accomplish in one week in a country with not the best of conditions is amazing. Their Hearts are definitely there to provide Hope for the Health of all the children, and adults, that they provide surgical care to.  They are the best!
Healing, Health, & Hope Inc	218528		/users/profile/282104	Desi_M	Donor	5	09/30/2014	I have gotten to know this organization this year and have been impressed with their vision and work.  My family and I are involved with other charities as well, and we are happy to support Healing, Health & Hope and their endeavors.  What impressed me the most was how passionate everyone was about making a difference.  From the time the volunteers put in, the fundraisers they have to help their cause, to the smiling faces on the kids and families that they help, Healing Health & Hope is a worthwhile organization to donate to.
Healing, Health, & Hope Inc	194280		/users/profile/253839	SMEC	Donor	5	02/13/2014	Healing, Health, and Hope does just what its name suggests. All those involved with this charity are committed to helping better the quality of life for others.  Healing, Health, and Hope consistently demonstrates true passion and selfless dedication to their mission.    Over the past several months, my husband, daughter, and I have had the opportunity to meet one of the children HHH has been helping.  She is a beautiful, curious, energetic two year old little girl who radiates with pure happiness. HHH flew her thousands of miles from her home and family in order to provide her with the necessary medical treatments.  As a mother of an 18 month old daughter, I cannot imagine the anxiety and fear her parents must have felt when they sent her with HHH, let alone the fear and confusion this two year old girl must have experienced leaving her family.  However, seeing the lengths HHH has gone to provide her so much love and support  has touched my heart.  A significant bond of love and trust has formed between the volunteers of Healing, Health, and Hope and this little girl, and it is truly heart warming and inspiring.      My family looks forward to continuing to support Healing, Health, and Hope - however we can.   We will forever be grateful for the opportunity we had to meet one of their young patients, to provide her a fun day of play, and of course watching as our daughter made a new friend!  
Healing, Health, & Hope Inc	193695		/users/profile/252986	Maryam_W	Donor	5	02/02/2014	Healing, Health and Hope is a wonderful organization comprised by a group of caring, compassionate and selflessly giving individuals.  Their efforts touch the lives of many families today and for many years to come.  Their name barely scratches the surface of all of the amazing things that they do for others who are much less fortunate than we are.  I am proud to be a donor and plan to support them as often as I possibly can.
Healing, Health, & Hope Inc	193691		/users/profile/252982	Jon_20	Donor	5	02/02/2014	This charity makes a real difference in children's lives. When you donate, you know that your money is going to help kids that really need it.
Healing, Health, & Hope Inc	193680		/users/profile/252970	MaxSmart	Volunteer	5	02/02/2014	The 100% volunteer policy makes sure that you get the most bang-for-your-buck with this charity - nobody in the organization is getting paid for their services.  The children they help get to live perfectly normal lives, instead of living as outcasts because of their deformities, or growing up helpless because of their crippling injuries.  
Healing, Health, & Hope Inc	193678		/users/profile/252968	mbinz	Volunteer	5	02/02/2014	I love what HHH does and look forward to supporting them as they continue on their selfless mission
Healing, Health, & Hope Inc	193655		/users/profile/252934	jkskwright	Volunteer	5	02/01/2014	There is no I in this team. Everyone works hard on our trips. But it begins at home base, packing ,sorting checking lists twice. We have to take 98% of what we will  be needed for surgeries with us . There is no Wal Mart down the road .  Everyone works very well together. We all do whatever task is needed to be done a at the time. Our payment is a smile and a hug from a patient that can now speak or eat more normally. Some can now use a hand that they could not use before. All the stories we hear are unspeakable here in America. It makes you take a better look at what is important in your life. Material things mean so little . Believe us when we say they have next to nothing except each other. 
Healing, Health, & Hope Inc	193385		/users/profile/252570	AmiPrindiville	Donor	5	01/28/2014	This is by far one of the most impressive Non-Profits I have come across in a long time. Their selfless nature is beyond amazing. They give their time, their talents and all of themselves to help each of their patients to the best of their abilities for the best results that can be achieved. They give children and adults the ability to do things they would not be able to do without them, give them confidence they may not have had or lost and the sincere love these patients and their families need to trust them without question. The success stories they have can bring tears to your eyes. The few patients that come back to America with them are treated as their own, loved as their own and shielded from anything that may have a negative impact on them. They give up their own time to be available when necessary. I am absolutely amazed at how well this organization is run and wish so many more could use their standards as an example. They don't don't get much better than this.
Healing, Health, & Hope Inc	193290		/users/profile/252464	bazinga24	Donor	5	01/28/2014	I met one of the organizers from this organization, Michelle Retson, and she presented to me what their group does on a yearly basis to help those who do not have access to surgical care for ailments like severe burns and cleft palates. Their work is purely selfless and generous. They are unlikely to solicit praise from the work they do, and the head surgeon (Michelle's father) prefers to remain anonymous from praise altogether.  I was deeply impressed with the pure volunteerism this organization displays, and I believe they are an honorable organization.
Healing, Health, & Hope Inc	193277	1	/users/profile/252451	shell1026	Volunteer	5	01/28/2014	A wonderful team that works HARD! Everyone gives up their vacation time to go. No one gets paid by the organization for any of our work.  We have 10-15 hour days at the hospital every day, we are exhausted at the end of the week, but we have a BLAST helping these people.  The stories we hear each day from the patients are just unbelievable: of people traveling 30 hours just to see if we will give their child surgery, of a child doused in gasoline and set on fire because her father was angry,  of children being shunned from their communities and not allowed in school because they look different, of a mother burned so badly in a car accident she could not hold her newborn son - these are the people we go to help.  People who would not be able to afford it, or would not have access to it.  Every trip makes me so much more grateful for how lucky we are in the US to have the opportunities that we do. These trips are hard work, but every life we make easier makes it worth it. HHH works with Esperanca, another NPO based in Arizona. They have offices in the countries we visit, so their employees can organize the destination half of the trip while we get our supplies and game plan together before we arrive.  This works very efficiently and ensures we can use every hour of our time to help as many people as we can. 
Camptown, Inc.	125862	1	/users/profile/156866	Lynn O.	Client Served	5	10/16/2012	Camptown has provided outstanding outdoor educational experiences for my special needs high school students over the past seven years.  Each one has been a wonderful opportunity for my students.  These students mention their Camptown experiences as some of  their favorite high school memories.
Camptown, Inc.	115153		/users/profile/156866	Lynn O.	Client Served	5	06/14/2012	     Camptown has provided classroom and outdoor experiences for my special needs students for the past seven years.  It is impossible to comment here on all of the benefits my students have had from their programs.  A short example is a high school student who had never spent the night away from home before, and had never slept in a tent.  His confidence soared the next morning;he was so proud of himself.  Camptown teaches leadership, environmental stewardship, builds an increased confidence in individuals, and provides an opportunity for underprivileged youth to learn and enjoy each other in a new setting. 
Camptown, Inc.	117339		/users/profile/159561	Richard31	Donor	5	06/29/2012	I have served in several capacities with CampTown through the years. I was on the board for several years. I have volunteered and helped with orienteering. i have donated through a variety of channels. This organization has, from its inception, been one of the most impressive local efforts I have been aware of for helping young people who are in difficult circumstances find their way. It is a benefit to their families because their children learn to set and achieve their own goals. It is a benefit to schools and teachers because it helps students gain confidence in their own ability to achieve. It is a benefit to our communities as it produces young citizens who have a world view with a solid foundation on a spiritual level and with regard to character. I am always happy to recommend CampTown without reservation to participants, volunteers and donors. 
Camptown, Inc.	117288		/users/profile/159501	____668	Board Member	4	06/29/2012	I have always been passionate about helping youth from disadvantaged circumstances and look for organizations that do this well. Camptown does a great job at identifying issues that are relevant and creating programs that help make a difference for youth in their life today. now. actionable. the staff is amazingly dedicated to the cause. the organization is monetarily efficient- money goes to the programs that go to the kids! 
Camptown, Inc.	117277		/users/profile/159491	Mike Devlin	Board Member	5	06/29/2012	I am involved with a number of organizations both board roles and volunteer. Camptown, more than any other that I work with, does so much. From providing opportunities forunderprivaledged kids to go places they have never been before to teaching life skills and confidence.  Camptown has found ways to capitalize on relationships with other charities to prosper and grow and the dollars that are donated and invested here are better spent than any other I know.  I will continue to work and support Camptown because I feel that it is a tremendous organization.
Camptown, Inc.	117266		/users/profile/159480	M.Burt	Volunteer	5	06/29/2012	Camptown makes it very obvious that the needs of the kids is the top priority. From someone who once participated in events led by Camptown and now volunteers for them whenever possible, I have seen the impact that can be made in the lives of the kids. Experiences like backpacking and whitewater rafting are not only a fun activity that most kids do not get an opportunity to do, but also something that teaches fundamental skills such as teamwork and perseverance.
Camptown, Inc.	115674		/users/profile/157528	kentG	Board Member	5	06/19/2012	Every child in this world has special needs, and Camptown has a special way of connecting with and impacting the youth they serve. Taking kids away from their familiar environment and challenging them in the wilderness is awesome.  Camptown builds character and confdence in these kids to carry them through life and I have been around long enough to know it works.
Camptown, Inc.	114162		/users/profile/155346	scott d	Board Member	5	06/07/2012	Camptown is the best of the best.  They add huge benefits to the children within the programs of many well-known charities by supplying custom outdoor programming that teaches respect, confidence and many other important life skills.  They do it in the most efficient manner of any non-profit I have worked with.  I support Camptown with gratitude and great enthusiasm!!

My experience with Camptown has been extremely rewarding.  I have had the opportunity to introduce freinds, family, and co-workers to Camptown through fundraising events and volunteer events.  EVERYONE that i have introduced to Camptown has been impressed with the vision and mission of Camptown and the amount of children and their families are being effected in a positive way by this organization.
Camptown, Inc.	114112		/users/profile/155280	jeffrey.obarr	Donor	5	06/06/2012	Since my wife and I began donating to Camptown and volunteering almost two years ago, it has been very rewarding to see how our time and talents have been utilized.  Camptown reaches an extraordinary number of youth on a limited budget.  The reason we donate our time and treasure is that we hear stories about lives changed through the programs offered by the talented team of professionals and volunteers that make Camptown a success all the time.  
Camptown, Inc.	114057		/users/profile/155203	bobcat	Donor	5	06/06/2012	My first experience with Camptown was in 2001 when I served as a volunteer on a weeklong backpacking trip.  During my week with a group from the inner city,  I could see the need for getting kids out of the city and into nature.  We climbed, backpacked, and canoed during our week.  I watched these kids try things they have never done before and watched as their confidence grew.  I so believed in the mission of Camptown that I became a staff member and have been a loyal donor ever since.

Shelter Ministries Inc	224332		/users/profile/288088	kittykaffeine	Volunteer	5	10/20/2014	Shelter Ministries has made a huge impact in the surrounding community. Food and clothing banks and the Christmas Bureau have helped hundreds of families put food on their table, provide proper clothing for those in need, and help families give their children Christmas.  I love that they have classes for people in need to take to better themselves and their families as well as getting them to actively help in their community and keep paying the good deeds forward. Such a wonderful group of people! :-)

Shelter Ministries Inc	223583		/users/profile/287334	dencin87	Volunteer	5	10/16/2014	Sheltered Ministries has helped me in my spiritual journey and to believe in the good in people.  It is a place to go for help without anyone judging them.  Since I have been volunteering there I have had so many people tell me how much they appreciate this Ministry.   I am so fortunate to be a part of this great ministry.
Shelter Ministries Inc	223402		/users/profile/287150	Elizabeth160	Client Served	5	10/16/2014	I don't know what we would have done without Shelter Ministries.  When my husband's hours were cut they helped us out with food and our utility bill.  They gave us the newspaper so we could look for different work.  Plus they told him about places that were hiring.  Now he is back to full time work and even has insurance.  I know it was their prayers that did it.  Like they says God is good.  
Shelter Ministries Inc	222729		/users/profile/286470	Tori4	General Member of the Public	5	10/14/2014	I have been at Shelterministries and this is what I've experienced , their is alot of love at the ministry and teachings on how to better your surroundings , families and your own life in general and when I'm at Shelterministries I feel a Spiritual blessing when I leave. I've  noticed the people that work in management try to uplift and pray with you one on one if you are willing to accept a prayer. We could use a few more place's like Shelterministries we all need help and uplifting in our lives one time or another.
Shelter Ministries Inc	222091		/users/profile/285779	Godcandoitall	General Member of the Public	5	10/12/2014	It blesses me to see what can be done when one small group of people put hands and feet to the call of the Lord to help his brother and sister in need -- the poor, the widow, and the orphan.  One person alone can do a few things, but a group of people together can do mighty things.  Shelter Ministries is a small group that together does mighty things to help those within their sphere of influence and teaching us all that it is not enough to take on a posture of worship and humility when all the while those around us are in a position of hunger and suffering.  We must put hands and feet to the call of the Lord in Isaiah 58 and do what we can to reach those in need that the Lord calls our own flesh, our neighbor.  (Is 58:6) "Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke?  (7) Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh?"   The naked, the homeless, the hungry, the working poor, people of a different class, the refugee, the single parent child, the one trying to survive on minimum wage, the illegal immigrants, these are what the Lord calls part of our own family.  We cannot hide from our own flesh.  We must do something to help them if it is within our power to do so.  This is the mission of Shelter Ministries:  they are that light of help in the harbor of despair, need, and loss to their own flesh.   They teach us that there in the midst of such devotion, where piety has legs, where worship gives birth to a ceaseless care of the other, where worshipers serve as midwives of the very kingdom of God, in the midst of such devotion, right there in our worship, the promise is that God will go ahead of us and God will go behind. When we call upon the Lord, the Lord will answer. When we cry for help, the Lord will say, Here I am. So when we remove the yoke of selfishness that hangs around us, shatter that idol that convinces us that worship is about what we get out of it, or how we "feel", or what we like and dont like, when we stop pointing the finger at what we think is wrong with the community or with the world or with them, so easily speaking of evil in others different than ourselves, and instead, offer food to the hungry and satisfy the needs of the afflicted, attend to the hurting and speak for those long silenced and reach out to the dying and lift up the trampled and advocate for those who have little chance, and when we need help with that, when we do that, when our life together is about that, then when we call out, then, the Lord will say, "Here I am!  Here I am!"  That is why the Shelter Ministries is both a blessing and is blessed.  They have answered the call of the Lord and are Jesus's hands and feet to their community.  I know that when a person walks into their lighthouse, they will find a safe haven where their needs will be met in a physical and spiritual manner with the Love of the Lord.

Parkview Health	145393		/users/profile/191900	brittany.daugherty1	Client Served	5	11/30/2012	I was involved in an accident in July of 2012 and had a complete humerus fracture requiring surgery.  I had never broken a bone and was nervous about the procedure, but the wonderful staff at Parkview helped to put me at ease.  During my brief stay the doctors, nurses, and other medical personnel consistently checked up on me to make sure I was comfortable and to keep me informed on my upcoming surgery.  This really helped to ease my fears making this as pleasant an experience as surgery can be!  My surgeon (Dr. Goertzen) did an excellent job leaving me with minimal scarring and a rapid recovery.  The follow up care at Parkview was also great --this even included massage therapy to speed up recovery time at The Womens Health Center from Julie (who was very nice and good at what she does!).  Overall, I would highly recommend Parkview and am 100% sure I will be returning there for any future healthcare needs.

Through this partnership they have helped many children and their families through their nursing support and many health initiatives.  Right now Parkview supplements the FWCS nursing staff by supplying 5 school based nurses so children have better access to a nurse while at school. They also have nurse specialists that provide expert advice on serious health conditions like diabetes and asthma. These conditions can have a big impact on our kids during the school day.  Additionally, Parkview has provided continuing education for all of our school nurses making us better prepared to meet the health needs of our students. Parkview has stayed committed to helping the most vulnerable and underserved in our community by offering additions services to our Title I schools. They provide vision screening and in-school flu immunization programs. They are committed to having an impact on other important health matters like childhood obesity by assisting with wonderful education programs for students like their LIVE program. My experience is that the Parkview mission is committed to a healthier future for Fort Wayne. We are truly grateful to have them as our partner. Mary Hess RN, BSN Health Services Specialist FWCS
Parkview Health	144171		/users/profile/190682	CLSchuler	Client Served	5	11/29/2012	During a recent routine physical exam, my husbands EKG revealed hed had a recent, silent heart attack. As expected, this was very scary news to both of us. Within days, the doctors at Parkview Heart Institute scheduled him for an echo cardiogram and, subsequently, a cardiac catheterization. Everyone at Parkview, from the receptionist who checked us in to the surgeon who performed the procedure was extremely solicitous. The nurses who cared for us  and I use the word us deliberately  were especially compassionate, not only making sure my husband was comfortable and informed at every step in the procedure but also taking the time to reassure a frightened wife and make what was happening a little less scary. Happy to say, the procedure went well and my husband did not need further surgery. If the time ever comes that he does, we will definitely have it done at Parkview.
Big Brothers and Big Sisters of Cass County Inc	87052		/users/profile/97627	Barri	Volunteer	5	04/25/2011	I have been a big brother for 10 years and this is my second little I have been involved with.  It has been a really good, humbling experience for me and I feel my little's have benifited well from our friendships and experiences together as well.  Sometimes a young adult just needs someone to talk to and share things with.  It may not seem very important sometimes but it may mean a whole lot to the young adult.  I also think getting together with my little has helped me too and has made me realize that sometimes it's the very smallest things that mean so much and has helped me appreciate that.  Big Brothers is a lot of fun and creates many opportunities that may be otherwise passed by or not even thought of.

I started in the Local Hero Program at a local elementary school and then became a board member and then a Big Sister.  I know that I am helping the child I am mentoring.  We have both grown through our relationship over the past 3 years and I look forward to being a part of her life for the next 8 years of our journey and hopefully beyond.  Big Brothers Big Sisters of Cass County touches the lives of so many in our community.  I believe that is evident in our ability to raise record amounts of money to support our agency year after year.  The community has really embraced our organization and we are so grateful for everyone's continued support especially through the difficult economic times in recent years.  The children of this community would not be the same without our chapter of BBBS.

Thanks to the dedication of our staff, volunteers(both in the field and my fellow Board members),  and the community, BBBS of Cass County continues to provide much needed mentoring services to at-risk children in Cass County both through traditional matches and school programs when such is needed more than ever.     We have survived hard economic times thanks to those mentioned above when all other local BBBS agencies have sadly had to close.    We remain focused on "one child at a time" and  the payoff is when an adult comes back and tells us that he or she was a "Little" here and how their life was positively impacted.   Small Big Brothers Big Sisters Agencies must not be allowed to  disappear!    John S. Damm

The students, parents, and instructors that participate in the FWDC events are one of a kind and it is easy to see that the FWDC has changed many of their lives. They teach more to their students than dance and other art forms. They teach their students to be beautiful human beings who care for the community.

Fort Wayne Dance Collective Inc	182017		/users/profile/238771	dhswartz	Volunteer	5	10/24/2013	THe Fort Wayne Dance Collective is an organization that reaches far beyond definition of the words which form its name.  This community of dancers, movers, healers, and artists (in every definition) is creating an indelible mark on Fort Wayne and Northeast Indiana.  Its diverse outreach programs touch the lives of our disabled people, our urban youth, our elderly, and our competitive dancers alike.  Without this organization, there would be a serious gap in our culture as a city, and in our repertoire of platforms for expression.  As a volunteer committee member for the Fort Wayne Dance Collective I have been able to see children's dreams come true, experience a rich-almost family like-interaction between students and staff, and been treated to some of the most beautiful dancing on earth through their Guest Artists Residency.  I pretty much freakin' love the place because of the people, and the genuine interactions between them, and the produced because of this culture. 
Fort Wayne Dance Collective Inc	181775		/users/profile/238511	Heather119	Volunteer	5	10/23/2013	Fort Wayne Dance Collective...a place for movement studies and creative expression.  All four of my girls have been so lucky to move and create with this organization.  As each child has a unique story...it is so comforting to know that there are dance teachers who encourage that individuality, rather than force kids into tricks and stunts and false expressions.  
Fort Wayne Dance Collective Inc	181489		/users/profile/238214	Larnold	Client Served	5	10/23/2013	After dancing for over half of my life through a combination of both a professional ballet company (three years) and a competitive dance atmosphere (seven years), when I finished high school I felt like the strive for technique outweighed my initial strive for the rejuvenation I felt through the original artistic pursuit. I had great experiences with all of these groups I had been a part of. But I know that for me some of the most empowering moments of dance were when I was free to take that wonderful technique I was taught through these schools and to create my own space and motion in an inclusive space that would allow me to do so. These were the moments I felt most inhibited in my body and alive. After I graduated high school, I had two months left to figure out how I could complete my dance experience in Fort Wayne before it would be potentially different forever away at college. I reconnected with a dance teacher who had believed in me all along and had always been nothing but kind to me throughout my dance career in high school. She is a current teacher there now and I in fact am still in contact with her today. The first class I took at the FWDC, I remember being nervous and unsure of how it would be. My former teacher told me I would love it, so I trusted her and tried out a class. The building itself was beautiful, it had photographs in the offices and hallways to show case old memories of when the company first started years before. I recognized some of the teachers faces. These faces had genuine smiles and honest content; I felt drawn in to experience advice and observe dancing from these teachers. And I did. These women, old and new teachers, taught their classes in some of the most proactive and inclusive of everyone ways I have ever been treated in a dance class. Everyone was given a voice, and all of our ideas were heard. When we were given a task to copy a movement by one of the instructors it was not to be exactly like hers, we could transcend the movement to how we wanted it to be our own. I felt like an individual in these classes, not simply a part of a group. I felt like I could take whatever emotion I was feeling and completely evolve with it in the space I was given and sharing with the other dancers. It was not about lessening ourselves, becoming smaller or lighter, or taller and higher- it was about reconnecting with our own bodies themselves and letting this interactive connection take us both where we wanted. I felt like I could even interconnect some of my own personal stories happening in my current life back into the dancing if I wanted, but I didn't have to. I was not forced to emote some feeling or to achieve some measurable amount of turns, I was just instructed to feel and become one with my dance and my body. That is what I had missed, this is what inspired me more than anything else. When I got to college I remembered how the FWDC would film some of their dancers and I became inspired to recast a storyline from my English class into a dance that would be filmed. My professor loved it, and encouraged me to keep up with it ever sense. I began noticing how open my school was to proactively restorative new interactive ideas, especially within my studio art major and within my help out at the ethics and nature park. It was here I began taking yoga and remembering the restorative feeling afterwords matching up with what I experienced after classes at the FWDC. I noticed people from my school leaving yoga more confidently feeling like they felt more attached to the body they were living in. They started telling me so, and they also enjoyed the space where they felt unjudged and always welcome. They felt like they had reclaimed their bodies and their intentions and their spirits. This is a concept I have been trying to work with back at school interactively with the community through my artwork all summer and school year, and I love to look back at the current works of the FWDC often to get inspiration. I love the interactive events that the collective hosts that really help to intertwine and give back inspiration to the community like the most recent Romeo and Juliet production. I love how the collective interconnects artistic concepts and they value the visual arts in how the collective engages community attention through their visuals and promotions (a beautiful website, very sincere and beautiful movies, beautiful pictures). And most importantly, I love how the FWDC welcomes any person no matter what their story and helps to reteach us the true and honest sincere beauties of dance, and what can come out of our pursuits if we treat our body nicely value it and restore ourselves by how we artistically choose to reclaim it and move forward with it. This is a dance collective that gives back and restores the souls of its dancers more than any other kind of dance collective I have been a part of. :)

She loved competing and did not want to change studios.  I wanted her to see the artistic side and true nature of dance because sh e wanted to continue with dance as a career.  She only spent one hour at the Collective and was completely open to switching studios.  She has improved her skills 100 fold in just a few years.   My son suffers from severe anxiety but he loves drumming.  The Taiko drummers were so encouraging to him that he has gone from standing outside watching a class to performing with their youth group and assisting with younger kids.  He even enrolled in a hip hop class.  They both have learned a variety of skills included in the creation process of a concert from conception to strike after the show.  The instructors are such an amazing mix of people from a vast variety of backgrounds, who are very encouraging to their students.  My children do not have just one mentor, but a community full of them!
Fort Wayne Dance Collective Inc	181439		/users/profile/238166	Katemajor	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/23/2013	As a transplanted artist coming to Fort Wayne I was nervous for my prospects as far as being a dancer and teacher. The FWDC is an amazing organization in a small city. The people, the leaders, and everyone involved with it continue to amaze me. I am lucky I be a part of the collective, not only because of the great students but because it is an outlet where I can create art myself. It has it's finger on the pulse of what's happen now In the real dance world, even though it is far away from buzzing dance metropolises such as NYC or LA. 
Fort Wayne Dance Collective Inc	181438		/users/profile/238165	Stephen24	Client Served	5	10/23/2013	I have been wanting to dance for years. After turning 30, I couldn't think of any reason good enough not to start pursuing this goal. I had no experience and had never taken a class; I just knew it was something I wanted to accomplished. The entire staff have been nothing but helpful. They pointed me in the right direction, signed me up for the right classes, and now I am not only taking public dance classes but also working privately with an instructor that I love. I highly recommend FWDC. They are a full service, highly qualified and student-focused dance company.
Fort Wayne Dance Collective Inc	180140		/users/profile/236801	HeidiFW	Board Member	5	10/20/2013	My involvement with the Fort Wayne Dance Collective began in January, 2000 after my second child was born.  I took ballet to recover from a C-section.  I studied dance briefly in college and never imagined that I would have the opportunity to take classes, perform in large concerts, and create my own choreography as an adult.  The Fort Wayne Dance Collective is a key part our thriving arts community with a unique emphasis on providing movement and performance opportunities for people of all ages and abilities.  FWDC places a high priority on the creative process and students are taught to explore through movement, rhythm, and  language.   With a wide variety of outreach programs that serve many people across Northeast Indiana, the Fort Wayne Dance Collective is an organization that significantly improves the quality of life in our community.
Fort Wayne Dance Collective Inc	178089		/users/profile/234711	Vicki39	Board Member	5	10/16/2013	I started attending classes at the FWDC in May of 2010 when I moved to Fort Wayne from NYC. The first thing I noticed was how welcomed the staff and teachers made me feel in addition to the non-judgmental atmosphere. I have been involved in several capacities since that day: student, teacher, volunteer, choreographer, costume creator, committee member and now board member. In ever facet of the FWDC, I have seen the way dance/movement has touched the lives of the public. Through our family concerts, our outreach classes to high school students and our onsite classes. Dance truly is for every "body". I am proud to call the Fort Wayne Dance Collective my home away from home. 
Indianapolis Neighborhood Housing Partnership Inc	294874	2	/users/profile/385642	jfmarron	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/07/2016	As someone who works in the housing field, I am proud to be a financial supporter of INHP and its work to support housing, homeownership, and neighborhood development throughout Indianapolis. Having worked with a number of nonprofit organizations, I know INHP has one of the most capable, knowledgeable, and committed staff working in the nonprofit sector today. With a clear focus on mission and vision, INHP staff are diligent in their pursuit of supporting families in their dreams to achieve homeownership. Through a combination of counseling, advising, and lending, INHP works with low and moderate income buyers to achieve the dream of homeownership; for many of the families with whom they work, INHP is the only responsible lending option available. INHP works with these families to strengthen their credit, engage in financial planning, and prepare them for the ups and downs of homeownership. Research from the Federal Reserve shows that families that participate in INHP programs are far less likely to experience a foreclosure than similarly situated families.  INHP's support of families, in turn, strengthens neighborhoods. This is one obvious benefit of its housing counseling/foreclosure prevention activities, but it also occurs through INHP's support of the local community development sector, its homeowner repair program, and its local lending/construction activity. Research from Indiana University finds that INHP's activities has a considerable economic and social impact on central Indiana - both measured in the millions of dollars. Having had the opportunity to meet a handful of families that INHP has assisted in achieving homeownership, that impact is modest when compared to the emotions and gratitude expressed by those families as they achieve the dream of homeownership. Those families are a powerful testament to the impact that INHP achieves through its work. Those moments are why Im proud to support INHP, its staff, and its mission. 
Indianapolis Neighborhood Housing Partnership Inc	291126	1	/users/profile/381494	ddylla	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/26/2016	Another colleague and I visited INHP in January 2016 and reviewed their homeownership services for Marion County residents. We looked intensively at their advisory and lending services, interviewed many of their staff members and did research about their accomplishments.  Overall, we were very impressed with their dedicated staff, the quality of their homeownership services and the number of homeowners they have assisted.  We found INHP to be an extraordinary nonprofit organization with staff who were very committed to their mission of helping families in Marion County.  Their innovative and personalized approach helps several hundred households every year. In many ways, INHP is a national model -- a research and development lab for testing new strategies for delivering homeownership services -- through online intake systems, web-based courses, in-person workshops, individualized advice for prospective homeowners and affordable mortgage products. INHP is truly a "one-stop shop" for homeownership services and residents of Marion County should be thankful for their existence.

It is a place where I can put down roots and be part of a community. As a donor to and volunteer of INHP, I am happy to help others achieve the gift of home ownership. Supporting, guiding, and teaching others to attain and sustain home ownership is the goal of INHP's staff. They are professional, hardworking, caring, and dedicated to the clients they serve.

Indianapolis Neighborhood Housing Partnership Inc	289657		/users/profile/379908	tmassey	Board Member	5	05/12/2016	        INHP transforms families and neighborhoods in Indianapolis by helping working people achieve and sustain homeownership.        Critical services include homeownership education, financial advising, and home financing to purchase or improve a home.        INHP programs support sustainable impact for families and for strong and vibrant Indianapolis neighborhoods.        INHPs reach and impact are leveraged through key community partnershipsthe city, lenders, community development corporations, state and federal programs, and local agencies.        Homeownership positively impacts children, families, and neighborhoods by providing a foundation that fosters long-lasting, generational transformation.         I would encourage others to support the dream of homeownershipfor Indianapolis neighbors, for stable homes, for a vibrant community.
Indianapolis Neighborhood Housing Partnership Inc	288588	1	/users/profile/378781	Msanchez1023	Board Member	5	05/05/2016	I support INHP and am honored to serve as a Board Member for the following reasons.  INHP is an organization that is not only transforming families, but also neighborhoods and communities.  Every dollar donated is used to make Indianapolis neighborhoods stronger and peoples lives better through increased homeownership, reduction in abandoned housing and other affordable housing initiatives, as well as through the development of new, strategic and innovative community development tools.  INHP has helped over 33,000 Indianapolis residents and has financed more than $373 million in mortgages for low-and moderate-income families.  In addition, with the help of the Lilly Endowment and other supporters, INHP has invested over $32 million in neighborhood development initiatives since 1999.  Needless to say, all of this has an enormous impact on the lives of families (every single member) which in turn adds to the vitality of a neighborhood.  This benefits us all as a community. Also, of the many things INHP excels at, besides its core mission, is the ability to bring together other partner organizations to ensure a cohesive and rounded plan in the area of community development, place-making, and building strong families.  INHP is a leader in this area.  It has strong philanthropic support and volunteer engagement.  This, along with its demonstrated track record of sustainable success and impact in helping families grow stronger and investing in neighborhoods, INHP has been and continues to be an asset to the community and is serving as a gold star example on a national scale.  This speaks volumes about the organization itself but also about our philanthropic community. When I hear from the families that are impacted by INHP's services, hear their stories and see them in turn supporting INHP to help other families, I am reassured that INHP is holding true to its mission and it makes me feel honored to be a part of it and to know that we are making a difference! 
Indianapolis Neighborhood Housing Partnership Inc	285778	1	/users/profile/375805	Huntington_IN	Donor	5	04/13/2016	As a corporate partner invested in the Indianapolis market we support INHP and their efforts to provide low and moderate income families with the opportunities to achieve and maintain homeownership because their efforts are key to the success of our community. Over 3,500 families access INHP services annually and their impact goes beyond the families served and into the neighborhoods were families live, work and play. We invest in INHPs programs and services because of their strong leadership, accountability and transparency. They are good fiscal agents of our philanthropic dollars and the organization is grounded in a results driven approach. We are honored to support them annually through contributions and corporate volunteerism. Mike Newbold, Huntington National Bank, Regional President for Central Indiana

Indianapolis Neighborhood Housing Partnership Inc	284821	2	/users/profile/374878	dwskeels	Donor	5	04/05/2016	I support INHP, and I heartily encourage others to do so, as wellfor Indianapolis neighbors, for stable homes, and for a vibrant community. Here's why I donateHaving resided in Indianapolis for nearly 20 years, I feel a responsibility and commitment to ensuring the city continues to grow and prosper. Though the adage, Give people a fish, and you feed them for a day. Teach people to fish, and you feed them for a lifetime, may be trite, the principle behind it is of fundamental importance to me when selecting charitable organizations to support.I donate to INHP because their path to homeownership begins with education versus immediate financial assistance. It continues with financial advising, and ultimately, with assistance in home financing. The successful completion of INHPs program is not easybut neither is homeownership. The brilliance of INHPs model hinges on its ability to help working people, not only achieve homeownership, but to sustain homeownership. Sustained homeownership positively impacts children, families, and neighborhoods by providing a foundation that fosters long-lasting, generational transformation.

I have had the opportunity to interact with members of the INHP staff and am impressed by their professionalism and tight focus on their mission.  
Indianapolis Neighborhood Housing Partnership Inc	169426	1	/users/profile/224506	CommDevIndy	Professional with expertise in this field	1	09/12/2013	INHP has a long history of helping people in the Indianapolis area. However, they have recently shifted away from the programs and services that have traditionally been provided. They receive the same or more funding each year, but have cut their programs and services to low and moderate income individuals, while creating additional overhead expenses internally. The programs and services most hurt by the cuts include education and housing counseling.  INHP advertises to the public and funding sources that it also helps provide mortgages to hundreds of individuals, but most of those loans are actually referrals to banks who then originate the loans. INHP originated just over 60 loans last year in house. That's a sad number for $6+ million dollars in expenses.  The organization has also shifted to administering funds on behalf of the City of Indianapolis and other fund sources, and uses its political power to exert control over numerous local community development corporations that depend on the funding to redevelop struggling neighborhoods, while shaving off administration fees. Those are funds that would be better served in the community.  The deterioration of the reputation of this organization is very sad, indeed. They are terribly inefficient, have lost all clout in the community development world, have lied to the public and funding sources, and are generally poor stewards of precious dollars that could be helping the people of Indianapolis.   
Ronald McDonald House of Indiana Inc	93458		/users/profile/107516	miles5872	Volunteer	4	07/05/2011	Ronald McDonald House of Indiana is doing spectacular things for Indiana families during a difficult time in their lives.  I served dinner there as a part of the Young Professionals Board and was able to actually meet and serve the several families staying at the House.  It was helpful to actually speak with those that we are serving.  The most impressive part to me was that the families actually thanked us as they were leaving the dining room!  In the middle of their struggle they recognized that others were helping them.  It was so touching and made me want to go back again and again.
Ronald McDonald House of Indiana Inc	92881		/users/profile/106613	emmy322	Client Served	5	06/29/2011	My husband and I stayed at the Ronald McDonald house two different times in 2008 while our son was undergoing surgery for a heart defect.  We were given a room right away each time because of our particular circumstance.  It provided us a way to sleep, and take shower but still be close to our son if needed which was very comforting to us.  There were plenty of meals provided at both the Limestone and Riley location that helped make our stay in the hospital a little better.  What a wonderful place to help families through the simple things while going through a difficult time.
Ronald McDonald House of Indiana Inc	92825	1	/users/profile/106548	Richard G.	Board Member	5	06/29/2011	On October 25, 1996 my 7 month old son, William, was diagnosed with Infant acute lymphocytic leukemia (Infant ALL) with a 19% cure rate.  My wife and I took William to Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis for what would end up being 2 years and 3 months of treatment.  At the time Will was diagnosed, we had no real idea what services the Ronald McDonald House of Indiana (RMH) provided.   Two weeks into Will's treatment he ended up in ICU and we found ourselves in need of a place to stay that was as close to the hospital as possible.  The RMH provided us, and provides thousand of families, with a safe place to stay while their child is receiving medical care.  Having the RMH eliminates the stressors of Where are we going to stay?, What are we going to eat?, How are we going to pay for those items?, and How can I get a break to rest?.  The RMH allowed us to focus our emotional and physical resources on our son and his care. Unfortunately, Will passed away on January 7, 1999.  Since then  I have found that being a volunteer/board member of the RMH is my best way to remember Will and help other families whose children need to receive critical medical care.

By providing the comforts of home to the families of these sick children, the Ronald McDonald House is an important piece to the treatment and road to recovery process.  During meal times when I've helped serve extra special meals, the families enjoy the opportunity to relax, gain strength from their meal, and find a communal sense of belonging while interacting with other families at the house.

The staff and volunteers here understand the needs of the families they serve, but are constantly working to better understand ways to improve. This is a great organization to be apart of and one that makes a difference in families llives.
Ronald McDonald House of Indiana Inc	92765		/users/profile/106473	Elux	Volunteer	5	06/29/2011	I have been a volunteer with Ronald McDonald House of Indiana for nearly 4 years.  I specifically spend time at the location inside Riley Children's Hospital.  As a volunteer I have had the opportunity to see the impact RMHI has on families who stay there during their child's hospitalization.  The physical and emotional toll experienced by these families is visible as they wander into the house just looking for a quick respite - a meal, place to sleep, chance to do laundry, or just escape.  They are always so thankful and even in their distress they show their appreciation.  The House transcends the idea of a physical place but rather a gathering place for other families with similar situations to share their stories and gain strength from their experiences.  I believe in the House and this why I continue to come back as a volunteer. Personally I have had the chance to share warm conversations with several people during their stay and it's always nice to engage them on a personal level to perhaps get there mind off their child's troubles.

As a previous intern, I got to see first-hand exactly what the House does and how important they are to the community. They are a home away from home for families with critically-ill children but they also go beyond that. The staff and volunteers all care about each individual that comes into the House and I know they do their jobs with pride. Furthermore, the events they hold to raise money and awareness for the House are top-notch (golf & poker tournaments, fundraising dinners, auctions) and are such events that include local celebrities and a loyal following of sponsors. Put it all together and it's easy to see why the Ronald McDonald House of Indiana is such an important non-profit to have around.
Ronald McDonald House of Indiana Inc	92672		/users/profile/106348	jesamyn	Board Member	5	06/28/2011	The Ronald McDonald House provides critical support to ill children and their families. The Indianapolis location plays an integral part in offering itself as a base for these children and their families to focus on their medical treatments and overall well-being. Providing family support as well as to the patient is critical in addressing the needs of the family being affected. The Ronald McDonald House Indianapolis staff, board members, and volunteers care deeply about the mission of the house, and care deeply about the children and families that this wonderful organization serves. Unfortunately medical tragedies can strike any family at any time, and just the simple fact that this resource exists to help many people throught these difficult times is amazing. I have never known the staff, board members, and volunteers to be anything but dedicated, passionate, caring and committed. This same spirit of committment to serving these deserving children and their families in Indianapolis will undoubtedly continue to carry on into the future, and I look forward to seeing what wonderful things come next!

As a guets the tsaff always seemed to know what to to do or say. Or even when to back off. For me, walking into the house during the day was a means of escape from the bedside "chaos."  It was free of patients and hospital staff. No monitors or alarms. It allowed my mind to clear briefly. As a volunteer I try to use my experience as a house guest to assit the current guest. Help them in any way I can. I try to make sure I keep the place clean, shelves stocked, and smile on my face.  Always trying to make thier visit as pleasant as possible.
Ronald McDonald House of Indiana Inc	91093		/users/profile/104088	Bekah A.	Volunteer	5	06/16/2011	The Ronald McDonald House truly is a home-away-from-home for so many families each year. I've had three personal experiences with family friends finding comfort and strength through their stay at the House.  When I was in high school, a very good friend of mine was diagnosed with osteosarcoma in her leg. She fought so hard for so long, all with her family by her side. They were staying at the Ronald McDonald House until she was released from the hospital.  A year later, my friend developed leukemia and was back in Indianapolis for treatment, again with her family close by. For the second time, her family found hope through their stay at the House. In my friend's honor, I decided to become a volunteer at the Ronald McDonald House, to be able to give back to a cause that helped her and her family so much in their time of need. I am now the Communications and Marketing intern at the House, and I am truly getting to see the odds and ends of how much effort it takes to keep the House running, allowing so many families to be served each day. There are so many amazing volunteers at the House, and that's one of my favorite parts of my job. I am able to volunteer for such a great cause, and have fun with my new team of staff as well. I've been able to meet a few families currently living at the House, and share in community meals, also coordinated by volunteers.  I just know, in my friend's time of need, the House was a safe haven for her family to turn to. I pray that with the help of volunteers and donors the Ronald McDonald House of Indiana can continue keeping families together when they need each other most.

I have seen the determination of the staff and volunteers to make this center a place of haven for women, children and their pets. Whenever I can I want to be able to give my time and dollars to such a hardworking and dedicated group of people who put saving lives of women and children who are in danger.

Through hard work and an enormous amount of support Beacon is now up and running. In working on these 2 fundraisers I saw first hand how willing people are to lend their talents and resources to help women in terrible situations. I talked with women from all walks of life who were survivors of domestic violence. Our fund raisers raised funds that helped us to realize the dream of opening the doors to a resource center on the west side that is helping women, children and teens have safer and better lives.

It has been amazing to watch the hearts of those involved go far beyond what is needed and help the hurting women and families of this community. This organization has filled a huge void where it was desperately needed. Each time I hear the statistics of the women that are assisted each month at the center I am amazed and my heart is moved. Beacon of Hope is God's answer to the prayer of many women in Indianapolis and I cant wait to see it become a 24-hour shelter for women, children and pets.
Beacon Of Hope Center For Women Inc	40993	6	/users/profile/41889	suzanne6	Volunteer	5	05/27/2010	I have had the joy of watching Beacon of Hope go from a dream to a reality (all in a very short time). From the beginning I have been in awe of Terry, the executive director. She has a passion for the cause and the victims that is contagious! Her faith is unshakable and she has such vision! With her leadership and countless wonderful volunteers BOH has done an amazing job of creating a crisis-call center, raising money and serving victims on the westside of Indianapolis! Their facility is top-noth, welcoming and safe. The volunteers are welcoming and so loyal and committed to helping victims. I have been so blessed to be involved with this organization, witnessing what can happen when people work hard towards a commone goal!
Beacon Of Hope Center For Women Inc	40518	6	/users/profile/41432	barbara310	Volunteer	5	05/25/2010	I joined a small group at my church recently as they were looking for an outreach opportunity.  They had decided on another nonprofit group, but I saw a write-up on BOH in the paper and was immediately interested. I was looking online to read about this other group and up came Beacon of Hope - God was trying to get my attention!  After meeting with Terry and hearing her story and hearing about the miraculous way BOH went from a dream to a reality, I knew this was where God wanted us to be.  Several of us attended the dinner and auction and will go to the "pampering night" to meet clients and other volunteers.  I'm planning to be trained in the next group of phone counselors, and our group will look for continuing opportunies to serve.  The enthusiasm and compassion shown by Terry and some of the other staff is contagious!
Beacon Of Hope Center For Women Inc	40153	6	/users/profile/41075	lori3	Volunteer	5	05/23/2010	The women of our church became familiar with Beacon of Hope through one of our elders and one of our women's ministry team members.  They both presented an invitation to Beacon of Hope's 2nd Purse Auction. Neither knew the other was doing so.  But God did and He has used Beacon of Hope to draw us into awareness of this huge need for a women's center/shelter on Indy's west side.  Ever since meeting the Exec Director and hearing her personal testimony and the reports of west side women's needs and needs meet, we couldn't help but try and come alongside to help wherever we could.  The Beacon of Hope staff and board have the Lord's sorrow over this epidemic called domestic violence and they live out, with all their marrow, the desire He has put on their hearts to reach out and offer a way out and healing for women and children caught in this cycle. They are having much success, and the calls come in daily for assistance.They are starting up a foster pet program to give these women they help yet another way to get out of their situation who will not leave if children or pets could be harmed.  Children and women are situated at a local shelter however their pets have had no where to go until now.  Beacon of Hope will have coordinators of a foster pet program to place victim's animals at temporary homes to be cared for while the women/children start the healing and recovery process.  Foster Pets will be a huge blessing for those who have need of it!Finally, each of the women on our team has been blessed by being involved with fundrasing and spreading the word about Beacon of Hope.  The Director and Board's ultimate goal and they believe the Lord's goal for them is to have a shelter built to further meet the needs of the women on Indy's west side. God is faithful and so are the Exec Dir, Board and volunteer staff at Beacon of Hope Women's Center.
Beacon Of Hope Center For Women Inc	39638	6	/users/profile/40589	heather6	Volunteer	5	05/20/2010	As a former victim of domestic violence, I find it rewarding to work for an organization that strives every day to help those in need, encourage those that we've helped get away from their abusers with continued counseling and empowerment programs and keep in contact and continue to encourage and motivate those that have overcome and are now supporting themselves and their children.There is a passion that you can feel when you walk in the door.  The staff here is committed to helping victims and also providing awareness in an effort to help prevent domestic violence.  It is a sad and unfortunate need in our community and Beacon of Hope Center for Women, Inc. is helping fulfill that need and does it with the strictest of confidence to the victims and with the respect and dignity they deserve.
Beacon Of Hope Center For Women Inc	38806	5	/users/profile/39710	rfrazier	Volunteer	5	05/13/2010	My experience with Beacon of Hope Center for Women, Inc. has been very enriching for me as a volunteer.  Although have not been a victim of domestic violence in the past, a number of my friends have experienced domestic violence.  I have had it in my heart to help serve in whatever capacity I could.When the Executive Director, Terry Moore, who is one of my best friends shared her dream and vision with me to open a domestic violence crisis center and shelter, I said to her that I will support you in whatever capacity and amvery happy to be making a difference with fundraising events to help with saving lives ofdomestic violence victims.  I have had an opportunity to meet a few current victims and survivors, through my service with Beacon of Hope.I believe that God has opened the door for Beacon of Hope Center for Women, Inc. to not just be like other crisis centers/shelters, but to take it a step further to provide for victims families and in future provide shelter for pets of victims as well.The community on the West Side of Indianapolis are very supportive of having Beacon of Hope Center for Women, Inc. locate there, because there is a GREAT need for there to be a shelter on this side of Indianapolis.  Domestic violence seems to be more prevalent on this side of town.It is my hope and prayer that Beacon of Hope will receive more and more monetary support so that they can open up their shelter soon, but also support otherwise through donations, volunteering, etc.
Beacon Of Hope Center For Women Inc	38798	6	/users/profile/39702	denise4	Board Member	5	05/13/2010	I am currently Vice President of the Board and have been with Beacon of Hope for 1 1/2 years.  This organization has grown and helped so many women in the last year, that I am honored to have been a part of it.  It takes so much support from the community to help these women and children, either monetarily or by volunteering your time.  Please take time to learn more about our organization or an organization in your area and see what you can do to help.
Autism Advocates of Indiana, Inc. dba Answers for Autism	261602	3	/users/profile/350214	Writer,	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/05/2015	In my current role as director of the Indiana Resource Center for Autism, I have had the opportunity to work in collaboration with Answers for Autism on a number of projects.  Through their fundraising efforts, they have worked with IRCA to create statewide training for First Responders in Indiana, to assist with the development of brochures and booklets for families of individuals newly diagnosed on the autism spectrum, and to assist with numerous statewide training events.  This is the only organization in Indiana that has a statewide reach and helps families and professionals supporting and living daily with those on the spectrum.   Started by a group of mothers, the state has benefited from their efforts.  I am truly inspired by them.  
Autism Advocates of Indiana, Inc. dba Answers for Autism	264687	2	/users/profile/353414	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/16/2015	The staff of Answers for Autism has worked tirelessly to give individuals with Autism across Indiana increased opportunities in so many ways!  They have raised funds and provided grants for many worthy activities to improve the lives of those with an Autism Spectrum Disorder.  They are present at numerous community events and disability fairs so that they can reach out to families.  As a speech-language pathologist specializing in assistive technology in public school, I saw first-hand the impact of the grant money they awarded.  They were among the very first organizations in the state to support the use of iPods for those with Autism, as well as sensory-friendly movie experiences, social skills training,  communication devices and more.  Answers for Autism also has granted money for professional development so that educators and therapists working with this population can increase their skills and ultimately better the lives of those with Autism.  By developing personal connections with families, offering resources, and financial assistance for programming, Answers for Autism's impact in our community is far-reaching and matched by no other group.  Thank you for all you do!

I have truly seen all sides of the organization and can say this is a dedicated group of folks who have a desire to make a difference in the lives of folks with Autism in Indiana.  As a parent I have enjoyed the annual walk where my son can truly be who he is with no worries about what other folks might think or feel.  As a professional I have been able to share the grant program as a local resource for the various organizations I work with.  As a volunteer I have been able to work towards a common cause with some of the most dedicated parents and professionals in our area.   
Autism Advocates of Indiana, Inc. dba Answers for Autism	262856	2	/users/profile/351553	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/10/2015	The dedication of Answers for Autism to the Indiana autism community is second to none!  I so appreciate these parents - parents with children with autism - and the time, energy, and heart they give to the community through their grant and outreach efforts.  If you've not attended an event - you should!  
Autism Advocates of Indiana, Inc. dba Answers for Autism	262122	1	/users/profile/350796	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	10/07/2015	I have had many experiences with Autism Advocates (Answers for Autism) over the years.  My son is now 9 and has autism and we have utilized many of their services.  We have always done the annual walk, which is one of the biggest ones I have been involved with.  The resources, the entertainment and the overall value is immense for our families in the special needs community.  They are very multi-faceted and we have also done the annual auction, the bike ride and even the golf event.  All these community outings are great to enhance the awareness to the area about autism.  They are much more than just good for our families but the grants that they give for others far exceeds any issue that we may have on a daily basis.  Answers for Autism is a fantastic organization and a true credit to central Indiana.
Autism Advocates of Indiana, Inc. dba Answers for Autism	261754	2	/users/profile/350380	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/05/2015	Inspirational, Heartfelt, and Genuine are just a few words to describe this Indiana organization.  True to their mission, this organization provides support to Indiana organizations to benefit people with autism, families supporting their loved ones with autism and professionals supporting both the family and individuals.  Monies raised from their fundraising stay in Indiana. As Outreach Specialist at Indiana Resource Center for Autism, I have traveled throughout the state of Indiana meeting families and participating in family oriented events.  One of my most memorable events is attending the Answers for Autism Walk.  Families and professionals coming together to raise funds in support of the work of AAI is truly work from the heart.

A grassroots organization, A4A has grown through love and hard work.  ALL the money they raise is put back into the needs of those they serve.  I serve as the Clinic Director of the Butler University Speech and Language Clinic.  At Butler, we now have a chapter of this group and are very proud to be associated with this amazing organization!

My family has attended the Autism Walk for the last 10 years. The people within this organization are wonderful, welcoming, and kind! The walk is an outstanding event for families, kids, and folks of all ages. In addition to the Walk, my husband and I have attended the gala event for the last several years. That adults only evening is a wonderful night out. All of the money that Answers for Autism raises goes directly to grants that impact individuals on the spectrum. The entire organization is fueled on dedicated volunteers!!! When I make charitable contributions, this is the kind of organization that I prefer to give to. Knowing that every dollar raised is making a difference is awesome. Thanks Answers for Autism for all you do for families like mine. 
Autism Advocates of Indiana, Inc. dba Answers for Autism	261222	2	/users/profile/349819	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/02/2015	This organization is completely volunteer run; there are no paid employees.  Most volunteers have direct ties to autism by way of a loved one.  AAI takes great pride in putting the highest percentage of money raised back into the state in the form of grants that directly impact programs for children and adults living with autism.  For the purpose of full disclosure, I was a founding member, proudly serving on the board for ten years and then moving to the grant committee for two.  I have since retired.  Grants are painstakingly selected to serve the most people with autism as well as to have the greatest benefit to those people.  This is a rare charity completely driven by a desire to improve the lives of children and adults with autism.

They love their coaches and teammates.  We have been involved with ASL for three years and plan on continuing for many years to come since they started their Adult Leagues this year.  They have player from 3 to?????.  Love this organization.
Athletic Sports League, Inc.	227382		/users/profile/291109	Allison98	Volunteer	5	10/27/2014	I played soccer the first year.  I have now volunteered the last two years.  It is a great atmosphere with wonderful people that support the league. I have even helped to promote the league by asking for sponsors.  Looking forward to next soccer season....and the possibility of Karate being added to ASL programs!
Athletic Sports League, Inc.	227358		/users/profile/291081	Boz74	Client Served	5	10/27/2014	ASL has a great soccer program.  My son started with the league 3 years ago.  My wife has coached for two years.  This year my son played in two divisions, my wife played in the adult league and coached 2 teams.  This is a very family oriented organization.  The coaches are wonderful and teach the kids how to compete but maintain good sportsmanship.  We plan on playing within this organization for years to come!
Athletic Sports League, Inc.	227230		/users/profile/290953	William53	Client Served	5	10/27/2014	My daughter has played in this soccer league for a couple years now. We even drive farther to get to this one because of the way that they are organized and how they teach the kids even down to the fact they actually keep score  and have winners and losers. To me thats important. I would say anyone near to this area that want their children to learn soccer and be active and have fun bring them to ASL!!
Athletic Sports League, Inc.	227213		/users/profile/290942	Heather189	General Member of the Public	5	10/27/2014	My daughter has played in the ASL for the past three years and we are beyond pleased!! They teach the participants great sportsmanship and how to work as a team. I myself am actually thinking of joining the adult league next year because I saw how much fun they had and it's great for the kids to see the adults displaying the great sportsmanship that the league has become known for. Keep up the great work!!! 
Athletic Sports League, Inc.	223767		/users/profile/287514	Rik F.	Board Member	5	10/17/2014	My family and I absolutely love ASL and all that provides for our community. I have been a Soccer coach for the 6-8 year old division for 2 years now. In this time, I've watched the organization grow immensely. Also, the parents of the children on the teams are extremely devoted and support the organization as well as the coaches for all that they do, week in & week out. Having our inaugural adult soccer league this year turned out to be an absolute  success! So.. with ASL, it's not just for the kids it's also an opportunity for adults to get involved Ias well.Tthere are also other activities such as being involved with parades during the 4H Fair and the James Dean Festival as well. ASL is a non-profit organization and in my time of being a part, I've noticed a huge growth in kids joining the league as well as the adults too! With smaller community comes more attention to the kids and the services it provides.Thank you ASL for all that you do! We greatly appreciate it!I strongly recommend this organization to anyone looking to find a new way of life & for a new great experience for yourself & your kids as well!!
Athletic Sports League, Inc.	223228		/users/profile/286970	Michael287	Volunteer	5	10/15/2014	I have coached in the league for three years now!  I look forward to seeing all of the returning players and all the new ones every season!  Passing along my knowledge and skills as a player both then and now is at times frustrating, but at the same time so rewarding.  Watching them play, and score wether they win or lose(hopefully win)is fun for all!  Looking forward to 2015!!  Thanks to all the sponsors, coaches, parents and board members who have made a safe fun environment for our children to learn and have fun!!  GO R&R Engineering!!!

From the Board members, to the coaches, to the players, to the spectators it is very much a family feel with everyone wanting to do their part to help the organization grow.  Even local area businesses play a roll in helping to sponsor the organization or teams with in the organization.

Ronald Mcdonald House Charities of the Ohio Valley Inc	320343		/users/profile/412741	Writer	Client Served	5	12/20/2016	My husband and I had to spend a month in Evansville due to our son being born prematurely and was in the NICU.  A room opened at the Ronald McDonald house and the social worker at the hospital referred us.  We were told there would always be hot meals, cozy environment, etc.  We arrived that evening cold, tired and hungry.  We were informed there was no dinner.  We asked about breakfast and informed there was no breakfast offered..only if we food shopped and cooked it ourselves.  We were handed cleaning supplies and told we had to clean our room every other day and that they reserve the right to come in and make sure we are doing this..that is an invasion of privacy.  We were also told that we could not be in the room at all during the day..my husband works remotely..how could he do that if we could not be in the room during the day?  We have to sign in and out when we leave?  Also the pictures of the rooms displayed here are NOT what they look like.  This was more like a halfway house.  I respect what this program does and think it's a wonderful thing, but it is falsely marketed.  We were not told that there is only food if a certain group prepares it.  We did meet other parents in the NICU who had similar issues with Ronald McDonald house.  I would recommend being honest with people and removing some of the ridiculous rules.  The people staying there are adults with sick children and should be treated like adults rather than kids at summer camp.  Very disappointing. 
Ronald Mcdonald House Charities of the Ohio Valley Inc	175972	2	/users/profile/232358	Tony27	Volunteer	5	10/09/2013	In the past my wife and I have been volunteers with a multitude of  organizations. Without a doubt our two years with Ronald McDonald House have been the most satisfying  and rewarding as we help clean the home as "floaters".  Seeing how appreciative our guests are and being hosts for them, interacting with them is instant gratification to us.  Our home away from home is vital to all who stay here.  A definite asset to the local hospitals and our families who come from all over the Country! We frequently have guests share their feelings - of gratitude and the warmth of obvious love they feel from the staff and volunteers. We enjoy interacting  with the children- an extra bonus while helping clean! Tony and Mary Bitter

It was a scary time for us.  knowing there was a Ronald McDonald house just across the road from the hospital took some of our worries away.  She was in the NICU for three months and had went through 4 surgeries.  We could not have paid to stay in a hotel for 3 months.  Our medical bills alone were astronomical my husband missed a lot of work when she had her surgeries and procedures done plus travel.  Parents with sick children are so blessed to have the Ronald McDonald houses in the area to stay at while they are away from home.  Since being home now, my daughter is now 8 and we have a more local RMH we are able to give back and donate our time once a month.

Ronald Mcdonald House Charities of the Ohio Valley Inc	175106	1	/users/profile/231424	awcarhop62	Volunteer	5	10/07/2013	The RMH Charities of the Ohio Valley is a valuable asset to our community.   It is especially valuable to families who need a place to stay to be close to their children with critical needs.  I have been told many times by these families that if the house was not available to them that they would have been forced to sleep in their cars to be near the hospital.  It is wonderful that they have access to a "home away from home" to allow them to get "home cooked" meals and some such needed rest. I have met and worked with so many wonderful volunteers at the house.  Some volunteer because they too needed to stay at a RMH and this is their way of giving back.  Others simply want to "give back" to others to acknowledge having received "gifts" in their own life.  I am impressed with the number of young people from the community who want to be involved in helping this non-profit organization.

I thought when I first started to volunteer that I would feel good about that. However, I didn't know that the people we serve there give as much back to me as I feel I give to them. It's a place that works it's way into your heart and makes you want to give more.  The Staff and the volunteers are wonderful caring people who it is an honor to work with.  
Ronald Mcdonald House Charities of the Ohio Valley Inc	173329		/users/profile/229470	KristyT3	Client Served	5	10/04/2013	The Ronald McDonald House of Evansville is such a wonderful place. I had never known what the RMH was all about until our family needed and received their services.  It was such a blessing that I was able to stay so close to my baby while she needed NICU care. We had a nice place to stay, food to eat, our children had rooms and a playground to use, it really saved us some from having extra stress. The RMH has such wonderful staff and volunteers who help make families feel welcomed and cared about during difficult times. A true blessing for families.
Ronald Mcdonald House Charities of the Ohio Valley Inc	162940		/users/profile/216295	Anna50	Client Served	5	07/18/2013	The Ronald McDonald House in Evansville, IN has been both an opportunity and blessing for our family. Without it, NICU families from the tri-state area wouldn't have a place to stay when they can't be at the NICU. Families from all over the country (like ours) use the RMH when our kids are in the terrific feeding clinic at St. Mary's (the local/associated hospital). Many of us are there for weeks (even months) at a time, which simply wouldn't be possible without RMH.  The staff and volunteers at the house make it a true home for us. Everything from the kids' playrooms, beautifully decorated bedrooms, the playground, etc. to the volunteer-provided meals help make the time away from home better. They take the time to get to know us, remember each family's special needs, and go out of their way to make us feel like family.

This year along the organization is funding 24 club kids with 4 year college schoalrships.  In most cases, these are the first members of the member's family to go to college.  It is a perfect example of how the Boys & Girls Clubs of Indianapolis helps bridge the gap between hope and opportunity.

They have done so much for the community I live in, they give kids a second chance and try to make the most out of those second chances.
Boys & Girls Clubs of Indianapolis, Inc.	94620		/users/profile/109472	StarletteJones	Volunteer	5	07/29/2011	As a volunteer of the Boys and Girls Clubs of Indianapolis I get to work with these kids on conflict resolution and how to act when things get heated between another people. It is amazing the changes you see in kids who attend these classes on a regular basis vs. the kids who dont attend on a regular basis. The kids that attend on a regular basis make huge strides in their overall social skills and behavior. They seem to have a general understanding of what is happening, when the argument is escalating and when their words no longer are working. At this point the next step is very critical, will kids to turn to violence or will they make smarter decisions with non-confrontational results.  It is the amazing the type of results that we see with these kids and the impact in their life.

I see it during the meetings I attend at the Clubs, I see at the statistics they provide on how each kid is doing and I see it in my community with the amount of well rounded youth they are providing back into the community. What a great social organization, I know I will be donating for years to come.

When I started at the Boys and Girls Clubs of Indianapolis I didn't do well in school and had trouble getting arguments. I started going when I was in 8th grade and was afraid I wouldn't make it to high school. A friend brought me along to the club one day and it changed me forever. Everyone was so nice and positive it was such a change to what I was used to. Thanks to the education help they provide I not only finished high school but also finished college. I will be starting my Master's degree in Aug and I owe it all to Boys and Girls Clubs of Indianapolis

I see kids come into the clubs and see adults leave. It is amazing the social touch points we have with these kids and what we teach them everyday at the clubs. We get talk about right from wrong, why drugs are bad and just because your parents didn't go to college doesn't mean you can't. It truly is an honor to be a part of such a wonderful group.

Not just any kids, but the kids that need it the most, they help kids that have been turned away from other places or who have been told they cant succeed. Not only does the Boys and Girls Clubs of Indianapolis take these kids in, they also provide them with the tools to be successful when they get out of the Clubs.

I am lucky to schedule speaking engagements for some of these kids and I get to witness what these kids can accomplish if they are given the chance. When you listen to the stories these kids tell and they explain how their social lives are at home or with friends, it makes you want to give every second you have to helping. Each kid has such a unique story and being able to provide each kid with opportunity or hope is an amazing feeling. I am excited to wake up every day and head to work just to help this kids and provide them with a skill set they may have not had before.

I have watched kids who seemed lost find their paths at Boys and Girls Clubs of Indianapolis. Most of these kids had been given up by their teachers and communities and had no where left to turn. Because of the work done at Boys and Girls Clubs of Indianapolis I have watched over 15 kids this past school year go from wanting or being forced to drop out to finishing high school and now looking for college opportunities. It has been such a wonderful feeling working with these kids.

Tara Treatment Center Inc	304870		/users/profile/396048	FranklinIn	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/15/2016	While I had heard of Tara, I had no idea the amazing program that existed in South Central Indiana! Having worked at a number of substance abuse treatment centers in Indiana and Illinois I have seen a variety of treatment modalities and philosophies. Tara has the very best combination of therapeutic, educational and 12 Step Support curriculum one could devise. The staff if highly professional and top-notch across the board. The location and grounds are second to none. Peaceful and serene sum it up. Wide open, rural, very spacious and a tranquil setting. A perfect place to self reflect, take a minute to gather thoughts and dreams, and find hope for the future. Tara provides a down-home setting rather than a hospital or institutional facility. The local recovery community supports Tara clients' integration into the fellowship and alumni often return to share their progress with staff and current clients. I greatly enjoy my opportunity to be a member of the Tara family and am delighted to watch the faces of our clients as the sparkle returns to their eyes, color brightens their faces and their smiles become common place. Its amazing to witness their families enjoy the weekly visits and the monthly Family Day Program where loved ones get important information about Substance Use Disorder and recovery. They get an opportunity to meet other families and begin to break down the stigma of addiction. Miracles happen every day in many places across the globe and Tara is definitely a place that miracles happen in Central Indiana!

Tara Treatment Center Inc	178454	2	/users/profile/235088	Regnewd	Client Served	5	10/17/2013	I went to Tara on June 1, 2007. I had gone to end my life the day before and accidentally left my gun at home. I was broke, hopeless, 50 lbs underweight and hadn't slept for days. My drug of choice was crack cocaine and meth, but anything that would get me high would work in a pinch. I wanted to die, my family had been called to a friends house where I had finally stopped running and just broke down. They knew enough to know that they didn't have the answers. They took me to Tara. I did not give much hope to this either. After appeasing them I could just go on and end my life. I hadn't seen my kids in a couple of weeks and figured they were better off anyway. After the assessment I hugged them and they left.   I went down to my bed and was introduced to the other clients. Next day we started groups and meetings. About a week in I felt I had made a mistake and at 2 am went to the nurses station and announced that I was cured and I was leaving. The night nurse told me to go read a chapter and then come back. That 10 minutes was all it took for that urge to pass and I stayed.    About two weeks in I walked to the top of the ramp leading out of the basement. The sky was blue, the grass was green, the barn was red and the birds were singing. It was like pealing the sticker off of a Claritin commercial. I had been wandering in a black and white fog. It was amazing. Like the big book says, a true upheaval . Two days later at family visit, my mom look into my eyes and said, "you're back. You have been so hollow for so long and I see my son again." I took to the program like I was on fire. I became group leader and realized the opportunity that I had and grabbed it with both hands. When I left Tara I took the tools that they had given me and started to live the life God intended me to live. I got a sponsor and continued to keep touch with counselors and a roommate.    That was 6 1/2 years ago. I am remarried now. I have twins sons and a good relationship with my older three kids and I love every minute of life. I still have hurdles in life and problems, but drugs and alcohol aren't a part of them.  I credit Tara and the counselors and the magic in that place with saving my life.  Jason D

Six years ago I walked out of Tara with all the tools I needed to plug into a recovery community and begin actively pursuing a new life. I was treated with compassion and respect yet they leveled with me and didn't pad the truth. The staff ranged from people with lengths of clean time and members of the local recovery community to very highly educated and talented therapists with a deep understanding of the underlying causes of addiction. I learned things there that I never even tapped into until years later. This was my third treatment experience and by far the most beneficial. To be honest I didn't necessarily agree with all their suggestions but had vowed to follow my treatment plan and I'm so grateful I did. I would never have been able to stay clean at the next two places my path led had it not been for the good habits I picked up at Tara.

Until that day Moe and Larry eere never separated from each other. Cats Haven never separated them from each other to ease adoption. They look after cats' wellbeing. My son calls Ms. Barbara and staff there "angels". I agree with him. Once you see how genuinely they care for every single cats under their care, you will plainely see it why they are "angels".  Thanks to them, I have been blessed with Moe and Larry. 
Cats Haven, Ltd	276384	2	/users/profile/366147	Janet127	Donor	5	01/12/2016	Cats Haven is a God send to these kitties that might have been put down just because they were old or had a chronic illness. The volunteers and staff here love each and every one of the cats that are here. I know this first hand because I use to be one of the volunteers and I still visit from time to time. Thanks to donations they are able to take care of all the cats needs. Barb founder of the shelter spends all her spare time making jewelry and cat toys and sells them to make more money to help the cats. She also is the one that will be up every few hours to feed orphaned kittens that were pulled from the Animal Control and saved them from being put down just because they lost their Mother.

The cats that I have had the pleasure to care for are some of the sweetest and most loving cats I've ever come into contact with. I've heard many wonderful stories of these special-needs cats being adopted by caring people. All of my time spent at Cats Haven has been very enjoyable. The effort put in by volunteers is very important to both the cats and to Barb, the woman who oversees the establishment. If you've got time on your hands and affection to give, please consider volunteering for this great place.

The shelter is clean and bright and the cats are free to roam the house (unless medically required to be caged).

Cats Haven, Ltd	141320	2	/users/profile/187611	dog_mom	Volunteer	5	11/19/2012	I've been a Cats Haven volunteer for over ten years, providing a foster home for countless kitties and helping with off-site events. I give the founder Barb and the shelter Five Stars because I can guarantee every cent that comes into the shelter goes directly to the kitties. I've worked with other small nonprofits run by people who weren't as ethical as the good folks at Cats Haven, so knowing donated funds go to the cats is very important to me. Cats Haven takes in special-needs kitties as well as seniors and vet referrals, and it makes no difference if they find homes or not . . . they are protected, cared for, and loved for the rest of their lives. Cats Haven also has a small pet food pantry for dog and cat owners both, and the shelter works closely with other local groups to help ensure that animals get what they need.

They had me set up to take stray kittens to the Noblesville Humane Society to be fixed and to have rabies shots.  At the last minute Robin changed her mind saying that she could get the shots done cheaper.  I never heard from her again.  I called and called.  I finally received a call from one of her helpers that called me an a-hole for not appreciating what they did and what they did not do.  Those pets are now deceased.  I had no job so they had to be put out and finally died as they had no shots.  This is a wealthy lady who does this as a tax shelter and has no heart and her "helpers" are nasty young ladies.
Robins Nest Of Indy Inc	275138	4	/users/profile/364710	Writer	Client Served	5	12/29/2015	I have adopted two cats from Robin's Nest adoption center at Petco on 96th Street. The first was just a kitten, about two months old. My second one was older maybe around four months. The first seemed sick so I called Robin and she met me to examine my cat and even gave me medicine for him. I then adopted my older cat from Robin as well based on how helpful she was with my first. Both of my cats are wonderful and I appreciate all that Robin's nest has done for them. After reading some of the negative review on this website I felt that I should post  how wonderful I think this agency is. It seems that reviews are mostly written when people are not happy with something. Robin's nest is a not-for-profit rescue and I am sure their resources are limited. To expect them to have all of their kittens examined for FIV and leukemia is not realistic. They also have a return policy if a cat or kitten that is adopted from them becomes sick, they will let you come in and adopt another at no charge. It is too bad that the person who had to put their cat down in the previous comments did not take the time to call Robin's nest to see what their options were. I am very impressed with this program and will recommend it to everyone who wants to adopt a cat or kitten.

We got them at an adoption event at PetCo on US 31 a few months ago. These two have fit right in to our family, they show absolutely no fear of our two large dogs and are very loving and affectionate to their human "staff" members.  Remember that when you get a pet from a rescue that they have been through a very traumatic experience and the Rescue is  counting on you, the adopter, to help ensure the pet gets the extra care they will need.

Robins Nest Of Indy Inc	233829	2	/users/profile/297791	Ashley120	Client Served	1	11/17/2014	For starters they told me the kitten I adopted was neutered, he wasn't. He was 10 weeks old, with worms and a bad upper respitory infection. When I called Robin's Nest to let them know about all the problems he was having, they never returned my call. So, I went to the adoption center to talk to them. I was told that upper respitory infections are common and kittens need to be treated for worms often. When I brought up the fact that they had said he was neutered but wasn't they told me they don't neuter kittens. After, getting him in tip top shape (all shots, to the weight he should have been) I got him neutered. Having previously fostered cats and dogs I know most rescues require you to let them know when the pet has been sterilized, RN told me they didn't need to know. Frankly, adopt from another agency $75 for an un-sterilized kitten is too much when you can get one from the pund for $20. Another red flag is when kittens are "buy one get one free". Good luck

I am very disappointed in the lack of care given to the kitten prior to being offered for adoption. This illness did not appear overnight after the adoption & the kitten should have been checked by a vet through the rescue group prior to being put up for adoption. The kitten will make a full recovery but I don't understand why this illness wasn't cared for prior to the adoption.

Robin, you are a hero, taking care of the littlest of God's creatures and helping them to find great homes. We adopted our beautiful kitten in 2010 at Speck's Pet Supply on Fox Road near Geist Reservoir, and he was in rough shape after being born a stray. Robin nursed him nearly all the way to health and gave us some medicine for his eye and ear infections. Within a few weeks he was terrific, and he's been a great addition to our family. I always try to give generously when I see Robin's Nest operating a rescue center at Speck's, PetCo, etc. We are very grateful for all she does to help the cats of Indianapolis.

In fact, after speaking to the store associate, I felt pressured to adopt that night because I was told they were to be picked up for treatment and not guaranteed to come back.  Again, no offer ever made to treat and then notify us when they were ready to adopt.   We have now paid over $500 between treatment and adoption fee for the kittens.  When I spoke to Robin, she made no attempt to alleviate some of the cost, did not offer to cover the first round of treatment or anything even though she stated that they will offer to treat a cat that obviously needs it before adopting it.  Very disappointed in the whole experience.  We love our two kittens very much and want them to be healthy.  But we are treating them for ringworm and upper respiratory...continuously after now having them for almost 6 weeks!  So watch out when considering adopting through Robins Nest of Indy through Specks Pet Supply of Geist.

She is an absolutely wonderful match for me!  Although we have not had the opportunity to do many things together, I can tell that we are going to develop a wonderful friendship that will last a very long time.  The staff of Big Brothers Big Sisters are absolutely wonderful!  They work extremely hard to ensure that strong matches are made so that both children and volunteers will have an enjoyable experience in the program.  Staff are there to provide support and advice as needed.  I have not yet had to seek the advice of my Match Support Coordinator, but am so glad to know she is going to be there when I need to.  I am so glad to be a part of this program.  Not only am I doing something good for the community, but also having a great time getting to know and do fun things with my Little Sister.  
Big Brothers-Big Sisters of East Central Indiana Inc	86803		/users/profile/97287	tracylaine123	Volunteer	5	04/22/2011	I was so proud to have teamed up with Big Brothers Big Sisters of Delaware County to put on their first annual "Dance for Kids Sake" event.  I am the owner and director of Cole Academy, the dance studio that taught the choreography and helped to put on the show.  Taryn Poti and her staff went above and beyond the expectations for this event.  The professionalism and dedication within the agency is outstanding.  Raising money is EXTREMELY hard to do in these economic times.  They thought outside the box to raise money in such a unique and different way.  The show was an amazing way to not only raise funds but to raise awareness throughout the community.  I am still getting compliments on the show.  Thank you Big Brothers Big Sisters for letting us be a part of such a special event.  I look forward to working with you all for years to come!
Big Brothers-Big Sisters of East Central Indiana Inc	86567		/users/profile/96955	Match	Volunteer	5	04/20/2011	I have been a volunteer with Big Brothers/Big Sisters for over two years and I love it! My little is the best girl ever, not just because she is funny and smart and open for all the corny ideas I come up with "hanging out" plans, but because she's pretty comfortable with who she is. She teaches me quite a bit about characteristics I need to work on for my own growth. She's awesome.We spend a lot of time doing artsy stuff, going to plays and concerts and museums. Whenever I come across something I think she'd like, I try get tickets to go. This year, we went to a few Ball State basketball games, a first for the both of us, and we had a great time. We're both up for trying new things.
Big Brothers-Big Sisters of East Central Indiana Inc	86558		/users/profile/96945	BSmitty	Volunteer	5	04/20/2011	There are far too many children in today's world that have a feeling of hopelessness.  For whatever reason, they have a lack of positive adult influence in their life.  Our children our being "raised by the streets" out of necessity, not out of want.  For some, they have no father figure or their older brother is in a gang, or their parents gave them to their grandparents at a young age.  For others, their parents are doing the best they can, but their jobs don't allow them to spend the kind of time with their children that is truly needed.  Regardless of the reason, BBBS of East Central Indiana is helping to fill a HUGE void in the life of these children.I was matched with Micah a little over 3 years ago and we have had an opportunity to grow together.  He has gone from being a shy, reserved kid with very little in the way of goals or ambition to a high school freshman with dreams of going to college on a athletic or academic scholarship.  Micah has a wonderful mother, so I can't take any of the credit for his development.  All I have done is become his friend and open his eyes to a world that he may not have otherwise had an opportunity to witness.  From there, he has blossomed.  His communication skills are so improved that one person  told me  they thought I had a different little brother after not seeing him in over a year.  They couldn't believe that he looked them in the eye and even asked return questions rather than giving a simple "yes" or "no" answer before looking at the ground.  His growth has been measurable and he knows that I am a friend for life that he can come to with any question and he will receive an honest answer or honest advice.I have also learned something about myself through our relationship.  I've learned that I can make a difference in the world.  Little things I was taught as a child became so beneficial to me later in life and not every child has an opportunity to learn these things.   I learned that I do have something to offer a kid in need and I can change the world by starting with changing his world.  If I'm going to give of my time, I want to make sure I am making a difference.  Big Brothers/Big Sisters does just that, it makes a difference in Micah's life and in turn, improves our community.
Big Brothers-Big Sisters of East Central Indiana Inc	86190		/users/profile/96387	cldevos	Volunteer	5	04/18/2011	My involvement with Big Brothers Big Sisters of Delaware County is in the form of a practicum student. As a pre-professional social worker, I came into the agency with no degree under my belt and no real-world experience with home-visits, interviews, or assessments. Despite my inexperience I was welcomed into the agency with open arms and given the opportunity to fine-tune my skills for my future profession. Not only did I get to shadow interactions, I was able to participate and faciliate these interactions. My time here has equipped me with indispensable skills and has given me the outline of the social worker that I want to be in the future: one who is dedicated and committed to her cause, on behalf of her clients.  Sometimes I feel that the hardwork and dedication of the employees often goes unnoticed or underappreciated. But I would like to give some personal thanks to each member of the BBBS team. Thanks for taking me on as a practicum student and being a great supervisor (Taryn), for being the glue that holds it all together and answering the unanswerable (Sally), for letting me hijack volunteer interviews and double-knock to ask a billion questions (Chrystal), for taking me on my first home visit and answering another billion questions (Joiceann), and for going with me on home visits and having many discussions (Megann). I am so thankful to have met all of you and will miss you all very much when I'm freezing living in Alaska! :)
Big Brothers-Big Sisters of East Central Indiana Inc	85957		/users/profile/96067	cseals	Board Member	5	04/15/2011	I am a Board member of the BBBS agency.  A favorite time for me is to attend the annual volunteer recognition program.  The stories and letters shared during the event come from the heart of the Littles and their family members about what their Big Brother or Sister means to them.  The common theme of the stories is it did not matter to the Little what special activities the Big and Little did togetherit was the fact that they had a caring individual in their lives to confide in, look up to or just hang out together.  From being involved in BBBS matched activity events over the past twelve years,  I truly enjoy seeing Littles blossom as they grew up and benefit from the one-to-one mentoring, trust and friendship with their Big.I was also a Big Sister for ten years.  I was matched with my Little Sis when she was eight and our match officially ended when she graduated from high school.  However, we will be Sisters for life and now she is the Big Sis in the height department over me.   I was matched perfectly because the agency staff does great homework in background checks, interview processes and match preferences, interests and likes.  The agency staff provides tremendous ongoing support and supervision to the Big and Little to assist in the match as it grows and thrives.

Big Brothers-Big Sisters of East Central Indiana Inc	85801		/users/profile/95841	Corey R.	Volunteer	5	04/14/2011	I recently joined the Big Brothers Big Sisters program and was matched with a 'Little' several months ago. So far, I have found the experience to be rewarding not only to my 'Little' but to myself as well. My 'little brother' belongs to a large family, with a mother who has adopted seven children. So far, all of them have been a part of the Big Brothers Big Sisters program and I can see that their whole family is grateful and benefits from it. I would recommend become a big brother or sister to anyone who wants to make a difference in a child's life, but not someone who is just looking for service hours, because the experience relies heavily on the want to develop a strong, truly caring relationship with a stranger in need. However, if up to it, I highly recommend the program.
Big Brothers-Big Sisters of East Central Indiana Inc	85758		/users/profile/95781	Jody M.	Volunteer	5	04/14/2011	I have been in the BBBS program for 9 years now and my little and I have been together for 8 years this October.  I am a Christian  and being a Big was put on my heart by the Lord.  My experiences with my little and the agency have been wonderful and even at times life changing.  My little comes from a "special needs" family so there have been some hard times for their family over the years and together we have made it through them.  The agency has been so wonderful to us and to every child that comes through their doors and I know this first hand because I have had the priviledge of working for the agency temporarily and have been involved in numerous activities, committees and fundraising events over the years.  I have seen them cry when a Big decided that they didn't want to keep the little that they had been matched with,  I have seen them spend many nights working over to make sure that an event that 20 people might show up for is "perfect", I have seen them ask for help and fight for  money to keep their doors open in a failing economy.  I have witnessed what caring about others means to the point that it takes the greater part of their lives to accomplish it.  Children need mentors, they need support and they need someone who cares.  That is what our BBBS Agency provides for the children in our community!  Thank You BBBS of Delaware County for everything that you do.  You are loved and appreciated
Big Brothers-Big Sisters of East Central Indiana Inc	85484		/users/profile/95397	RANielsen	Volunteer	5	04/13/2011	Four years ago I applied to be a volunteer with Big Brothers/Big Sisters of Delaware County because I had always been interested in helping children see and reach their potential.  From the beginning the office has been very involved in my match and being a support for me.  I know that if I ever have a question I can call and have it answered or just be given advice when I encounter a situation.  I also appreciate all the events that I am able to attend with my little.  Many of these events are experiences I am able to let her have that I might not otherwise be able to let her have.  When I applied I hoped that I would be able to make a difference in the life of another - but with the help of this organization not only have I impacted on teenage girl but she has been able to impact my life in more ways that I can list.

The arboretum is a great place to bring your dog, as it holds a very pet-friendly reputation. A variety of educational opportunities including; informative hikes, classes, and demonstrations are offered throughout the year. Also, it is home to a very noteworthy & photogenic oak tree. All in all a great place to get back in touch with nature.

Also, the model trail really surprised me with how detailed and big it was.
Taltree Arboretum and Gardens Foundation Inc	152033	1	/users/profile/203077	MuseumProf	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/03/2013	First of all, Taltree is magnificent.  If you haven't gone, you should go.  Second of all, the review component of this website exists for people who want to review a nonprofit, not an individual person. Whomever is writing some of these reviews as personal attacks to the CEO should not be so naive. People are protected by libel and defamation laws against attacks made in this manner.  If you have not verified the facts about the claims you are making, (newspaper opinions are not considered facts), you could be sued for libel.  You have better read up. Having submitted a review online, it is considered a "published" writing.  The law reads: "a defendant who publishes a false and defamatory communication about a private individual is liable to the individual if the defendant acts with actual malice (applying the standard under New York Times v. Sullivan) or acts negligently in failing to ascertain whether a statement was false or defamatory." Read up and grow up.  Those that break the law cannot hide behind a user name.

Taltree Arboretum and Gardens Foundation Inc	150117	1	/users/profile/200153	fatgirl74	General Member of the Public	5	02/26/2013	I am a bit surprised by the reviews on here. It seems some people are judging this wonderful, serene place based on information they have read about one person. I don't think it is fair to judge Taltree, as an organization, based on this. My family and I have been enjoying the Arboretum for a couple of years now. I have attended weddings, classes and several of their concerts. We all have grown very fond of the grounds, the staff and the volunteers. It is amazing that something that feels so secluded, is so close to home. My son and husband love the railway garden, while my daughter and I enjoy walking our dogs on the trails. It has been very exciting watching the Arboretum grow, and we look forward to finding something new every time we go!

Having green space in NW Indiana is very important to my family and me, and having been an Indiana resident for several years now, it is nice to see local organizations striving to conserve the land around them.  I lead hikes on occasion and cannot wait until spring when the wildflowers come back.  If you get a chance, go hike the Bluebird Trail and stop at the Savanna Wetland.  There are two swans there.  If you do not have much time, the train garden is a must see.  You will feel like a kid again :).  
Indiana Parkinson Foundation	323440		/users/profile/417782	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	02/19/2017	The Climb is very important for the improved support system of those living with Parkinson's disease, both for them and their families and caregivers. It extends beyond to benefit the larger community as well. We all suffer from this together and the mutual support is essential for a hopeful, faithful living on the way to a cure. I love this support system of caring and I am glad there is not much boxing. Even though boxing is good fitness training and may help relieve stress and anger it is originalLy designed for breaking down the  body of another person. Because of this fondational purpose for boxing it is not as inspiring for the larger purpose of building up the body, both of the person and the community. I feel great gratitude that we have found another path for creating a community and faith to encounter this disease and to slow progression.

Indiana Parkinson Foundation	319379		/users/profile/410829	Thankful.Caregiver	Client Served	5	11/23/2016	My husband was diagnosed with Parkinson's in the spring of 2016.  His neurologist recommended the CLIMB, and he started going two days/week, immediately after his diagnosis.  He felt remarkable improvement to his mobility within the first month, and has said to me that the benefits go beyond the physical.   He is encouraged when he goes to the CLIMB, has made friends with others who understand what he is going through and they offer each other encouragement on a regular basis.   The therapists are very knowledgeable in their field and go above and beyond to help each individual.  They are very encouraging to each participant.  They make the exercise challenging but also rewarding because they make it "doable" for all who participate.  They meet the individual where they are in the disease and help them at their level.  I have seen a great change in my husband since the beginning of this journey and going to the CLIMB -- all very, very good and positive.   The Indiana Parkinson Foundation truly cares about those with this disease, as well as the caregivers.  They offer monthly support groups for caregivers, focusing on specific topics each time.  They are faith-based, and share their faith with others at the end of each exercise session with a brief devotion and prayer.  Those who participate receive not only physical help, but emotional and spiritual encouragement as well. The Indiana Parkinson Foundation turns no one away.  They do charge a fee for participating, but it is only a fraction of the actual cost of running the program and providing the professionals who are passionate about helping those with this disease.  They rely on donations and funds raised through fundraiser activities, such at The MOVE Race each year, for the balance of what is needed to meet their expenses and improve the programming. I highly recommend anyone with Parkinson's to give the CLIMB a chance.  I also would encourage anyone who has a desire to donate their time in volunteering their services, or making a monetary donation to a very worthy cause to consider the Indiana Parkinson Foundation.

Indiana Parkinson Foundation	318564		/users/profile/409769	Writer	Client Served	5	11/08/2016	" Scientific research has shown that exercise is a key factor in delaying the progression of Parkinson's Disease. There are several institutions that provide opportunities for people to exercise, but very few focus exclusively on people with Parkinson's disease.What separates the Indiana Parkinson's Foundation ( The Climb) from large commercial groups such as the YMCA, LA Fitness, Lifetime Fitness is the quality and dedication of the trainers. Many of the trainers have college degrees in Occupational Therapy, Physical Therapy and Speech and Hearing. Others have certifications in fitness, posture and yoga. All continue to get advanced training well as training others. The Indiana Parkinson's Foundation ( The Climb) provides much more than group exercise because each person receives an individual evaluation which is updated on a regular basis. Another component is the support group activities which are both social and educational. In addition there is a spiritual component that occurs on a weekly basis.In the final analysis, what separates the Indiana Parkinson's Foundation ( The Climb) from others is the quality and dedication of the trainers."

First, there is an instant bond with other folks who are struggling with Parkinson's Disease.  Second, the trainers are exceptional.  With a diverse group of people in a variety of stages of the disease, the trainers are excellent at modifying and also challenging the participants.  Choosing to move is a phrase we are all familiar with and a necessary part of dealing with Parkinson's. Finally, on a personal level ....Exercising had never been important to me, so when I started going to The Climb I just wasn't sure I wanted to commit.  It wasn't long before I looked forward to attending and challenging myself to try things I'd never done before.  Last September I ran my first 5k.  It was the encouragement of the trainers and fellow PWPs (people with Parkinson's) that kept me training for that event.  What a privilege and honor it is to be able to go to a place where you are accepted, can share and learn from others, and work to improve your physical health and be the best you can be!  I love this place!  The ClimbDeb

My experience at TLC was life-changing.  Camp is definitely for the campers, but God works in the staff's hearts as well.  God taught me so much about who I am in Him and how to continually rely on His grace to carry me through.  TLC uses experiential learning to teach spiritual truths, so campers have fun with the activities (high & low ropes course, paintball, octaball, water slide, swimming, canoeing/paddle boating, group games, and many more!) while still focusing on God's Word.  Campers build relationships with each other and with their counselors.  Most importantly, they have the opportunity to get away from the business of life, so they can truly concentrate on their relationship with Christ.  I absolutely loved the opportunity to be both a camper and a counselor at Twin Lakes Camp, and I will remember those experiences and hold onto those friendships for a long time.

This camp not only provides fun and life-changing experiences for campers, but it gives true purpose in everything by glorifying the name of Jesus Christ.  Campers are challenged physically through the ropes courses and other activities, but also challenged mentally and spiritually through various activities throughout the day.  Every week at TLC is fruitful and impacts not only campers, but the staff as well.  I would highly recommend TLC to anyone!

I plan on applying to be a counselor when I am in college! Although I have not attended any of the other camps, I'm sure that they all are equally as incredible as this one!

Indiana Center for Middle East Peace	257697	4	/users/profile/346156	Writer	Donor	5	09/16/2015	This organization is doing wonderful things in the community to help foster peace and understanding between different cultures. The trip we took to Israel and Palestine this summer, hosted by Dr. Michael Spath, was an amazing experience. We met many wonderful people who are trying to erase hate and show love while pushing for justice.

Indiana Center for Middle East Peace	253387	3	/users/profile/341571	Salam	Volunteer	5	08/19/2015	The ICMEP helps tell the other side (or the rest) of the story.  I know it is not easy doing what they do.  My only hope is that the Center will continue to grow and perform its valuable service. 
Indiana Center for Middle East Peace	232608	7	/users/profile/296155	Amar A.	General Member of the Public	5	11/02/2014	The ICMEP brings the undertook story of the Palestinian to Fort Wayne! It is an oasis in the Midwest.
Indiana Center for Middle East Peace	227420	9	/users/profile/291150	ejwc612	General Member of the Public	5	10/27/2014	The Indiana Center for Middle East Peace is doing a wonderful job promoting peace and justice by educating the public on issues related to problems in the Middle East. They provide guest speakers, who are experts, to share their knowledge and conduct tours so that people can better understand the situation in Palestine. I have attended many meetings and have been very impressed with the topics and professionalism of the guest speakers. Adequate time is always arranged so that the audience can ask questions or interact with the guest after the talk. 
Indiana Center for Middle East Peace	219423	9	/users/profile/283041	SonyaSue	General Member of the Public	5	10/02/2014	The educational programs that the ICMEP brings to this area have helped me learn about the struggles of the Palestinian people with this on-going crisis.   It's refreshing to see a local organization stand up for an oppressed people with dignity and respect.
Indiana Center for Middle East Peace	213972	9	/users/profile/277187	Salaam	Board Member	5	09/08/2014	The Indiana Center for Middle East Peace offers a wide range of programs and opportunities related to that troubled part of the world.

Indiana Center for Middle East Peace	188785	2	/users/profile/246389	Norvil	General Member of the Public	1	11/18/2013	ICMEPs  Mission Statement is: We promote justice, peace, and human rights locally and globally through education, the arts, intercultural dialogue and resource sharing. In contrast both to its name and recently revised mission statement, the organization now primarily provides ANTI-ISRAEL, ANTI-ZIONIST and subtle ANTI-SEMITIC programming in association with, and financially supported by regional/national organizations that have similar objectives.  Most recently among those being "Jewish Voice for Peace"  "The Rachel Corrie Foundation."
Autism Society of Indiana	290181	1	/users/profile/380467	dylanmom123,	Client Served	5	05/17/2016	As a Special Needs Advocate that is moving to Indiana, I was struck at how amazing ASI volunteers and "Ally's" are . I was given so much help and information talking to Mary Roth, Carmel, IN. It really helped to relieve my anxiety and stress with the upcoming move to a new city with my Autistic son Dylan that is graduating from High School. She gave me so much hope that there IS help and resources out there in my new community. I can't wait to get settled  so I can support ASI the way they have supported my family. 
Autism Society of Indiana	291716		/users/profile/382165	GrumpyGuy	General Member of the Public	5	06/01/2016	I never heard of Asperger's until my son was diagnosed.  I had a lot of questions and nowhere to turn for answers. ASI was instrumental in helping me get information and answers. We would've never made it to where we are today without knowing they were there if we needed information. These are people that care about our loved ones like nobody else.  It's nice to know that there are still people in this world that want to help folks like us. They make you feel like extended family and that's pretty special.  I'm not an extraordinary person a celebrity, or famous athlete. I'm just a regular guy with a child on the spectrum. If you need anything related to autism, ASI is the place to turn to. 
Autism Society of Indiana	147922		/users/profile/195751	Tim W.	General Member of the Public	5	01/10/2013	Incredible, dynamic organization and leadership. My agency has benefited tremendously from our partnership.
Autism Society of Indiana	147874	1	/users/profile/195632	Mark1966	Volunteer	5	01/09/2013	The cornerstone of ASI - it's most visible, direct way that it helps families -- is the Allies program.  As a part-time volunteer, I have seen from the inside how this program works, and how many people ASI helps.  There are allies around the state, helping families deal with the diagnosis of a child, a school district, finding a good speech therapist, the right approach to help a child socialize, find employment -- you name it.  The Allies program is amazing because each Ally is a parent of a child with autism, so they have been there.  But they also must pledge to be neutral, to share advice but to also make families aware of various options for a given type of service or support, even thought they may have their biases.   It is these criteria -- that the Allies are parents affected and that they pledge to share unbiased information -- that makes this organization incredible.  Oh, and the fact that there is no charge for families!
Autism Society of Indiana	147862		/users/profile/195642	fuzzy	General Member of the Public	5	01/08/2013	Our 9 year old daughter has aspergers. With little family to assist us, we looked for others going through what we were, but found no local groups. When ASI assisted in setting up a support group in our county we were excited. This group is what we spent 5 years looking for. It gives the members access to proffessional help and products they need, but just as important , it gives  us others to talk to that understand what life with autism is like. In just 6 months ASI has brought 14 families together that otherwise might never have met. I support ASI totally and hope you will too. 
Autism Society of Indiana	147800		/users/profile/195558	Joshua11	Board Member	5	01/08/2013	I am not personally affected by Autism in my life.  However, about 5 years ago I met the executive director whom inspired me with her passion and conviction.  I strated volunteering and then slowly become more involved.  I was asked to be on the board, then treasurer and now serve as the current executive board president.  The amount of good this organization does is absoultely amazing.  We are very proud that 100% of the funds we raise stay in Indiana to support the local communitites.  You can have all the awards and commercials, but nothing is more satisfying then seeing the families say "THANK YOU" to our allies.  Keep up the incredible work everyone!!!
Autism Society of Indiana	147779		/users/profile/195532	Melissa120	Board Member	5	01/07/2013	I started working with this organization several years ago and I have been amazed at how much it has accomplished. This organization helps fill a tremendous need in Indiana's autism community. The staff are hard-working, fantastic people with amazing vision. 
Autism Society of Indiana	147749		/users/profile/195485	ruby13	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/07/2013	The work that Autism Society of Indiana does is incredible. Hundreds of families receive personal attention every year from the Ally in their area. In addition, ASI also trains over 1000 people per year - parents, professionals, members of the public, and so on - in the basics of autism and how to best communication with people with autism. The Expos are a great way for families to connect with service providers and support groups in their area. And, the Autism Resource Network of Indiana, or ARNI, is a huge online database of events, providers, and other information related to autism. 
Autism Society of Indiana	147748		/users/profile/195483	yamelaine	Client Served	5	01/07/2013	My grandson has autism.  It was caught when he was three.  He's now nine.  I am certain that without the guidance of the director and staff of the ASI, he would not be as fully functioning as he now is.  ASI provided guidance in the areas of methodologies and resources.  He's in the fourth grade and performs above grade level.  
Autism Society of Indiana	147742		/users/profile/195480	DKDWN	Board Member	5	01/07/2013	This organization is amazing!  It continues to help families by providing them with information and supports they need to help and make their lives easier.
Aurora Inc	58027	3	/users/profile/61595	brem	General Member of the Public	5	11/29/2010	I was looking for an organization to make a donation to for the Christmas Season.   I was thrilled to find Aurora!   This organization is one I wanted to introduce my children to.   One who makes a difference in the lives of those who need need help.  I'm very touched by the compassion that is Aurora.
Aurora Inc	57651	3	/users/profile/61009	gaustin	Professional with expertise in this field	4	11/23/2010	As a clinical Social Worker working along side of Aurora Staff, I have been in awe of their compassion, dedication, and willingness to serve others. Gary
Aurora Inc	57636	1	/users/profile/60987	babber46	Volunteer	5	11/22/2010	Naila is an incredible individual...not only does she care about and help the homeless, but she  makes connections with so many other programs that can perhaps prevent homelessness in the first place...ideal, don't you  think??
Aurora Inc	57607	1	/users/profile/60948	angnic	Volunteer	5	11/22/2010	Aurora is comprised of caring people who truly care about our community. I commend this organization for their services and their dedication. We need more people like this.
Aurora Inc	23124	1	/users/profile/24191	SJKaho	Board Member	5	11/30/2009	I have been involved with Aurora as a board member for several years. The staff and leadership have a passion to end homelessnes in our community and are working a plan to do it in ten years!Caring, skilled staff work daily with the population to build relationships and coordinate efforts to serve this population that is misunderstood and that society tries to forget.
Aurora Inc	22949	1	/users/profile/23984	Jamie	Board Member	5	11/23/2009	Aurora is a valuable link in Vanderburgh County. People and services are linked together by Aurora with the homeless. Aurora helps people find connections but also reaches with direct connections like starter kits. We also provide the funding mechanism for projects to happen with the federal government.
Aurora Inc	22876	1	/users/profile/23891	pjdemo718	Board Member	5	11/19/2009	Aurora does far more than provide direct services to Evansville's homeless population. It is the thought leader in our community regarding the strategies we need to end homelessness. In its role as the lead organization for our ten-year plan to end homelessness, it has stepped out and taken on additional responsibilities as opportunities have arisen. The latest is serving as the fiscal agent and manager of the prevention grant Evansville recieved through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. This is an outstanding organization with vision and the willingness to do whatever it takes to serve people and build a community infrastructure that will prevent and end homelessness.
Aurora Inc	22851	1	/users/profile/23862	lvaurora	Board Member	5	11/18/2009	Aurora is an organization which is vital to our community.  Aurora is the lead referral agency in providing homeless outreach services, and is playing an instrumental role in implementing the 10 year plan to end homelessness in our community.  In this role, Aurora has taken on additional responsibilities; the employees have worked tirelessly to achieve this vision.Aurora also works to increase community awareness.  They recently sponsored a viewing of the movie "Where God Left His Shoes" which is a very realistic representation of the challenges homeless families face.
Aurora Inc	22745	1	/users/profile/23750	graduate1970	Volunteer	5	11/16/2009	Aurora does a wonderful outreach program to those who are homeless, supplying them on a weekly basis with food, life's necessities, and consultation on their health.  They also have a program from client's who are to be housed so that they are prepared for what is ahead.  The staff there has been outstanding in welcoming young adult volunteers and educating them on homelessness while encouraging them to assist as they can.  The staff at Aurora has networked with local universities to pick up and sort through furniture, clothing, and household items that students wish to leave behind at the end of a school year.  This group has also been active in beginning program to end homeless in Evansville with the help of the local residents, government, and agencies that do outreach.
American Legion Auxiliary- Nationwide	34059	1	/users/profile/34875	marty-unit-44	Volunteer	5	03/27/2010	My name is Marty Novak.  I am an 11 year member of Unit 44 in Elephant Butte, NM.  At the time I joined I had no idea of what the American Legion Auxiliary was all about.  I am so proud to be a member of this great organization...and of my own Unit.  Our Unit 44 is located in a small community in southern NM.  Our members are caring, giving ladies who willingly volunteer their time and talents to serve our community, Veterans, residents of the NM Veterans Home and support the state and national programs of the American Legion Auxiliary.  We also have 1 special program of which we are very proud.  In September, 2003 we began our Care Packages to the Troops project.  We began with the names of 7 local men and women with the intention of sending them Care Packages each month during their entire deployment.  Our list has grown over the years to a high of 98 and currently about 60 a month. To date we have sent out over 4500 Care Packages. The community has now gotten involved.  Local organizations and individuals regularly give us cash donations, Memorials, and supplies for the packages.  We have enlisted the school children to write letters, draw pictures, and make Christmas and Valentine cards.  One school contributes letters and art work each month and periodically collects toiletries and goodies in their classroom to add to the boxes.  Winter visitors, members of our American Legion Family, and even non members show up to help on packing day.  It seems that everyone wants to help out.  I think we all feel that this is SOMETHING we can do to help these brave men and women who are sacrificing so much for us.
American Legion Auxiliary- Nationwide	33953	6	/users/profile/34770	evelyn1	Volunteer	5	03/25/2010	I am a 40 year member of the American Legion Auxiliary.  I have been involved with volunteering and working with veterans for the past 37 years of my membership; and I never fail to be amazed at how much each veteran seems to appreciate everything you do for them.  I feel that I am privileged to do some small part in making their recovery time and stay in the hospital just a little more pleasant.  After all, I am indebted to them for their service to our Country and helping to keep us a free nation.
American Legion Auxiliary- Nationwide	33691	8	/users/profile/34507	nancy12	Volunteer	4	03/22/2010	I am a member of the Florence, Kentucky Boone Post 4 Ladies Legion Auxiliary.  I am a relatively new member and am overwhelmed by the amount of good work and support that the ladies provide the community and veterans.  These ladies have lifes to live, families to care for, but still find the time to donate their time, talent, money, and compassion to help the world be a better for all.  While working towards a common goal they have fun, meet new people, and learn new skills.  While working on a fundraiser, our team realized that there is no "I" in team and worked together for great results.  The Auxiliary is the heart and soul of the American Legion.
American Legion Auxiliary- Nationwide	33638	9	/users/profile/34451	susan22	Professional with expertise in this field	5	03/21/2010	My name is Carol Lainhart and I have been a member of Unit 67 Versailles Ky for 16 years and my experience with the ladies auxiliary has been a blessing. I have had the opportunity to work with other units threw the district and department level and learned what the auxiliary was about and how we help our veterans,their families and communities through our different programs.To volunteer in the VA Hospital and bring a smile on a vets face. To reach a goal we set to help our fellow soldiers over seas fighting for our country.And it so much more than that, We work with our youth and teach them government values, history, and about legislation through our girls state program. There is scholarship for nursing,we are alway pushing our young girls to be the best that they can be.  I can not begin to tell you how proud I am to be a part of such an organization. I encourage everyone who is eligible to get involved, you will have the opportunity of a lifetime.
American Legion Auxiliary- Nationwide	33573	1	/users/profile/34374	theresa-price	Volunteer	5	03/19/2010	I am currently a member of Unit 16, London, KY American Legion Auxiliary.  I have been a member for over 2 years, and in that short time frame, I have witnessed and taken part in many activities that have supported our veterans and their families and communities, locally and worldwide. As a state, we have a lot of activities that help veterans and military personnel( as well as their families) bridge a gap where most times, they might not be able to get help from other organizations.  I am happy and proud to be a member of this organization and feel that the things that we do to help support our veterans is trivial as compared to the service that they have done for us and our country
American Legion Auxiliary- Nationwide	33564	4	/users/profile/34364	karensue5	General Member of the Public	5	03/19/2010	My name is Sue Arvin and I have been a member of ALA Post 41 in Carrollton, Ky for 9 years.  Last year our post hosted a ceremony honoring the Korean War Veterans and presenting them with a commemorative medal.  It was wonderful to see the volunteer time that was put into this by our members and our community.  We had many city officials in attendance and it was heartwarming to know that the whole community has a very patriotic spirit and took the time to thank these wonderful veterans for their service.  The ALA puts in many hours every year to help veterans and their families, and I am very proud to be a member of this organization.
American Legion Auxiliary- Nationwide	33548	3	/users/profile/34342	dianneunit15	Volunteer	5	03/18/2010	My name is Dianne McClung. I have been a member of the American Legion Auxiliary, Department of West Virginia, and Parkersburg Unit #15.  Thirty five years ago I married a veteran that was the Commander of Post 15.  Before that I had no involvement in the Legion or Auxiliary and had no experience with them.  Boy, did my life change.In addition to being employed all those years, I considered myself a full-time volunteer.  I continue my involvement into my retirement years.I am a very patriotic person and the Americanism and Veterans Affairs and Rehabiliation programs appealed to me.  The ALA is the largest women patriotic organization in the United States.  Many dollars and hours have been spent to show our pride in our country.  Children and Youth programs support Girls State that teach young ladies city, county and state government during a week long session.  Over 350 high school junior girls attend our Girls State.  Two girls are chosen to represent WV and go to DC in July to learn and participate in Senate activities.  I have served over 15 years on Rhododendron Girls State staff.  These girls also are taught how our organization supports veterans and why they should be proud of those serving our country.  Our Unit members volunteer at our local VA clinic and coordinate the volunteers.  I could go on and on but as you can see,the American Legion Auxiliary continues to support our current servicepersonnel and those who have served.  Ninty years of service!!!
American Legion Auxiliary- Nationwide	32580	1	/users/profile/33401	buddy929	Volunteer	5	03/05/2010	My name is Pat Wanoreck from Fort Worth, Texas and have been a member of the American Legion Auxiliary for 36 years.  I originally joined for the social activities, received the monthly newsletter and all of my friends were listed as workers in the kitchen, bingo etc.  Well I was never asked to help in any way so the second year did not renew my membership.  So I received a phone call about paying my dues for the second year and I told the lady that I guessed they did not need me because I was never asked to do anything.  Hmmm   from that day forward I was involved in everything going on and became an officer the 3rd year and have been an officer within my Unit every year since.  Everything from Historian, Treasurer, Parliamentarian, Vice President and President several times off and on over these many years.  Then I got involved in the District and Division activities, became an officer on both levels, eventually becoming President of both District and Division.  Of course Department level came next and after serving on many committees became Department President in 1997-1998.  Well that led to serving on the National level as NEC and some committees.I thoroughly believe in the programs of our organization especially serving the veterans at our local Outpatient Clinic and VAMC.  I have also volunteered in school activities within my community.But the very best part of my membership is the travel and the many friends throughout the country.  Every National event is filled with warm hellos and hugs from these friends.  I call the travel and the friends a fringe benefit of membership in our great organization.
HomesteadCS	287921		/users/profile/378088	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	05/02/2016	A wonderful organization with wonderful counselors and employees - all for a great cause. HomesteadCS continues to make the Tippecanoe county area and surrounding counties a better place to live with the programs and opportunities they offer.
HomesteadCS	187763		/users/profile/244848	Charissa10	Volunteer	5	11/04/2013	Homestead CS not only helps people save their own home, but also the neighborhoods and community. They are a great non profit that has wonderful staff that go above and beyond when working with clients or on fundraisers.
HomesteadCS	186069		/users/profile/243053	James105	Volunteer	5	10/30/2013	I met the people of Homestead consulting while helping with one of their fund raiser.  After getting to know Marie Morse and Joe Kellogg they gave me information about several programs that would help my family and I through our (then) situation.   Homestead helped my wife and I through the Hoosier hardest hit fund enrollment process.   Joe Kellogg as well as the rest of the staff were simply great to work with and extremely helpful during the process.
HomesteadCS	183381		/users/profile/240292	amy.davis6	Volunteer	5	10/28/2013	Homestead CS provides critical services in the community to homeowners who are at risk of losing their homes and to potential home buyers which helps them be responsible and successful homeowners. This organization is committed to keeping people in their homes and works tirelessly to make this happen. The staff is friendly and hardworking.  We are fortunate to have an organization such as this in our community!
HomesteadCS	181300		/users/profile/238022	Sharon96	Professional with expertise in this field	4	10/23/2013	Having a client who was in need of help to save their home we gave them the contacts for Homestead Consulting.  Joe Kellogg and the organization was able to guide them and help them to save their home. This is a success story not only for the client but for the entire community as all win when a foreclosure is avoided. property values are maintained and financial institutions are able survive.    This is a great organization and I wish more people were aware they were out there to help.
HomesteadCS	181054		/users/profile/237765	Larry32	Board Member	5	10/22/2013	It is a shame that many people in trouble with their house payments due to layoffs or job changes, etc., do not know that there may be help for them.  By calling Homestead CS people can understand what options are available to help them.
HomesteadCS	181053		/users/profile/237764	Kathy139	Board Member	5	10/22/2013	As a board member for Homestead CS, I get a first hand look at all of the great things they have been doing in the Greater Lafayette Area to save homes for clients, learn money saving skills, obtain affordable lending and just being there to see people through rough times has been amazing. I believed in this organization and the work they were doing so when I was asked to serve on the board, I didn't hesitate. They are a great organization doing great work.
South Shore Dance Alliance Inc	80865		/users/profile/88285	Racquel	Volunteer	5	03/01/2011	SSDA is one of the best pre-professional companies I have ever witnessed.  You can see all of the passion in everyone's eyes. It is very easy to see that all of the kids and adults enjoy what they do.  I had the privilege of seeing SSDA perform at the event Leap into the Arts last year.  They took the stage by storm and left me wanting more.  They definitely deserve every positive reward coming there way.
South Shore Dance Alliance Inc	80359		/users/profile/87725	Loleta	Volunteer	4	02/28/2011	I have two children that attend South Shore Dance  Alliance and I am truly impressed with the commitment level of the staff and students. South Shore fosters an environment of excellence and it is evident in their perfomances. I have watched many of the students blossom into wonderful dancers but the training also prepares them to be diciplined in other areas. Great experience overall!
South Shore Dance Alliance Inc	79105		/users/profile/86406	nina	Board Member	5	02/27/2011	My name is Nina Arzumanian and I am a parent of  three children who attend South Shore Dance Alliance.  I am also a board member as a representative of SSDA's parents. My experiences with SSDA start about 3 years ago as an observer of one of the summer intensive programs which was held at a local health club in my home town.  My daughter was currently enrolled in a local dance school but we were not satisfied with the program.  As I was leaving the health club one day I stopped to watch the summer program and was so amazed at the talent of the teachers and what the children were learning.  Having not taken dance myself I was not an expert on dance but I knew there was something missing in the current program she was in.  After watching the SSDA program quit a few times on my visits to the health club througout the summer I was convinced that this was where we should be.  My daughters vision for what she wanted from dance was the deciding factor. We currently live in Munster, Indiana and drive to Miller four times a week.  This a huge time commitment but worth every minute!!  We joined SSDA in August of '09 and I can' even begin to detail all the wonderful things that we have done and all that Ani and now my other daughter have learned and experienced in the past year and a half.  We have performed in so many venues and have been taught by the best instructors.   These instructors are local as well as  from Chicago and New York.  One is currently a Chicago Luvabull. The fact that they have been able to perform in so many locations has been such a wonderful experience for them.  It has improved not only their dance but has built up their confidence in so many areas.  SSDA has not only provided great dance instruction but it has also provided a positive social atmosphere for our family.   We are very happy with our decision to join and couldn't imagine ourselves in another location.     
South Shore Dance Alliance Inc	79099		/users/profile/86398	Roger J.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/27/2011	I have been affiliated with SSDA for 3 wonderful years. SSDA is currently filling a huge void in the artistic and educational lives of the the children of Gary, IN.  I am honored and humbled to be an instructor, mentor, advisor and choreographer for SSDA. 
South Shore Dance Alliance Inc	78993		/users/profile/86291	Nancy S.	Volunteer	5	02/27/2011	I have been involved with SSDA on a nearly daily basis for the last two or three years. This is an organization that reminds you of all the good things that are in this world. The dancers, the volunteers, the teachers--it's an extremely positive environment in a world--and a city-- that's had its share of negativity. The work that we do for this place is such an integral part of what makes life fulfilling and worthwhile.
South Shore Dance Alliance Inc	64617		/users/profile/70657	Patricia Meyers- Caudle	Volunteer	5	02/08/2011	I think that the SSDA is a great place for kids to learn how to express themselves. They learn about their self worth and ethics, how to work together. They learn that hard work will get you where you want to go. It is a place for kids to go and know that they are nuroised through thier mind, body and soul. SSDA can make a childs whole world change to know that they are important.  You can have the worst day and watch these kids dance and nothing else matters.  The Artistic Director truly loves all these kids and makes them all feel special. He works very hard to get them to where they want  to go and encourges them. The program itself is incredible and I am very proud to say that I have gotten to be part of this experience. 
South Shore Dance Alliance Inc	63990		/users/profile/69950	sarasvatisings	Volunteer	5	02/06/2011	At a time when the arts are desperately in danger of disappearing from our public schools SSDA provides an environment in which our community's younger citizens can come to learn.  I have had the opportunity to work with some of the students in a completely improvisational setting and saw that they were confident, disciplined and talented - unafraid to 'leap' into spontaneous movement.   The students are well supported by staff, parents and community members.  Although I realize this sounds like all honey and no vinegar however I am truly proud to support an organization that asks students to strive to be more as individuals not just as artists.  SSDA is such a gift to us all.
Ays Inc	53365		/users/profile/54484	p2	Board Member	5	09/25/2010	As an elementary principal, I saw the need for after school programs and housed them at our school. I was always so impressed that the director never gave up with all the challenges not only at my school but in all the distrcts and schools she tried to cover. The demand on her time continues to be overwhelming. Fortunately, she can deligate and the people that volunteer and work for her donate much of their time and energies to keep the programs going. There were teachers who didn't want to be bothered with the program, administrators seeing it as another load to carry, difficulty with having to always move equipment around, shortage of supplies and coping with very diversified programs were a few of the many challenges. The founding managing director has kept up the struggle to maintain her vision for 30 years.
Ays Inc	51952	2	/users/profile/52737	cmr1	Volunteer	4	09/07/2010	AYS, Inc. has served families and children of our community for 30 years.   As a partner with many school systems, AYS provides safe and quality before and after school programs to many children.  AYS also offers several early childhood programs.  As part of the technology project, I visited AYS summer programs in Noblesville.  I was very impressed by the activities for the children and the staff interaction and commitment.
Ays Inc	51941	1	/users/profile/52721	krt	Former Volunteer	5	09/07/2010	My years of volunteer work for AYS were very rewarding.  The needs of the children always come first in this organization. When I think of AYS I think of quality, excellence and consistancy.
Ays Inc	51924	2	/users/profile/52704	h16	Client Served	5	09/07/2010	My child was part of this amazing program at the school where I work.  I cannot say enough good things about this program and all that it offers to the young people that can attend either before, after or during school hours. They follow a curriculum that allows for students at all levels to find success.  Children are given choices, and have hands-on activities often within the day.  All of these things make for a positive environment in which children are comfortable trying new things and will certainly grow! I especially liked the multi-cultural lessons mixed in throughout the year.
Ays Inc	51903	2	/users/profile/52692	tam2	Client Served	5	09/07/2010	AYS before and after school service was a blessing to me as a single parent who needed to work to provide for my daughter. I was more at ease at my job knowing my daughter was in a safe environment before and after school while I worked. The staff at AYS was a god sent to both of us.  They were so thoughtful and cared about my daughter's feelings and helped with her self-esteem and setting her goals.  AYS is an amazing service and my daughter and I are very thankful this service was available at her school.

Absent the involvement of AYS, I fear our children would be left without service.
Outreach Inc	208055		/users/profile/270742	rsclark44	Board Member	5	07/31/2014	I have had been involved with many nonprofit organizations in a variety of roles over the last 40+ years. The staff of Outreach are among the most professional I have ever seen. But while they are consummate pros, they never lose sight of the young people they serve as people. It is an impressive balance. In addition to an outstanding staff, this is an organization with a mission aimed at one of the more significant social issues of our day: adolescent homelessness. I was drawn into this ministry when I saw how effective they were in meeting real needs and making a significant difference but I could also see in the gratitude in the eyes of these young people.
Outreach Inc	192775		/users/profile/251743	Latoyaa	Board Member	5	01/18/2014	I came to Outreach when I was 17 years old lost and confused about life. I didn't believe I had dreams or a future... until Outreach saved me. I honestly don't believe i would be where i am today in life if it wasn't for the amazing group at Outreach. They encouraged, pushed, and believed in me when I didn't. I wouldn't have made it through high school if it hadn't been for Outreach. I am now studying Social Work , a full time preschool teacher , a member of Kingsway Christian Church and most importantly a member of the board serving and helping change the lives of our youth. Outreach is truthfully life changing!! 
Outreach Inc	94520		/users/profile/109333	uottocus	General Member of the Public	5	07/27/2011	I feel the Outreach programs are an essential benefit in our city. Many of the youth served have gone on to become valuable community citizens thanks to the loving care and guidance provided by Outreach.
Outreach Inc	94487	1	/users/profile/109280	Bruce	Volunteer	5	07/27/2011	I had the pleasure of creating a video to tell more folks about the great work Outreach INC does in our community. Outreach serves homeless young people in Indianapolis with food, guidance with in the system and a lot of love. Hosting "drop ins" twice a week for homeless teens to get a good meal and socialize in a safe place. They also take to the streets to find homeless youth that don't know their is hope and help available to them.I am particularly proud of how many of the Outreach kids actually graduate from high school and go on to college!  Many of these have a ton of potential, but need someone to believe in them!
Outreach Inc	94479		/users/profile/109271	DSC1	Donor	5	07/27/2011	Outreach, Inc. is one of the non-profit organizations Dealer Service Corporation proudly supports. From sock, mitten & hat collections to food drives DSC has found Outreach, Inc. to be supportive, interactive, and grateful. Eric Howard has set the tone for corporations to come along side and assist Outreach in creative ways. Penny wars being one of our favorite fund raisers for Outreach.   Many of our co-workers view donating to Outreach as the most fulfilling projects they engage in during the year.  We love how Outreach keeps in touch by telling stories of how the lives of teens have been propelled in a positive direction.  Yet, never pressuring us to give solely to them. "Awakening, Stories of Hope" has brought us encouragement, laughter & tears through the stories of changed teens.  
Outreach Inc	94467		/users/profile/109255	Jayne Thorne	Advisor	4	07/27/2011	Our large UMC partners with Outreach, Inc. by providing volunteers and financial support.

We see results by attending the annual graduation party and know that we had a part in making it happen.
Outreach Inc	94459		/users/profile/109245	Sam Luppino	Donor	4	07/27/2011	My name is Sam Luppino and I would like to add my review and to let you know why my family believes so much in the work and mission of Outreach, Inc. (so much so that my wife is now a staff member of the ministry). Unfortunately when I was a teenager Outreach did not exist and I could have used its help in my own personal life.  I experienced abuse and homelessness as a youth and know the pain and suffering, the anger and resentment, the lasting scars of abuse and abandonment.  I also now know the grace of God, salvation of Christ, and love of a real family.  It was through the support of caring people who were willing to invest time, and love in my life that helped me to find the right path and to turn my life from that of hopelessness to hope for a better future here on earth, and with Christ an everlasting, eternal life when my time here is done.  I also know from personal volunteer participation that same thing is happening with the youth of Outreach.  The staff provide services, programs, counseling, and trusted relationship to youth who are broken-hearted, aimless, depressed, jobless, without the proper life skills to "grow up well."   They do everything they can to teach needed skills to help youth become self-sufficient, and to instill truth of God's word, and promise of salvation through Christ. 
Bauer Family Resources	184078	2	/users/profile/241017	Jim Bien	Board Member	5	10/29/2013	As a pediatrician, father, school volunteer, husband of a teacher, and 14-year community member, I have observed multiple benefits brought to the children and families of Tippecanoe County through the services of Bauer Family Resources.  The significant support and developmental impact enabled by its Early Head Start and Head Start programs are felt by many.  Counseling and support services for the most vulnerable in our community are provided with professionalism and compassion.  The involvement and connections encouraged by the Community Center's programing and youth initiatives are ever-evolving and impactful.  The newly developed Celebrate Youth! recognition event engages schools, other agencies, and the entire adult community in appreciating the strengths to be found within the youth of our community - and then holds them up to all with pride.  Bauer has a long history of making a difference for families in multiple ways, it is a vital resource for many and a contributor to what makes the Greater Lafayette area a wonderful community for all. 
Bauer Family Resources	183809	1	/users/profile/240725	TravisGilmore	General Member of the Public	5	10/28/2013	This agency serves thousands of people every year and strengthens their community by empowering youth and families to choose better futures for themselves.  The types of programs and services offered address a wide variety of issues; everything from kindergarten readiness to substance abuse therapy to emergency financial assistance.  Our community is better because of Bauer! 
Bauer Family Resources	183336		/users/profile/240249	Bonnie Hobbs	Volunteer	4	10/28/2013	Bauer is a Family Friendly organization. They have a wonderful youth services program that helps youth stay out of trouble and become productive citizens for our society. Many positive stories have been produced from this program. Most heart warming is one about a former Youth Service volunteer in the 90's who is now a CEO of a company that hires kids from this program into his organization and gives them a chance to succeed. He is a great mentor and supporter of the whole organization. His personal testimony of how Bauer changed his life when he was a volunteer while attending Purdue University is very powerful and meaningful.

The organization is in its third planning year of this event, which receives deep and wide community support!  Congratulations Bauer, and keep up the awesome work!
Bauer Family Resources	169952		/users/profile/225233	kummerdave	Board Member	5	09/16/2013	Bauer Family Resources provides services to individuals and families in the Greater Lafayette area when they need them the most, whether its food or clothing when these items are solely needed, or child care services when the parents are both employed but there is not enough money to cover these expenses. There are countless stories of families in our area who have benefitted from the caring and compassionate services provided  by the staff at Bauer, and our community is truly blessed to have them here.

The people are passionate and have great stories of kids already benefiting from their work. I like knowing that my small contribution will be going toward more stories like those. The fact that the people with SOHO are so knowledgeable and well equipped to carry out their mission means a lot to me.

I was blown away at how much SOHO was making lie better for the orphans in Swaziland. They are giving these children hope and a real chance at life. I pledged to continue to be apart of this wonderful organization and make life better for those children. May God continue to bless SoHO in the work that they are doing.
Saving Orphans through Healthcare and Outreach	59081		/users/profile/63607	Kait	Volunteer	5	12/26/2010	I became involved with SOHO this past summer when the nonprofit I work for (Art With a Heart) decided to partner with SOHO on the first Art, Full of Hope trip to Swaziland.    From day one, I was impressed with SOHO and Annie (Program and Research Development) - coordinating an international collegiate service-learning program with excellent planning and organization.  Annie was well prepared and a wealth of knowledge during the entire process, prepping all participants through cultural trainings and reading material related to the struggles of the region.  SOHOs efforts are making a huge difference in the lives of many Swazi children.  I was able to see this first hand this November and will be forever changed.

It was beautifully organized and ran so smoothly. In addition, they did a really good job raising awareness for the problems that face children in Sub-Saharan Africa through beautiful photographs, t shirts, and word of mouth. The members of the organization are so passionate about their mission and are always coming up with innovative sustainable ways to serve the orphans of Sub-Saharan Africa.
Saving Orphans through Healthcare and Outreach	58750		/users/profile/62809	sschulz	Volunteer	5	12/13/2010	I had the opportunity to travel to Swaziland on the Art: Full of Hope trip. It was truly a life changing experience for me and it was amazing to see how much we were helping the children in Swaziland just by being there and showing that we care! SOHO is an awesome organization and I wish more people would take the time to learn about and support their mission. Any little bit helps, as we saw when we traveled to Swaziland and I can't wait to help out more in the future!

I think that a lot of people want to be aware of what is going on and I think the majority of the people that understand the situation want to help but they aren't sure how to do so...  SOHO has given me the opportunity to not only help but also get involved!! GREAT ORGANIZATION!!!!

They are really committed to helping out the families in Monroe County. They have great programs to help their clients, the classroom for the childcare programs are wonderful, and all the people who work there are the nicest people you could meet! I have volunteered in both the food pantry and in one of the classrooms, since it was required for a group I am a part of at IU, but I really and truly loved it, and felt like I was doing a good thing for the community by giving my time to this organization!
Monroe County United Ministries, Inc.	102901		/users/profile/136236	Danielle12	General Member of the Public	5	01/05/2012	As a student at Indiana University, I witnessed firsthand the commitment and dedication to Bloomington families from MCUM's staff, volunteers, and board of directors.  MCUM is very in touch with the clients and children they serve--they really understand the needs of the local community and the services they offer (emergency assistance and affordable childcare) really reflect that.  They provide a sense of stability to families who may be overwhelmed and anxious about making ends meet.  When it comes to donations, MCUM is a wonderful steward of the gifts it receives, whether they be financial gifts or in-kind goods!  
Monroe County United Ministries, Inc.	57295		/users/profile/60458	Michelle R.	Client Served	5	11/18/2010	My daughter attended pre-school through the child care program at MCUM for over 2 years.   MCUM determines its childcare fees on a sliding scale, based on income.  As a single mother who is just a little bit "too rich" to qualify for any assistance of any kind, the affordable childcare offered by MCUM was essential for me being able to support my daugther while still working full time.  The teachers and staff at MCUM are so caring and wonderful that I never felt like I was receiving a "discounted" service.   The care that these kids get really gives them a foundation for learning and gives them a great start that they might not otherwise have.   From what I have seen, MCUM makes the most of every donation it receives.  Nothing is wasted.   No one is profiting from this organization except for the folks that it serves.

Monroe County United Ministries, Inc.	2386	17	/users/profile/3832	durkinl	Donor	5	01/05/2009	MCUM is a great organization that really makes Bloomington a better place. It is an organization that is small enough to connect to people as individuals, and has employees who are dedicated and professional enough to make a difference in the lives of the people they are helping. With MCUM, I can really see that my money is going towards the community. My contribution is not lost in some annual report, and MCUM does not treat its clients like they are statistics.
Animals Rescue Fund Inc	129116		/users/profile/174463	clsheets2	Volunteer	5	10/25/2012	I love knowing that I can provide one-on-one attention to animals while they wait for their forever homes. The staff was busy, but they were helpful and appreciative. 
Animals Rescue Fund Inc	127198		/users/profile/172241	leash7	Volunteer	5	10/19/2012	This group saves dogs who would otherwise be euthanized. They are amazing in the fact that the animals have a forever home until they get adopted! Two and a half years ago I adopted three dogs from this organization who lived there for 11+years. Fonzy, Jack and Nedders have become my children and best friends since. This organization goes out of their way to make a difference and help each and every animal they come in contact with even if it's a three legged dog who is elderly and will have major veterinary care expenses. I am proud to say I was apart of this organization for years and still support them even though I am two hours away from them now. All of their tails truly do have happy endings!
Animals Rescue Fund Inc	127045	2	/users/profile/172085	Jann S.	Volunteer	5	10/18/2012	When I went to ARF to walk a few dogs, complete my school service hours, I didn't know it would change my life. Baxter was the first of many unforgettable furry friends I would make. He was covered in scars from his time as a bait dog for pit bull fighting. They used him because he wouldn't fight. Baxter is a good example of why ARF exists. Many shelters won't take chances on a bully dog, no matter how sweet. But at ARF, he was welcomed, bandaged, and loved. I said I'd keep coming back just to see Baxter. But I learned that this was the plight of animals in Delaware County at the time. Starved, shot, burned, left to mange and heartworm, dumped in the cruelest ways imaginable, and then left to an uncaring animal control system. ARF was there to heal them, body and spirit. And if they couldn't make the journey to a family because they were so badly broken, they had a home at the farmhouse to live our their days with love. And in addition to taking in little guys like Otter, his back broken by a careless owner's misstep, ARF advocated for change in the community. It has trained hundreds of volunteers in caring for and speaking up for animals, and has been instrumental in progress that's being made in the city's shelter system. As for me, it motivated me to make a career out of doing good. After graduation, I got my master's degree in non-profit management and am the executive director at a small non-profit in Nashville, Tennessee. Not a day goes by that I don't think about running with Honey the overexcited greyhound or laying in the crate with my shy guy Jack, about the joy of reuniting old blind Angel with her family after four months or the heartbreak of losing sweet Iris to parvovirus. It's been a few years since I left Muncie, but I keep up on the goings on at the dog house and Catty Shack. There's nowhere in the world like ARF. It helped Baxter find his home, and so many of us lost humans find our place in the world, too.
Animals Rescue Fund Inc	126962	1	/users/profile/171996	scrappydew	Client Served	5	10/18/2012	My personal experience with ARF/ANIMAL RESCUE FUND was wonderful. They make sure every animal is going to a good forever home by checking the applications very closely. They were great to tell the background of the pets I was interested in and if they were recommended for homes with children. The dog we rescued from ARF has turned out to be the best pet ever for us! I highly recommend ARF to everyone in this area!
Animals Rescue Fund Inc	126941		/users/profile/171970	Julia N.	Volunteer	5	10/18/2012	ARF is a fantastic organization.  I volunteered there for four years while I attended a nearby university and I loved every minute of it.  I also miss volunteering there every week.  ARF staff is so friendly and helpful to the public as well as the furry animals they help save.  One of the best things you can witness in this world is changing the opinion of a dog or cat that have been previously mistreated.  Many times people think that the animal will not be able to live a normal life with an owner.  But at ARF, they work so hard to regain the trust of those animals and in turn place them with the correct owner(s).  Then as soon as that dog or cat is placed they go right back out and take in another animal in need.  ARF staff has such big hearts, ones that match only the love a dog can give to its family.

I remember getting our dog from there, almost 15 years ago! My mom has been helping and donating to this charity for over a decade. Now that I am old enough, I do the same thing! I couldn't support this charity anymore than I do. I specifically remember, about a year ago or do, ARF saving 4 pitbull puppies. They were thrown out a window in a plastic bag. ARF took them in and took care of them! Nursed them back to health an adopted them out!!!!!
Kids Alive International Inc	294484	1	/users/profile/385224	jwhite525	Volunteer	5	07/01/2016	Recently did a ten day mission trip with my daughter in Peru with Kids Alive.  What an awesome opportunity to sponsor a child you have interacted with, hugged, laughed and cried with.  Seeing the love and care given to these children is life changing.  Kids Alive may not have the name attraction of World Vision, Compasssion, or other well known charities, but they are definitely impacting the world for Christ in a huge wall.  I was impressed in every way with this organization.
Kids Alive International Inc	35667	9	/users/profile/36475	benderkrb1	Volunteer	5	04/13/2010	I spent a week in the Dominican Republic working at a Kids Alive orphanage a few years back. This organization truly meets the physical and spiritual needs of the children in their care. I was amazed at the relationship the leaders had with the children  wonderfully loving relationships. I have supported this organization financially for years and will continue. They honor that Lord in caring for the least of these.
Kids Alive International Inc	7611	7	/users/profile/9459	Deborah	Volunteer	5	07/29/2009	My husband and I have been going to Palo Blanco in the Dominican Republic for six years. We started building the school by laying the first row of blocks. We have gone back at least once a year ever since. We sponsor two kids there and get to see them every year to see how they have progressed. KAI is pouring money and love into these kids. They are flourishing! It has been a privilege to see how God is working in their lives. Now we are concentrating on doing vocational training for the boys so they will be able to support a family as adults. Kids Alive uses the money that sponsors send in for the care and education of the kids. We have seen where our money goes and how it has helped the kids at Palo Blanco.
Kids Alive International Inc	3452	6	/users/profile/5241	valerie	Donor	5	04/14/2009	I recently had the privilege of visiting the Kids Alive children's homes in Kenya, which meant that I was able to meet the little girl I sponsor (who was once an abandoned baby in a local hospital in Kenya)! What a joy that was -a miracle that I never thought would happen! The caregivers at the Children's Home are quick to share that "my" little girl is always quick to help "her siblings" in the home. Just think - this child who has no father or mother - is now reaching out loving and helping the other children who are just like her! That touches my heart! At the homes we met children who had only been living there for a short time and those who had just graduated from high school and were enrolling in a university to pursue a degree in law, business and education! I will never forget my visit to the children's homes in Kenya...or meeting the little girl I sponsor!
Kids Alive International Inc	3431	6	/users/profile/5221	phj	Donor	5	04/14/2009	Our recent visit to the ministry of Kids Alive in Kenya was most encouraging.  We saw first-hand how orphans and underprivileged children are cared for in such a loving, caring and professional way.  Their operations and the people involved were first class in every way, from the leadership in the U.S. (some of whom traveled with us) to the staff in each location.  I was also impressed with their efficient operations both financially and from a management perspective.  It is so refreshing to see God's work being done so well and the impact they are making in the lives of so many children that had little or no hope.

Kids Alive International Inc	3411	7	/users/profile/5205	madtownskibune	Donor	5	04/13/2009	Kids Alive is an organization that has openned my eyes to the basic needs of children in our world.  These are real kids that don't have clean water or shelter, kids that were abandoned by their birth parents because of a disease that the parents were not educated about.  These are bright kids with hope now that Kids Alive has created a loving home and school environment for them.  They now know of the Lord and know that people around the globe are praying for their health and happiness.  Praise the Lord for His work with Kids Alive around the world.

Natalies Second Chance Dog Shelter Inc	240723	1	/users/profile/326993	DEVINE628,	Volunteer	5	04/07/2015	I LOVE WORKING WITH NATALIE AND ALL THE VOLUNTEERS  AT NATALIES. WHILE SOME PEOPLE MAY SEE IT AS A "ROUGH PLACE" THIS IS ONLY BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE AND VOLUNTEERS TRULY CARE ABOUT THE DOGS FIRST, NOT "APPEARANCE." THEY PUT THE DOGS NEEDS FIRST IN MAKING SURE THEY HAVE NOT ONLY FOOD AND WATER, BUT LOVE AND ATTENTION AND WALKS. I FOSTER WHEN I CAN, AND IT IS SUCH A JOY. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND GETTING INVOLVED, YOU WILL SEE TRUE PASSIONATE PEOPLE WHEN YOU TAKE THE TIME TO GET TO KNOW THEM.
Natalies Second Chance Dog Shelter Inc	322468		/users/profile/416307	ShelterObserver	Client Served	1	01/31/2017	This place is ABSOLUTELY horrible. I have dealt with Natalie's Second Chance Shelter numerous times, and although, I would try to see the good in not only the board of directors, but the other members/volunteers; I just don't have anything good to say about them. They are RUDE, lack knowledge, don't know much about the animals, claim to be concerned about the dogs in their care (there are probably thousands of people who could tell you otherwise), they are not well cared for, they lack the medical attention they need (I know this for a fact), most animals don't receive proper testing, diagnoses' prior to being adopted, they prefer cash over credit (because it's not traceable), she claims to save most of the dogs from death row (that's not true), she saves dogs who are ill beyond their ability to pay for proper testing, treatment or surgeries, she has to beg for help because the money donated isn't used accordingly, they don't always give out receipts for tax right offs to those who donate, they don't always respond to emails or calls (even if it's in regards to helping), they turn down fundraiser ideas and/or aren't present at those created for them, I could go on forever about this place. It is DIRTY, very unhealthy for these animals. I know volunteers play favoritism to dogs, therefore, they don't all get the proper attention, exercise or food others receive. Did I mention how RUDE these people are? How about how ungrateful and disrespectful they are to clients, volunteers, and even the dogs... this place has no business being in business. These dogs would be better off going to other well-maintained shelters with staff who are gentle, caring, financially able to care for their needs, friendly to their staff, supporters and clients, and ultimately puts the dogs needs first. They also have a terrible vet (if that's what you want to call him). He appears nice; but seems to lack a lot of knowledge when it comes to identifying symptoms in animals to then recommend proper testing for diagnostic reasons and treatment plans thereafter. He has misdiagnosed many of our rescues, one of which has passed away and 4 others who require expensive, on-going treatments that are far from what he diagnosed them with. I do NOT recommend this shelters vet or walk-in clinic. I do not believe these animals are a passion of his nor does he make them sound worth the proper time of a thorough wellness exam, testing, etc. I could write forever. This place needs shut down!!
Natalies Second Chance Dog Shelter Inc	249076	2	/users/profile/336909	reece30	Volunteer	5	07/22/2015	I love volunteering and working with Natalie's.  All the dogs there are truly cared for, and while it may be a bit unorganized or overwhelming, every volunteer is truly appreciated and we have to realize as the public that they are a non profit and doing the best they can with little resources.  What is important is how well the dogs are cared for, and how many dogs they are able to save and place in new, permanent homes each year.
Natalies Second Chance Dog Shelter Inc	204951	2	/users/profile/267029	minimilo	Volunteer	1	07/02/2014	This place really is awful. I used to volunteer there. There is nothing about that place that is good. The dogs are barely exercised, they aren't treated well, and  they don't get water or comfy blankets (unless cameras are around). The place is filthy. The staff is rude and incompetent. No one ever knows anything about the animals. I could go on and on.
Natalies Second Chance Dog Shelter Inc	198376	3	/users/profile/259091	mvio21	Client Served	1	04/20/2014	This shelter was absolutely awful. The place itself was dirty and so unorganized. The staff knew nothing about the dogs. I just adopted a dog today and he is already sick with many issues, including kennel cough which has to do with the cleanliness of the facility. I would NEVER recommend this shelter and really feel bad for the animals. This place is gross. I can't stress that enough. I am just glad I am able to help one dog get out of that awful place.

We take in all kinds of dogs and do not discriminate against breed, age, or even health!  Natalie takes in the hardest cases, dogs that have been abused, dogs from puppymills, etc.  Natalie's Second Chance Dog Shelter is a no kill dog shelter.  We work with dogs that need extensive vet care, extensive training and socialization, and we will put the time, money, and love into them.  Natalie truly believes that every dog deserves a second chance, and she will never turn down a dog if she has the room and the money.  We are completely ran by volunteers and donations.  We receive no state or city funding.

I have learned about the environment and  have seen the changes that I and others have done to help improve these preserves.   I have gone on a majority of the workdays and have done individual projects for SHLT, like spraying herbicide on invasive species, collecting seed and photo monitoring. Shirley Heinze Land Trust gave me this opportunity and I am grateful for that.

I saw for the first time what a preserved area looks like--it was spring and beautiful woodland flowers were everywhere--trillium, Dutchman's breeches, anemone. I have been a fan of the organization ever since and have volunteered in many capacities. SHLT acquires parcels of land that contain plants and animals that are threatened by development. It gives many people the opportunity to help preserve these areas and restore them. It is a well-run organization with dynamic leadership and friendly staff.

Rock-It To A Cure, Inc.	239110		/users/profile/324731	DaveKriebel	Board Member	5	03/11/2015	I've been fortunate enough to be part of Rock-It To A Cure since the very beginning, when Mark and Cindy had this grand idea to create a non-for-profit.  There has never been much of a 'humble beginning' to RITAC since the goal was to never be just another non-for-profit.   With Mark and Cindy's passion and desire to make this work, it truly has grown into a wonderful organization.  After only a few short years we have been able to write checks to other non-for-profits that are making a significant impact on children's lives.  During this last year's event, which was in support of GiGi's Playhouse,  I was able to see firsthand the impact that RITAC was making.  Not only were we raising money, but we were educating and raising awareness of Down's Syndrome to the concert goers.  All of the RITAC events have proven to not only be a great music event, but also an event that shined a light on some incredible kids.  I've truly have been blessed to be part of RITAC.

Rock-It To A Cure, Inc.	237202	1	/users/profile/321505	CindyM.	Board Member	5	01/23/2015	At the age of 3, my son was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes - a life changing event for him and all who love him. My husband and I wanted to do more than just sit back and accept this as "just the way it is." We wanted to raise money to find a cure, to create another life changing event for him and the millions of others who have this disease. This is how Rock-It to a Cure began. As others joined us in the journey, we were introduced to families who have children facing other challenges such as Down Syndrome and cancer. So, we expanded our vision to include other child centered organizations. We "spread the love" by choosing a new non-profit each year to benefit from our concert. Changing Children's Lives Through Music - it's what we do.

EAC events are uniformly well-designed, well-run, and well-attended. I particularly appreciate the focus of some events on helping existing entrepreneurs take the next to step to sustain or expand their existing enterprises. The programs are not just for startups or those thinking of starting a business. The events in series also step through exactly the types of issues on the minds of active entrepreneurs -- not just seeking investment, but sales, hiring and retention, dealing with new mobility technology, and the like. The more purely networking events also take  steps beyond nametags to facilitate the networking process, such as scattering discussion leaders among small tables and having a brief presentation designed to start discussions.Roland J.

What a remarkable year it was! We were able to continue to coordinate our Business Plan competition for local high school students. In the past, some of our competitors have actually started their own businesses, and others have told us that the competition helped them to secure college internships. In 2010, we also continued our practice of offering valuable educational opportunities to our local small business community. We offered presentations on how to secure state grants and tax credits, how to use social media for marketing, and a recent educational presentation on the implications of the new health care legislation for small business. Finally, we held our first Community-Wide Business Plan competition in 2010. The plans that we received were extremely well written and we hope that our winner will be able to use their prize package to become a business success.

Then trained horses for awhile.  I help the abused ones learn to trust again.  I can't squat like Tammy, but I have a chair in almost every pasture :).  Can sit for hours under a shade tree, and just wait.  There's nothing so rewarding as watching the fear and the wall, break away!    The rescue is clean!  Poop is scooped daily, (in the pastures!)  and water tanks are cleaned daily.   No baby leaves in bad shape!  They are well fed, and well loved.  We try to help folks, even after they have adopted one of our babies, if they need it :)  LOVE updates and that fact that many ppl who have adopted from us, stay in touch!        Horses and farm animals are more expensive than dogs or cats.

They were able to get her to not worry so much about how she skated and instead focused on having fun and seeing herself as a capable person. She finally let down her guard and relaxed enough to see the fun she was having. She insisted on going to their next event before the one at X-Games had even finished!Over the next year, she gained so many friend through the Girls Riders Organization and attended every girls' skating event possible. She has so much confidence and is now entering boy's contests as well. She knows that she is may not be at top competition level but she goes anyway because now it's about having fun, seeing friends and just tacking challenges every day. She now seeks out girls at skate parks and tells them all about GRO. She sees what they have done for her and wants all girls to have this kind of support and confidence.
Girl Riders Organization Inc	47251	5	/users/profile/48017	cressey-rice	Board Member	5	06/30/2010	I came to skateboarding later in life (24), and one of the reasons I love it so much is that every moment on a skateboard represents a fear that is being conquered.  I love encouraging other women to chase after their fears as well, and I feel that skateboarding is a life-changing activity.  While I used to compete at other sports to try to win, I joined skateboarding contests in order to meet and skate with other women.  That's when I met Courtney and her big idea to give the gift of skateboarding to girls all across the country so that the ratio of girls to boys skating might even out and change the course of so many lives.  I have helped out with clinics as well as preparing the tax documents, and it is so fun to share the joy of skateboarding.  Every clinic leaves a wave of friendships and new attitudes about what is possible.

GRO now has an ATL chapter, and since I live over in Athens, I try to make the road trip to these events when I can.  It's always fun.  The best part is skating with girls standing their ground as the minority, girls who are having fun with skating despite it being a rough sport/art.

Messiah Missions	222362	1	/users/profile/286068	Gordon L.	Donor	5	10/13/2014	Messiah Missions does great work helping the poorest people of the world
Messiah Missions	144154	1	/users/profile/190665	seanmcc	Board Member	5	11/29/2012	In my recent involvement with Messiah Missions I have found this ministry to be committed to passionate Christ-centered outreach to the most destitute - both locally and globally. Their mandates are clear; Globally - "Go and make disciples of all the nations.", and equally resounding their Local commission - "You shall be witnesses to Me in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth.". These directives speak volumes of Messiah Missions strict alignment to Biblical precepts and are truly representative of their Eight Guiding Principles; Integrity, Trustworthiness, Effectiveness, Respect, Empowerment, Excellence, Trust, and Flexibility. These principles and practices has compelled me to prayerful; giving and/or going as God may lead. 
Messiah Missions	142376	1	/users/profile/188844	Cmnahrwold	Volunteer	5	11/25/2012	I have been helping this organization for many years now, and I have been simply amazed how God has used the Mission.  I support the organization for many reasons.  The first reason is because it not only serves global initiatives, but it also helps local causes in our community.  Secondly, I appreciate how all of the raised finances go directly to the field and not used to pay overhead and pay checks.  This means that Messiah Missions uses volunteer efforts for everything.  Because of this Messiah Missions is dependent upon God in every aspect. No wordly strategies or marketing techniques required, but only prayer to God to raise support and volunteers.
Messiah Missions	142360	1	/users/profile/188822	perez.jo	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/24/2012	After working around 9 years in the non-profit world, I was amazed to see how Messiah Missions devotes 100% of donations to the pastors and ministries it serves, and how it is based solely on volunteer support.  Also, the hand of God was evidently working in favor of this organization as resources and necessary volunteers come as the Lord leads them.  
Messiah Missions	141970		/users/profile/188388	In His Service	Board Member	5	11/21/2012	I have been involved from the start, and have seen God's hand move in ways that can only be called supernatural in confirmation of His divine guidance. Coming in with a history of experience in missions, serving with a number of other organizations, it is refreshing to know that ALL donations submitted to Messiah Missions go to the cause, not to operation expenses or payroll. The "cause" being support of pastors, missionaries and evangelists in the field locally and internationally, along with assistance for those abused, orphaned, widows, sick, and persecuted. Praying that the Lord continue to bless this work, whereas so few religious organizations hold to the standard, submitted entirely to God in the power of the Holy Spirit under blood of Christ, which paramount to fulfilling the Great Commission.
Angels & Doves Inc.	159506		/users/profile/211679	Sandi8,	General Member of the Public	5	06/05/2013	I have interviewed Kim Harvey from Angels & Doves multiple times on my Internet Radio Show, The Average Superwoman Show. She first impressed me with the story of how she and her mother found their mission for helping young people. She continued to impress me with the concise, educated and organized program they developed. I had heard that other companies provide this kind of program, but the fact that Angels & Doves does NOT cost $60,000 a year per school helped me become a believer. Reading her book, and researching her results convinced me that Angels & Doves provides a real, practical program that can reach our children at their level and help turn around a dangerous trend in society today.I highly recommend Angels & Doves for any school, sports organization, faith-based organization or concerned parents who want to find ways to help their children learn how NOT to bully, and how to help themselves grow into strong, confident and happy adults.Sandra P.

Angels & Doves Inc.	252624		/users/profile/340721	Bobsam	Client Served	5	08/11/2015	Angels and Doves is an incredible organization to work with.  Their dedication to developing the best anti bullying program is refreshing to see.  My organization, STEPSS and Christi Academies were extremely happy with the Angeles and Doves program.  I highly recommend that this programs be made available to all youth.  So if you have an organization such as a school, youth group or other situation where young people are involved, please get this program in front of them.  We must stop bullying.   
Angels & Doves Inc.	157911		/users/profile/209437	Marla Jo	Volunteer	5	05/15/2013	I became a partner with the Angels and Doves in the most unique way.  Would like to start off by saying "...that some time in my life I had been bullied!"  In seeking opportunities to promote my first album, "I Won't Have To Worry About This World Anymore" (http://www.tatemusicgroup.com/epk/?id=16215&page=home), a friend of mine gave me the topic to pursue on bullying in schools and to use my album to do so.  The next morning after my thoughts were racing, Kim Harvey was on the news talking about her program.  I called her immediately and she added me as a partner on her website.  After assisting Kim on a few events in 2012, I know how sincere she and her mother are to stop this disease and to help hurting children of all ages.  I feel good to be a part of her team, currently working on an event to be held July 20th, 2013 in Columbus Indiana (see partner page on their website) for details.  Together, Let's Make A Difference!  Marla Jo Mason
Angels & Doves Inc.	157523		/users/profile/208902	Caesar	Client Served	5	05/09/2013	A local news reporter introduced me to the Angels and Doves organization after my son was bullied and harassed at school by his coaches and teammates.  My son was singled out on multiple occasions by the coaches, who then told the teammates to do embarrassing and humiliating acts.  The final incident, resulted in my son getting his leg broke.  My son and I, contacted Angels and Doves and met  with Kim Harvey.  She has a passion for kids that have suffered from bullying.  My son felt his feelings were validated by Kim.  She helped him to realize that none of the incidents were his fault and that he was a victim.  She also made him aware that there are other kids suffering from similar incidents.  This is a wonderful and much needed organization. ~ Kristi Freeman
Angels & Doves Inc.	157451		/users/profile/208825	jeremybrimm	Board Member	5	05/09/2013	I was introduced to this organization long before I joined the board.  I am most impressed by the passion that went into the founding of Angels & Doves Inc and that has followed Kim and Joyce throughout each event and advancement.  What I believe sets Angels and Doves apart from similar anti-bullying organizations is that in addition to the presentations that are given in schools to the students and faculty, there are also tools and resources, in fact a whole program, that can then be implemented.  It's not simply about what bullying is and how to report it, but it's about empowering each and every person to combat bullying at its roots and be able to speak up and change the culture of bullying.  Students and faculty alike are affected deeply by the invaluable work that Angels & Doves Inc does.  As changing schools and technologies allow the means of bullying to change, Angels & Doves helps everyone stay aware and get ahead of the curve.
Kibble Kitchen Pet Pantry Inc	262750	1	/users/profile/351446	Lisa485	Volunteer	5	10/09/2015	I started out in a donor capacity with the Kibble Kitchen Pet Pantry, providing monetary and pet supplies. I understood the mission to help families in need thru pet food and other essentials in maintaining  pet health, education and spay/neuter assistance. I later turned into a volunteer after seeing the out reach and rescue program. The Kibble Kitchen offers assistance in both Lake & Porter Counties, helping families keep their pets due to economic constraints, education on proper pet care/responsibilities and helping connect pets with people.  The need for this program is great and the organization is staffed with caring individuals who are there to assist.

La Casa De Amistad Inc	119541	1	/users/profile/162538	Patrick A.	Volunteer	5	07/30/2012	La Casa de Amistad is a wonderful nonprofit organization that provides the surrounding community with services that the low-income residents would otherwise not be able to afford. I personally have volunteered with the organization as an English language instructor for adult learners for the past year and have seen the tremendous impact that La Casa has on the community. By helping adults in my community gain control of the English language, I am contributing to their future success and a brighter future for my community. Some students come to class unable to read or write even in their own language and are given the gift of literacy from volunteers such as myself. La Casa provides the classroom space and materials in order that volunteers such as myself can give our gift of knowledge, skills, and friendship to fellow community members. La Casa de Amistad is at the top of my list for nonprofits that have impacted my community.

The cats are housed in rooms rather than cages which provides potential adopters with an opportunity to interact with many cats at one time.  Cats are never euthanized for space or any reason other than to alleviate end of life suffering under a veterinarian's advice.  Many programs support life-saving efforts including adoption, foster, spay/neuter, TNR, fundraising events, etc. all run by volunteers, proud to give their time & energy to this most noble cause.  I am honored to be among them.

External observers, including our auditing teams, have always held up the quality of CWS' internal staff in the financial realm.  There is an intentionality about using funds efficiently and always in a manner that reflects the goals of donors. I often have occasion to speak to grassroots donors as well as to institutional stakeholders, and I can honestly say that I have never had any reservations about presenting CWS as a preferred choice among organizations working to end hunger and poverty in the global arena.

It is my goto organization when I want to donate to help out after a disaster strikes.  The donation doesn't go to that specific disaster but previous donations will already have been mobilized to get relief to the disaster area.  I trust this organization because it is a cooperative ministry of 37 Christian communions including the major protestant and orthodox denominations so I can be sure that it has been well vetted.  Although a Christian ministry it does not proselytize and helps people of all faiths.

I am there weekly and can see the true dedication the Staff has to improving the quality of life of the animals they serve. The Staff attends to medical concerns and behavioral issues. Each animal is behaviorally screened so that he/she is placed in a home that will be a great match. It isn't an easy task and some animals are more difficult to place than others. All staff and volunteers remain optimistic and do their best to help their top priority which of course is the animals. The animals, from the largest dog to the smallest mouse are kept in a clean environment with adequate food, water, toys and bedding to make their stay as positive as possible. My daughter and son-in-law adopted a husky mix 2 years ago and they believe that he is the best ever and are grateful that he was brought to Washington County Humane Society as a stray and taken care of until they "found "him.
Humane Society Of Washington County Inc	103482		/users/profile/138168	orel	Volunteer	4	01/16/2012	I just wanted to tell you about the most amazing humane society -  The Washington County Humane Society in Slinger, Wisconsin.  I am volunteer there, and have been for 4 years.  This place and the staff that works there full time,  take so much time and care with each animal,  Despite the lack of space to handle the animals and money.  They love each and every animal that comes in and does what ever they can to get it better and into a forever home.     they are a no kill shelter and will keep a dog, or cat, etc...  however long it takes to find them a good home.  They always want to make sure they go into a good home and not just worry about getting them out the door.       They really need more space and some new equipment.   If I could afford it I would give it to them,  but I can't,  but I do try to help in as many other ways as I can.    They really need more volunteers.   The staff is the most loving and hard working you will ever meet.    If you want to adopt a dog in Wisconsin,  come to this Shelter,  they are the  Best.!!!    V. Parker

The staff at HSWC was very straight-forward in telling us that Maxx had been raised in a puppy mill, had been adopted once before and returned because the family had problems house training him. They advised us it might be difficult to successfully train Maxx but offered suggestions on how we could make it work. We followed their advice and the end result is that Maxx has become a loving member of our family. He is an absolute joy. The staff at HSWC was great to work with, made it easy to adopt Maxx and to successfully integrate him into our lives. We recommend them to anyone looking to add a loving animal to their lives.

They were the  youngest of the age range, but always came  home feeling quite proud and confident in the things they did - and what a range of things they did! They threw pottery on the wheel, sewed, painted, made puppets and more.  The products were quite impressive! They not only hope to go next year, they hope to go next week! This is my first experience with the Lawrence Art Center. I plan not only to look for more opportunities for my children here, but also for myself.

In all cases it was a humbling experience to see how children from the poorest of circumstances are helped by education,  nutritional and medical care that otherwise would not possible.  To witness children from the same neighborhoods be physically shorter because of lack of nutrition and care and to watch parents who benefit from Christel House parental outreach to improve their lives and their families is wonderful. I could not recommend more highly the work being done by Christel House and the excellent financial stewardship shown in their operation  to keep this charity  growing and changing lives.
Christel House International Inc	81759		/users/profile/89640	Jeff Parker	Donor	5	03/10/2011	I believe the Christel House is the epitome of what a charitable organization should be--a group that is transforming the lives of both those who need a hand and those who are able to help.  Year after year the Christel House team has proven through their passion and commitment that the health and education of the children is their unwavering priority.  Having visited both the Indianapolis Academy and the Mexico City school, I can testify that these under-privileged students are being given opportunities to change their lives in ways that would not happen without Christel House.  Each donation that I make is money well spent as I know that it helps children in need to prepare themselves to contribute to our global society.    
Exotic Feline Rescue Center Inc	273789	1	/users/profile/363076	Ann_123	Donor	5	12/04/2015	This is a rescue for exotic felines in this country that were bred into the pet trade through no fault of their own.  Having a lion, tiger, leopard, puma, lynx, bobcat, serval, Asian leopard cat or geoffrey's cat can be an overwhelming animal as a pet because of their specific needs, room to live in and temperments.  It is the thought that it would be so fun/neet to have one.  The Exotic Feline Rescue Center located in Center Point Indiana  was conceived by Joe Taft as a way to help these deserving cats have room to roam, dental work when needed, cataract surgery to restore their sight, fed the food that is needed by these cats so their bodies can grow healthy.  The EFRC is an exotic feline home for life.  The staff and volunteers do such a wonderful job of taking care of these beautiful cats.  The supporters, donors and visitors enable them to give the best life possible when an exotic feline has no where to go.  The staff does not they go in with the cat unless it has been anesthetized, they receive the care and devotion they deserve (food, water, straw, clean ,living areas, etc.)  These are happy cats that know they are safe and cared for every day.  Stop by the EFRC for a tour to see these wonderful cats and see how well they are taken care of.   
Exotic Feline Rescue Center Inc	59338	2	/users/profile/63986	Nicola K.	General Member of the Public	5	01/01/2011	Divine Sanctuary In my life, it hasn't been easy to open myself up to love and be loved.  The blessing of love has sneakily come in the back door for me, through animals and nature.  They both paved the way for my opening wider to my human family. This August, I gifted myself the overnight experience at the Exotic Feline Rescue Center in Indiana.  I had been to the facility a couple years before with my family and had the most heart-warming experience ever.  I fell in love over and over again with these beautiful big cats and the EFRC!  I was  delighted when they told me about a North Carolina local rescue center with an equally big heart... my other love, The Conservators' Center. I wanted to stay overnight at the EFRC's apartment, to see more of the animals who weren't on the regular tour, but it was limited to adults and I had two children.  The desire was born though and I knew that I would be back to experience it. The drive up from North Carolina seemed short.  Every passing second felt like it was bringing me closer to a dream!  Music was my companion and gorgeous scenery, like the Cherokee National forest, the Kentucky river, the mountains, mountains, mountains... I arrived close to four in the afternoon, plenty of time before the gates closed and staff went home.  My adventure begins! Day 1 - (August 4, 2010) I fell asleep outside the overnight apartment, with Mirage (bob cat), another lighter coloured bob cat called Swizzle (I think), Pauli Ann (mountain lion), Zoey and Kaya (tigers), Brumby (leopard) and Lanky (Canadian Lynx). 210 cats 121 tigers and 34 lions When I first arrived, I remember Joe asking me, if I wanted to unpack or if I wanted to go see some big cats.  No brainer for me.  Big cats, of course! I had driven up almost 10 hours from North Carolina, my gift to myself, to be in my kind of heaven! I do not like being hot, so it has to be something special for me to want to stay outside in prolonged heat.  The EFRC is definitely something special!  The heat somehow just felt okay. Remembrances sun going down, mouths open everyone panting with the extreme heat today.  Doves cooing in the background and grasshoppers or cicadas making a buzzing sound.  Synchronised roaring that brings a smile to my face and heart. Late afternoon rounds a couple of the tigers tracking the male assistant.  As hed turn his back, they would move closer, then stop when he turned towards them.  Childhood games of statues and Mother May I, come to mind! One of the big cats licking a positively smelly horses head.  My guide called them the garbage disposal! The sounds choruses of roars deep groans, grunts, chuffs, waahs, huhhs, uhhs and mwuhs! I wondered if I would hear the sounds in the night.  Joe Taft, the owner of the EFRC, suggested leaving the windows open a crack so that I would. Day 2 - (August 5, 2010) Instead of waking to bird song, I hear a double thud of Pauli Ann, a mountain lion, jumping down from her perch. I look out, and everyone is pacing.  Brumby and Zoey  join her in their morning programme of back and forth pacing. Brumby settles on the top perch to gaze across to where the bobcats live.  Whats he thinking about, I wonder. Brumby and Pauli Anns pacing looks like a synchronized dance.  There is a grace of movement as they go back and forth, broken by a steady gaze outwards at the smaller neighbouring bobcats. My daughter likes to pace and circle when she talks.  I think it feeds her imagination and creativity in some way. I am hypnotized by their movement.  I have a sense, that somewhere on the rest of the 100 acre property, other bodies are pacing, staring awake. I talked to Joe yesterday about the difference with the animals here versus ones at a zoo.  They seem so real and alive to me full colour instead of gray or black and white.  He affirms that you are up close and really get to feel their personalities.. Yesterday, Joe called to the cats outside the apartment, offering them a piece of meat.  I remember Brumby and his room-mate, Pauli Ann, coming instantly to the fence.  Brumby, who Joe has had from a baby, let out a little cat wail that touched my heart.  I felt the bond of love between them.  One of the care-takers said that she felt that leopards pick out one or two people who they cared about.  Joe and Jean were it for Brumby, otherwise he was mean. We should all have someone to love and someone to love us back.  Two-leggeds, four-leggeds one, none Why am I here again, visiting this place? Pauli Ann and Brumby are laying back, heads and paws off the sides of their perches, while Zoey continues to make her morning rounds. I love life in all of its forms.  Animals especially, have an easy way to speak to my heart.  They are wide open, showing us who they are, commanding my attention, love and respect. I watch the two girls, Zoey and Pauli Ann, lovingly grooming themselves and my heart feels full. Brumbys tongue pokes out as he scratches his back.  My father used to do that stick his tongue out a bit when he was in deep concentration mode. Zoey is now up on her perch pacing.  Bigger, heavier than her neighbours, she is equally beautiful.  Her movements more lumbering than graceful. I have to get ready for the day and I find that I dont want to leave my spot.  I dont want to miss anything! A piece of the Why am I here? comes to me This is a living, breathing example of how to treat our family and our home.  Our family extends far beyond just the human element.  It includes these creatures who walk the earth, inhabit our skies and swim our ocean They are deserving and worthy as are we. Stewards of the earth our responsibilities lie here to ourselves and to each other.  Each other doesnt just include human beings. We do the best possible to make this heaven on earth for all. I didnt expect to be greeted when I went outside, but I was!  My mind went to my own pets back home and how eager they are to see me and of course, to get their dose of loving attention and food. Zoey gave her chuffle and a tiger cry, that even though I dont know what it is called, it melts my heart.  She actually broke into a loping, playful run alongside the fence, as if she wanted to go for a morning walk!  Gosh, doesnt that remind me of my dogs, my children, myself even... all wanting just a little love and connection. Kaya greeted me with a chuffle and a cry too, and I was surprised.  He raised his tail as if to spray and I jumped back immediately.  He did not.  The tigers rubbed against the fence, looking like they would love someone to stroke them.  I could feel the natural impulse in me to respond, but I did not.  These are not my pets. In between Zoey and Kaya, lives Lanky who was quite scarce yesterday.  Today, here he was, sitting still, gazing upwards at the skies.  I watched him, closing my eyes for a moment.  My heart jumped with fright when I heard a sound behind me!  Thank goodness, nobody was loose and ready to jump on this easy prey! Pauli Ann gave me a little cry and came down from her perch.  Brumby raised his regal head and looked.  I was happy not to get a snarl. Came back out after reluctantly giving time to getting dressed got an oomph kind of sound from Kaya and a cry from Brumby.  Intutition tells me that he is wanting a visit from Joe or Jean.  As he made his way back to his side of the enclosure, Pauli Ann lay in wait and pounced!  Cute how he jumped. Ideally, these animals would be living their lives in the wilds in their natural habitats.  But, that is not to be for some.  Circumstances have altered what could have been and have led to their being here. This is a loving alternative and a blessing to live out your days being treated with compassion, love and respect.  The words grace and dignity come to mind. Feeding Zoe grabbing her meat and tossing it playfully around.  One tiger took a whole horse leg into the water tank, so he could enjoy his bath and hold on to his meal at the same time!  Constant in and out with the food, that struck me as funny.  Bob and Tom tigers getting really loud when it was feeding time. Beautiful names matching their owners Rollo, Elsa, Kayla, Princess, Killian and Bella, JR and Uluru, Samoa,  Charm and Copper, Jagger, Majai, Tacumseh, Clancy and Babbs, Paco and Dangerous, Hunter, Romulus, Tinker and Samantha, Gabby, Lea, Missouri, Montana and Sierra, Natasha, Katerina, Dulce,  Mauzi, Bombay, Mustafa, Goldie, Navi, Jabbers, Kiki, Tika, Rappie and Cubbie, Koko, Sinbad, Bro and Hannah, Jasmin, Sassy, Zeus and Thor, Tony and Rob, Niko, Oklahoma, Mickey, Bonnie, Jake Jr., Kachina, Samara, Clementine, Lincoln, Killer and Kennedy, Bob and Tom, Anna, Oti and Tony III, Kisa and Max, Lakota, Layla, Simba, Swizzle, Lanky, Samo, Bear, Ra, California Leopards, The Munchkins, Hermans group, Southern Belles... Experiences Zeus and Thor two male lions who came to the EFRC with Zoey tiger.  Probably about 12 to 14 years old, there was a definite display of love and affection with these guys.   Poor coordination and muscle tone due to their earlier cramped confinement.  A little unsteady with movement but still able to frolic and roll around and enjoy their outdoor haven.  Zeus, described as not all there, was back kicking like my best dog!  To my delight, one of them followed Jen, as she invited them to go skipping alongside the fence!  This big cat was literally bouncing along, playing with another free spirit!  I am feeling thankful for interventions that change the course of unhappy lives. Watching the dead animals (horses, cows, chicken, rabbit) being cut up for the big cats, was quite an experience in itself.  I found myself feeling really glad and being in gratitude that there was food for our residents.  I was happy that there were workers who were perfectly willing and able to perform the tasks to make this happen.  A feeling and appreciation for the circle of life. Beautiful Jagger peering out of his corner space.  Watching as one of the wondering wild cats ventured into Jaggers  enclosure.  Why on earth would the little cat go into the tigers home?!  One of the staff members mentioned that the cat had had her kittens in the back.  100 acres and she picks the back of a tigers house to have kittens and they were still alive?!  My contemplating all of this led to my talking to a staff member about parenting. Some big cats put their energy into nurturing their young, while others focus on protecting their own and creating new offspring.  Lions, even if starving, wont eat their own.  They may kill the offspring of another lion, but still not eat it. A big group of tigers getting hosed off and loving it, as their area was being cleaned out.  They kept moving in circles and winding in and out of each other muddy and happy.  All the while, beautiful sounds!  While the tigers were in this smaller, "holding" area, David was out alone, aerating their huge pond.  You couldn't see him because of all of the grasses and I remember thinking about trust, responsibility and the need to have a good memory!  Before letting that clan out, everybody's whereabouts need to be known. Back at the main entrance,  sitting and waiting to make the rounds to the main tour area Impromptu visitors arriving and I am happy, as this means money coming in and people being given the opportunity to know God's wild ones... Feeling love and overwhelming gratitude.  Thankful for people who will devote their time and energy to care for a species. Thankful that creatures get to experience a second chance and the gift of a peaceful haven. Mmmwaah, mwah, mwah Sounds more like a cow than a tiger!  Happy, contented sounds. Finding the 4  inch whisker from Hunter tiger in my journal just now.  Remembering how he had chuffed at me and then feeling like a kid when Jen discovered the whisker in his enclosure and presented it to me!  Treasure! Loving the wave of noise.  Loving that somebody is nicknamed Smiley boy, that Jabber lion is grumpy and a 19 year old ocelot is here to retire.  Just like everyone else, these big cats have distinct personalities Gabby II lies on her back and plays patta cake with her paws!  How precious is that really?! The next time that I ever have to cut up a chicken, or have to clean out my cats litter box, I will remember that someone else has to cut up a cow and clear out decaying bones and matter. Feeling amused when Sam lion was stubborn and wouldnt come when David kept tirelessly calling.  Loving the affectionate comment that male lions can be dumb  sometimes.  Amused again when Rebecca told one of the cats, Anna, you gotta pay attention! Feels like me with my children! Max, the biggest tiger, living with Kisa lioness.  She has neurological damage and walks a bit unsteadily.  Sweet girl who was swatting at Maxs legs for attention and then bit his hind quarters.  He jumped and then roared his displeasure at her.  She was just playing big guy! Last day - (August 6th) Outside the apartment, everyone is definitely frisky this morning.  The light coloured bobcat, Swizzle, is jumping and racing around from perch to perch, down to the ground and back up again. Later, a dead skink was discovered as the source of her antics. Zoey reminds me of my pet dog and cats, playing with her two boomer balls, tail out tail up in the air batting them around, jumping in the air, crouching down over the ball and then galloping off! Brumby and Pauli Ann double pacing on two levels.  Kaya, way down at the other end, also pacing. Everyone in their morning spot.   Dozing, resting settling into a good feeling. Foods coming! Precious Lanky gazing upwards and making his way through the brush, blind like India tiger, but knowing his space My morning guides are here! Zoey being incredibly frisky... bounding and jumping up, and it felt like she wanted David to come in and play!   Come play and then food! I leave my journal in my car this morning and just follow and feel with my heart In feel with the animals, the staff, the whole experience... crying as I feel with my senses, each individual creature and then, collectively as a bigger family... One moment in the building, when I saw Joe and he asked how my morning was  Tears in my eyes, as I said that I didnt want to leave.  Moments later, standing in the big field, seeing all of the enclosures and registering the soul of this place More tears and the reluctance to leave. Driving home later that morning, listening to music... memories re-surfacing... Somebody To Love by Queen Audra, Rebecca, Jen, Hollie, David, Ziggie, Ann, Jan, Joe, Jean, volunteers and staff whose names are unknown to me, but whose hearts and actions are not... Julia, Mindy, John David, Doug, Carolyn, Janine... Talking to Rebecca about rescues and remembering her response that it is not easy to remain professional when you go on a rescue trip.  Sometimes, we are called to have a fierce heart... to feel anger that you could blow them all away and sleep well that night... But, you blow no one away in reality, using that energy to do what you do every day, because your presence is needed right here, right here... When you open your heart and you really feel another being, another creature... you can't abuse them. How could you? How can you experience love and life fully and go forward to commit harm?  To do harm, there has to be ignorance and closed off spaces internally... (from my blog on wordpress: "For The Love Of The Wild" - http://loveofthewild.wordpress.com/2010/09/23/divine-sanctuary/)

Cota Childrens Organ Transplant Association Inc	272937	1	/users/profile/362086	gritzmacher	Client Served	5	11/26/2015	We worked with COTA for my son's transplant, beginning before the transplant, while he was waiting. When he got his transplant sooner than planned, it was a good thing we had started early. The thing people should understand about COTA is they do not raise the funds for you. You must have a group of people to do the work. What COTA does and does very well is help you out with the red tape of managing a charity. Since the money raised goes into COTA, as a registered 501(c)(3) you don't have to deal with all the paperwork and tax issues, or decide what the money will be spent on. They guide you through all of that. COTA will give you a lot of good advice on how to raise funds and will sit down with you and help you estimate how much needs to be raised. Once you set a goal and reach it, COTA manages all the reimbursements for expenses.  Since my son's transplant we have been receiving reimbursements for travel expenses and some medical supply expenses from them with no problems. They have a clear set of requirements to report the expenses and turn around time for reimbursement has been about a week. I would highly recommend COTA over attempting to "do-it-yourself." They are a dedicated and professionally run group and delivered what they promised. 
Cota Childrens Organ Transplant Association Inc	253560		/users/profile/341772	Ana_27	Client Served	5	08/21/2015	Our child had a liver transplant.  I can not imagine what we would have done without COTA.  The COTA staff is not only wonderful to work with but they are so genuinely caring.   
Cota Childrens Organ Transplant Association Inc	167738		/users/profile/222603	CEHmom	Client Served	5	09/05/2013	Wow, I am really surprised by the other review.  We have had a wonderful experience with COTA.  I never expected them to raise the money for us.  They are only supposed to be there as a support for YOUR fundraising activities.  We have found it extremely helpful to have the backing of such a large 501(c)3.  We have done several large fundraisers over a year period and have been able to raise almost 100K.  When doing a large event and seeking corporate sponsorships, it is absolutely necessary to have a 501(c)3 of some type.  I have known people who tried to fundraise without the backing of a large organization and they had a harder time raising large amounts of money.  We have found COTA to be extremely helpful with reimbursements.  They are confined by IRS regulations, but that would be true of any organization of this type.  You cannot expect to take funds and use them for non-medical reasons.  My son has a very complicated condition and his care is often "out of the box."  We have found COTA to be very helpful with helping us get things approved when they are medically related but maybe not the typical reimbursement.  We usually receive the reimbursement checks within a week.  You can also submit medical bills to them and they will pay them directly.  I cannot tell you how much it has helped to have the extra funds.  It has made our life manageable through a very difficult time.  We have been reimbursed for over $40,000 in medical expenses in just one year so that should tell you that it is certainly not impossible to get reimbursements.  It upsets me that someone would write a negative review when it sounds like they did not have a very good understanding for what COTA actually does.  
Cota Childrens Organ Transplant Association Inc	167212	4	/users/profile/222073	RileysMomma	Client Served	1	09/05/2013	I would not recommend COTA to anyone seeking to fundraise for their childs transplant.  Basically if you are in a terrible financial situation - don't expect them to help.  Even though the funds they hold are the funds that were raised for YOUR child specifically by fundraising events.  They don't deem the funds as yours.  They deem them as THEIRS to do with whatever they please.  Good luck getting reimbursed for anything and if you do enjoy the 3 week long wait.

While I'm a board member, I am also a tutor.  I work with a 63 year-old man who is learning to read.  He struggles, but continues to make progress. As someone who has loved reading since I was about 4 years old, I find it difficult to imagine all of the problems one would face without this skill.  The instructions on an aspirin bottle, an insurance form, or any type of directions would be incomprehensible.  It's really an honor to be able to help people learn this skill and The Literacy Center makes this possible at no cost to the student.
Literacy Center Inc	71727	4	/users/profile/78433	PBurzynski	General Member of the Public	4	02/20/2011	The Literacy Center in Evansville, Indiana is an organization that has enthusiastic and dedicated staff members who work towards the goal of providing reading skills to adults who lack proficiency in reading.  More important than quality of their teaching skills, however, is the care and sensitivity that these volunteers who offer their time to clients express - to enable these men and women to feel that they have worth, that their reading deficits are not permanent, and that they can overcome these obstacles.

One of the agencies I even referred a personal acquaintance to. Deaf Services helped someone I knew that had a deaf family member.  We had never heard of this agency before.  The Deaf services help them get a much need hearing aid and also got legal aid from an interpreter, a service I did not know existed.  These services proved invaluable to them.  I was very impressed on how the Gary YWCA made an amazing turn around and now so many services and activities to the city.  I know many who enjoy the water aerobics which is good for health and entertaining as well.  They house a charter school and business offices.  I also know that LAUW make sure that all the agencies are informed on what the need to do get funding.

INFLAMMATORY BREAST CANCER RESEARCH FOUNDATION	292578		/users/profile/383116	maracawoman	Donor	5	06/09/2016	The key word for me is "research".  I knew nothing about breast cancer subtypes when I was diagnosed in March 2010. My oncologist is Dr. Beth Overmoyer at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. She was awarded a $50,000 research grant in 2011 from the Inflammatory Breast Cancer Research Foundation (IBCRF). In my first consult, Dr. Overmoyer explained the differences between inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) and other types, including how IBC is rare and doesn't show up on a mammogram. She impressed on me the significance of research needed on IBC, and indicated a clinical trial where she thought I would qualify as a participant. I was glad to take part in it, thinking that even if it didn't work for me, perhaps the results could help someone else.Although many charities exist for breast cancer in general, I prefer to donate to IBCRF, as many medical personnel are unaware of IBC and its aggressiveness and uncommon symptoms, Hence, we really need to educate the medical professionals as well as the public. 
INFLAMMATORY BREAST CANCER RESEARCH FOUNDATION	289190		/users/profile/379414	JaneNIre	Client Served	5	05/09/2016	On September 11, 2015, I was diagnosed with Stage IV Inflammatory Breast Cancer (IBC). To say that I was stunned is the understatement of the year. I have been very healthy my entire life and now at age 59 I was being told I had a disease I had never heard of and will probably die from.Like most people these days I immediately went on-line to research as much I could about this disease. This was completely depressing and very scary, until in the course of my research I discovered the Inflammatory Breast Cancer Research Foundation (IBCF). After my diagnosis in September I started chemo therapy which finally concluded on the March 1, 2016. Then on March 31, I had a mastectomy and lymphectomy and am now undergoing physical therapy while I wait to begin six weeks of daily radiation therapy.  During all these treatments, it was very disconcerting to find that no-one other than my oncologist and MD had heard of Inflammatory Breast Cancer. The Foundation is focused on assisting scientists and researchers in determining the cause of IBC, increasing awareness of IBC amongst medical staff and the public, as well as supporting research. The information, research and support they offer is wonderful. Their newsletter is informative and made me realize that I am not the only person with this disease. Everything I have learnt, specifically from this organization has made it easier for me to educate people about IBCyou don't have to have a lump to have breast cancer!  They have answered my many questions with patience, kindness and speed.  Had I been aware of IBC, I might have questioned the bruise that suddenly appeared and not simply waited on it going away, I would have seen my MD sooner and the disease would have been caught earlier not at stage IV. How many other people (men and women) are treating their bruise like I did? How many other people right now could be saved sooner with some simple education?I have been a volunteer all my life and have worked with various charities and organizations close to my heart, but without a doubt the IBCF has proven to be the most useful and meaningful, there is no doubt in my mind that the Inflammatory Breast Cancer Foundation is ethical, knowledgable and that any money they receive and spend is well spent. With more recognition (& money) this organization can and will save lives!Jane McCloughlin
INFLAMMATORY BREAST CANCER RESEARCH FOUNDATION	289155	1	/users/profile/379378	Phyllis27	Board Member	5	05/09/2016	I first became aware of the Inflammatory Breast Cancer Research Foundation because of their website, which became my "go-to" source for accurate up-to-date information about this comparatively rare cancer and the latest research about it.  I have volunteered to help answer questions that come into its toll-free number, so I know how many people have been helped by this resource that can calm fears and help connect patients to the best medical facilities in their area.   Since I have become a member of the board of directors for the IBC Research Foundation, I have been impressed by how the foundation stretches every dime and spends valuable resources so carefully.  Direct grants for research are carefully vetted by a medical board of directors and members of the board of directors.   A small organization like the IBC Research Foundation can't make huge direct research grants, but the foundation's impact on IBC research is multiplied by its Biobank with tissue samples, its patient data survey "No Lump Required," and the connections it makes with researchers at conferences and research advocacy organizations.  Much of the credit for the success of the organization goes to Ginny Mason, Executive Director, who works constantly behind the scenes encouraging recognition of the needs of the IBC community such as specific guidelines to diagnose and treat IBC and the inclusion of IBC patients in clinical trials.  When I was diagnosed with IBC in 1998, few resources were available for IBC patients.  Thanks to the IBC Research Foundation, a patient diagnosed today needn't feel alone.

Building Tomorrow Inc	88962		/users/profile/100685	Estelle R.	Volunteer	5	05/20/2011	I am a firm believer that "knowledge is power", and Building Tomorrow is actively empowering the world's underserved young people by building schools and providing them access to an education that otherwise they would not have. But what I like most is that their work does not only benefit the students in their academies. BT engages young people here in the states, who are fundraising and spreading awareness, as well as entire communities in Uganda, who come together to build and sustain the schools themselves. Their impact reaches far beyond the walls of a classroom.
Building Tomorrow Inc	88920		/users/profile/100599	nicolak	Volunteer	5	05/19/2011	There are many ways that students and people of all ages can get involved with Building Tomorrow.  I have participated in several BT fundraisers, particularly their Bike to Uganda, and the excitement and dedication of students helping students is inspiring.  The BT word deserves to be spread! 
Building Tomorrow Inc	88919		/users/profile/100596	erinelang	Volunteer	5	05/19/2011	Building Tomorrow has a bold mission that is allowing students in Uganda and in the States to find their voices and use them for change.  The most powerful part of this organization is the bold faith they have in youth overcoming the challenges of today for the benefit of tomorrow.  Anyone is incredibly lucky to be a part of their mission.
Building Tomorrow Inc	88914		/users/profile/100589	Claire M.	Volunteer	5	05/19/2011	As a volunteer and intern, the more that I learn about this organization, the more that I am impressed with its actions, employees and missions. Building Tomorrow really does "walk the talk", as one grateful community member stated at the opening of the Building Tomorrow Academy of Lutisi. (http://vimeo.com/16624334) In its six short years of operation, Building Tomorrow has fulfilled its mission to build schools and support primary education in Uganda. They have completed and opened 7 academies across the country, and is set to break ground on a 15th location by the end of this year. I am so impressed with the way that this non-profit (or "social-profit", as they call themselves) organization making such a large impact in the few years after its inception. Building Tomorrow is an incredible organization which I would highly recommend any and everyone to get involved with.

I have done most anything you can think of over the years to try and help my son communicate as he has been what we call severely autistic and non verbal. We were taught to approach him from a behavioral standpoint for years. I listened to the experts.  I now,  because of the willingness of Optimal Rhythms  and their staff,  look at autism In a completely different way.  I now have communication through typing with my son. He has been an advocate in his education,  medical issues , and every other area. He struggles with his body tremendously and so much right now is due to medical issues,which we would have assumed were behaviors before. He has access to a general education program now and peers that he can communicate, encourage and receive support from also. He has a staff that gives the supports he needs for his body and emotions. For example, when a medical issues landed him in the hospital for 3 days almost the entire staff came to visit.    We are so thankful for Optimal Rhythms and ACCESS Academy. The entire staff goes above and beyond and everyone works together.   Josh also won the self advocacy award from the Autism Society of Indiana, which of course is something we had never would have imagined. I know his goals are to be a missionary, an advocate, and get his diploma and attend college. These are not goals in had ever imagined for him and I am ashamed to say that now.

The board takes its fiduciary duties very seriously; we meet all of the governance standards of multiple accrediting agencies. Board meetings are open to the public and "transparency" is written into the bylaws. The staff have long tenures within the organization and the senior staff, in fact, are considered experts in the field statewide.  While every organization can become even better -- and Stone Belt is no exception here -- my gifts of time, money and expertise have always been used appropriately and carefully.

They are the nicest, most caring people you will ever meet and, they take such good care of all the animals. They do their best on finding the best homes for all the animals.

We drove from Cincinnati to help the animals shelter in Indiana just to realize our youngest kids were afraid of our forever match (we have two toddlers and two teens). We were heartbroken walking back into the shelter and then a nice woman suggested we look at another dog. I was hesitant at first, I'd den a lot of research and thought I'd narrowed down what breed and age would best fit my family, but I gave the puppy a try anyway. We loved him! The ladies even were nice enough to show us video they had taken of him riding on a scooter. He has been the best fit and I would have never given him a try if it wasn't for their kind worlds and upbeat spirit when it comes to placing their animals. They didn't pressure or rush us but instead left us alone with the dog so we could play and make sure he was indeed what we had come for. These ladies are so dedicated to their work and love the animals...each and every one!!

Chiara Home Incorporated	55188		/users/profile/57200	DebM	Client Served	5	10/22/2010	I'd need to tell you about a very special woman who has helped so many families and has even given up her own bed for her "special" guests.       Her name is Sister Gretchen Clark and she runs Chiara Home.   It's a wonderful place that gives respite to families that have a member with disabilities.   Sister refuses no one who needs help, regardless of their finances.   She's supported strictly by donations.   She has been in operation since 1992 and has tried so hard to be there for her "families."  There are so many stories, but I can only tell you mine.  My mother died November 3, 2004 and I became guardian to my brother Davey who has Downs Syndrome.   I promised my Mother  I would always take care of Davey and protect him. No matter what happened, I would always keep him safe. My life changed so much after my mother died.  There was no place to take Davey to that I felt was  safe and affordable.  I needed to go to work to support us. I had already lost one of the jobs I had. By the time I found Chiara Home and Sister Gretchen I was feeling lost and very scared.  With tears in my eyes,  I talked to Sister and explained everything---my worries and my fears.   She put her arm around me and told me everything was going to be OK.   No one is ever turned away from Chiara Home.   I explained about our limited finances and she said we'd work it out--that Chiara Home would be there for us. Sister Gretchen works 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  I believe she has even  worked without salary/benefits to keep Chiara Home open for the families who desperately need her.I don't know what my brother and I would have done without her and Chiara Home. She's our own unsung heroine.   Chiara Home has made a difference in so many lives...   I know the difference it's made in ours.Sincerely, Deborah Marchesi & David Guido

Many of them are adoptable with a little understanding and all have a forever home at the shelter. I like going to help at the shelter. The cats are not caged (except in special circumstances) and they all come running to see you looking for attention. They love to 'help' with chores around the shelter, especially 'pet the cat' jobs. If you are a cat lover, this is the place to go for extra kitty time!

Some that can't be adopted come here for their forever home.  It should be called Cats Heaven because they are all cared for no matter what their circumstances.  Anyone looking for a cat should come here, they are in every shape and color.   I now have two cats, one of which adopted ME at Cats Haven.

Voices of Indiana	100129	2	/users/profile/121684	Emily Taylor	Client Served	5	11/01/2011	I joined Young Voices in the fall of 2008. I started out in a higher group than most children when they first start, and I thought it was very challenging. I wasn't sure if I would continue, because I wasn't used to having a challenge like this in the music field. My mom told me that I wasn't allowed to quit, and I was going to try it for one more semester because she thought if I quit, I would regret it. She was right. The next semester I was still pretty quiet, but I grew more fond of it as my second semester went on. I liked Young Voices a lot, then. I wasn't sure if I would do the summer musical, because I didn't know what it was all about. I decided I would try it out, and that's when my life took a turn for the best. I met many people with the same passion and love for music and performing as I did, and they were all very different. It is a very diverse group, but I absolutely love that I'm exposed to different types of people with the same passion as me. Ever since that summer musical, my life has been better than it could ever possibly be. Young Voices teaches me everything that I could ever want to know. I learn more about music every Monday night. Music isn't the only thing that it teaches me, either. It teaches me leadership skills, and it teaches me that there are wonderful people throughout the world. I love every single person that I know in Young Voices. Everyone is so beautiful, talented, non-judgemental, and kind. Other than the people I take part in Young Voices with, we have a lot of great role models. Ms. Budd is an amazing director, and she is there for you whenever you need anything. She is very patient, and she never gives up on anyone. She is nice, and she can make anyone smile on their worst days. Seeing her every day at school, and every Monday night is the best. Mrs. Johnson is also wonderful. She shares her talents with all of us, usually with a smile on her face. She is sort of quiet at times, but I love her and I love getting to see her every Monday night. I can honestly say, Young Voices is my life and I could never thank Ms. Budd, Mrs. Johnson, Mrs. Bentley, My Mom, or last but not least, My Mima enough for going through this journey with me. I love Young Voices, and I think that anyone exposed to the atmosphere of Young Voices will love it, and should be very grateful!

I can't imagine what my singing would be like without the training I received in Young Voices (YV). One of the great things about YV is that we learned to be such good singers while having fun and learning life lessons. I learned so much about singing as a group, working with others, how my voice works, different styles of music, music theory, making a difference in my community, and to always leaving a place better then I found it. In my singing now, I am always thinking of thing Mrs. Budd used to tell us and of things I learned in YV. 
Voices of Indiana	59377	1	/users/profile/64087	Sara	Board Member	5	01/03/2011	Ten years ago, an arts council education committee on which  I was sitting  was searching for program ideas for bringing a greater education in the arts to the children of our community.   I was thrilled when we settled on a children's community choir, because it would provide a program that I felt my own children would benefit from.   I have not been disappointed;  in the 9 years my children have participated in Young Voices, they have developed wonderful choral and vocal music abilities as well as a significant appreciation for the art of music.  I have served all of those years, first as a founding parent, then on our "pitch crew" of volunteers, and finally on our board when we became an independent 501c3.  It is been my priviledge to work with an Executive Director and a Creative Director who have managed to create excellent educational choral opportunities in our community not only for children but adults as well.  I also have been very glad to be a part of an organizatin that has truly made a difference in our community and has met and exceeded our original hopes and intentions from our founding years.  This is an organization I plan to continue to support with my time and resources for years to come so that many others can reap the benefits that my family and many others have already experienced.
Horse-Angels Inc	193443		/users/profile/252643	freedomreins	Client Served	5	01/29/2014	Horse-Angels is a unique horse rescue organization in that the owner, Sue Whitman, is a vet.  She is able to care for some of the most difficult horses that other horse rescues would not be able to handle.  Because of Sue's ability to care for the worst of the worst horses, her expenses are also much greater than other horse rescues in order to provide the proper vet care, meds, specific types of food, specific farrier services, additional training of horses, etc.  Whereas, many other horse rescues will only accept those horses that they know that they can re-home.  Sue has poured her entire heart and soul in to the horse rescue and she is one of the most amazing people I have ever known.  100% of donations go directly to caring for the horses.  She gives so much to others, and even provides her vet skills to other non-profit animal organizations in her area.  Not only does Sue give so much to the horses, but she also helps so many with their small animal issues providing low cost services to people who could not afford a vet otherwise.  Sue is a Rare Avis...she did not become a vet to make a small fortune.  She became a vet knowing that she wanted to help horses and she also cares so much for the people that she encounters from horses to small animals.  
Horse-Angels Inc	22748	3	/users/profile/23753	Horse Lover	Donor	5	11/16/2009	Horse-Angels is a must see and should support for horse lovers!

I cant imagine a more nurturing environment for these wonderful animals and the care they receive from Dr. Sue is amazing.  In addition, she also ensures that they are adopted into homes where they will be safe and well cared for.  If you are looking for a horse, please consider adopting from Horse-Angels.  If you already own a horse, consider making an donation in honor of them.  Your donation will directly impact the mission and is well spent.

When April was well enough, Dr. Sue took her to her own horse trainer to work with her and see what she was capable of doing under saddle.For all of her hardships, this lovely paint mare has the sweetest disposition and a desire to please that we feel like came from the love and care she was given at Horse-Angles.  Dr. Sue takes special care in placing her horses, her babies, with the right people where she feels the proper care will continue and the horses will receive the love they deserve.  If one of her horses goes to another home and the adoptive family's circumstances change, Dr. Sue always leaves a stall open.
Therapeion Therapeutic Riding Center	273932		/users/profile/363247	Writer	Volunteer	5	12/07/2015	I have been volunteering at Therapeion for over a year.  I thoroughly enjoy the time spent with the riders  - some who have developmental disabilities and others who may be veterans recovering from PTSD.  Seeing participants overcome whatever challenges they are facing that day and witnessing the happiness that they express while attending sessions is so rewarding.  I feel fortunate to have the opportunity to be involved with Therapeion - this organization is changing lives!
Therapeion Therapeutic Riding Center	82647		/users/profile/91271	Rebecca W.	Volunteer	5	03/20/2011	I have been volunteering at Therapeion for 3 years now and I have loved every minute of it! Libby is great and has a lot of passion for what she does. The kids really seem to gain a lot from riding there and I have had the pleasure of seeing kids improve from semester to semester. I feel that any child with a disablity can beinfit from therapeutic riding centers just like Therapeion. I hope that Libby can continue with Therapeion, and the work she does for years to come. Rebecca

Spoiled Acres Rescue Inc	99108		/users/profile/118529	stormwatch1981	General Member of the Public	5	10/07/2011	this rescue is ran by truly devoted people. always willing to help out ANYONE without passing judgement.  they definately do not get enough support and end up having to spend their personal money to care for the animals. they need and deserve way more financial help,  and more recognition for the great things they do. they honestly love the animals and will do anything to better their lives! 
Spoiled Acres Rescue Inc	99094		/users/profile/118513	Amber234	General Member of the Public	5	10/07/2011	This is such an excellent rescue here in Dearborn County.  They are the only horse and large animal rescue and they always have plenty of animals.  They care for the animals like they are their own and most animals end up with new homes and much better "parents."

Fort Wayne Artists Guild Inc	238951	1	/users/profile/324477	artistintraining	Board Member	5	03/07/2015	I joined the Fort Wayne Artists Guild in the fall of 2010.  I'm not a professionally trained artist, more self-taught.  As a group, they have taken me in, befriended me, and accepted me as I am.  The monthly meetings have helped immensely in teaching me skills as an artist, teaching me the business side of being an artist, and having an enjoyable time in the process.  I went in thinking of myself as a beginner or a dabbler, and they have helped me see myself as an artist.  I went in hoping to be able to have something show sometime in their Ventures in Creativity annual juried show after having seen it several times at the Allen County Public Library.  I not only made it in, but all members have available to them many places around Fort Wayne to hang their works for public viewing, which is something I didn't know could be done.  They also do outreach programs.  For many years they helped with Kids' Create at the Fort Wayne Museum of Art.  Now they have a nursing home they go into to help the residents make their own art.    It's an awesome group to belong to.
Right Relations Inc	42539	1	/users/profile/43240	jennie1	Client Served	5	06/01/2010	I walked into Right Relations a crying mess.  My life was out of control and I was miserable.  The program teaches you the foundations of respect for other people, which is impossible to do if you don't have self-respect.Through learning how to care about others, you begin to see you are a valuable person, too, and that you can control your destiny by the choices you make.  These choices are founded on the goals and principles you hold, and this program teaches you how to identify the pieces to make a picture in your head of the world you want to live in.I was a mess, and still have a lot to do to become healthy, but this program is the starting point for anyone who wants to take control of life and make a better future for themselves and their kids.  Change happens at the level of the individual.  Let the change start here.
Right Relations Inc	41647	2	/users/profile/42448	chris-voors	Volunteer	5	05/28/2010	I have the privilege of teaching classes for the Family Enrichment Series from Right Relations. Most of its participants move from anger into being open & cooperative & appreciative. There are sooooo many stories that can only be described as miracles. The most important recepients are the children. They move from homes filled w. stress & anger to homes where they too learn to be cooperative & responsible. With that they are able to do what children are meant to do....to run and jump and learn and play in an atmosphere of love.
Right Relations Inc	41402	2	/users/profile/42230	teresajohnson	Volunteer	5	05/28/2010	For the last 20+ years I have had the opportunity to be touched by the Vision of Right Relations, and my life is made richer for it. First as a student, and later as a volunteer, I have learned that I have the power to change my outlook on life and all my relationships by keeping in mind the vision for my life. My work with Right Relations has also cultivated a spirit of caring about the well being of others and my role in helping to improve the conditions in the world.     As a volunteer teacher, I have watched so many people change their image of themselves and their relationships. I have witnessed parents who could not communicate, now able to converse and speak thoughtfully about about the needs of their children. I have watched women who looked sad, defensive, angry or dis-empowered learn that their dignity comes from within, from valuing themselves as women and mothers. I have watched them find the joy of opening their hearts and minds and discovering the KEY of trusting and blending these to create a fulfilling life.     I cannot imagine my life without the BEAUTY I have witnessed and personally experienced in knowing the staff and volunteers of this organization. It is proof positive that there is hope for the world, that people can truly work together for the greater good, and that we can all transform our lives for the better!
Causes For Change International	109383		/users/profile/149030	thinbranches	Volunteer	5	04/09/2012	Causes for Change Int'l has impacted my life in a very positive way. Let me share with youjust a few experiences I have had. First of all, I had never been to a third world country and I had no idea what to expect. Zully and I went to Ecuador in 1996 to explore and evaluate where the needs were in the rural parts of that country. Well we were astounded to discover there were many needs especially with people with disabilities, education, healthcare and nutrition.  Since then, I have been on eight missions with Causes for Change and each mission has been very gratifying in the difference we have made in those areas of need. We have set up clinics in many villages throughout the country and have treated thousands of people in the dental, nutrition, well-being, and education arena. I have learned how very impactful one person can be when they have a commitment like Zully has and how she continues to live her life with this purpose always in the forefront of everything she does. Sincerely,Marilyn Varn
Causes For Change International	109210		/users/profile/148748	TobbyFried	Volunteer	5	04/06/2012	My name is Tobby Fried and I have know Zully Alvarado since 1999 which was when I volunteered to go on a medical mission with her and with her organization called "Causes for Change International." What impressed me then and what impresses me now is not only Ms. Alvarado's ability to spot a need in a person or a community, but she is able to almost immediately find people and resources to successfully resolve that need in such a way that creates a symphony of teamwork. She has the astounding ability to make things happen. When someone in a village in Ecuador tells Zully Alvarado that they need a wheel chair, Zully will send 550 of them in a container. Without staff or a budget, she brings 2 to 3 medical teams and support teams of volunteers to Ecuador each year. She sets up temporary clinics where 1500-2000 are attended in a 6 day period. As if that weren't enough, Ms. Alvarado has opened 5 dental clinics in Ecuador by having dental chairs and equipment donated from the U.S. on one end, and having office space donated along with volunteering dentists and students on the other end. Again, all this she accomplishes without grants or major donations. I tremble  at the thought of what she could accomplish with substantial financial resources.  Zully Alvarado is unstoppable. She has devoted her entire life to the service of others. Each year more and more requests for help are made to her and she diligently works, makes calls, has meetings, creates fundraising events and never stops the flurry, if not the whirlwind of activity until she finds a way to fulfill that need. I have been on 5 or 6 missions with Zully Alvarado and I have seen at firsthand the divergent teams she has brought to Ecuador from the US, Australia and Jaimaica to name a few. The missions I have worked with have included, dentists, physicians, nutritionists, audiologists and even Chicago Firefighters who came and trained local firefighters in Ecuador in rescue and emergency tactics. When I think of these many amazing experiences I have seen with my own eyes, and when I think about all of the lives that have been positively impacted by the efforts of this amazing woman, there is hardly a word in the english language that can captivate the emotion I feel. Awe, respect, admiration doesn't begin to say it all, but it comes close. I think of Zully Alvardo as a champion for people in need. Assuredly, there are many good and worthy people doing wonderful things for their fellow man and woman, however, I can't think of one living person who deserves to be honored for their good deeds and contribution to humanity as does my amazing friend, Ms. Zully Alvarado. Sincerely yours, Tobby Fried
Causes For Change International	109112		/users/profile/148580	MariaJoseMorla	Volunteer	5	04/05/2012	I have been fortuitous of applying my communication skills in my volunteer work as the Social Media Administrator for Causes for Change International.  I was captivated by this organization's mission of providing aid to children, women and people living with disabilities in the Americas. One can only be inspired by Zullys story, she is the president and founder of Causes for Change. She has taken as a mission to partner with organizations to provide an effective outcome in different projects as well as to give back to her country, Ecuador. Through yearly Mission Trips volunteers have the opportunity to travel with Zully to the coast of Ecuador to provide dental hygiene as well as aid to people with disabilities. This is an organization that relies on volunteers in order to continue growing. Causes for Change International is the result of Zully's way of thinking: it only takes one person, one idea to inspire change.  I am truly honored to be a part of this wonderful organization and look forward into being part of it in the future.
Hebron House Inc	100874		/users/profile/125477	BoomerWI	Volunteer	5	11/21/2011	When my team at work was awarded a prize of $25,000 to be given to a charity, we looked for a local organization that benefitted our local community. I recommended Hebron House of Hospitality which runs shelters and assists homeless people in Waukesha (WI) County. What better use of our prize money could there be than to help those who have nothing, who have no place to live and no means for basic survival.   My work team has made a commitment to partner with the Hebron House throughout the year. We have taken up collections of food and toiletries, given cash donations, and held a clean-up/fix-up day where we painted, repaired, landscaped and cleaned three of the shelters with a team of 50 volunteers. The people at Hebron House are compassionate and dedicated to their mission.  They provide the basic needs for those who most need it, and assist them through the maze of bureaucracy to help them find a more permanent lifestyle.   Our donations and volunteer efforts were greatly appreciated by the Hebron House staff and clients.
Hebron House Inc	100645		/users/profile/123743	Eddie01	Volunteer	5	11/14/2011	My experience with Hebron House is as a member of a community volunteer group that supports the work of social service organizations in our area.  Hebron House was selected for the past three years because they have done an outstanding job of providing for the homeless in our community.  I have personally found the administration and staff to be extremely dedicated to their mission of providing for both the basic needs and personal support of those they serve.   When visiting the shelters, I noticed that the residents work together to support each other and are very engaged in their own personal care.  Everyone is so willing to pitch in and help.    
Hebron House Inc	100601		/users/profile/123458	moersfelderg	General Member of the Public	4	11/13/2011	The Hebron House help and care to the homeless and mentally ill indivuduals of Waukesha County WI. They not only do it with the logistical needs but they care for each and everyone of their guest.The problem that they are facing is that Waukesha County is one of the most afluent counties in the State, so many do not think there are homeless indivuduals and families in the city and county. The Hebron House is doing a great job this year of reaching to the community and county to increase awarness of the homeless needs.
Cooking With the Troops Inc	100088		/users/profile/121613	WendyStewart	General Member of the Public	5	11/01/2011	I have had the opportunity to interview some volunteers with Cooking with the Troops.  They did a Cuban pig roast at Brooke Army Medical Center.  Their passion for helping the military members, wounded, and their families brought tears to my eyes.  They worked so hard to give everyone a great day. Everyone from the founded of the charity to those who do cooking demonstrations and who cook for the troops are dedicated and have wonderful energy.  I hope they continue their great work for our troops!

I have watched the announcements and also have recommended this organization to others who are looking for a positive and tangible way to support our military members.  I have followed and read stories of military members who have been served by Cooking with the Troops, and it is evident that this is not only a way to build morale and community, but it truly blesses those who attend the functions. 
Cooking With the Troops Inc	99907		/users/profile/121286	CEO-CwtT	Board Member	5	10/28/2011	Cooking with the Troops supports U.S. and Allied troops, their families, and caregivers through four major programs:  Food Events, Culinary Careers, Homefront Support, and Frontline Support  Food is family, it is hope, it is comfort, it is nutrition.

Terre Haute Humane Society	25506	3	/users/profile/26509	Concerned Citizen	Volunteer	2	01/13/2010	The organization is not fiscally responsible. The board of directors do not abide by the organization's by-laws. While the euthanasia rate is impressive, often the results of temperament tests on the dogs are ignored so that the animals can be sent to rescue.Volunteers are often made to feel unwelcome.
Terre Haute Humane Society	19067	2	/users/profile/20310	lisa	General Member of the Public	1	10/21/2009	THHS has lost its way.  Despite multiple very successful fundraisers, the board claims there is no money for vetting animals - especially cats.  Where is all of that money going?  Best case scenario - into a fund for building a new building.  Worst case scenario - use your imagination.  Most recently they have begun euthanizing cats out of hand insted of letting them go out to rescues or into foster homes at the same time as they have just changed the rules to allow the city to bring in much larger numbers of cats than ever before.  They have also cut off all funding for medications and vetting for cats.  The commuity at large needs to step forward and demand that the cats get equal treatment with the dogs.  Perhaps the HS's books need to be audited as well to findout where all the money from fundraisers is being spent.  The board is now a closed clique - all new board members are approved by the president and her friends.  And they put on only their friends.  General membership no longer has a say-so in any HS policies.  Good people are beign driven off the board by the hateful atmosphere and are afradi to stick up for each other at the meetings.
Terre Haute Humane Society	11139	2	/users/profile/13083	THHSDonations	Board Member	5	09/28/2009	The Terre Haute Humane Society has effectively reduced euthanasia in the community by incorporating and being involved with several new programs in our community.  These programs include: low-cost spay-neuter, free spay neuter for the parents of puppies or kittens taken in at the shelter. Most recently we have been involved with the community HOPE program which targets families on assistance by providing free spay/neuter for their pets.  We have increased adoptions by joining with PetSmart Charities adoption center at PetSmart, monthly Mutts at the Mall adoption events, and other adoption events at community events as well as businesses.  We have a weekly presentation on both local TV stations, and a weekly article in our newspaper, each showcasing an available animal for adoption.

Born Identity Ministries International Inc	251857		/users/profile/339851	Charlis C.	Volunteer	5	08/06/2015	Born Identity began the mission in Cameroon in 2011 with only the money in their pockets and love in their hearts. They are a group of like minded individuals who take time from their regular working lives and families to travel across the world to this special place. Today they are building an orphanage in Kumba, Cameroon to provide a nurturing home for local children to improve the quality of their future. These children are underprivileged and marginalized by the circumstances of their community. Born Identity strives to eradicate this misfortune through the Cameroon Orphanage Project. Currently, the orphanage structure stands with no roof to endure the long rainy season in Cameroon. Even so, Born Identity pushes forward with fundraising endeavors and annual mission trips to Cameroon. They are dedicated to seeing the complete construction of the unit that will house nearly two hundred displaced children.

I am so disgusted with them I have been wearing the same glasses for 10 years. I think I need some NEW ONES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
INDIANA STATE COUNCIL OF ROOFERS HEALTH AND WELFARE FUND	192238	4	/users/profile/250993	tstro380	Client Served	1	01/08/2014	Last year I was notified by my doctors office that my bills were not getting paid by my Insurance, so I called Indiana state council of roofers health and welfare fund and was told they did not receive my paperwork. This was about 3 months after  we sent it in to the address provided and we had not been notified by the Insurance company. So we asked them to mail another copy and we filled it out and we resent it, and once again the doctors office called and said they were still not getting paid, So we asked them to mail another copy. When we received it we filled it out for the third time and sent it to the address provided P.O. Box 5767 Lafayette In. 47903-5769 So once again I contacted the Insurance company and was told they had not received anything from us. Once again I was informed that the bills were not getting paid and were going to collections, so I contacted the Insurance company and spoke with someone in costumer service and ask for the form to be e-mailed to me and she did but said she would need to have the original forms mailed to her and we did this. So I call this morning and I am told that they don't e-mail forms and that their mail goes through a mail sorting company. I told her that I felt that this was a way for them to deny claims because if the mail sorting company does not deliver your mail to them then your claim is denied even though you have done everything expected. I think this company needs to be Investigated for Insurance fraud because I don"t think I'm the only one this happening to.

The organization is exceptionally well run with Dr. William Forgey, and a wonderful team of dedicated volunteers, ensuring that the community receives a sustainable and cooperative form of care while ensuring learners have a chance to gain valuable international medical experience. In a country where almost 40% of the GDP is attributable to faith-based charities, this group stands unique as a secular humanitarian and teaching organization with no hidden agenda.   Please support generously. Dr. Ankit Kapur MB, BCh, BAO

Char Fasson Childrens Fund	98669	3	/users/profile/117212	Viveca	Volunteer	5	09/30/2011	It is not often that you come across an organization that works so tirelessly for others. This children's home, founded in 1972, provides a home for up to 100 homeless and abandoned boys. No boy is turned away. These boys are fed, clothed, educated and emotionally supported to help them break the cycle of poverty and to give them hope, focus and direction for the future. With only two full time staff on meagre wages ($35 a month) all funds go into the boys welfare. They are taught to fish, farm, sew and cook so that they have a livelihood and independence. Boys that leave the home at adulthood are encouraged to come back and help the little ones. Fundraisers from around the world are sought as there is still so much to do. Future plans involve a home for girls. More information, contact details, and photos about this home  and how you can become involved can be found on: www.causes.com &  http://charfassonchildrensfund.org & also a Facebook page.

Saba Association Ltd	122945		/users/profile/167497	SabaAssociation	Client Served	5	09/24/2012	SABA' is an awesome nonprofit.  They set-up a full fundraising campaign for a project we are doing in Chicago. The project can be seen at www.JamesPaytonProject.org.  SABA' has gone above and beyond the call of duty by creating, hosting and funding the campaign out-of-pocket.  It was a pleasure working with their team of professionals.  The project is well structured, totally transparent and fun.  If you are a charity or even a for-profit and have a vision to help the less fortunate SABA' can help you with your philanthropy. Good luck and God bless you SABA' Association.

They are not committed to the best interest of the dogs or the families- we had to return the dog we adopted from them after 8 days because she growled, lunged and and trued to bite our children.  They refused to give us a refund, even after the dog was rehomed less than a week later.  They have been fined by Massachusetts on many occasions for illegal transporting dogs to MA adoptees.  Shady does not even begin to describe them.  
Lucky Lab Rescue Inc	260610	1	/users/profile/349181	Junemike1	Client Served	5	10/01/2015	We can not say enough about Lucky lab.  The people that work there are so wonderful.  They rescue labs of all kinds from kill shelters.  They nurse them back to good health, foster them until they find good homes,  then transport them across the country to loving families.We have got two dogs from them.  They are kind and Truely care about the well being of the dogs.  Our puppy was part of a litter of eight pups that were abandoned at a kill shelter.  They were in pretty bad shape. They were full of hook worm and tape worm.  Lucky Lab scooped them up and got them healthy and got loving families for all of them. We love our new addition and we will give her a great life.  If it was not for Lucky Lab those puppy would not be here today giving joy to so many.

World Missionary Press Inc	155495	1	/users/profile/206419	r g	General Member of the Public	1	04/20/2013	This organization sends millions of religious booklets out every year, on the premiss that they are saving souls (apparently their god leaves it up to the random chance whether poeple get saved or not). The booklets indicate that homosexuality is akin to murder and invokes eternal punishment in fire, including tasteless pictures of people burning in flames. Thier literature meets the definition of HATE SPEECH in many jurisdictions because it incites hatred against a segment of the population based on their sexual orientation.This business should not be subsidized by tax exemptions and preferential treatment as a "charity".They should be shut dwn.

I assist in the medical clinics, primarily checking the vision of our under-resourced visitors. We give away, free of charge, eyeglasses, reading glasses and sunglasses that have been donated by our friends, families and through special collections at our churches, schools and other contacts.  Being able to give a young mother eyeglasses so she can read to her child, or to a father so he can make a living for his family is an amazing opportunity.   Hearts In Motion has given me an opportunity to change lives for the better, including my own. I have been able to see what is truly important -- to help others, to show love and compassion to those who have little.  It makes me appreciate the things in life that have nothing to do with money or status.

Evansville Rescue Mission Inc	192326	1	/users/profile/251108	alsa	Client Served	5	01/09/2014	       There are so many wonderful things to say about this organization that I'm certain there isn't enough space in this box to express them.  So let me just very briefly say that as an ex-felon newly released from prison after having served ten straight years that this organization holds true to it's name in that I was truly "rescued."  While I had imagined a homeless shelter that would be dark and cold, unsanitary, packed with unsightly drunkards, thieves, drug addicts, and uncaring staff, I was staggered by the great force of love and compassion I met upon stepping through the doors.  The place was unbelievably clean and modern, with flat screen televisions and pleasant and inspiring artwork adorning the walls.  I felt as if I had entered a sanctuary.  The atmosphere moved me from dread of the future to new hope and confidence.  I no longer worry about the future as I have no doubt about the genuineness of the people who make the Evansville Rescue Mission possible because I experience it daily.    By Anthony L. Smith                                                                                       
CMF International	147621	1	/users/profile/195288	Tracy38	Volunteer	5	01/03/2013	I traveled to Kenya twice as part of a short term mission team with groups from CMF, and I can't tell you what an amazing experience it was each time.  The first trip, in 2008, was absolutely life changing for me. We were able to visit Mary & Wallace Kamau and their schools and ministries in Nairobi, as well as travel out to Maasai medical clinics.  I have never felt closer to God in all of my life then I did during those two trips.  The people we met were so wonderful. Going back the second time felt like going home, truly.   I have traveled pretty extensively in my life, and although the areas we went to in Kenya were some of the poorest I've ever been in, these people had the love of God in their hearts, and what they did not have in the material sense, they had more abundantly in the spiritual sense. And the children....oh, how I loved those smiling, happy faces.  The singing, the holding hands, the playing soccer, the painting finger nails, the hugs!  I now know what Heaven must be like.  Would I go again, or tell you to go?  In a heartbeat.  The CMF staff were kind, courteous and knowledgable.  Every chance I get to talk to someone about Kenya, or the work that the fabulous folks at CMF are doing there, you bet I take the time to share.  I pray for all of these folks regularly, and encourage you, if you are reading this, to ask God how you can be used, how you can be His "hands and feet" in another country.  Maybe He's not calling you to go, but to support.  And that support can change lives. You don't have to be a doctor or nurse to be used in mighty ways there.   And believe me, it will touch and completely change your life.  Pray about it, and act on what you are lead to do.  Step out in faith.  Maybe if I'm lucky, I'll see you there!

CMF International	147568	1	/users/profile/195180	Kathy94	Donor	4	01/02/2013	CMF has opened the door for me to see how to make a difference in people's lives from many perspectives, and how I can be a partner with the work through my contributions, short-term trips, or cheerleading my church to be involved with CMF. First of all, this organization is exactly what it says it is. My money goes where it's supposed to go. I receive regular information on CMF's ministries and activities. The website is informative (cmfi.org). Through CMF I get to see holistic work that cares about people physically, emotionally, and spiritually. I've learned about how to use Community Health Evangelism, how to work with university students, life in Asia's big cities and East Africa's slums, planting churches in First World cities  and rural villages, helping the poor through microfinance and child sponsorship, touching the middle and upper classes through friendship, Bible studies, and kindness. CMF attracts personnel who reach for excellence in whatever part of the organization they serve.
Middle Way House Inc	82602		/users/profile/91161	jean	Board Member	5	03/18/2011	I have worked on women's issues for decades-- and seldom have I seen an organization that addresses all aspects of women's lives -- from being there when  women are shattered, to giving them a sheltering place to heal and learn and grow, to providing her job training, loving childcare,  and  opportunities  to rebuild her sense of worth.  Middle Way is more than an emergency shelter: there is long-term housing for women and children, there is community development,  there is entrepreneurial creativity.  Middle Way's businesses  build on clients' new skills,  Middle Way's commitment to a sustainable future led to  renovating and reusing an older building and making it green while also providing more space for women, children.  It's a model of what can be done with creativity, ingenuity, and giving women safe environments.
Middle Way House Inc	82582		/users/profile/91132	Laurie	Board Member	5	03/18/2011	Middle Way House is a shining example of helping women fleeing domestic violence restart their lives.  Through a continuum of services from rape crisis to educational and employment assistance, Middle Way works with women to find their own strengths and build the self-confidence necessary to forge a healthy and productive life for themselves and their children.  The whole focus is on empowerment and independence.  Middle Way serves over 2,000 women and children a year in a five-county area in south-central Indiana.  The proof of the success of their empowerment model is their recidivism rate:  for women who stay with Middle Way's programs for three weeks or more, only 2-18% returned to their abusers in the last ten years.  For those staying less than three weeks, the recidivism rate is 18-33%.  Bloomington, Indiana is very fortunate, and very proud, that Middle Way is part of our community!

Hope In Action	51151	2	/users/profile/51733	cwcsnepal	General Member of the Public	5	08/27/2010	Hope In Action provided us with some vegetable seeds to establish an orphanage garden. Our children and youths are acquiring skills for growing vegetables while producing much-needed food. Hope In Action also provided two sewing machines and supplies to start a sewing business. The progress within the first few months has been tremendous. The main aim of the project is to generate income to support the daily needs of the orphanage and to provide basic training of sewing skills to our youths. Both aims have been accomplished in a very positive way.Some of our youths have quickly learned basic skills of sewing.  The income we earned paid for some of the daily basis needs of the orphans. If we could increase the equipments & materials that we need for bigger scale of production, then we can surely generate enough funds to cover all of our operational expenses and care for more youths. We are very grateful for the confidence and support that Hope In Action provided to our small, newly-formed organization. It has really helped sustain our operations and has provided hope that we can be successful as we expand our care to more children and youths.

Helping Hands Unlimited	48872	3	/users/profile/50079	matthew2u	Volunteer	1	07/28/2010	I lived at Albany Helping Hands Shelter for three years frome 04-07 and was the first person to graduate college from Albany Helping Hands shelter. My name is Matthew Montpas my phone number is 541 670 8774 please contact me before you give any more money to the shelter as Pastor Les Bailey has retired. I have information reguarding the shelter that is very unsettleing to me to say the least. I think you will find it will also make you ill. I graduated at Linn Benton Community College in 2007 with an associate degree of applied science degree in medical assisting. With that said the accountant that worked for Albany Helping hands has resigned after 10 years at the shelter. He did a wonderful job making sure everything was transparent and easy to verify. Now the new Executive Director Paul N Barnes was hired to replace the honarable Pastor Les Bailey and has been put into the helm at Helping Hands. I started looking into Pauls resume and what I found was mis-information, and information that is inaccurate, misleading and just plain lies. He claims to be a minister licensed to marry and counsel people but he bought his license on-line and did not earn it. After finding out that I was researching his back ground he called me on the phone and threatned to have me arrested if I didn't tell him where I got my information. He wanted to shoot the messenger and not in anyway answer to the message. Paul N Barnes instead of answering the questions about his resume instead took my church priveledges away, bible study time away, and all other means of speaking with the guests that stay there at the shelter. Refusing to answer questions about the time spent in prison which he lied in his resume and said he was operating a home based business at the time he was inprisoned and why he lied on his resume. Paul chose to try to discredit me instead. I took this to the board of Helping Hands and was told that they wanted to discuss giving me back my church privledges back and not the resume. I had broken no shelter rules yet he took my privledges anyway. He was trying to silence me. I was told by a membor of the board that if I told them where I got my information that, I would have everything restored. Like I said before I had broken no rules. Pauls background is filled with things like bankruptcy, kidnaping, domestic violence and abuse. He was also sued and his buisness failed over money. The board will not address these issues and I'm putting together first hand testimonies of people who have worked for him and any that have first hand testimony about Mr. Barnes. He is also counseling guests in an anger management class and has no counseling degree. He himself yelled and screamed at me in the last two weeks right in front of his whole staff. This is not a man that should be counseling anyone. Please do not give any more money to the shelter untill your questions reguarding the new Excutive Director have been answered. I'm waiting on a back ground check for Paul N Barnes right now I paid for it myself. I will make it public along with all the testimonies to the local Demacratic Hearold news organization to make this matter public. This is so we can discuss and find out the truth about this man. Many organizations and churches and people in the community deserve to no the truth in this matter. Matthew Montpas I tried to get the board of directors to address this matter three times now and they have declined to do anything about this matter. The president of the board should resign for not dealing with this matter. This is not a compaign. I want this matter to be dicussed in the community and to get the truth and try to get to the bottom of how this could happen in the first place.

HEARTLAND SMALL ANIMAL RESCUE INC	237292	2	/users/profile/321771	ZeusMittens	Client Served	5	01/26/2015	My girlfriend and I adopted our second dog from Heartland.  Heartland regularly holds adoption events at the local PetsMart and we met a dog we really fell in love with there.  The volunteers were more than happy to tell us all about the dog we were interested in.  The foster parent for the dog told us all about him.  They had a brief, conversational interview with us and had us fill out an application to make sure we were a suitable family for the dog we wanted to adopt.   One thing that really impresses me about Heartland is the effort they make to ensure that the animal up for adoption is going to a good home.  They want it to go somewhere not just where it is loved, but also somewhere where it will fit in with other family members, pets, kids, where it has a nice yard to run in (if it's a dog that needs that), and with a family they know can properly take care of it.  Their goal is to find the animals a quality forever home and prevent these animals from ending up back at a shelter, which happens all too often when the animals aren't properly matched up with a family.   Another thing that impressed me about Heartland is how dedicated the volunteers are to the animals in their care.  The foster parent of our dog regularly checked in with us after our adoption to make sure everything was going well and the dog was acclimating well into our home.  Shortly after we adopted our dog from Heartland, he got loose in our neighborhood.  He was a very skittish dog at first and ran away from everyone.  We called one of the volunteers to tell them and within a half hour there were over 15 Heartland volunteers on foot and in car searching the neighborhood for our lost dog.  They helped us search for well over 8 hours that day before we called it a night around 11:00 pm.  They were planning to have volunteers back out searching the next day but luckily in the middle of the night our dog came back.  I can't explain how much it meant to us that all those volunteers were just willing to drop everything they were doing to help us look for our lost dog.   There are many animal adoption organizations in the area but what makes Hearltand a cut above the rest is the caring and dedication of their volunteers.  
HEARTLAND SMALL ANIMAL RESCUE INC	222443	1	/users/profile/286151	DissatisfiedWithHeartland	Client Served	1	10/13/2014	I am appalled by the unethical behavior and complete lack of integrity of the dog adoption coordinator at Heartland Small Animal Rescue. After an egregious error, South Bend Animal Care and Control gave away the dog (Mya) upon which I had a pending adoption a mere hours before I was to adopt her. She was given to Heartland. I immediately called the adoption coordinator from Heartland (twice). She confirmed that they did have Mya. I told her that I would take Mya THAT DAY. I could meet her or whoever had Mya in less than an hour. She told me that she could not adopt out a dog until I had filled out an application and encouraged me to do so. I immediately did. She promised that she would give me a call on Monday. That call never came. I called her again on Friday, October 10th in the afternoon. She did not return that call either. On Saturday, October 11th, I went to PetSmart in South Bend for the adoption event that Heartland holds weekly. I met her, who informed me that Mya had been adopted just last night. I asked why she never called me. These are the reasons she gave: 1. She was waiting to hear from South Bend Animal Control to see if they wanted the dog back. She never heard from them. Why then, I asked, did she allow Mya to be adopted by someone, if she was waiting for animal control? I never received an answer to this. 2. She said that my vet references did not check out, but it clearly said on my application that all of my dogs vaccinations and heartworm preventative are from VIP PetCare clinic. Additionally, my vet has records of these vaccinations, and I have the receipts for them.  3.  She said she had been busy. Interestingly, I had called her and left a message on Friday afternoon. Too busy to call me, but still able to take the foster familys call just hours later.  South Bend Animal Care and Control attempted to retrieve the dog from the adoption coordinator, but she refused. Despite knowing that there was already a pending adoption and despite having an adopter immediately available, she decided to allow one of her friends to adopt the dog rather than even give me the courtesy of a callback. I appreciate that the volunteers at Heartland are just thatvolunteers. Ethically, the adoption coordinator should have called me at some point in this process. Instead, she was simply going to wait for me to give up. By the power of sheer incompetence on the part of South Bend Animal Care and Control and an abhorrent lack of ethics on the part of Heartland Small Animal Rescue, I am unable to adopt the dog that I fell in love with. My heart is broken, and I can only hope that this message will save others from the same pain and frustration. Adopt from a reputable shelter.

I love that this group is so willing to take the animals into their homes.  Some fosters have an amazing number of pets in their homes waiting for forever homes.  They work with the animals to socialize them and go out of their way to get very sick animals healthy.  The animals are neutered before they are adopted out.  Hard to place animals do find homes.  Adopters agree to return the animal to ARPO if they can no longer provide for it.  If you are looking for a group to donate, please consider ARPO.

I personally was involved when they first got started back around 1995 or 1996, but have since had other obligations to tend to, but still donate and attend some of their events. They are very dedicated to the mission or promoting "responsible pet owners" and the adoption of unwanted or surrendered/found pets. 
BLOOMINGTON AREA BIRTH SERVICES	43484	1	/users/profile/44352	jennifer46	Volunteer	5	06/10/2010	I have played the role of client, volunteer, donor and am currently considering joining the Board of Directors at Bloomington Area Birth Services (BABS).  This organization has literally altered the course of my life as a parent in ways that I never could have imagined; I am without a doubt a better person, friend, wife, community member and mother because of the resources provided at BABS.  My experience with BABS began when I took the Childbirth Education course.  An eight week course focused on labor and delivery, breastfeeding and post-partum considerations, this class prepared me and my husband for the process of delivering our son, feeding our son and caring for ourselves and our new baby in the weeks and months after his birth.  Without this course, birth would have been a frightening and overwhelming time; because of the course we knew what to expect, as well as what was important to us as a family during birth.  In the weeks and months following our son's birth, BABS provided space for me to come with my newborn to talk with other mothers, get insight into sleep, nursing and other pressing new parent concerns and to simply feel welcome with all the messiness that comes with a newborn.  Although babies are welcome in many places, they are often less welcome when they are crying or needing to nurse constantly; at BABS, mothers feel accepted and validated...what they are doing and feeling is normal, and to allow new mothers to realize this allows them to feel confident and competent in their ability to mother well. The breastfeeding support provided through the Nurse and Chat program is priceless for our community. I often tell expecting mothers to make a point of coming to the first meeting after their new babies have arrived, even if it is the first place they take their baby!  Breastfeeding is not easy in the early weeks of motherhood, and without an excellent support network, research has shown success rates drop dramatically.  BABS is a resource for women who are struggling to initiate breastfeeding, are working to resolve the balance between nursing and working outside the home, adjusting to nursing a toddler or a second child and everything in between.  Ann Marie, the lactation consultant who hosts Nurse and Chat, literally changes the course of mothers and babies' lives each month at this meeting--helping women who are on the brink of giving up breastfeeding see that they will not only survive, but that they will thrive!After the first couple of months mothering and being a 'BABS mama', I decided I needed to volunteer.  I had been given so much without giving much of anything to BABS; what I had the most of was time.  What started as folding newsletters led to helping solicit donations for the annual gala auction, helping host Nurse and Chat and most recently facilitating New Mom Support groups. Now that my son is an 'older baby', I have found my support network of other mothers; these are women without whom I honestly cannot imagine my days.  My identity as a mother, and in turn my son's childhood, has been defined largely by the sense of community I gained from the services BABS offers. When asked if I was willing to commit to helping facilitate the New Mom Group, I knew it was the right thing for me to do.  These groups run for eight weeks and meet weekly for 90 minutes.  They provide space for mothers of newborns to discuss their experiences, emotions, relationships and challenges.  After watching the evolution of these new mothers into confident, connected and loving mothers, I was more than happy to agree to volunteer for the next eight week group.  I have recently been asked to join BABS' Board of Directors.  This has been an easy commitment for me to make, as I fully believe that the services and resources that BABS provides improve our community immeasurably.  Children quite literally are the future of any community; without appropriate support for parents from pregnancy through toddlerhood, we are not truly supporting the children of our communities.  Whether it be educating families on childbirth, breastfeeding and pre- and post-natal health or providing support to families in processing their birth, building community and creating a parenting style that best suits the needs of all members of the family, BABS has something to offer every expecting or new parent in Southern Indiana.
BLOOMINGTON AREA BIRTH SERVICES	43440	7	/users/profile/44295	cynthia15	Board Member	5	06/09/2010	After finding out that I was pregnant my husband and I decided that we needed to take a childbirth education class. We knew that with all of the questions that we had, there was no way a standard one-day class would even come close to what we wanted and a friend had suggested that we could take a longer class at a local non-profit group. From the moment that we arrived at our first childbirth education class at Bloomington Area Birth Services, we knew that we had made the right decision. We were welcomed into the class instantly and our first class was designed to look at what we knew about birth already and how accurate, or inaccurate as the case may be, birth is portrayed.Through the childbirth class we learned about ourselves, our bodies, how normal labor develops, comfort measures, and how to deal with complications that arise as well as helping develop a birth plan (a list of things that we did or did not want to happen during labor and childbirth). The class helped me become a more informed parent, not only about childbirth, but empowered me to research ask questions about medical care and parenting in general.donationsAfter my child was born, I continued to utililze the services of Bloomington Area Birth Services. I frequently attended Parent-Baby Playtime and Nurse and Chat. I could continue to bond with my child while being around other parents, many of whom shared similar questions and concerns as I. The relaxing atmosphere gave me a chance to talk with other moms about everything from nursing bras to how we were all sleep deprived but surviving. I still see most of the families from my birth class and those parent-baby playtimes and continue keep in touch as our children grow up. While we are all at different stages of our lives in our family and career, the bond that we created in the class has helped us remain friends throughout the years. I truly feel that BABS has become my community.BABS has helped me by:    * Providing education on labor, childbirth, breastfeeding, and how to take care of a newborn    * Willingness to answer even my silliest questions during childbirth classes    * Providing access to knowledgeable staff    * Supporting my birth plan    * Providing information about doulas and local doulas    * Creating a relaxing atmosphere to meet other moms    * Providing a library with information for pregnant and new moms    * Creating an atmosphere of community

The staff was terrible so I spoke with one of the Unit Managers who explained why.  The directors all make around $100,000 but the rest of the workers barely get minimum wage.  This means they are always hiring and the people they get aren't good.  The directors get bonuses if they save money so they cut pay and benefits for the workers so they get more money.  I tried to complain but it's run by a company called LCS and they never once returned my emails or phone calls.  I feel so guilty that we put my mom there.

Gleaners Food Bank of Indiana, Inc.	198079	1	/users/profile/258765	Lloyd-M	Client Served	5	04/16/2014	I've only been to the Pantry (Community Cupboard) side of the Gleaners Facility.  At this time I have been one one occasion, though I may visit again if the need arises. The line to get in was quite lengthy out side the doors, zig zagging  between the parking lot and the sidewalk when I last visited. The time I got into line, until I physically went thru the doors and entered the facility was approximately  two and a half hours.  While in line other "clients" mentioned that this line was longer than usual.  The staff was courteous,  and a staff member circulated thru the line checking that the clients had required ID/mail and signed the clients in on clipboards to try and expedite.   Another staff member also circulated thru the line distributing Ice Cold bottled water; which was refreshing in the heat.  Once thru the doors and in the "client distribution/service area"  the Community Cupboard Pantry was very clean, neatly and adequately stocked and staffed.  The staff was very courteous and helpful.  There were several stations/tables that you circulated thru in the inner line to receive the supplies/commodities that they were distributing.  I received various canned items, some dry foods including bags beans and bags of rice.  They also provided me with some dairy items and refrigerated meat/protein items, as well as some breads/bakery items.  They also provided a couple of deli-style sandwiches that were apparently donated by major retailers that were close to the printed "best-by dates" and were still quite fresh and tasty and to me was quite the "treat".  It took me between 10-15 minutes inside going from "station" to station receiving the foods that they were distributing.  Over all I felt quite blessed to receive a variety of good high quality food supplies in a neat, clean, modern and  well maintained facility, staffed by courteous, caring individuals in my time of need.  Thank you "Community Cupboard"  and thank You, Gleaners.

Year after year the facility breeds baby tigers to be used in "pay to play" schemes to make money. This facility breeds animals, sells animals, and exploits animals, and has been in violation of animal welfare laws repeatedly.

The recipients are extremely grateful to have their personal battles recognized for having demonstrated courage and "mettle" with a medal.
Medals4mettle Incorporated	169569		/users/profile/224742	dklmdc	Volunteer	5	09/13/2013	Endurance races, whether Half Marathons, Marathons, Half Iron Triathlons (70.3 miles), Iron-distance Triathlons (140.6 miles), or even longer events, are tough.  But, as Medals4Mettle points out, someone is in a tougher race than you right now.  Those of us who race in endurance sports chose to do so.  Cancer, however, along with thousands of other illnesses or debilitating accidents, does not ask who wants to participate.  Those selected by cancer, or caught in the wrong place at the wrong time, suddenly find themselves in the race of their lives.  They just have to keep fighting, every day, and not for bragging rights, a cool t-shirt or a medal, but for survival.  Medals4Mettle collects finishers medals from the racers and distributes them to those in tougher races -- the sick and injured -- worldwide.  I am an endurance athlete, and have completed multiple marathons and and Ironman.  The medals I earned were special to me.  Shortly after my Dad was diagnosed with cancer,  I ran in my most difficult race yet, the Great Wall of China Marathon.  Suddenly, giving a medal away didnt seem hard after all.  I kept the ribbon off of the medal, and Medals4Mettle put a fancy new one on and presented it to my Dad.  Im told he cried.  He immediately ordered a display case for it.  He e-mailed me, saying he, a professional writer, did not have the words to tell me how much it meant to him.  Then he unexpectedly passed away from a massive stroke a few days later.  That medal went to Dad, and the rest of my medals will go to whomever Medals4Mettle thinks needs them the most.  My races were tough, but they sure werent as tough as cancer.

They have always been friendly, my animals have been wonderfully taken care of and seem to bounce back from surgery better than when I have used other area vets.

BLOOMINGTON PETS ALIVE INC	108017	3	/users/profile/146737	Christina17	General Member of the Public	1	03/18/2012	We sent two of our cats to Pets Alive one to be spayed, and the other to be neutered. I agree with the bottom reviewer in that my boy cat came home a mess. I was assured by the group that they traveled with for the clinic that it was safe. I told them the history of my animals. Our kitties were bottle fed from about a month old after being found abandoned by my sons. I was never consulted about potential dangers of the surgery, or the fact that my kitties could be in danger because they would just be receiving their first round of shots that day. Needless to say, we just buried our boy today, a month later. 230 Dollars later at the local vet (I should have taken him to in the first place) countless shed tears, hours medicating, comforting, and trying to save the life of our sick boy. I had to leave numerous messages with Pet's Alive, and upon finally speaking to the person in charge, was told that basically I should have known this information already. That it was all my fault, and they are not culpable. Never take your pets to this group, I feel as if they murdered my pet.
WABASH COUNTY HISTORICAL MUSEUM INC	152182		/users/profile/203284	katesgram2000	General Member of the Public	5	04/05/2013	When you think small town you do not think amazing museum but you would be wrong in the case of the Wabash County Historical museum. While our town might be small our museum is wonderful and has something for everyone in the family. They also have different displays that run for a time and then are replaced by another one. For instance they had one about Harley Davidson Motorcycles and one about World War 2-just to name two. There is always something new and different to see and do.
WABASH COUNTY HISTORICAL MUSEUM INC	99039		/users/profile/118415	Becki W.	Volunteer	5	10/06/2011	I want to tell you about a wonderful museum in a quiet little Indiana town.  Wabash has been a city since the 1830's, and there has been a museum since the 1850's.  But it wasn't until five years ago that all the wonderful treasures of the county could be fully displayed and enjoyed.  That is when the new museum opened.  House on two floors, the flow of the museum guides us through the geologic formations of the county, to the early years of the Erie Canal, onto Wabash's beginnings as a town.       Our town is most notable for being the first electrically lighted city in the world.  In March, 1880, 4 Brush lamps were placed on the pinnacle of the courthouse.  People could see light from five miles away!     Another famous person from Wabash is Mark C. Honeywell, inventor of the Honeywell thermostat.  There is a very nice display on him also, as well as Frances Slocum, and a host of other people who were born in Wabash and left to find fame and fortune in the world.For instance, did you know Crystal Gale was Brenda Webb and always had brown eyes in Wabash, In?   Then there is John Corso, set director for a number of Hollywood films.  John still volunteers at the library!     On the second floor--the one that most children like--is a dig pit for dinosaur bones; an actual switchboard from the old General Telephone building, a train set that is absolutely fantastic, running from town to town throughout our county.  Two cycles offer a grand tour of the county via monitors as a "windshield", which takes the rider on a magical ride from North Manchester all the way to the Mississinewa.     There is also a revolving exhibit on the second floor.  Past exhibits have included the Lincoln Exhibit, an award-winning exhibit with art and artifacts from private collectors of the life of Lincoln.  There has been an exhibit of the Eagles Theater, a one-hundred year old institution in Wabash; and most recently the Harley-Davidson Exhibit.  This is a million dollar extravaganza which has Harley's from 1903 to the present.  It is being presented courtesy of another Wabash County institution:  Brand't Harley-Davidson.  Now in its' 60th year,  the exhibit is a rare look at motorcycles from the past and today.  If you are lucky, you might tour the museum on a day when Toni Brandt will guide you through and share stories of the motorcycles.     Finally, there is a 15 minute video in the theater that tells all about the county, the importance of three rivers running through the county and how farming is a way of life for many of our residents.       The Gift Shop is chock full of books on our state, small items for children to buy and take him, and a variety of t-shirts, handmade wooden cookware, and other      I volunteer at the library whenever guided tours for school children are needed.  Through the philanthropy of a number of individuals in the county, all children grade K-12 can use the museum FREE when accompanied on a school tour with their teacher.  How many places offer that???     The staff of the library is so very knowledgeable.  The Archives Department is filled with answers to questions so many people have about their ancestry.  The basement (off limits to the general public) houses wonderful antiquities which will be used at some point in time in various displays.     When tours are slated in advance, every effort is made to have the exact material needed for the presentation, with enough volunteers (who have been given time to acclimate themselves to the subject) so that children are allowed to have a "hands on" experience.     Recently, I hosted a wedding rehearsal dinner at the museum.  So many of the guests were from New York, Ohio and other parts of the state.  About an hour was given for touring the museum.  When they were finished, so many commented on what a wonderful place it is, and how they had learned so much about the town.  Some of the guests were lifelong Wabash residents and went home with a new fact or two about where they live.     Ask just about anyone who lives in Wabash and they will fill with pride when talking about their town and the county.  It is a wonderful treasure trove, but to my mind there is no nicer place to spend a snowy winter afternoon or a morning filled with noisy kids that our museum.  It is simply a glorious adventure through the time and space known as Wabash County.
Goodwill Industries Of Michiana Inc	273408	1	/users/profile/362628	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	1	12/01/2015	Actually Goodwill Industries is a privately owned business, not a not-for-profit social service agency.  While I don't believe there's anything wrong with making a fortune from your business, I do have a real problem when that business poses as a social service agency.  Among its staff, Goodwill hires and trains handicapped people--which is exactly what all businesses are required to do thanks to the Americans with Disabilities Act passed 20-some years ago.  If you want to support an organization that does great outreach work and has awesome thrift shops, choose the Salvation Army or St. Vincent de Paul.

They treat staff unprofessionally. 
GATEWAY ASSOCIATION INC	151270		/users/profile/201917	Moe C.	Client Served	5	03/19/2013	I have been a volunteer for raising money for Gateway since 1996.  This was the year that I first started working with Pay Less.  I truly enjoyed raising money for such a worthy cause.  As a volunteer I know that the majority of our customer base looks forward to the month of May and to all the fun events we do for Gateway.  We work very hard as a company to plan for this by planning for the following year, as soon as the end of May gets here.  We spend much of our own time doing this because we believe in what Gateway stands for.  This is more than a fundraiser for a local non-profit organization, this is an investment in our future.   I believe in the cause and the wonderful things Gateway does for our children even more so now...I too, have a child with a disability.  Gateway has helped make things possible by not only helping me see what goes on when I'm not around, but also by helping us, as parents, teach our children: Manners, Countying, Alphabet, integration (so that in unique situations our children will know how to properly act with what is acceptable and what is not) without the help and continued education of their students some of them would not be where they are today.  Some would not be starting kindergarten on time.  Some wouldn't be potty trained without the extra help.  If I have a concern about my child I am always welcome to bring it to anyone at the school and they are more than willing to offer advice on how we can do things to help our child with certain issues she has.  A consistency between us and the school has really made a difference in not only our daughters life, but also our own.   When I look at the children of Gateway, I don't see a waste of time or money, I see a bright future for children who may not have had a chance.  I get to see a child with severe behavior issues turn into a caring, polite & loving child, and the ability to take what this world has to offer and work for it.  I know because I get to see the changes everyday.  Sometimes it's slow and sometimes it's quick, but there is always change and always the hope of a brighter future where at one time there may not have been any.   When I look at the staff of Gateway, I see caring people who have not given up on the children, they hold bright hope and care for each and every child that walks through the door.  No matter how difficult a child may be or how severe a disability, they still hold the same love, care and hope for that child as you would any other child without a disability.  For the children that do not have a disability, they are given the same opportunities as any other child.  In my opinion, they get more out of this because they get to see first hand how wonderful each and everyone is, no matter what challenges they may face by being different. Then there is no room for discrimination, because it doesn't exist to them.  Everyone is equal and the staff makes that happen.  For them, I am grateful for how much they have helped not only my child, but the children of other people I know.   I will always continue to help the family of Gateway, so that others may have the same opportunities that my family and myself have had.

After two years of continued billing errors for office visits, they sent my account to a collection agency.  They had been paid multiple times for the same office visits.  When I asked the CEO how many people a year they turn over to collections, he told me 7000.  No one in management even reviews the accounts sent to collection for possible errors, or financial need / health of the patient.  They harass the extremely ill, suffering, and dying for their money without exception - even if they are billing them erroneously.   That is not a charitable organization.  They give large cash bonus's to officers, they are more concerned about getting paid than helping to care for their patients. Also, everything I have been able to find on this 'foundation' indicates they are a charitable organization who's charity is themselves.  I find NO recipients of their monies or services to any group other than themselves.
One Mission Society Inc	236940		/users/profile/321160	buildfree	Donor	5	01/16/2015	I gave $1000 and they did not give any promotional material.  I started donations to them because a leading Christian witness and business man thinks highly enough of them to invest all his company profit in them.  Knowing their background in advancing the Gospel, it seems one of the top places to give God's money.
One Mission Society Inc	227757	1	/users/profile/291484	UnhappyDonor	Donor	2	10/27/2014	I gave $100 to OMS in Fall 2013.  I then received a mailing from them that consisted of the following: a 31 page full color brochure, a full color trifold brochure, an 11-page full color brochure-style 2012 Annual Report, an ECFA pamphlet, a single color letter/receipt combo and an envelope.  I really look for organizations that carefully steward resources.  I never requested more information from them and found their mailing extraordinarily wasteful - from a financial and environmental aspect.  
Center Grove Education Foundation Inc	66659		/users/profile/72859	JulieW	Board Member	5	02/11/2011	I have recently joined the board of the Center Grove Education Foundation. It is a wonderful organization dedicated to raising funds to assist our school corporation in providing quality education and opportunities for all students and teachers.  They are a dedicated and passionate group of individuals that put education as a priority for children.  With all of the budget cuts in recent times, our organization becomes more important to maintain quality education through funding of materials, programs and grants.  Our events not only serve to raise money for the cause but also to educate the community about our foundation and the needs of the schools. Everyone looking to find a charity that makes a direct impact on children and education should consider donating not only money but time to this organization.

Horizon House Inc	262531		/users/profile/351215	lsmith747	Board Member	5	10/08/2015	I have been a board member for the past three years and before that I volunteered.  What I am most appreciative of is the comprehensive services Horizon House provides for our homeless neighbors.  They include job readiness, mock interviews, medical and mental health onsite clinic, laundry facility, showers, interview clothing, bus passes to get to job interviews and help to obtain housing to name a few. The programs are definitely not a hand out but a hand up.  Their services are provided with a level of caring support that helps individuals get back on their feet with dignity.  The staff at Horizon House works tirelessly to achieve success with those individuals who are willing and those who aren't.  They never give up on anyone.  I would encourage anyone interested in helping our city improve and end homelessness to visit Horizon House and spend some time there.  Every time I hear a success story of someone who has received the services Horizon House provides and has become a very productive citizen and all they overcame with the support, I am proud to be a contributing board member.  I am ready for three more years!
Horizon House Inc	262521		/users/profile/351207	chefboydrz	Board Member	5	10/08/2015	I have volunteered at Horizon House for over a decade and continue to be amazed by the compassionate care provided to so many neighbors.  The co-location of services is one of the most unique aspects of the center.  Basic needs - showers, laundry, an address for mail; health services - an outpatient clinic of Eskenazi Health; case workers, job placement and outreach on the streets.  I came back to Horizon House after years away from the board during which I volunteered at HH because I felt so strongly about their mission, the service they provide and the manner in which they provide it.  I've found them to be more than worthy of time and treasure.

They are rude and unprofessional.   They claim to care about the elderly but truly offer no compassion.  It's a shame.  Don't waste your time supporting them.  
Porter County Council On Aging & Community Services Inc	200198		/users/profile/261342	Salvador	Client Served	1	05/13/2014	Unfortunately our experience with PCACS in Valparaiso on Campbell Street has not been pleasant. The person or persons answering the phone can sometimes be very impolite bordering on rude to the seniors.  And that has happened more than once to my parents. My parents have been members of the Banta Center for years which they enjoy going to.  A little over a year ago I had to move my parents in with me.  I also live in Porter County.  They had already paid the yearly membership at Banta so they continued to go.  When they first started getting a ride on the bus, they were told they had to join another center.  When I contacted the director, he did respond promptly and assured me that was not the case and they would accommodate my parents but sometimes emergencies come up which I totally understood.  So my parents continued to use this service once a week only and paid the fee even though my mother is handicapped.  A few times the bus did not show up nor was there any notification.  So my parents were left waiting.  This last time when that occurred my mother called to inquire and was told if she was not happy with service to find another line.I was in the next room.  My mother did not get upset or raise her voice.  If anything, she was disappointed about not being picked up and left waiting.  Once my mother hung and told me what was said to her I called and I was upset that they would treat the seniors that count on them that way. I understand dealing with seniors can be difficult.  But that is what PCACS is supposed to do.I guess as retaliation because I was upset my parents just received a phone call that they would not be picked up anymore.I already knew that we could not rely on this service so I'm not upset about them not picking my parents up.  It's just the fact that this is how seniors are being treated.   So now Banta has lost two memberships.  So they lost revenue which I'm sure they count on.  Banta has been pleasant for my parents.  Unfortunately the same cannot be said about the transportation to get seniors to a nice place so they can enjoy themselves.
Cancer Services of Northeast Indiana	67523		/users/profile/73805	Charlene Doctor-Ferrell	Client Served	5	02/13/2011	After a routine hysterectomy, I was shocked to find out I had a rare form of cancer,fallopian tube cancer, and would need to undergo chemotherapy. My sister-in-law told a friend that used to go to my church about it, and she sent me the address of Cancer Services of Northeast Indiana. She had used their services and highly recommended them. My daughter took me for a visit, where I talked with a counselor, and we were shown around their warehouse. I was very concerned about "looking normal" for my students at school. I got my first wig and some hats for free. This made me feel somewhat prepared. I also borrowed the book "The Jester Lost His Jingle" to read to my class. This helped me explain to them what was happening to me and that they were part of the joy that I was reaching inside to help me keep going. I was able to work part-time for awhile, and am half way through my treatments. This week I had my first massage therapy session, which is also offered for cancer patients at Cancer Services of Northeast Indiana.  It really helped me relax and feel better. They have truly been a blessing to me during this time.

I stopped by their office because I was scared.  I stopped in the air lock between the two doors where I found some pamphlets.  As I was looking through them, someone from the office invited me in and asked what they could do for me.  I told them I didn't know and that I was JUST diagnosed.  He knew I was concerned.He gave me a tour and showed me all they things they offeded.  More than I could list here.  As it turns out, the one thing they offered that I did use was a case of Ensure protein drink.  My radiation made it difficult to eat and the Ensure helped.They are great people who do care.  I still donate because they did so much for me!

Last July, I was asked to join the Board with the specific assignment of raising funds for a new school through a scholarship program.  The Aletheia Banjara School is now in operation with 218 primary children attending. More scholarships are needed in order to sustain and expand this important project.  These children are becoming aware that they are blessed by God; this school is obviously the best thing going for miles around, and it testifies mightily to the love of our Savior for the Banjara people. Pray with us that they learn to love Him in return.

PEACE LEARNING CENTER INC	151718		/users/profile/202605	campbellsp	Volunteer	5	03/27/2013	Peace Learning Center is a wonderful resource for Indianapolis area teachers and community organizations. As campus minister at Providence Cristo Rey High School (2007-2012) I annually engaged a team of PLC facilitators to guide the freshman retreat. During the course of the day, the PLC leaders taught the PCR students principles of Conflict Resolution, team building processes, and communication skills for responding to others nonviolently. I always scheduled the retreat during the first month of the school year. I was always pleased to observe the students applying what they learned at the retreat as they met daily challenges.  More recently, I have been volunteering as a facilitator with the Focus 2020 process. This is a well-conceived four phase project designed to generate a "grass roots" driven strategic plan to improve the quality of life for all who live and work in the greater Marion County area.  The process begins with a listening session in which groups of residents (often intergenerational in make-up) talk about their current  view of where the community is, then dream a vision for the future together before getting practical about what it will take to stimulate change. Participants then can choose from a variety of skill-building sessions, and engage with their peers in larger gatherings called Chatauquas. Those who complete the prerequisite hours then can apply for seed grants to help them initiate community improvement efforts.  In each session that I have participated, I have been energized by the creativity and imagination, the commitment and determination of the attendees. As this process continues to unfold, I am sure we will see a number of wonderful projects unfold that will bring new vitality to Indianapolis neighborhoods.  In addition to these efforts, I am grateful to the Peace Learning Center for sponsoring and co-sponsoring community-wide events like the annual MLK Jr. Day that enable me and others to broader our horizons as I have heard speakers who give me a window into the experience of racism and human rights violations in other parts of the world. I encourage all to visit the PLC website often PeaceLearningCenter.org  to keep up to date on the variety of events they offer.

Rock Steady Boxing, Inc.	236146	5	/users/profile/319955	rsbean	Client Served	5	01/01/2015	I have been active at Rock Steady Boxing nearly since its inception.  When i walked through their doors, I knew little about Parkinson's Disease and nothing about boxing.  Rock Steady Boxing gives people with PD Hope, a rare and precious commodity for those facing the scourge of this insidious, progressive, incurable disease. When I began this innovative, non-contact boxing-inspired program, there was no "scientific" evidence that this kind of exercise was beneficial in the fight against PD.  But those of us who were fortunate enough to have this resource did not need outside proof, we knew what it did for us.  In the ensuing years longitudinal studies have documented the wide-ranging benefits of the program.  My neurologist has said that she did not know what my life would be like without Rock Steady, but it would not be what it is now.  Physically, socially, and spiritually, my life has been enriched. Parkie aint picky!  Parkinsons Disease is the second most prevalent neurological disease, and the most common movement disorder.  Though the average age of onset is around 60, symptoms may occur sooner or later. People of all ages and degrees of challenge have had the opportunity to improve their quality of life through the Rock Steady program.  The benefits of this program have ranged from being able to walk unaided again to running a first 5Km from resuming gardening to climbing mountains. I am grateful to the trainers, staff, volunteers, family and friends, and for the generous support of the community.  Each of these pieces of the puzzle has been critical to its success.

Michiana Feral Cat Initiative Incorporated	237250		/users/profile/321689	Scenario	General Member of the Public	1	01/24/2015	This is their mission statement:  Our mission is to care for the free-roaming cat population in northern Indiana and southwestern Michigan by: promoting awareness in and providing education for our communities; implementing a trap/neuter/return program to help reduce the homeless cat population; and establishing managed cat colonies where free-roaming cats have access to food, water, shelter and basic veterinary care.  I live in Southwest Michigan and they refuse to help because we are to far away. Don't know the title of the person who contacted me. The person who contacted me seems to think that the tenants of the apartment community are responsible to TNR and feed the feral population. This makes no sense. We are not permanent residents. When we leave no one will care for them. Also, I know I mentioned in one of the many emails I sent her, that the property owner out here will evict any tenant who feeds the cats! A fact that was ignored.  Many tenants would be willing to assist an organization who would come out here and care for the cats, but we cannot do this ourselves. We need an organization that will actually help.

Kids Dance Outreach	194111	1	/users/profile/253589	paulabrennan	General Member of the Public	5	02/10/2014	I was privileged to attend the first public performance by Kids Dance Outreach. This presentation, showcasing the impressive accomplishments of some of this city's third-graders, was a dramatic display of what can happen when unique cultural opportunities are offered to an underserved population. In addition to the visible celebration of diversity these children reflected the passion, discipline, dedication, respect, caring and appreciation of the arts inspired by this superb program's director and team. It was a stunning, moving demonstration. Kids Dance Outreach offers an invaluable opportunity often available only to the privileged. It will have a huge impact on narrowing this city's opportunity gap. Indianapolis stands to gain enormous lasting benefits from this remarkable non-profit program that will have proven, lasting ripple effects on the academic and social success of its children. This deserving venture, as it expands, will have wide reaching positive consequences for all of Indianapolis and reach far beyond its boundaries.  This opportunity must not be squandered.

Vigo County CASA Kids	114218		/users/profile/155426	Ginger B	Volunteer	5	06/07/2012	Children, that is the number one reason I am a CASA.  These children up until they were appointed a CASA had no voice in the decision made by the judge.  Being a CASA I was involved from the start.  I made sure services were made available to the parents and the children.  Services that would make a difference in their lives and the lives of their parents.  These children need to know that they are not the reason they were removed from their home.  They need compassion, understanding and a feeling that someone does care that they are not neglected or abused.  They need a voice and I am that voice.  Will you be a voice for that child?Lift up a Voice, LIft up a child.
Vigo County CASA Kids	114175	1	/users/profile/155363	Kate Y.	Volunteer	5	06/07/2012	Children who have been abused and neglected need someone to be a voice for them in the court system.  That is what we as Court Appointed Special Advocates do.  Through getting to know these children and their situations, we report their expressed needs and wishes to the court as well as our own perceptions of what these kids need in regards to their physical, mental, and emotional well-being.  We are part of a team of people working to serve families and provide help to those who are willing to receive it.  As the one person involved in a case as a volunteer, most children recognize that we are there simply because we want to be and we care about them.  The other day during a visit with her at school, one of my little girls repeatedly told anyone in her classroom who would listen that "she's the one who talks to the judge."  It is rewarding to walk into a room to visit my CASA child, and see her face light up as she rushes over to give me a hug.  And even when unhealthy choices have led to current problems, compassion and respect can have an uplifting effect on parents and families.  It is inspiring to see families go from patterns of despair to hope and growth.  And it is a blessing to know that giving of my time and myself could be changing these precious children's lives for better...forever.

Although I attended one of the best schools this state has to offer, the lack of diversity among students and curricula was still very apparent.  I have seen how the experiences that Global Indiana provides has opened the eyes of educators, not just in Indiana or even the United States, but overseas.  It is creating a new movement that calls for education reform and the investment in our children.  This movement is now sparking government involvement and international recognition for our organization.  Now I've seen American children and Chinese children forming friendships and learning from one another despite cultural and language barriers.

This organization is grass roots and if you could personally speak to the students who benefit from SYF, you'd know that every dollar you give is well-spent.

They were sloppy and used dates my son had absolutely no contact with the agency (multiple visits over two month period that never occurred).  Additionally, the alleged "clinical psycho-therapy" records were signed by an unlicensed individual.  NO ONE THERE HAS A LICENSE FOR PSYCHOTHERAPY.  They are non compliant with the Federal requests for records as this was reported to the U.S. Dept. of Health & Human Services and the investigation is going for over a year now.  It has also been turned over to the Indiana Attorney General for investigation for fraud and unlicensed practice of medicine.

Concert Association Of Valparaiso	22994	10	/users/profile/24041	Tim	Board Member	5	11/24/2009	Formed in 1944 as Valparaiso Community Concerts under the national Community Concerts organization, the Concert Association of Valparaiso (CAV) has provided quality entertainment at affordable prices ($40 for 4 - 5 home concerts and free attendance at four other concert venues!).  In addition to providing good, professional entertainment to local people, CAV has offered a scholarship to local youth pursuing music education.  Moreover, some of our performers will give an outreach educational experience to our local school children for a modest fee.Previous offerings from our organzation include the Indianapolis Symphony, the Obernkirchen Children's Choir, the Vienna Boys' Choir, Fred Waring and His Pennsylvanians, the Roger Wagner Choir, and many other estimable, well-known groups, as well as exposing local, talented groups and soloists to our community.CAV has always held to a subscription program (required under Community Concerts) and individual donations for its funding, but has now opened its concerts to single presentation attendance at affordable prices.  We have historically served crowds of 700 and had a subscriber base of 600.  However, currently, our crowds have been in the 350 - 450 range and our subscriber population hovers around 300.  Our donations have traditionally been around $20,000 but have dropped precipitously in the past two years to just under $10,000.  We are also becoming aware that our visibility and awareness by the public is waning as we lose local advertising due to media mergers.We serve a large senior citizen audience, people who would not normally be able to attend live performances away from home.  We have enjoyed a large popularity for well over sixty years and feel that there is increasing need for our service as our population both ages and experiences increasing financial stress.

Pleasant Run Childrens Homes Foundation Inc	166181		/users/profile/220764	Franklin M.	Client Served	1	08/26/2013	Pleasant Run Children's Homes staff members were unqualified for the jobs they were given due to their lack of respect for the idividuals living in the placement along with the lack of maturity in which they took their jobs.  I was a kid who lived in this facility when I was 12 years old.  I lived there for almost 2 years.  I was also one of the very first to arrive.  For years I've been searching for ways to find these staff members so I can tell them exactally how terrible of a job they all did while working in this place.  I am 29 years old now and still till this day am upset about how they treated everyone.  The training room where the supervisors trained the newcomers how to restrain the patients, they only rough housed and fooled around by pulling various WWF moves on each other.  When the restraining actually was needed they chose to body slam and punch instead.  Certain staff members felt it was funny to make fun of and poke at the child patients throughout the days.  When you reach level 4, you are allowed to bring in certain things from home that you usually are not permitted to bring in like stereos and stuffed animals along with other toys and forms of entertainment.  Some of the staff were so cruel they would purposely mess with certain kids and get those kids to blow up.  Once they do the staff places them on ground zero (the lowest level) then they take everything out of their room.  If the staff find any of the kids belongings favorable, they would take it home with them never to be seen again.  One of them stole my Gameboy and everything that went with it.  I dont care now, but as a 12 year old boy it hurt.  It hurt more when no one would believe you.  Your therapist, mother, other family members.  Afterall its a 12 year old patients word against a grown mans words.  I heard several years ago that this facility was shut down and up for investigation.  Dont think it will ever be back.  If however it does then be warned this place was terrible for all of us.   Their slogan "Helping Good Kids Get Better" should have been rewritten to " Helping Good Kids Get Worse".     -Franklin.

The museum covers the  science, art, and history of the state of Indiana, allowing visitors and residents the opportunity to learn more about where the state has been, where it is today, and where it is headed, in the grand scheme of the world.  Without the funding from the foundation, programming would suffer, which would affect thousands of school children and families.
Voyager Program Inc	272356		/users/profile/361383	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/18/2015	The Voyager Program was founded by Dr. Bill Gerber, a local Pastor in Michigan City, IN to address the growing drop-out statistics in then two local high schools -- Elstong & Rogers. The program targeted those most vulnerable and initially started with ten students from each school. Mentoring & tutoring were the primary tools that began  as an after-school effort.  Summers were spent in the wilderness environment of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area in northern Minnesota and southern Ontario, Canada.  Students were pulled out of class to receive tutoring and mentoring - to include their home environment. A "cash for grades' program rewarded students with savings bonds donated by local businesses.  The bonds were held in the student's name until graduation.  At years ten & twenty of the program it consistently graduated 93% of those enrolled.

CLD taught me so much as a young African-American, about etiquitte, the importance of being on time, interviewing skills, college admissions, what to expect in college, responsiblity for self, maturity, conflict resolution...should I go on. Its mentors are leaders in the community that can relate well with the students they work with.  They have such a myraid of programs, as a former participant and now a parent, I can't wait to get my child into their programs. With so many schools that have limited counseling for students, this program fills the holes found in our public schools. 
Disabled American Veterans	209232	4	/users/profile/269187	summer14	General Member of the Public	1	08/07/2014	I have to agree with these unfavorable comments. What these people do is take advantage of the elderly and sick. They play on their patriotism waving the American flag in one hand and holding the other one out for money. And they ask for large donations, thousands. They had the nerve to ask for $12,000 one time. They need to stop doing this. My father is by no means rich but he is senile enough to think he is. My father is ex military, and he is a prime target. I have asked repeatedly to take him off their mailing list and I have yet to receive an answer, phone or e- mail.

Southlake Tri-City Management Corp	164798	1	/users/profile/219051	angnun9	Professional with expertise in this field	1	08/13/2013	Geminus Head Start is a joke. They claim to offer competive offers for job positions but had the audacity to call me and offer me wage $2 less then the state and federal minimum wage. Meanwhile the administrative staff making well over 50k. If your latino dont even bother they claim to be equal employer but in reality they are not, low ball latinos, they see desperation for employment and take full advantage. The Head start program itself has good intentions but geminus corporation administrative staff only intention is self prosperity. In my opinion Geminus head start field staff as they are referred to should boycott. And should be shut down by OHS or Health and Safety administration.  Many parents are lead on to believe they're child will be accepted to later on be told they were not. Not allowing the parents enough time to find alternate schooling for their children and risking the loss of a entire school year.

Ymca Of Terre Haute	129552		/users/profile/174920	Randi4	Client Served	5	10/26/2012	I am very fluffy and in the process of de-fluffing.  I joined the Y.  Everyone is very friendly and helpful.  I heard several times that the Water Aerobics was great and to make sure and go to Abby's class, she kicks your butt.  I probably could use a work out like that.  I was a little late and there was a sweet woman walking in front of me but with a cane.  I was hoping she was going to my class but I thought surely not.   She did and I thought maybe it was just the evening class that had the good workout but i was wrong.  It was a great workout and water aerobics is great, no matter what ales you, you can usually exercise in the water.  I have a weak knee and heel spurs myself and haven't been able to walk but I could do this workout.  Abby gives you a workout and with lots of smiles and energy.   I had started de-fluffing before going to the Y but to date I have lost 40.  I still have 80 to go.  The Y also has a community support program to help with de-fluffing and it is popular, there is a waiting list but I hope to get in soon!  They also have activities for the kids while you exercise, there is something for everyone and we have kids ages 9-22 that go.

Trinity School Of Natural Health Inc	213047	5	/users/profile/276171	Dan33	Client Served	1	09/02/2014	I would not recommend Trinity School of Natural Health.  I was a student at one time studying for my N.D. I was about 80% done with the program and they decided to change their requirements.  This met many of the courses I had already completed no longer applied to the program.  So instead of only having eight classes to finish my N.D. program, I would now have twenty two courses to take.  They are not credited and the medical association that they claim to be apart of is actually an organization they founded.  I just recently contacted one of their former professors that gave me allot of insight into this program.  It is not what it claims to be and not even a good home study program.  You will not get any help from professors and the program is based of reading a book and then taking an open book test.  Basically its a joke. If you are considering this program you need to think long and hard.  If it is for professional reasons, then forget it.  If its for personal growth, look at the book list and just read the books on your own. 
Ecumenical Free Church In But Not Of Indianapolis Inc	280168	1	/users/profile/370007	Writer	General Member of the Public	4	02/14/2016	Back in the early 70s, this organization was housed in the basement of an Episcopal Church near the Circle in the downtown area of Indianapolis. It was a Counter Culture meeting place - 24-hour Rap Phone Line, Friday Night Pot Luck Get Together, Street Theater,  and Political Action and Awareness. I haven't heard anything about the Indy Free Church since the early 70s, nor can I find any current information. I seriously wonder if it isn't now actually defunct. But, I can say that in the early 70s, it was a memorable part of my life, and I did spend many hours there with the other denizens of Indianapolis' Counter Culture Underground. I can still envision the basement of the Episcopal Church in great detail  including the ' phi zappa krappa' poster that was  hanging on wall next to the entrance to phone line room.

John P Craine House Inc	149394	2	/users/profile/199099	Marylin	Board Member	5	02/14/2013	Craine House has a special place in my heart.  Their mission of providing women within the criminal justice system that have young children an opportunity to re-enter their community as good mothers, productive citizens and a positive role model is incredible!  The success rate for women that participate in Craine House is far greater than the success rate within the typical penal system.  Additionally, the children are much less likely to take on bad behavior than those children separated from their mothers and placed in foster care during the formative years of their life. Craine House does all this at approximately 30% less cost than a traditional correctional program and foster care for the children.   Please help Craine House assist more families by joining with them as they grow to allow those women with children on the waiting list to participate in this life-changing experience and allow these families an opportunity to live good and productive lives in Indiana.

Kiwanis International Foundation Inc	114337		/users/profile/155582	pscottz	Volunteer	5	06/08/2012	The Kiwnais International Foundation's mission is to serve the children of the world. Kiwanis International Foundation has done far more than that over the years by actually saving lives and by changing the world in so doing. The Foundation raised over 100 million dollars to eradicate Iodine Deficiency Disorder (IDD) around the world. IDD caused physical deformities and severe mental deficiencies translating into the births of millions of individuals who were unable to care for themselves and who then became burdens on society. By succesfully eradicating IDD around the world Kiwanis International Foundation in partnership with UNICEF changed the course of history. Individuals who might have been born in need of society's help were instead born with the ability to provide for themselves and their communites and families.

Rarely do you meet people as passionate and creative about "defending the defenseless" as they are. The Boaz Project is a ministry to orphans AND their caregivers in Russia, India & Kenya.  They've made a huge impact on the lives of hundreds if not thousands of orphans in desperate need. I unreservedly give them the highest recommendation.

Indiana Special Olympics Inc	251695	1	/users/profile/339676	A1In	Former staff	2	08/05/2015	Special Olympics Indiana has dedicated staff - both paid and volunteer. The County Coordinators do an amazing job doing the real work of providing opportunities to people with intellectual disabilities.  Recent changes, however, have been robbing local programs of their hard-earned fundraising dollars, since the State Office has been skimming off the top to cover "operational expenses." They've also been skimming from the middle.  And the bottom.  For years the State Office would do almost nothing to help local programs raise money for their activities. The local programs rose to the challenge and many of them raised a lot of money to serve the growing numbers of athletes. The State Office wants a piece of that action now that their own fundraising efforts have increasingly failed with high staff turnover and a despot for a leader. The Board of Directors has, for years, been somewhat enthusiastic but relatively uninvolved.  They've allowed themselves to be swindled and hoodwinked by the current (as of Aug. 2015) E.D. They are very comfortable NOT asking questions or reading between the lines. They are failing the organization and its athletes.
Good Shepherd Montessori School Inc	107134	1	/users/profile/145022	Maria M.	Board Member	5	02/27/2012	Good Shepherd is a small, private, not for profit, elementary school which teaches grades 1-8 in the Catholic tradition. We've recently announced that we are adding a preschool to the mix beginning with the 2012-2013 school year.     This is a school started from the love of parents at a dinner table 10 years ago  who believe this is their calling in life and the way that they are supposed to do the work of making the world a better place.  The school has grown from 16 children to over 100 kids, managed to make it through all sorts of trials and tribulations, and they do wonderful, beautiful things with, and for, children.  They teach conflict resolution. They love every kid, each one, for who they are and who they can become.  They celebrate diversity in real ways, every day, all the time.  This is a school South Bend needs - we are a model of how to care for children and connect to the community, we help attract high quality faculty to the area, and we role model peace.   Each class partners with a local farm, works on it throughout the year, and eats or sells a portion of their harvest. Theres sledding during recess in the winter. The kids work at Our Lady of the Road, a Catholic Worker Day Shelter. Theres a nutrition curriculum. Our junior high students run a micro-economy and learn financial literacy within a very unique and approach to junior high school.  Their music program shows students how to do jazz improvisation on xylophones and art as a regular part of their learning. Its truly a unique place where children can come into their own power to create. And they do this with the guiding partnership and care of the teachers at the school, a group of enthusiastic creators themselves.Part of Good Shepherds mission is cooperative learning in a diverse environment. To that end, theyve been generous with financial aid. Theyve worked with local funders to establish a program that gives 8 year scholarships to children from families transitioning from the Center for the Homeless into their own local homes. About 1 in 6 of Good Shepherd students are somewhere in the Aspergers/Autism spectrum. Theyve worked with many families whose children werent fitting in traditional schools, who now find school to be a great place. I believe very strongly that this school does incredible things for its students. The school recently bought the building that they have been housed in since their beginning.  We are committed to being a real positive force for good in the South Bend community and the school has an amazing potential to become a local and even national example of success in education in a way that can help the ongoing debate about childrens education.  Every year Good Shepherd is sending kids off to high school (soon college) with a different value set than we often hear about in the news these days.  Community, solidarity, preferential treatment for the poor, and peaceful, sustainable living are all things children at Good Shepherd live and learn to value as they move on in life.
Irvington Sports Association Inc	86120		/users/profile/96287	mark	Client Served	1	04/18/2011	This  organization is completely disorganized. I signed my son to play sports AND paid his fees and was never contacted by anyone as to when the season begins. His 5 year old peers requested to be placed on the same team so they could play ball with their friends and were denied that opportunity. The coach's rational was that kids have more fun playing against their friends. AT AGE FIVE??? Terrible

Starfish Initiative	199468	1	/users/profile/260405	alexisdean1483	Volunteer	4	05/01/2014	I think that the Starfish Initiative is such a needed non-profit in the Indianapolis area. The number of high academic achieving, low income students in this area is astonishing. During my year of volunteering with Starfish I have met so many scholars who are the translators for their family, the tutors, and caretakers for their siblings and at such young ages. All the while, being so driven to be a successful student, oftentimes involved  also in clubs and sports. The parents want the absolute best for their kids and the opportunity for another positive adult to assist in the high school process is welcomed and encouraged.  The way that the staff work to make the best possible scholar/mentor matches just shows their dedication to both their volunteers and program participants. I look forward to continuing to volunteer my time to Starfish.

World Gospel Mission	143100		/users/profile/175443	Andrea48	Volunteer	5	11/27/2012	I first became familiar with World Gospel Mission in my early twenties. My home church, where i served a number of terms on our missions board, sponsored many WGM missionaries and projects. Later, I worked for another missions organization for 10 years; we partnered with WGM frequently. For the past three years, I've had the privilege of serving as a WGM staff member. I'm always impressed by their ministry focus. They understand what it takes to be a great ministry--one that leaves the greatest impact for Christ. I'm proud to be associated with this ministry.

I received a reply the next day advising me that an clerical error was made on my receipt and a new receipt was provided.  I'm overwhelmed at the quick response and correction that was done to make this right for me.  Unfortunately, I have to wonder how many others had the same clerical error and either didn't catch it or just didn't bother with finding out the "why's" of the problem. I rate them a 5 because I truly believe they are doing a magnificent work, I rate them a 2 on their clerk.

Michigan City Area Schools Grant Acceptance Fund Inc	286560		/users/profile/376630	Jessica_H	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	Dogs Changing LivesI have volunteered with therapy dogs for 12 years.  My team which currently consists of Maddie, a Great Pyrenees, Bugsy, a puggle, and Trillian, a terrier mix, works with the special needs program at Joy School.  I consider every time we go to 'work' to be an inspiration but since I have to narrow it down I will focus on the early moments with my first canine partner Peanut, a pit bull mix.When we first started I didn't know what to expect from the kids or my dog.  I was nervous but Peanut seemed to know exactly what to do.  With no formal training she walked into that classroom and won over even the most reluctant student.  One young blind boy with autism was always loud and constantly in motion.  The teacher brought him over to us and he became quiet.  He sat still for a long time and the teacher commented that she had never seen him sit that calmly.Peanut was a motivator for a little boy with cerebral palsy to learn to walk.  He wanted to take the dog for a walk and his teacher wanted him to use his walker.  If he wanted to walk Peanut he had to challenge himself to learn.  By the time he started high school he was walking unaided.Peanut's inspiration extended beyond the special needs classroom.  She also helped to change people's opinions about pit bulls.  Staff and students both commented on how they believed all pits were aggressive until they met Peanut.I love what my dogs and I do with the kids. We change lives in so many ways. I am always working with the teachers to find new ways to incorporate the dogs into the curriculum.  The teachers love having us but it's the reaction of the students when the dogs walk in that keeps me coming back.http://mcas.k12.in.us/site/Default.aspx?PageID=13
Training Keys Incorporation	59350		/users/profile/64017	EBAB	Client Served	5	01/02/2011	La Tonya Peterson is a wonderful instructor and takes great pride in understanding her students.  She is a strong motivator and takes time with each student on an individual basis.  What I really admire about Ms. Peterson is the fact that she makes her students reach high even when they feel they can't or they are thinking they are a failure that is when she goes into high gear.  She has a success rate of just about 96% and that is because those students either moved or other circumstances developed. My hats off to Training Keys, Incorporation because they do more than teach they excel. Patti Marshall, Certified MBE/WBE
Mississinewa Battlefield Society	187872		/users/profile/244991	madaboutindians	General Member of the Public	2	11/05/2013	I've went to the Mississnewa 1812 pretty much every year since it started except for a couple of years i've watched it grow bigger and bigger and the price right along with it. Then i started wondering if any of the money that is made during this event is kicked back to the Native Americans that were part of this so called battle of Mississnewa. If not you have to ask yourselves is that fair because it doesn't seem fair to me but, thats just me. It seems to me that the Native Americans have been treated unfairly ever since we came to this country which i think is very wrong. Well thats how i feel about the event that is done every year and by the way i wont be attending until this is fixed.
Gary Literacy Coalition Inc	60482		/users/profile/65787	N Moore	Donor	5	01/20/2011	I give to this organization because of the service they provide to the Gary, IN community.  They give thousands of books to children and adults who are unable to have home libraies in their home.  I have seen children clutch a book with a smile of unbelief and delight when told that it is now theirs to keep.  The GLC also organize adults to mentor students in the gender academies in the school district.  Students are turned on to reading by playing a game of "Reading Pays", lead by the mentors, students respond to questions about the books they have been given the previous month to read.  I applaud this organization for making Gary a Reading city!

I never received a receipt for my taxes from my donation of aircraft parts. After careful review, I discovered that the aircraft assets of this supposed 'non-profit' are owned personally by the founder of the organization. He could potentially 'sell' the assets and personally profit from the sale. The organization has also never done any search and rescue. In my opinion, this is not a legitimate non-profit.

Indyferal	306510		/users/profile/24076	AnnT2	Client Served	5	09/25/2016	When we moved to Dudley Avenue, we were appalled at the dozens of homeless cats that prowled our block and several more. Cars dodging cats often came close to causing accidents, and more than one cat was hit and killed. A friend told us about IndyFeral.  One call was all it took to obtain help. With Lisa Tudor's assistance, we learned how to use TNR in our neighborhood to the betterment of both humans and felines. In the course of seven years, we have trapped fifty-one cats...all of which were spayed or neutered, received a rabies vaccination, flea and tick removal, and any medical help they needed. Many more found inside homes with new families that love them very much. With the cat population under control, the neighbors have stopped complaining and nobody has a rodent problem. THANK YOU, IndyFeral.

His attempt to resolve conflict was a disaster. I don't think Justin could have recognized a manipulative personality, if he was told one was in the room....

I found out about the Great American Songbook Foundation through following the career of one of my favorite performers - the organization's founder, Grammy-nominated singer Michael Feinstein. He and the Foundation's leadership team have set a truly noble goal of educating young singers (during a recent concert he compared this work to planting seeds) to become superior American Songbook interpreters. The Foundation has also done more than any other organization to share this beautiful music with the public at large, via the Foundation's ever-growing archives, museum, and concerts.

Board Member	5	12/19/2016	The United States Power Soccer Association is a 100% volunteer organization dedicated to providing those with a severe disability that places them in a power wheelchair the opportunity to participate and compete in a team sport. The mission is to grow teams throughout the United States and the region by organizing clinics and and competitions throughout the US. Participants are ages 5 to 70 and is played by both boys and girls, men and women. The sport is not segregated by gender because the control of the joystick is the great equalizer. But the participation in the sport goes far beyond the pitch.Players find for perhaps the first time, they are no longer on the sideline but are independently making decisions with their teammates to support a common goal and that changes everything.The benefits exceed the sport itself and its participants by creating new hope of independence to the player and those who surround them. Family members and the player learn they are not alone dealing with the day to day challenges and become part of a community that deal with the same challenges each day. Together this community helps the individual and their family find new ways of overcoming those challenges.Many players have completed high school, gone on the college, driving, and are gainfully employed living independently and experiencing their form of the American Dream.These players learn life skills through sport. Self confidence, determination, accountability, personal responsibility, and a can do approach to life; all are qualities any employer would want as part of their workforce.Yes power soccer changes lives.The game is played in 27 countries. There are 60 teams in the US that compete regularly and many more who participate on a recreational basis. There are an estimated 400,000 people in the US that use a power wheelchair for their daily mobility. Currently we have just over 400.The USPSA serves those with muscular dystrophy, Cerebral Palsy, SCI, quadriplegia, and many other injuries and diseases that place someone in a power wheelchair.

Wayside Mission Inc	87272		/users/profile/97914	dr.michaelblunk	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/26/2011	 For over fifty years, Wayside Christian Mission has been changing the lives and even saving the lives of men, women and children stricken by homelessness.   Today, the needs are greater than ever. Today, we will serve over two thousand hot meals to those who are hungry.   This evening, over five hundred members of our community will no longer need to seek refuge beneath a viaduct or inside an abandoned building.   We will give them a bed and a measure of security that cannot be found on the streets. Once their physical needs are met, we will offer our resident clients a Sober Living Program that can bring deliverance from the ravages of drug and alcohol addiction.  For those lacking in education, our working relationship with Jefferson Community and Technical College has assisted many in earning a GED or in enrolling in a degree program.  Our Work Therapy Program allows our clients to "earn their keep" at the Mission while gaining real world job skills that will prove invaluable as they return to society.   Through a regimen of classroom training and on the job experience, we have transformed many men and women once deemed unemployable into productive working citizens.    Children are often the forgotten victims of homelessness; each year, over 8000 school aged boys and girls will experience homelessness, too.  Many of our resident clients are little girls and boys.  The streets are no places for children to live and no child is turned away at the Mission.   Furthermore, we have partnered with the Jefferson County Public Schools to see that these boys and girls are able to remain in school.

Clint's shop, where he built all of his cars was located north across the parking lot of my brothers bank (valley National, at the time) at 7th and Glendale Streets, in Phoenix.  The following year Clint saw to it that my son and I were guests at one of his four garages at Indy.  At that time my son and I met Roger Penske, Al and Bobby Unser and their mother, and Andretti.    Clint was quite a personally and Clin gave me the last copy of his book called the Indy 500 Mechanic, of which I have a photo of Clint presenting the book to me.  I also met Duke Nalon, a well known stock car driver and iowner in Phoenix.  Days I shall never forget.  I didn't realize that Clint had this non-profit, but knowing Clint, this is something that he would do!  Wally Storey

Originally established in Fort Wayne, Indiana in 1982 as the Fort Wayne Job Training Program, the need for expanded services and outreach came just 5 years later in 1987 resulting in a new name and a broad expansion of programs and services to meet the needs of northeast Indianas changing manufacturing economy.

OPENING GATES INC	88461		/users/profile/68714	Judy Wiesenauer	Volunteer	5	05/07/2011	As a volunteer who helps care for the therapy horses I have grown as a person.  I was raised on a dairy/hog farm but didn't have horses.  Getting involved in Hunters Brook Farm and Opening Gates has given me the opportunity to learn about horses and myself.  Although all the horses have different personalities, they all require human assistance; they need food and shelter, grooming and medicine, pasture and stall maintenance.  It's the personalities which amaze me.  Bear, the largest horse, is probably the gentlest.  Cletus and Lady are practically inseparable.  Bucket and Sparky get nervous when one of them is out of sight, but can be comforted by other horses.  Coke is the queen of the farm and is proud of it.   I am not a horse specialist or a counselor so I don't participate in the counseling but I have met a few of the clients who, upon completion of the counseling, volunteer with the farm chores.  They were great supporters of the work done at Opening Gates.  I have found that horses can cheer, irritate, and comfort me.  I am cheered when Mikey "laughs" at me, irritated when Deuce swats me with his tail or refuses to be led, and comforted when Rascal can still run in the pasture even with steel rods in his leg. Opening Gates accomplishes its goal of providing "equine assisted counseling and learning" everyday whether to clients or volunteers.

Marion-Grant Co Humane Society Inc	156537	2	/users/profile/207640	stopgrantcountyhumanesociety	General Member of the Public	1	04/28/2013	We went in to help a puppy find a forever home, and were very happy with one in-particular. We jumped through hoops for this place, filled out the application, invited them to our home for a home visit and waited twice as long as other for an answer. We were even asked to offer up more information than the application asked for and we did without hesitation. We spent hours there playing with a puppy we believed was going to be ours, but in the end were discriminated against for being a new home owner with "a less than stable fence". We have had this house for less than 6 months and it was purchased in the fall (this being spring at time of review) so need-less to say outside repairs are difficult in the winter. But despite all that they could not tell me anything wrong at the time of the home visit. It seemed plausible,  that we would have a new member of the family. But in the end were denied for what seems like bogus reasons, the only explanation we got was "It's on a case by case basis". But here's the kicker, an elderly man brought back his adopted pet while I was in there because he couldn't house train the dog and it kept running away because he HAD NO FENCE. So how willing is this place to help these animals at the end of the day? I for one will never donate, refer or attend any function this place is hosting or benefiting from. Please ask around before adopting from this shelter. Find out if anyone you know has had a bad experience with them.

Reins Of Life Inc	80864	2	/users/profile/77944	Pixilated18	Volunteer	5	03/01/2011	Two of my brothers and one of my sisters and I all volunteer at Reins of Life. This is a hippotherapy center for people with special needs. We are so excited about this place. We try to get everyone to volunteer there.Since 1978 volunteers have been assisting during more than 3,000 hours of lessons per year. The organization helps children and adults reach their full potential by having them ride horses. The lessons teach focus, direction following skills, coordination, and help stretch muscles and improve balance. Over 500 riders per year participate. Reins of Life helps individuals who come from as far away as 100 miles. There are very few organizations like this one. I see the same riders a lot because they find the experience to be so beneficial. The riders sometimes become very close friends with the volunteers. One rider was a flowergirl in her sidewalker's wedding. I am a side walker, so prevent riders from falling, engage them in conversation, and assist during activities. I love to chat with the riders. It's easy to speak abstractly about "appreciating differences," but when I'm with the riders, I really learn how. I am so happy I can help them reach their full potential with their abilities and physical health.Reins of Life receives no government or insurance funding.Reins of Life subsists on fundraisers, the small lesson fees, and donations from individuals, organizations, and corporations. The horses are donated.

Evansville Day School Inc	222387	3	/users/profile/286091	Aimee10	Client Served	1	10/13/2014	This review is of my personal experience with the school: despite it I have made life lasting friendships and it does not in any way reflect the beautiful families that make up the school. The school has given me so many great opportunities academically but also in friendship. My senior year of high school I was extremely sick and spent a lot of time in the hospital (POTs and histamine intolerance). My heart rate would shoot over 200 beats per minute despite medication. The administrators at the time and many of the staff were not at all sympathetic.  (I am not even going to list 1/3 of the problems that occurred with them.) I had to wear a heart monitor and when it would beep three times I had to call in through landline to make sure I wasnt in cardiac arrest and could continue school instead of going to the hospital. I also had accommodation papers signed by each staff member so that they could be aware of what was happening  and how they needed to act. The male british administrator however would interrupt me calling the hospital and transferring the data from the monitor to the hospital and yell at me for skipping class.  Also, when I was resting in the nurses office (because my heart rate was 170) he came in and yelled at the nurses asking, why are you letting her rest? They replied stating how high my heart rate was and he said, DO NOT LET HER REST AGAIN, came into the room and forced me to walk to class, which couldve put me under cardiac arrest. He yelled at me several times throughout the year disregarding the accommodation letters he signed stating that I should be allowed to rest and eat as I needed.  My ap History  instructor and National Honor Society leader was angry at me when I couldnt -- on a sudden whim due to his lack of organization --  go help sell pizzas during lunch, because he hadnt given me enough notice so that I could take my lunch (and when your heart goes that high you desperately need calories, skipping lunch was not an option.) He told me I was not fulfilling my responsibilities and (despite the fact that I had over 100 hours of community service each year and the only one in my class to have so much, in spite of MY ILLNESS) said that I wasnt up to par with my classmates (which was obviously false) and said some very rude things to me. He then complained about missing school ONE day because he had strep throat and talked about how hard it was for him. I was in the hospital for A WEEK because I had strep throat and he couldnt at all be empathetic. Finally, the female headmaster was another issue entirely and tried to convince me to drop out of high school among many other things. Which wouldve been a real shame if I had listened since I was an exceptional student, had attended the school since I was 3, and was only a few months away from graduation. Also, despite my illness, I was still among the best grade point averages.Regardless of this experience with the staff, at the end of the year I won most of the awards (history because I was the only one to have completed 5  years worth of history classes in 4 years, volunteering from key club despite my illness I still volunteered more hours than anyone, Spanish and French award because I was the only one taking both of the languages, after three years of arguing and switching between the two they finally let me take both. And some others) Ive always been an excellent and award winning student and its a shame that they treated me the way they did, even trying to convince me to drop out of high school and telling me that I wasnt going to succeed and that I was the worst of my class, while the other staff members clearly disagreed. I have had soooo many AMAZING teachers And I have experienced SO MUCH LOVE from the amazing families that make up this school, especially ones that have experienced illness as well, and without them I wouldnt have been able to pull through the way I did. It takes a village to raise a child, and day school is definitely a village. Im so thankful.However, I am giving it a one so that attention is brought to this issue... Because it needs to be addressed that Day School staff needs to be trained or taught how to be empathetic and how to deal with students who are illespecially good students. I know that there have been many students who have had similar issues with the staff, or even worse. However, their love for the school and their position in this society has forced them to keep quiet lest anyone think any less of them and their faithfulness to the school. My love for the school has caused me to speak out and urge that not one more student suffers the way I did.

Team Greyhound Adoption Of Ohio Inc	124629		/users/profile/169567	Jane V.	Client Served	5	10/05/2012	Team Greyhound takes retired racers from the tracks, provides veterinary care, trains the greyhounds at Ohio prisons, puts them in foster care, then delivers a well-trained and well adjusted dog to his/her new owners.  In addition to getting a great dog, you get all the support you need from the group.  Also, you know that if something catastrophic happens to you, this group will always take the dog back and re-home it into a great home.  This is how I got my greyhound from them.  His first owner ran into serious financial trouble and could no longer keep him.  I provided his second home and he is a delightful dog.  I am so thankful to his first owner for recognizing that she could no longer care for him properly and to Team Greyhound for taking him back and getting him to me.  Also, all of the people who "work" for Team Greyhound are volunteers -- no one gets paid.  Therefore all of the money they raise goes directly to caring for the dogs, primarily providing all their veterinary needs.

Alcohol Abuse Deterrent Program Inc	240898	1	/users/profile/327267	fightaadp	General Member of the Public	1	04/09/2015	The citizens of Allen County, Indiana are forced to put the drug Antabuse in their system following a second D.U.I. arrest without even being convicted of a crime. After conviction of the D.U.I. a person could serve anywhere from 3 to 6 years on the AADP (Alcohol Abuse Deterrent Program) being forced fed a drug which attacks the liver much like alcohol does. Their forced sobriety is risking the health of every individual on the program. The courts continue to sentence people to AADP and AADP continues to poison and ignore its clients health problems. The only reason this facility is allowed to remain in business is because of the Indiana Code (IC 9-30-9-2) that was slipped through with minimal press in 1991 and driven by Judge Ryan of Allen County. We need to abolish or revise this Indiana Code to keep facilities like AADP from hurting people and their families whether it be medically or financially. Please sign this petition to abolish or revise Indiana Code (IC 9-30-9-2) and stop the shameless poisoning of thousands of Indiana citizens for profit. www.fightaadp.com

College Mentors For Kids Inc	286691		/users/profile/376761	Alex_B	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	Why This?So many times (and for so many reasons) I am asked the question Why. At work, at home, in my professional circles, by co-workers, by friends, by my family. People ask why did you make that decision, why do you live in that area, why did you buy those tickets, why would you take that route, why did you choose to work there? Its an incredibly powerful question, three simple letters that can reveal the inner workings of an otherwise mysterious persons mind. A simple question that can open up an insight into the most complicated, seemingly incoherent, decisions. However, it is also a question that can be easily answered if the individual has convictions around the particular topic. And when I am asked why I give, or why I support, College Mentors for Kids, it is one of the easiest questions for me to answer. I give because I believe in the cause. I believe that mentoring the youth of our country is one of the key solutions to generating positive outcomes for the greater community. I believe that college students, as exuberant, well intentioned, future leaders of their communities, are well positioned to provide that mentoring relationship.College Mentors for Kids is an innovative mentoring program that connects college students with the neediest at-risk youth in our country, providing the youth with the positive, caring role model that they may be lacking. Due to its innovating model, the program creates these relationships for pennies on the dollar. And I give because of the wide variety of people that the program helps. Not only does the program aid the elementary school children, generating proven outcomes in several areas, it also benefits the college students who mentor the little buddies. But first, the topic of the elementary school children. I give because of the infinite potential kids have if only nurtured and positioned correctly.  I give because 80% of the kids in this program graduated from high school compared to 73% of their peers.  I give because 75% of the College Mentors kids have gone on to achieve post-secondary education as compared to 51% of their peers. I give because 2/3 of these mentees go on to volunteer in their communities. The volunteer rate for young adults is 18.7%. I give because of the impact the program had on me and all of the other college students who are involved with the program. The program instills an inherent sense of charity, compassion, and care for others in our community. It reveals the sides of society that, as a college student, I may have otherwise been unaware. I give because the only way to truly gain that perspective is by interacting in person, and I believe that to be valuable for all individuals.As a society, we know that the cycle of poverty is a terrible institution, and incredibly difficult to change. We also know that in order to make large sweeping changes, money cannot make the difference, but that the culture must support the change. That, above all else, is why I give.. because mentoring works. It changes the story for the mentees, and empowers the mentors to make valuable decisions as they grow into future leaders. I give because College Mentors changes the culture, and extrapolated out, can help change the world.http://www.collegementors.org/
Maple City Cadets, Inc.	2569	6	/users/profile/4086	Steven Schell	Client Served	3	01/21/2009	I joined the Maple City Cadets after the 1977 Fourth of July parade. My Mother was upset with me pounding on all the furniture and demanded that I join this organization and learn how to play drums. Once in the corp, I spent all my time learning to play and LOVED the activity. I spent four years with my family fully involved in the corps. My family was limited on income and became the only way for us to take vacation together as a family. As an adult, I have always loved Drum Corps. I go to the shows, attend DCI and buy the merchanise. During the past four years, my oldest Son has become involved in the activity here on the West Coast. Of course, I became a full time volunteer. Last year I took a month off work to tour with Pacific Crest Drum & Bugle Corps. I learned everything from flipping hot cakes to driving the simi-truck. My Son is center snare in the Corps this year and loving it. Recently I was elected to the Board Of Directors for Pacific Crest. I can't wait for the season start. I owe all my enjoyment of this acitivity to the volunteers and instructional staff of the Maple City Cadets. Thank you so much for giving me a passion of this activity.

I have visited Pet Refuge a number of times in the last 15 years and I know it to be a fantastic, well-run, all-volunteer organization.

The patents of these children have also found support among each other and we have unofficial ly become known as "MarysKids".  For three years in a row, MAAP Services has supported our efforts to run  an overnight camping experience for these children and their families.  For most families, this is the very first or only time they can comfortably take the entire family out in the great outdoors and truly enjoy all the wonders of nature around them.  They can lay on the ground and see the stars and constellations, walk the trails and try their luck at fishing.  No one is out off by the occasional meltdown or exuberant shouts of joy from the children.  Everyone looks out for everyone..... We all pitch in for campfire foods and most participate in the hayrides through the county park .  Without MAAP support, these families would not be able to enjoy this wonderful , all-American adventure!

ANIMAL PROTECTION COALITION INC	295808		/users/profile/386589	mallorca	Volunteer	5	07/12/2016	I first become involved with the Indiana Horse Rescue over 10 years ago when I adopted one of their horses. Since then, I've been a donor, a volunteer and most recently have provided temporary homes for a series of horses through their foster program. Despite the fact that it operates with a skeleton crew, modest facilities and a small budget, the Indiana Horse Rescue has always left me with the impression that they really care about the welfare of the horse. They've also been a great organization to work with by being considerate of my own needs and limitations as an adopter and foster provider. I would enjoy seeing the Indiana Horse Rescue receive more recognition and support inorder to continue to improve their programs, facilities and ultimately help more horses in need.

I did so and found out that Chances Spot serves animal lovers in many ways.  It is possible to post stories and pictures of pets, to order items, some of which are free, and to learn about many ways to help animals.  There is a newsletter posted every week with lots of information.  I have found this nonprofit to be so very helpful emotionally and have connected both with its founder and with other people, countrywide and internationally, who need to speak with like minded people.  i recommend it highly for the emotional service it provides.
Girls Incorporated of Greater Indianapolis	286690		/users/profile/376760	Lee_J	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	What Inspires Me To Givehttp://girlsincindy.org/I am a firm believer that strong, smart and bold girls make the world a better place. I am also a firm believer that girls are inherently strong, smart and bold. Unfortunately, girls are not always encouraged to be their strongest selves, and can lose confidence very early in their lives. There is a lot of pressure to be perfect all of the time. These pressures lead to challenges. In fact, the following statistics reported in 'The Status of Girls in Indiana 2013', a report from St. Mary's College are staggering:* 28.2 percent of Indiana female high school students report being bullied on school property, as opposed to 22 percent nationally;* 20.4 percent of Indianas female eighth grade students having considered suicide and 11.5% having attempted suicide at least once;* Indiana girls are more likely than the national average to take diet pills, vomit, or take laxatives to lose weight; and* 14.5 percent Indiana female high school students report being raped, as opposed to 11.8 percent nationally. We know that girls with positive self-esteem, a healthy body image and soaring confidence will be the leaders of tomorrow. I give to Girls Inc. of Greater Indianapolis because their mission is to inspire all girls to be strong, smart, and bold. They provide hands-on programs that address the challenges that girls face today, such as self-esteem and bullying. Their impact is evident and they better the community I live in. I always feel valued for my gifts.Rest assured that Girls Inc. is working on these issues and more each and every day in our community and beyond. Girls Inc. girls are healthy, educated and independent. Whats not to love?

Down Syndrome Association Of Northwest Indiana Inc	286677		/users/profile/376747	Rahat_R	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	To give is to liveAbout a year and a half ago I was absolutely tired from life after three excruciating years of taking care of my husband affected by Alzheimers, along with a life time of taking care of my son with Downs Syndrome. It was around this time I chanced upon the Facebook page of the Northwest Indiana Downs syndrome Association that also worked with other children in my sons school. I decided to visit the Associations office once and that day was a life changer. The work being done there was beyond amazing. Every day volunteers would show up, smiling more than the day before, more motivated, and zealous than ever. I decided then to give the remaining of my time and efforts there, and I did, and never looked back. The organization lived by the rule of giving. After just a month of dedicating my time there I felt more relieved and happier in general realizing that giving is what we live for. The more we give, the more it makes us more peaceful inside. And that is why I give. To the DSA of NWI, and to my family. After all to give is to live.
Humane Society Of The Dunes Inc	106171		/users/profile/142965	Humane Society of the Dunes	Volunteer	5	02/08/2012	I cannot thank this organization enough for the experience and knowledge it has given me. Learning to work with animals that have been less fortunate than most has been so rewarding. Jane has taught me so much about the understanding of abused animals that I will never forget. Knowing now that spaying and neutering is one of the biggest concerns of this organization has really opened my eyes and has made me realize the importance of having animals spay/neutered before they are adopted out is the key to a successful future in reducing the numbers of so many unwanted numbers. What a wonderful experience this has been and still is. I am learning something new everyday.
The Crossing National Inc	191838		/users/profile/250391	JRyanHillman	General Member of the Public	4	12/30/2013	The Crossing is a faith-based alternative school like no other I've ever seen, experienced, or heard of...in a good way--a GREAT way!!!  Their mission is "To empower struggling students to become contributing members of their communities through academics, job-training programs, and faith-base mentoring".  I have volunteered there and seen first hand (as you can also on their website www.crossingeducation.com) what an impact this organization has on its students through small teacher to student ratios and the level of in-depth caring the students receive from all staff and faculty involved with the school.  They take students who've been expelled from elsewhere or simply dropped out and even travel to county schools asking for "the worst of the worst" in an effort to help turn their lives around.    If you do visit the website, you can learn much more, but perhaps most importantly, hear numerous candid and personal testimonials from students who've already graduated with a High School Diploma, GED, or are well on their way to doing so after feeling like no one else cared enough to even give them such a chance.  In addition, through the Job-Training Programs, students come away with not only valuable skills to aid in entering the workforce but also, through the teachers, mentors, job coaches and all the way up to the CEO, a massive network of vocational connections and possibilities they would never have found otherwise.  The Crossing helps restore hope to the hopeless and help to the helpless.  Please check out the website and or visit one of the nearly 20 campuses when/if you can and feel led to;  I cannot think of a better Non-Profit business to contribute to nor any other alternative school with such a proven and promising impact, whether you are able and willing to assist financially, through volunteering your time, or simply through your prayers. :)

BARTHOLOMEW COUNTY HUMANE SOCIETY INC	234305	4	/users/profile/298463	misseskuhl	General Member of the Public	1	11/23/2014	As an avid animal advocate, I am genuinely concerned with the Bartholomew County Humane Societys inadequate space for their present number of cats when they move to their new shelter December 2014. Their old building has 100-200 cats to care for on an average day, yet the floor plan of the new building and newspaper articles state the new facility will only hold around 40 cats! When they've been approached about this issue previously, their responses were inconsistent and evasive.  I have contacted their Board of Directors with an urgent letter asking what will happen to the cats they have neglected to plan to have space for and gotten no response. I feel we, as a community, could help create a humane long-term solution to this problem together if only we could get honest answers. If you are equally concerned about the animals in Bartholomew County, Indiana and the facility we should trust to help them, I urge you to contact them yourself and ask for proof of the steps in their action plan for this situation; ask for direct, non-evasive answers; ask if they are moving to this new shelter at the expense of the animals!

Destiny Rescue Usa Inc	240267	5	/users/profile/326366	Tomboy	Volunteer	5	03/31/2015	Wow this was a life changing trip to Asia. I have seen a lot of charities waste money on high salaries in the USA. What I found with Destiny Rescue were people who sold everything they had and moved to Asia to work 60 and 70 hour weeks for free.  We toured all the facilities and met most of the staff. Nobody is getting wealthy in Cambodia and Thailand. We paid $3000 to go on the trip and every dollar was tight. We roughed it in cheap hotels in the ghetto for $10 a night. I would have rather stayed in a nice place for $25 a night. They wanted to scrape that $15 to help get more people out of brothels.  Then one day we had to rice farm. They farm rice to help feed the girls because money is tight and there are hundreds of mouths to feed.  I did not see any fraud or waste. It was a breath of fresh air that does not spend it's time going to conferences, but spends it's time eliminating all the reasons a girl might drop out of the program and return to turning tricks. I saw nappy 70 year old men going into hotel rooms with teen girls. There were six and seven year old boys that were cross dressing, set up by their relatives. Scores of pedophiles roaming the street, stopping to gawk at a young eight year old in a leotard doing hand stands and kart wheels. What I also saw were women coming up out of the ashes and learning to sew, make jewelry and blend coffees. Gals were learning to do hair and loved to learn English words. All the workers earn $300 a month just to pay rent and food. On a side note... Does World Vision really need a $40,000 car and $2000 paint job? I saw them in Cambodia. Nobody is getting wealthy, and it was great to see volunteers who have a one year minimum commitment and many people have stayed multiple years!  Nobody was required to go to church, and there was a Budda Day Barbeque to keep local  traditions and respect the culture. Many gals loved going to church and were so excited to worship. 
Indiana Police Officers Association	120772	44	/users/profile/164305	bbeell	Donor	1	08/15/2012	My parents are elderly.  This organization calls them every couple of months that they are having their "annual donation drive," and since they have given in the past, can they make another donation.  Rather than having my parents mail the check, they insist on coming by to pick up the check.  I happened to be at my parent's house in July 2011 when they picked up a donation check.  Again I was there in September 2011 when they picked up a check.  They called again in November 2011, I answered the phone and told them that my parents would not be giving.  I noticed in my parents checkbook, a couple weeks later, that there was a check to them, and my mom said they came by earlier that day.  In February 2012, as I was coming up the drive to my parents house they were just leaving.  Finally I was there in April 2012 and told them that my parents had given enough to the organization and do not call them again.  I was told that they wouldn't be called again.  August 15, 2012 my parents received another phone call from the group stating they are having their annual campaign drive and since they have given in the past, could they be counted on giving again?  I told them my parents have already given twice this year and was told that they wouldn't be called on again for a donation.
Springdale Cemetery Association	224691		/users/profile/288454	oneguy	General Member of the Public	1	10/21/2014	This association does a good job of keeping the grass mowed and trimmed. The cemetery is on the National Register of Historic Places and is a national landmark. The newer and active area of the cemetery is in good shape and kept up to high standards. There is serious decay in the historic sections, with the unique chapel and irreplaceable stained glass windows and building structure. The cemetery office building is also a historic building, that is being left to mother nature to decay. Whole windows are falling out and the building is still used as an office. One window section is completely open on the ground floor that allows anyone to step through it and enter at any time. The cemetery records stored in the building are not safe. This is a deplorable situation that can not be properly expressed here. the historic tombstones, the stones of our forefathers, are being left to fall on the dirt, broken and mower damaged stones are everywhere you look. Historic retaining walls are falling down everywhere you look  and left untouched in any attempt to repair or stabilize.  This entire association needs to be completely audited and replaced with fresh blood that cares for our history. This is just wrong.

Malawi Matters Inc	275756	1	/users/profile/365420	Writer	Donor	5	01/06/2016	I have been a donor & volunteer for Malawi Matters Inc. since its early beginnings. From gathering supplies to packaging them for the next courses, to their Taste of Malawi fundraiser and hearing from those who have travelled to help teach a course, I know my donations are going right to help Malawians. MMI has now facilitated its 20 class/week-long course "Creative Methods of HIV & AIDS Education" for 178 congregations in Church of Central Africa Presbyterian Nkhoma Synod.  12 key volunteers (by category of leadership) are conducting programs with groups in their churches/schools/villages.As the program developed, they saw two very weak areas and MMI worked with the in-country folks to begin two more programs:  Culture and HIV-AIDS which addresses harmful cultural practices. This has now been done in 33 congregations for adults of the congregation as well as secondary school youth!  The other weak link was the information women share with girls - so many dedicated, loving women with such misinformation, old myths.  Soon MMI worked with 13 in-country women to design, develop & deliver "Equipping Women - Empowering Girls," a 15 class course for 6 lady leaders of each congregation.  In all cases, the people trained return to teach their respective groups. Imagine and believe how effectively this method equips each church!MMI has a follow-up and sustainability plan in place for each village where trained and volunteer leaders in each area work to put the three phases - Implement, Instruct, and Interact in place. These are amazing methods which have lasting effects!

Peyton Riekhof Foundation For Youth Hope	286823		/users/profile/376893	Elisha_W	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	What inspires me to give?  With a lot of introspection, I can say that I give to causes that I have personal ties to, along with having a cause worth fighting for.  I not only give my money but I also give my time, and my heart. Here is my giving story:Suicide. This word brings up so many feelings. These words come to my mind when I hear it:  fear, loss, grief, suffering, heartbreak, depression, STIGMA, pain without words. Because of The Peyton Riekhof Foundation for Youth Hope, these words also resonate:  Hope, treatment, overcoming, healing, community. You see, my neighbor and friend's teenage daughter died by suicide only a few years ago. Their daughter was amazing and one of my favorite kids. She was beautiful, she was smart, she had south kindness in her heart for others, she was a great friend, she was a softball player, an amazing sister, she was my girls' babysitter. She took time for people. She was the type of person you want to fill the world because it would make the world better. She struggled with depression. Depression from an early age. Her family cared, got her treatment did their best for her, and still..... Her name was Peyton. Her father, being a 'doer' and working through and with his grief, quickly founded a not-for-profit in her name, with the mission of reducing suicides among her community's youth. He found community experts and resources and organized a Board. He built a website. He organized community programs, bringing a speaker to the local high schools to talk about suicide--a door once closed tight to this topic. He organized a local softball tournament, Play for Peyton, to increase awareness of resources and decrease stigma. His team in the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention Out of the Darkness Walk raised the most money year 1. He has used funds raised to start support groups within local schools. He bravely tells his story, and her story, depite that it is hard, to help others. He is involved with the mayors local task force for suicide prevention. All in just over one year. You see, Peyton is not the only teen in her community of youths to take her own life. And this has to stop. A teenager who was present at one of Peyton's fathers local talks emailed him to tell him how much he needed to hear this story. That he was on the brink. It's this that keeps her father and  the Foundation pressing forward. I give to this foundation. I serve this foundation and this cause with my time because our community needs this. Because my own daughter struggles. Because I love the Riekhof family. Because kids struggling with their mental health need this and deserve understanding and resources.

LAFAYETTE OPTIMIST FOUNDATION	275661		/users/profile/365307	Writer	Board Member	5	01/05/2016	Although our organization benefits many local youth projects, the Teacher Grant Program has led to a valuable partnership with teachers from many local schools who apply for grant money to provide unique experiences for their students.  In turn, the teachers keep us informed of the needs and problems they face as they work with our children in an era of rapidly shrinking funding.  The non profit status of the foundation has allowed us to improve our fund raising efforts.
Girls On The Run International	286809		/users/profile/376879	Victoria_V	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	The Gift that Gave so MuchAs I watched my eight-year-old prepare to run a three mile race in the crisp November air, surrounded by hundreds of other eight-, nine-, and ten-year-old girls and their adult buddy runners and coaches, I marveled at her excitement and courage.  Here she was, about to attempt something many adults had never donethat I had never doneand she was beaming and jumping around like she was at a dance party.  The energy of these Girls on the Run was infectious, and it was obvious their ten-week training in both running and self-esteem had served them well.I signed my daughter up for Girls on the Run http://www.girlsontherun.org/ because I had read that pre- and post-testing actually showed increases in self-esteem due to its twice weekly program.  I thought anything that could help inoculate us before the looming adolescent years was well worth it.  I had no idea how it would change my life and the lives of my daughters.My daughter crossed the finish line that morning with a final sprint and an enormous, proud grin on her face. I was beyond astonished by what she had accomplished, especially because I was the kid who hated to run.  When we had to run around the school in junior high, I would actually hide after one lap and then rejoin the group on lap four or five.  I like other sports, but I just hated, hated, hated running.When spring came and it was time to sign up for Girls on the Run again, I didnt hit enter fast enough, and my daughter didnt make the team that filled up quickly.  A number of other girls in the school also wanted to be in the program and long story short, I ended up starting a second team and volunteering as the assistant coach.  My lack of running skills didnt impede my coaching gig;  I helped lead the activities and discussions and left the running to the real coaches.  About half-way through the ten weeks though, I realized I wouldnt be much of a role model if I didnt actually run the final 5k race with the girls.  How could I back out of something these young girls were working so hard to conquer?  I went out one morning and ran my first twenty minute run.  I have no idea how far I managed with my ragged breathing and pounding heart, but I walked at least half the time.  I still hated running  almost every single minute of it.  But when I finished, I found myself constantly thinking about when I could fit in my next run.  By the time the race came, just a few weeks later, I was still hating running, but the unstoppable energy of hundreds of elementary school girls carried me through that first race.Six years later, I am proud to call myself a runner.  Running has become a treasured part of my life and one of the biggest gifts I give myself. Ive run ten Girls on the Run 5ks with my oldest and my middle daughter.  Ive also done a couple ten mile races and a half marathon on my own.  Running surprised me like almost nothing else in my life so far (and everyone who ever knew me when I was younger  including my husband!). Running with my daughters, getting to witness every step of their perseverance and tenacity first hand, has given me some of my most joyous and proud moments as a parent. My oldest now runs on the cross country team and has broken a seven-minute mile.  She can run circles around me, and I couldnt be happier about it.Girls on the Run makes it easy for me to support them; every time I sign up one of my daughters (and my third is ready and waiting to join as soon as shes old enough), they allow me to give extra to let girls who need extra financial help with fees or running shoes participate.  I can use my match at work and know Im giving the same transformative experience me and my daughters have had to girls who wouldnt otherwise experience it. The confidence and strength you get from doing something you never dreamed you can do is incomparable. Its been said before, but it has truly been one of those gifts where we have received so much more than we have given.

DEARBORN COUNTY RETIRED TEACHERS FOUNDATION INC	251559	1	/users/profile/339515	creche1	Volunteer	5	08/04/2015	The Dearborn County Retired Teachers Foundation, Inc., a 501(c ) 3, is a group of retired teachers in Dearborn Co., IN, who support the active teachers in our county. We give an annual $500 grant/award to an active teacher in our local schools. Unfortunately, we are the only such group in our county working in behalf of active teachers in our communities. The teacher must apply and then is selected anonymously at a general meeting of the retired teachers. Receipts must be presented in order to obtain the money to be used in the classroom. Consideration is given to innovative/creative teaching and those whose project would have the most impact on the greatest number of students. The website for our organization is dearborncountyrta.org. Complete documentation and explanation of our process can be given upon request. As retired teachers we feel that we are in a unique position to help the active teachers as we can readily recognize good and innovative teaching.  Help us help the students in our area schools.

I recommend it without reservation! Come volunteer!
