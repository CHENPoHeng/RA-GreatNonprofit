Camp Courage	305970	1	/users/profile/397238	Writer,	Volunteer	5	09/21/2016	I found Camp Courage after my son became a Marine.  Mai Christy, the founder,  supports our military so well.  She is constantly looking for and finding ways to keep sending care packages to all the people in our military.  She and all the volunteers of Camp Courage are constantly looking for items and "pieces of home" to put into these care packages, so our soldiers, airmen, Marines, sailors, etc. can know that there are people thinking about them and thanking them and honoring them for their service to our country.  The Camp Courage vision is "To reach as many service members as possible through the outreach of our care package projects in an effort to express our sincerest appreciation for their selfless choice to serve our great nation." and everyone who is a volunteer for Camp Courage does exactly that.  I am proud to be a part of something so special.  
Camp Courage	306033	11	/users/profile/397298	Jessica294	Volunteer	5	09/22/2016	 At first, I was a little worried about giving time or anything to any organization for care packages as I had seen first hand how some of them would say one thing but it would be totally used for something personal. But then I got in touch with the Admins of Camp Courage. I have a son who is  Military, and as a single mom with 3 children trying to make ends meet, I turned to this group and asked them about sending him and some of the guys/gals that my Military son  works with care packages. 20 packages total. They not one time hesitated. Gave them the information they needed to have all 20 packages sent to my son and he handed them out to the guys/gals in his  unit. They gladly accepted and within a couple weeks my son contacted me excited and said everyone was so thrilled to have gotten a package "from home" cards, letters from kids coloring pages from groups of children were the highlight of their day. Said it was like watching children open a special present they had been hoping that Santa would bring them Christmas Morning.  Since then, I decided right then and there that I would figure a way to pay it forward to this wonderful organization for putting a smile on my son's face and the face of his fellow Military brothers/sisters. I have sense decided that even if I can't contribute with money to the packages, that I would become a "Card writer". Knowing that my card could brighten someone's day as others have done for my son makes it all worth doing. I am so thankful for God putting this group in my life and the life of so many others. Seeing posts or pics of those that get the boxes and the joy and smile on their faces is what makes this group a ONE OF A KIND GROUP..If you love our Military and want to help out but are limited. Hey there is no such thing as there is nothing I can do because there is something that everyone can do to help show our Men and Women in the Military how much we as American's  Stand Behind Our Troops.. I would recommend this group to anyone who could find it in their heart to help any way you can because even the smallest donation or even to write a card or even get a group to do coloring pages with a short note to them is well worth it. And everything donated goes to the care packages.. Nothing is used for personal gain. The only personal gain anyone receives is the person who is receiving the love and support these care packages  have to offer them when they are opened.. With my son being on the receiving end of their care packages, I turned to volunteering for them just by writing cards for them, and have NEVER one time had any regrets doing so!CAMP COURAGE IS A TOP NOTCH, 5 STAR, AND ONE HUNDRED PERCENT DEDICATED GROUP WHO SUPPORTS OUR MILITARY WORLD WIDE ONE CARE PACKAGE AT A TIME!! 
Camp Courage	306026	1	/users/profile/397294	jmwhitelock	Volunteer	5	09/22/2016	I became involved with Camp Courage a few years ago after my youngest son graduated from USMC Boot camp. This group has filled a void that was left when I no longer had children at home to care for.  Their support has helped to give me insight into what the life of a Marine mom is like. Their mission of helping our military one care package at a time has shown me that what started as the acts of a small group of moms can really make a difference in the lives of so many.  Camp Courage is a wonderful, all volunteer, organization. By volunteering with this organization I have made some lifelong bonds and have found a group of individuals that are always willing to lend a hand, lend a shoulder, lend an ear or most importantly, lend a heart.
Camp Courage	306023	1	/users/profile/397291	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	09/21/2016	After my son decided to become a Marine almost 4 years ago, I was lucky enough to hear about Camp Courage.  Through donations and sales in the Marketplace they are able to send care packages to our Military members all over the world!  My son has received one and was thrilled with the letters from children that get added into the care packages!  This "little bit of home" is extremely important to our serving Military members because it lets them know we haven't forgotten them and that we appreciate the sacrifices they make every day for us.  And even though the main purpose of CC is sending care packages, their Facebook page is also a place of support for family and friends of the men and women who serve in the Military.  It is a  good place to get information or just share your feelings at that moment.  For me personally, I know that these last 4 years have been a little easier to handle knowing I'm not going through it alone.  Mai cares so much about our Military personnel and works so hard to let them know that we are so proud of them!  Every box she mails out is filled with needed toiletries, goodies, cards, letters and a whole lot of love!!
Camp Courage	306006	1	/users/profile/397274	Nancy268	Donor	5	09/21/2016	Camp Courage is Amazing. I am a Military Mom and I know the importance of our sons and daughters  feeling loved and thought about by their families and friends.  I know how much they look forward to cards, letters and the things we at home, take for granted like food, candy, magazines,  personal items and so much more. I love Camp Courage!

Camp Courage	305995	1	/users/profile/397263	cat23	Donor	5	09/21/2016	I found this Great non profit when my Grandson became a Marine to serve our country!  This group does so much for members of all Armed Forces! One care package at a time!  I have been a donor and have been writing cards which go in every package sent out!  It is a Great organization run strictly by volunteers that love to share their love and support of our military!
Camp Courage	305993	1	/users/profile/397261	Mary459	General Member of the Public	5	09/21/2016	Camp Courage has touched so many lives of our Military by all of the care boxes and emotional support that are sent out to all branches of our Military. I have shed many tears of joy and shared heartfelt moments with other parents whom have felt the same love for all of our Son's and Daughters. Mai Christie has given so many hours of her personal life and continues to do so for the love of all of our Marines and Military, she asks for nothing in return except that we show respect for each other and others within this group of parents who root and support each other on in our moments of joy, and anguish of separation from our Marines. 
Camp Courage	305989	1	/users/profile/397257	Tina111	General Member of the Public	5	09/21/2016	Camp Courage is a wonderful program.  I have orders items and clothing from them as well as have donated items to be sent to our Marines. She is on a much needed and appriciated mission!

Camp Courage	305979	2	/users/profile/397247	Melody15	Client Served	5	09/21/2016	They are an awesome group. The volunteers pack each box for a service member with a lot of love and much wanted and needed things. The homemade cards that go in each box makes the service member proud, feel loved and supported. Someday I hope to be able to take a vacation and help with a packing. My son received a package while on deployment and he loved it! Thank you Camp Courage for what you do for our Military!

Camp Courage	275291		/users/profile/364888	Paula82	General Member of the Public	5	12/31/2015	Camp Courage not only provides care packages to active duty military, but they also offer support to parents and other family members whose loved ones are serving their country.  As a non profit organization, all proceeds go into building care boxes that contain many of the simple needs of those who are deployed or feeling down, along with letters of thanks and encouragement. Definitely a worthy organization started by an amazing lady and run by a dedicated board of directors.

By sending care packages filled with necessities, treats and love (in the form of hand written cards and letters) Camp Courage lets our service members know they are thought of and appreciated. Camp Courage also provides valuable support to family members of Marines on their website.  Love this organization!

We all come together in support of our Military to make sure they are taken care of one care package at at time. It doesn't stop there though. We give our support in card/letter writing, in prayers, in helping in anyway that is possible to see that the  needs of our Service men and women are taken care of. Beyond that we have become an incredible group of strength for one another. I love Camp Courage and all that we stand for! So grateful I am a part of it!!!  Semper Fi!!!

Camp Courage	256645	6	/users/profile/345038	Karren	Donor	5	09/11/2015	Camp Courage, Mai Christy and all her volunteers are amazing! Care packages and cards of encouragement are sent to our military men and women serving our country.  The care packages mean so much more than the items that are enclosed...getting a touch of "love" from home to our men and women mean more than words could ever say. They are in awe that total strangers get together and send things to them and remember them. One young man I know personally that received a care package was totally floored that out of all the men and women that serve, he was chosen...he did not think he was that special to anyone until he received the "love" from Camp Courage. All of us face battles in our personal lives but in spite of that, every single month Camp Courage volunteers and donors step up to honor our heroes...those protecting our country through their military service! So very proud of Camp Courage and for who it stands for!

Cats Cradle Shelter Inc.	308593	1	/users/profile/399960	Sheila73,	Donor	5	10/07/2016	I live in Louisville KY now but was in Charlotte NC when I first heard about Corky and what this shelter team was hoping to do for him.  I have followed Cats Cradle on Facebook every since.  I'm amazed and so appreciative of the care and the work these folks do.  I know there are other shelters in America that also do good work, but Cats Cradle has been "chosen"!  They are no longer a shelter "just in Fargo"; they are now known world wide yet have continued to keep their focus on the care of kitties and cats. I ask that everyone consider including this shelter in your taxable contributions. Another way that I like to contribute is by selection when shopping at smile.amazon.com.Thank you Cats Cradle for all you do!
Cats Cradle Shelter Inc.	310934		/users/profile/402270	Glory Jo J.	General Member of the Public	5	10/15/2016	We went to Cats Cradle in Feb. after we had lost one of our beloved cats. We were looking for a companion cat to play with a cat we had rescued that had been thrown out at a farm by Ada. We had seen a picture of Hope Solo on their page and decided to adopt her. She has been a joy to have and loves to play. In August we lost another of our cats and went back to Cats Cradle at which time we decided to foster Pippi. She was so sweet we decided to adopt her as well. We now have three additional kittens one is Pippi's and the other two are being fostered through Cats Cradle. We are considering adopting all of them as well. This shelter is the best. The staff are all great to work with. Please help them to continue the wonderful work they do. Thanks
Cats Cradle Shelter Inc.	310903		/users/profile/402240	Beverly36	Client Served	5	10/14/2016	Cat's Cradle Shelter in Fargo is wonderful.  The shelter is clean, organized and provides a nice atmosphere for cats that are waiting to go to their forever homes.  They get medical care, sunshine, comfy beds, toys, and "people" time.  The dedicated staff members and the multitude of volunteers are so compassionate and caring.  I have had the Shelter help me three different times in finding homes for cats.  Very impressive!

Cats Cradle Shelter Inc.	309094		/users/profile/400454	MelanieZ	Donor	5	10/08/2016	I became acquainted with the two exceptional founders of Cats Cradle before the shelter was a reality.  They were volunteering at an organization that provided low cost spay/neuter, but realized very soon there was an unbelievable need for a shelter for the abandoned and unwanted cats in our community.  From day one they gave their heart and soul to this shelter and it has grown so quickly to a shelter that has Facebook friends and donors from all over the world, in part because of the media attention of Corky, a cat they saved with bilateral arthrogryposis of the tarsus.  Anyone else would have had him euthanized him, but Cats Cradle decided to try and save him--and they succeeded!  One of the best things about their no-kill shelter is their cats are able to live in rooms with 6-10 cats rather than cages.  Also since their inception in 2012 the number of adoptable cats being euthanized would drop from over 400 in 2011 to zero.  That is quite the accomplishment and says a lot about the dedications of the volunteers who rely 100% on donations and adoption fees.Because I believe in this shelter so strongly I provide a monthly donation to the shelter along with other donations throughout the year and attend all their fundraising events.

Cats Cradle Shelter Inc.	308969		/users/profile/400332	nightfog	Donor	5	10/07/2016	I have been following CATS Cradle Shelter since it's inception in 2012.  It's one year since I adopted Warrant Officer Tootsie Roll...and nine weeks since I adopted Lily Pad (Tripod) and Goldie. I cannot say enough about Gail and all who are affiliated with this extraordinary shelter...and how they go above-and-beyond in taking care of all their rescued cats and kittens regardless of them being bottle babies, injuries, medical necessities, or a myriad of other things. Truly the best-of-the-best, I encourage everyone to support CATS Cradle Shelter...including financial donations so they can take care all these beautiful creatures. Blessings to all.

Cats Cradle Shelter Inc.	308759	1	/users/profile/400134	sbreuer	Volunteer	5	10/07/2016	My daughter and I absolutely love Cats Cradle. A few years ago, we decided we wanted to try to help animals and we wanted to do something local. We found Cats Cradle and began donating money and then we decided to volunteer as well. We've been volunteering for over 2 years now and have discovered an amazing group of people who dedicate their time and money to saving cats. We also adopted our second cat, Nadia, from Cats Cradle and we are so grateful to have found her. She makes every day special in our house. Finding her would not have been possible without Cats Cradle and all the dedication they put forth to try to find every cat a loving home.

Cats Cradle Shelter Inc.	308665		/users/profile/400039	kellymbowlin	Client Served	5	10/07/2016	Cats Cradle is truly dedicated to finding homes for every cat no matter what their history is. Cats Cradle blessed us with 3 wonderful barn cats who would have been euthanized by any other shelter. Cats Cradle live trapped these feral cats, had them spayed or neutered and got them all of their vaccinations!   While most shelters would charge an adoption fee, Cats Cradle mentioned that if we were able, a free will donation to help defray the veterinary costs would be appreciated. Executive Director, Gail, was in email contact with me whenever I had a question whether it be weekend or evening. Typically I am very skeptical about making monetary donations to non profits and prefer to donate gifts in kind; however, I have no problem making a cash donation to Cats Cradle.  This is a top notch organization who truly cares about helping our less fortunate furry friends. 
Cats Cradle Shelter Inc.	308593	1	/users/profile/399960	Sheila73,	Donor	5	10/07/2016	I live in Louisville KY now but was in Charlotte NC when I first heard about Corky and what this shelter team was hoping to do for him.  I have followed Cats Cradle on Facebook every since.  I'm amazed and so appreciative of the care and the work these folks do.  I know there are other shelters in America that also do good work, but Cats Cradle has been "chosen"!  They are no longer a shelter "just in Fargo"; they are now known world wide yet have continued to keep their focus on the care of kitties and cats. I ask that everyone consider including this shelter in your taxable contributions. Another way that I like to contribute is by selection when shopping at smile.amazon.com.Thank you Cats Cradle for all you do!

The dedicated volunteers show us the best of what human beings are capable of in taking care of the most helpless - as well as others who come into their care. I am happy to support this shelter from afar. They use their funds wisely, are accountable and responsive, and most dedicated.
Cats Cradle Shelter Inc.	308640		/users/profile/400009	Susan504	Client Served	5	10/07/2016	We lost our cat four years ago to an illness and she had been a rescue.  When we were ready to adopt again we went to Cats's Cradle.  We were warmly greeted by Gail who gave us a tour and introduced some of the cats.  The cats were free to roam in their room and looked happy and healthy.  Gail showed a beautiful long haired calico, now named Callie, who has been with us for four years.  CC assists cats with medical conditions, has foster homes for several cats and kittens and provides a warm safe environment until they are adopted.  We can't say enough good things about Cat's Cradle!

They treat each cat like  they are their own and do whatever it takes to help them live happy fulfilling healthy lives.  They are a blessing in our community.
Cats Cradle Shelter Inc.	308638		/users/profile/400007	April O.	Donor	5	10/07/2016	Cats Cradle is the definition of a great non-profit. They go above and beyond to help animals in our surrounding communities, taking on the toughest and most expensive cases. Their stories are touching, heartbreaking and heartwarming, and they have a community of followers from around the world based on the great work they do. Check them out in Fargo to follow the amazing animals they have and the amazing people that volunteer there.
Cats Cradle Shelter Inc.	308607		/users/profile/399977	DM D.	General Member of the Public	5	10/07/2016	CATS Cradle Shelter is top notch. They have a rescue history that is beyond compare.  Here is a record for you: In 2015 they took in every cat or kitten in Fargo for a total of 525 animals (NO MATTER WHAT THE ANIMALS CONDITION OR MEDICAL COST) and guess what---524 of them were adopted out. They are very careful with all the adoptions to make sure it is a good fit for the cat and new family. Their medical costs for 2015 were $71,487.40 and they raised all of it and more for feed, litter and overhead for a completely volunteer staffed shelter. These folks are AMAZING and sure could use the money to help even more. They are so dedicated-bless them.

This past month a young cat came into her yard, scared, stragly looking and starving. She has been taking care of it and is looking a lot better.  It really is a very beautiful cat but scared yet of people. As winter is approaching  she plans on trapping it and bringing her into Fargo.  I sent a email to Cat's Cradle Shelter and they will be looking for her.I have donationed to their 12x12 program for years.

HERO, Healthcare Equipment Recycling Organization	109699		/users/profile/149451	Lbberg	Client Served	5	04/11/2012	I travel to Haiti with a group of doctors and nurses to give medical care to the people of Haiti. We obtain many of the needed 10,000 pounds of medical supplies  that we send each year through HERO.  Those good supplies would have been put into the local landfills but because of HERO's efforts those much needed supplies go to Haiti with our medical team.  The supplies are used to preform 40-50 surgeries and enable the hospital staff to continue giving care long after  we leave.   
HERO, Healthcare Equipment Recycling Organization	109633		/users/profile/36438	cpeterson	Volunteer	5	04/11/2012	My first contact with HERO was on a mission trip to Haiti.  I found out that they had packaged donated medical supplies to help people there and stock the shelves of a local hospital there.  Their work was lifesaving and amazing!!  When I returned home to Moorhead, I realized that they were providing medical equipment and supplies to thousands of local citizens as well.  These supplies would have been thrown in the garbage without the HERO organization.  This organization saves lives, keeps trash out of landfills and fills a need for people who are really hurting.  What could be more important than that??
HERO, Healthcare Equipment Recycling Organization	35618	1	/users/profile/36438	cpeterson	Board Member	5	04/13/2010	My first contact with Project HERO was during a mission trip to Haiti.  I met the warehouse director, Georgia Dufault in the airport in Haiti and learned that HERO was involved in collecting donated medical supplies that would be used by American doctors and nurses doing urgently needed surgeries at a Haitian hospital.  I was intrigued by idea of recycling medical supplies and equipment and impressed by the mission of the organization.  I am a nursing faculty member at Concordia College, and as a result of my first introduction to the HERO organization, I have worked with HERO as a learning partner for both nursing students and global health issues students.  I became a board member recently because I believe so passionately in the work of this organization.  I have seen the dramatic difference that HERO equipment and supplies can make to local and global citizens.  I have seen how this organization uses the resources they have been gifted with to pass on the gift of health to others.  Project HERO is aptly named, as they function as a health HERO to thousands of people every year, and an environmental HERO that keeps thousands of pounds of medical supplies and equipment from being wasted in landfills!!!!

Or...what do you do with the crutches or shower stool, or lift bed that you have but no longer need?  HERO is the place to go!  HERO stands for Healthcare Equipment Recycling Organization.  This worthwhile non-profit promotes "green" by recycling reusable and discarded medical supplies to people in need, which would otherwise end up in landfills.  The HERO motto is "Save a Life, Save the Earth"! I can't think of a better organization that is providing these two invaluable services..medical supplies to the needy and recycling the tons of supplies being thrown away!  I have been a volunteer sorter for HERO over the last nine years, and am a board member as well.    HERO has a huge environmental impact, keeping over 50 tons of medical supplies from disposal in our local landfill.  I believe in "Going Green" and I believe in HERO's mission and vision to provide medical supplies locally and globally.

HERO, Healthcare Equipment Recycling Organization	35686	7	/users/profile/36491	jfremstad	Board Member	5	04/13/2010	I am a former Board Chair of this great organization.  While that might make me biased, I would submit that I vetted my involvement carefully because my time and reputation is important to me.  I valued my time with HERO because it is a relatively unique organization that is not duplicating services others are already providing.  HERO also has a unique dual mission where it is both keeping durable medical supplies out of landfills (fulfilling a "green" mission") and also providing healthcare equipment to those in need.  Thus, I encourage potential clients, volunteers, and donors to check HERO out.

Today, since I truly believe in the necessity of this nonprofit organization, I've become a general member of Tzeva.

This concerns employees, volunteers and even the children themselves, who learn to kknow their own value and potential during the Tzeva activities.

They say that home is where the heart is, if that is true TZEVA has been my home for the last 7 years, every week during activity time getting to the school (I've been in few) I volunteer in, meeting the children and teaching and learning with them. I've met lots of interesting people while volunteering which I'm still in touch after they stopped coming.I remember every child I've been in contact with and every one of them thought me something about life and I hope I have given them all they needed from me.During the summer, in which time the activity is in pause till the start of the school year, I usually feel that some part of my life is missing and that part fill again when the year start, and there is a new beginning.

Young Womens Christian Association Of Minot North Dakota	86515		/users/profile/96875	Aubrie	Board Member	5	04/20/2011	I was introduced to the YWCA in 2009 through community volunteer efforts.  They provide an amazing service to the local women and community.  Additionally, their recognition of the contribution of local women through the Women of Distinction event is amazing.  So many women and children are in need here in Minot and the surrounding areas.  Many are homeless due to very limited availability of housing and outrageous rent prices.  The YWCA gives women a chance to get on their feet and off the street.  It is unfortunate that the YWCA struggles with funding as a much bigger shelter is needed as well as more program availability.

I contacted the "Y" and without hesitation the director accepted my client into the shelter apartments.

Young Womens Christian Association Of Minot North Dakota	85903		/users/profile/95986	debra.dewitz	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/15/2011	My connection to the YWCA in Minot, ND began six or seven years ago.  I was serving on a child care committee at Minot State University, where I am a professor in the Social Work program.  We were studying the issue of child care in the hope that (at last) we would be able to successfully have a child care program at the university.  At the end of the year, the only conclusion that had been drawn is that there was not sufficient support to move ahead on our own. The situation continued to worsen, as the wait for child care grew longer still. We then brought together a number of community partners, such as the agency responsible for child care licensing, the Child Care Information and Referral Center, a church or two that had child care in their facility, and the director of the YWCA.  MSU and these partners worked for several years, moving toward a possible site, which then became unavailable, at about the same time that the largest child care facility in Minot closed.  The need for child care became even more critical.As we worked with these community partners, the one place that stayed focused on the problem, and continued to actively seek a solution, was the YWCA.  The provision of quality child care not only does not make a profit, but is a financial drain on whoever hosts the program.  The University backed away from hosting, citing lack of funding.  The YWCA continued to move forward.  At some point, an agreement was reached whereby MSU would offer the location, and provide outside lawn and snow care, if the YWCA would raise the money to build the building, and to pay ALL expenses related to the program, including utilities, and of course, the high cost of personnel.  When I heard this was their proposal, I was very disappointed in the partnership.  The YWCA would build a building that would belong to the University, and pay all the expenses of the program? Not a very equal partnership, in my mind.But the YWCA did what women have always done.  They moved forward to make it happen, even when the problem was not being attended to by city fathers or state legislators.  They have begun a capital drive to raise money for the building, but they didnt stop there.  They opened a child care center at another location in the meantime, which they are managing without MSU as a partner.  I have long admired how women find the resources to make happen what they have been told cannot happen, and the YWCA in Minot is a shining example of that.  But that was not enough.  On top of all the programs the YWCA already has in place, they saw an immediate need for housing for homeless women and children.  While everyone outside our state has heard how rich ND is, and how well we are doing, they are only looking at the dollars being brought into the state through energy development, and the high wages being paid to oil workers.  The reality for single women and their children is that their wages for women have not gone up at all, but the rent they pay has sometimes doubled or tripled, as the oil company employees pay exorbitant prices for housing.  There is now an even bigger problem with homelessness for single women and their children in Minot than there is across our country.  The YWCA didnt talk about the problem.  They are opening up a shelter in response.I cannot say enough about the positive impact the YWCA has on women and children in our community.  But the value of what they do far exceeds the programs they run.  The empowerment they give to women builds strength in every woman they serve.

They love their caregivers at the Y and are always anxious to go each day!

As a retired educator, I am thrilled that my grandchildren are sang to, and worked with on their basic skills (colors, numbers, shapes, etc.)  The kids love daycare and their providers.  I know that my son and daughter-in-law are very pleased with the level of care, professionalism, and communication between the staff and the parents.
Young Womens Christian Association Of Minot North Dakota	85749		/users/profile/95768	ulyndsay	General Member of the Public	5	04/14/2011	They YWCA of Minot takes GREAT care of my children and other children in the community within their daycare. We've been bringing our children for almost 2 years and we love it! The staff is great and caring and our kids just love them. My husband and I can go to work without worrying about the care of our children during the day. We know they are being cared for by people who love them. They are also a huge support system to women and children everywhere who need a little extra assistance.
Young Womens Christian Association Of Minot North Dakota	85671		/users/profile/95655	caren	Board Member	5	04/14/2011	The Minot YWCA Mission statement says that we are dedicated to the elimination of racism, empowering women, and promoting peace, justice, freedom, and dignity for all.  The Minot YWCA does this by providing 7 long-term apartments for the chronically homeless, offering temporary shelter for women and children until they are able to find their way on their own, and providing childcare in a city that is in dire need of those services.  I have been a board member for one year and have become more aware than ever of the hope that the YWCA provides for women and children in need.  I have also learned the importance of educating our community about the services that the YWCA provides and the difference that it makes in our community.
Young Womens Christian Association Of Minot North Dakota	85656		/users/profile/95634	ValB	Volunteer	5	04/14/2011	The YWCA Minot helps our community in many ways.  The Florence Anderson Center of Hope helps homeless women and children.  Besides a roof over their heads the YWCA helps with food, clothing, supplies, transportation and mentoring.  They work with other agencies to get help for people with mental health issues.  With a shortage of childcare providers in Minot the YWCA came to the rescue and opened an early child learning center.  The child care need in Minot is still not being met so the YWCA is looking to expand but that requires more financial support.  The YWCA conducts "A Day of Giving" many times throughout the year where people can stop and get free clothing and necessities all at no cost.  Many people benefit through the efforts of the YWCA.
Young Womens Christian Association Of Minot North Dakota	85629		/users/profile/95593	Alexandra D.	Board Member	5	04/13/2011	The Minot YWCA is fulfilling a need in our region of North Dakota that is not being met by any other organization: The Minot YWCA's Florence Anderson Center of Hope is the only shelter for chronically homeless women in the area, providing small apartments for single women and their children. The YWCA also helps the women with childcare and job searches, and generally helps them get back on their feet. The shelter also has rooms to house women on an emergency basis (domestic violence)The Minot YWCA also operates an excellent childcare facility (Early Learning Center) to help fill a great need for childcare in the city of Minot, even though it is a struggle to maintain financial support of the center.

Although Ive always been interested in government and current events, my involvement in North Dakota Womens Network activities, such as Womens Lobby Day, has made be I feel much more informed and connected with the political/legislative process.  Im met many new interesting women with which I feel a sense of camaraderie.  I look forward to monthly Feminist First Friday events.

Their efforts have increased the visibility of women's issues and encouraged me to become more aware of the issues affecting women and my personal involvement. NDWN brings together women who share their education, experience, and expertise with one another and I have benefited from many individual's knowledge and experience.   My experiences through NDWN have helped me learn about leadership and have been inspired do more than just live life in accordance to the rules and expectations set by others.

It is made up of wonderful women who are willing to join and give their time for the cause of improving the lives of women in the state. It is a big job, but we have started to make a difference by influencing Legislators and organizing events to show that women care about what's going on in the state and in the nation.
North Dakota Womens Network	37989	11	/users/profile/38782	mandankat	Board Member	5	05/05/2010	I was so impressed with this group of women and how they work on women's issues in the state that I applied to serve on the board.  This group was formed by some women who saw a need in the community to bring women's issues before the public.  There is a very strong lobbying effort that goes during the Session and the organization has been out front on all issues affecting women. I'm continually impressed with the hard working board members and E.D. who are responsible for the continuing growth of this organization.
North Dakota Womens Network	37957	6	/users/profile/38745	l-sundquist	Board Member	5	05/04/2010	North Dakota Women's Network has allowed me to network with other women who feel strongly about women's issues.  Before this organization came along, I did not know of a way to be actively involved in women's issues in a way that impacted women from all over North Dakota.  The organization has promoted women of North Dakota through various methods and is continually working to improve the lives of all women in North Dakota.

North Dakota Womens Network	37922	9	/users/profile/38701	minot-ms	General Member of the Public	5	05/04/2010	I have enjoyed being part of the network.  I have renewed friendships that had been lost over the years and had an opportunity to meet new friends. It is difficult in a state as big as ND with so few people to have regular contact with other women who share my interest in expanding the role of women in public life and want to see women's issues addressed and improve the lives of ND women.  Through the network we can connect and find ways to move the agenda forward.The feminist first friday events are great and the annual conference is a source of new energy.  The first lobby day was an eye opener for legislators.  I hope we can continue to find wasy to sustain the organization.
God's Child Project	286729		/users/profile/376799	Melissa_S	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	My inspiration to help others. As a child, my parents always made sure we were highly involved with a variety of volunteer experiences and charities.  My mom always said, 'we are blessed to have more than enough, and it is our responsibility to help others.' From church functions to school programs to non-profits to the little old lady down the street - we as a family always stepped in to help.  As an adult now, I have tried to keep up with my moms go get'm drive when volunteering, but somehow I tend to stick with organizations that are for children in other countries. Especially those that work with street children, bringing them out of the shadows and into the world where they too have a chance. I am always attracted to nonprofits like GOD'S CHILD Project, helping children receive a second chance at life. My first experience volunteering, and donating to them, was when I was 19 and living in Guatemala.  They had a huge group of dentists come down to Guatemala - working with the families and communities of their base project.  I will never forget the looks on the children when they saw these doctors - their excitement, nervousness, and pride to show their teeth. One at a time I interpreted for the doctors, children and adults. One at a time I saw children who had very few 'good' cavity free teeth to be cleaned, but the desire to have teeth like the American doctors was contagious.  Children got cavities fixed, learned to brush and floss correctly, received tooth brushes and tooth paste; but the most moving part was them now having smiles to be proud of.  These children I later found out were at one point in their lives homeless, living on the streets, and at times child prostitutes bought into child slavery due to their lack of options for survival. Through the help and guidance of GOD'S CHILD Project, these same children were living in foster homes, receiving medical care, education, and food for their hungry bellies every day. Without this organizations help my heart breaks for the alternative lives they could be living, if living at all.  Everyday GOD'S CHILD Project, works hard to find and help many more children just like the ones I worked with years ago, and the results are amazing. These children went from dreamless daily pain and suffering to dreamers who are becoming educated, employed, honorable adults who continue to give back to the children who are like they once were.
God's Child Project	240430	3	/users/profile/326583	PAGSDIII	Volunteer	5	04/02/2015	My service-trip to Guatemala in 2009 was life-changing, as I catch myself having to validate whether I NEED things, as compared to how I lived there. I have/had made several changes to the way I was deciding to spend money. I find myself spending LESS, and being able to allocate MORE towards certain funds. Aside from this all, I was able to make a positve impact in the lives of several families, as I was able to build three houses, and got to play with some AWESOME kids.
God's Child Project	234934	2	/users/profile/306844	Kayla18	Volunteer	4	12/04/2014	I have volunteered with The God's Child Project five times in Guatemala to date, and also have volunteered at the US offices as well. This organization changes lives. We have sponsored kids through GCP and have seen (in person) their lives change forever! GCP offers hope for a better future as well as a better present. Volunteering in Guatemala is so awesome because the team they have down there is so much fun! Every teacher, social worker, coordinator, home builder, etc care about what they do. Many of them now I get to call friends and to have people with hearts of gold working with this project just makes you confident when you come back home. You know that the kids and families of Guatemala are in amazing hands with the GCP workers & volunteers located in Antigua. Everyone should go down and volunteer, it does change the lives of people in Guatemala but even more so, it will change you!

God's Child Project	188548	5	/users/profile/246051	Scott S1981	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/14/2013	After reviewing The God's Child Project's operations, I was so impressed by their efficiency, effectiveness and openness of their finances, as well as their ability to stretch donations as far as humanly possible, that I volunteered full-time for 4 months.  It was the greatest thing I have ever done and I have since brought down friends, colleagues and associates from all walks of life.  While I was at The God's Child Project program I sorted clothing, built houses, handed out food, and worked as a teacher.  When I met the executive director I was impressed by his humility; he was unloading donated food off of a truck so for nearly an hour I thought he was just another volunteer.  Then a staff member came and told him he had to get ready to meet with the Vice-President.  If you are pure in your motivations and want to work with and support a real charity, this is the real deal.  If you are into power trips, and for some reason a lot of potential volunteers and donors are, no one in The God's Child Project is going to let that happen.  There's too much real work to be done and they've been making real changes in countries all over the world for nearly 25 years.  The finances are externally and independently audited yearly in the United States and every three months in the international programs that the Gods child Project supports.  Those external audit reports are available to anyone and everyone.
God's Child Project	165313	4	/users/profile/219762	HNDakota	Donor	1	08/19/2013	In my experience, the financials from this organization are  hidden from the donors.  It is extremely difficult to determine how much of the donation is used for intended recipients and how much is used to fund salaries.  This is an organization that in theory can do a lot of good, but is so careless and inept at sharing quantifiable data, you could be throwing your money away.  In a time when donors expect more than anecdotal stories, Project God's Child has fallen off the map.   There are other organizations that are much more transparent that "do good" in the places in which God's Child operates.  I will donate with them the next time.
God's Child Project	108861	3	/users/profile/148156	Paula RN	Donor	5	04/03/2012	This international organization pairs donors with individual children in the U.S., Guatemala and Africa who need support for their basic needs and for schooling.  The God's Child Project organizes service teams to help with projects in Guatemala including homebuilding. Out of their efforts to ensure that impoverished children have tools to build successful lives, they have seen a need to intervene in the area of human trafficking. As the sponsor of a child, I am impressed with the way the organization facilitates communication and demonstrates how my support positively impacts my sponsoree.
God's Child Project	5298	2	/users/profile/7093	Helper	Volunteer	5	06/17/2009	I have volunteered twice in Guatemala with the God's Child Project and say first-hand that this organization is saving hundreds of children from abject poverty by providing them with first and foremost an education, but also with safe housing, food and medical care.  Every volunteer and staff member is focused on doing what it takes to keep children in school and off the very dangerous streets.
Christian Alliance For Indian Child Welfare	201909	4	/users/profile/263488	FortheNAFamily	Professional with expertise in this field	1	06/05/2014	This organization supports removing Native American children from their families for adoptive placement with white families, not because of abuse or neglect but because they have decided that a white family is the better environment in which a Native American child should be raised. They would be better served trying to help Native American people on reservations rather than removing their children for adoptive placement. This is NOT about helping Indian children, but about providing exotic children for couples who desire to expand their family. If it was about the children, they would help ALL children, not merely advocate for removal of infants and toddlers. If I could give it less than one star I would Racist organization and adoption-centric.

Christian Alliance For Indian Child Welfare	199288	3	/users/profile/260187	Flutterby0212	General Member of the Public	2	04/30/2014	This nonprofit came to my attention as I was researching the Indian Child Welfare Act.  They have valid points and I wanted to know more.  However, after looking at their website for about 15 minutes or less, my access was blocked by the administrator.   This is causing me to question the validity of the organization.  Perhaps this occurs due to a bug in the system, but one would like to think the organization would be aware of this situation and fix it.   I marked that I would be unlikely to donate or volunteer merely because of the lack of access on the website.  If allowed to investigate further, I would have marked unsure or likely to donate.  My decision is based solely on the restricted access on the website and not on the merits of the organization itself because I wasn't given the opportunity to get more than a precursory glance at what the merits of the organization are. 
Christian Alliance For Indian Child Welfare	79707		/users/profile/87046	Lisa Morris	Board Member	5	02/28/2011	My husband, 100% Minnesota Chippewa, was always afraid that if something happened to us, our kids would be forced to live on the reservation or with dysfunctional relatives. Having grown up on the res, not even speaking English until he was 5-yrs-old and had started school, and coming from a very large, extended family, he knew what things were really like.  The first time he brought me to the res was for the funeral of his 2-yr-old niece who was beaten to death by her parent. Neglect, abuse, endangerment are all very common in the family and community. Children begin using drugs and alcohol at young ages. Suicide is common. His beautiful, 16-yr-old niece hanged herself in a closet; the pain in her heart so intense that all she had to do was stand up to save herself. Tribal government claims that the best place for kids is on the reservation, many times living with dysfunctional relatives.We never felt like these two nieces or any of the others kids in my husband's community, really mattered to tribal or federal government.   We felt that what really mattered to both governments was money, and that his extended family and community are just pawns for those that are in control of the money.   My husband started speaking out about it, testified at several State hearings on various tribal issues, and testified concerning tribal jurisdiction before a select committee for the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs.  We began receiving letters from families from across the country expressing pain and tragedy as a result of ICWA.  Five months before he died of cancer, we founded the Christian Alliance for Indian Child Welfare (CAICW) as a way to minister to the hearts of hurting people.  Three weeks before he died, against doctor's advice, he went one last time to DC to speak at the National Press Club and tell Congressmen that ICWA is hurting families. Part of his concern at that point was what would happen after he died to the four grandchildren we were raising. CAICW is the only Natl org advocating for families affected by ICWA. Our advocacy is both judicial & legislative, as well as a prayer resource & shoulder to cry on Read letters from parents, grandparents, foster families, & adoptive families telling how their children have been hurt by the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) http://www.caicw.org/familystories.html CAICW has been advocating for families affected by the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) since 2004.   A few Issues of concern:  -- 1)  Some Children have been removed from safe, loving homes and placed into dangerous situations. -- 2)  Some families, Indian and non-Indian, have felt threatened by tribal government.  Some have had to mortgage homes and endure lengthy legal processes to protect their children.  -- 3)  Equal opportunities for adoption, safety and stability are not always available to children of all heritages. -- 4) The Constitutional right of parents to make life choices for their children, for children of Indian heritage to associate freely, and for children of Indian heritage to enjoy Equal Protection has in many cases been denied. - -  Harmful federal Indian policy affects children and families across the USA. In the words of Dr. William Allen, former Chair, US Comm. On Civil Rights (1989) & Emeritus Professor, Political Science MSU, ... we are talking about our brothers and our sisters.

Christian Alliance For Indian Child Welfare	79184		/users/profile/86494	andrea505	Volunteer	5	02/27/2011	On November 19th 2010 my 4 year old daughter was taken from our home.  She was trying so hard to get someone in our family to save her, she was sobbing and begging.  We couldn't do a thing...imagine.  Imagine losing a member of your family because of a law that allows that to happen.  Imagine having that in your head for the rest of your life.  I relive that moment everyday..everyday.  She is 1/2 native american and is therefore affected by the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA).  This law was put into place to keep NA children from being taken from their homes.  Itwas put into place for a good reason.  Now children are sometimes placed in dangerous and deadly situations because no one wants to oppose this law.  We got our daughter when she was 7 months old and she was taken from us right before her 4th birthday.  The best interest of the child was not taken into consideration.  Her attorney thought it was not good for her, but the tribe and other "so called" professionals stated it was okay for her to be traumatized (she also has attachment disorder).  When is it okay to traumatize a child?  Please help us bring awareness to this problem.  It happens all the time and know one knows unless it happens to you.  Please help.

The Village Family Service Center	106283		/users/profile/143241	bstorm_scsu	Client Served	5	02/11/2012	I had heard about the First-Time Homebuyers classes put on by the Village.  I had been looking at houses and done a lot of research on my own.  I heard that attending this class could possibly qualify individuals for a discount from their lenders and it was a required course for people hoping to use down payment assistance programs.  I thought I could use the financial benefits so I signed up for the class.  It was two nights, about 4 hours each.  I thought I knew a lot, but I learned so much.  It never felt like a waste of time.  I really feel attending this class will save me money in the long run just because I now know what steps to take to make the homebuying process work in my favor.  In addition, you receive a one hour one-on-one consultation with a Village financial advisor.  I couldn't say better things about the whole experience.  A must for someone going through the homebuying process for the first time!  
The Village Family Service Center	26131	7	/users/profile/27164	Joan	Client Served	5	01/24/2010	On November 8, 2008 I lost my main income earning job; about 70-80% of our income. My husband had recently been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes; and he already had four other chronic conditions. His medications were expensive and many. We were working with our mortgage company to stay in our home. This in itself was a stressful activity as the mortgage company seemed to keep changing their requirements. All our income was dedicated to the mortgage payments, there was litle left for food and medications. Sometimes we had to skip the meds because there wasn't enough to buy both. As my income declined we became late with our other bills. I have always communicated with our creditors. This time our creditors became impatient with me. Understandable. I felt overwhelmed because I had no way of getting another job like the one I lost. My husband and I began to promote our individual marketable skills in digital transfer (husband) dog training & boarding. It's been 14 months since I lost my job. Most recently my husband's chronic pain has become more intense. The stress of trying to earn income, manage 5 chronic health conditions and calm creditors has left us demoralized. A friend/client of mine who works in social justice suggested we contact the home ownership center online. There I saw a tab for credit repair and debt management. That's how I found The Village. I spent about 30-45 minutes on the phone with Dwayne at the Fargo location. He helped me see what other options we had and the pros and cons of each. We have begun to implement his suggestions and though we are not out of the woods, we have some concrete options to help us navigate the path forward.

Scott Prevus had enlarged the knowledge and scope of classical music for all of us who hear his programing each morning.      I also trust the NPR news to give me an unbiased and informative review of the happenings in the country and in the world...something that is hard to find in any commercial stations.    The program such as Upstairs Downstaiirs,  Downton Abbey  and Ken Burns specials provide some of the best entertainment available anywhere.    When I settle into my chair with my cat on my lap and my knitting beside me, I know that I will have a wonderful evening!
Prairie Public Broadcasting, Inc.	133557		/users/profile/179291	Katherine Satrom	Client Served	5	11/05/2012	Prairie Public Broadcasting fulfills a great need in our region in an exceptional way.  In a largely sparsely populated area, Prairie Public brings not only national news, but critical local and regional news in a clear-headed accurate manner.  Prairie Public's afternoon show, "Hear It Now," provides in depth interviews and programming that keeps listeners current on everything from newly published books to area non-profit efforts to arts offerings.  Prairie Public is truly a critical informational and social link for people in our region.Katherine Satrom, Bismarck ND
Prairie Public Broadcasting, Inc.	133468		/users/profile/179192	dorthea	Donor	5	11/04/2012	Prairie Public Radio is a good friend to us.  We listen in the mornings and the evenings.   We listen to balanced news coverage, shows that make us laugh, shows that make us cry, shows that help us with daily life including how to cook and expand our spiritual journey.  Our life would be incomplete without Prairie Public Radio.
Prairie Public Broadcasting, Inc.	133450		/users/profile/179168	sawdustkid	Donor	5	11/04/2012	My wife and I really enjoy Praire Public TV and Radio. I very rarely listen to any other radio stations anymore. The great programs on the Public TV are always so good too.
Prairie Public Broadcasting, Inc.	133372		/users/profile/179082	No Regrets	Board Member	5	11/04/2012	Prairie Public Television is an oasis in the great wasteland that commercial television has become.  Not particularly "television people", we none-the-less have finally found something worthwhile to fill the flat screen. Prairie Public Radio is our touchstone for quality when we listen to other outlets.  It is seldom equaled and never bested.  Prairie Public Radio brings us commercial free jazz and classics, as well as fair and in-depth coverage of national, regional and local news through the NPR news staff and Dave Thompson and his statewide news team. Matters of importance and of interest to North Dakotans are covered through special features like Black Gold Boom, Natural North Dakota and ... well the list is longer than the space provided here. In other words, Prairie Public Radio fills the beginning, middle and end of our day. Without Prairie Public Television and Prairie Public Radio, we would be a lot less  less informed, less inspired, less connected, less entertained and certainly less happy. 
Prairie Public Broadcasting, Inc.	133363		/users/profile/179073	BWef	General Member of the Public	5	11/04/2012	Prairie Public Broadcasting provides service to all of the State of North Dakota aswell as parts of Minnesota and Canada.  My wife and I listen to lots of news on Prairie Public Radio and we listen to quite a few programs as well.  We love BBC World News on Prairie Public Television as well as many great programs such as Frontline and Downtown Abbey.  It is a well run organization that is well worth our continued support!

Best Friends Mentoring Program	178584	2	/users/profile/235207	KLD1	General Member of the Public	5	10/17/2013	My son is a mentor to a little boy who had problems making friends in school because he just moved to our town. He was also absent from school quite a bit. My son told me that since he has been visiting his buddy at school over lunch, the boy now has a couple of friends and the teacher said he never misses school on the day when his mentor is coming to see him. They like to play football with my son and he said he feels he is making a difference because his buddy seems happier and he's not getting into so much trouble during recess. The principal told him that just by being himself, my son is a good role model for the little boy, who does not have a positive male role model in his life.

Best Friends Mentoring Program	57655	2	/users/profile/61014	grjk	Volunteer	5	11/23/2010	Best Friends has a geat reputation in Dickinson.  The program benefits both the mentor and the child they are working with.  There's a lot of logic to the idea of establishing another adult connection early on - much more cost effective to do it sooner than later.  I've only heard good things about Best Friends.
Guardian Fiduciary & Advocacy Services Inc	289826	1	/users/profile/380083	cabosmom	General Member of the Public	1	05/13/2016	Kelly Qualey and her teams lack of competence caused my mom and I more heartache than i can describe.  When she had failed us miserably and cost me thousands of dollars she quit and Lutheran Social Services was the only other service available.  They are EVEN WORSE.  Kelly was found in contempt of court for failing to file mandatory paper work and deserves worse.  She closed her company took the money and ran.  She even screwed her own attorney but he deserved to be screwed.  My poor mom has been stripped of every shred of dignity and now is dying of depression in a nursing home.  Thank you to the failed guardianship program and the attorneys who put her there.  She deserves a negative rating for her ethics and complete lack of moral compass.   And she got a new job in banking.   That is scary!

The head of GFAS is as unethical as they come. She makes decisions based on favoritism, not what is best for her client.  She spent a total of 15 minutes with my mother before making major decisions about her care.  She admitted in her year-end report that she had only visited my mother 3 times, yet she made many major decisions affecting my mother during that year.  All of her decisions benefited one member of my family not my mother, her client. She consistently showed preferential treatment of some family members over others.  She insinuated false accusations toward family members resulting in limits to their visitations.  My rating is ZERO

Don't want to rate this company but I have no choice - should have no rating at all.

I also participate in adoration and am a Secular Franciscan. St. Anne's is so warm and caring. If you want a definition of love, kindness, friendliness, gentleness--go to St. Anne's. Just walk in the door and you'll know what all those things mean. If I ever need to move to a retirement home, St. Anne's is where I'm going. I won't be lonely, alone, bored, or sad. I'll be loved and cared for and have lots of things to do. God bless St Anne's.

Sleepy Hollow performs high quality musical theatre productions during the summer season and uses the production rehearsals to educate students on many levels. I was a student in the program when I was in High School and I feel so passionate about the experience and education it provides for young people that I now work for the organization. This non-profit does very much to enhance our community and enrich the lives of its residents.

They have truly changed many children's lives. One child loved the Horse Program, and in particular, her horse Itch. This child had issues with anger, stemming from a tough home life. At one point in the summer of 2010, she helped another girl overcome her fear of horses by taking her out to the pasture with a staff-led group, allowing her to pet Itch and to stand beside her all the time. This was a beautiful moment when our resident could feel "success"--something she dearly needed.

My son attended two year, 2011 and 2012, took 2013 off to attend another camp.  They sent him the application for 2013 but I contacted the director of the camp and explained that we were taking 2013 off to attend a camp in Montana.  She said nothing at that time about any issues that had arisen.  I applied for camp 2014 in Feb and emailed making sure they got the application and all.  They again said nothing about issues.  I got an email last night from Kim Belgarde, director, saying that due to serious behavior problems with my son he was being banned from camp for good and she hoped we find another camp for him to attend.  I emailed her asking for specifics about the behavior and have heard nothing so far. We were never alerted to any issues, either year, about any problems, not by email, phone call nor in person when I personally picked him up.  I am beside myself as I just don't understand how they can, after two years, ban a child from attending a camp that he looks forward to and with other kids that have had cancer like him.  I feel they are discriminatory against some kids when it comes to their decisions and they are very hurtful to children who have been hurt enough in their illness journeys.
