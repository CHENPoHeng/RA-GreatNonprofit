They graciously let us use a room to have a meeting even though we're not members as they knew it would help a member of the community. I wish there were more agencies like the Women's Intercultural Center.  Thank you for your generosity.

Women's Intercultural Center Inc	318129		/users/profile/93827	Sally C.	Donor	4	11/02/2016	I started working with the Women's Intercultural Center as a volunteer computer instructor.  What fun! We were working in English and Spanish. As time went on I saw so many women and members of their family taking English lessons learning to cook with healthy recipes, learn to sew,  and register to vote  just to name a few of the classes.  Women have gone on to paying jobs outside the center and often on to school, : GED or community college.  I am so impressed  how the Center adds in a positive way to the community of Anthony NM / TX.  The picture is me with Sister Camilla, one of the founders of the center. 
Women's Intercultural Center Inc	84576		/users/profile/93827	Sally C.	Volunteer	5	03/31/2011	i volunteered with this organization in it's beginning days.  I taught computer software.  The women who came were so pleased to have a place to meet other women, study English, and take many other interesting classes.  The miricle of this organization is that it was started by a group of Sisters who were able to , over the years, transfer the running of the center to the women who  benifited from it.  The center has grown into a dynamic organization that meets the many needs of the women and their families in this small, rural, bilinqual community.  I am very proud to have been associated with it.

They're a great non profit organization that really seek to empower and help the community. They have so much to offer to each unique individual that comes through their door. You get to meet wonderful volunteers and teachers, they all make you feel welcome and part of a family. I was fortunate to have given the opportunity to be part of the team. Thank you Mary for all your support and all the knowledge you passed on. You helped me grow as a professional and a women. I feel that I've come out of my shell and gained confidence on what I am capable of achieving and value myself as a strong women now. Thank you women's Intercultural Center for a great experience.

I realized the center is made up of mainly volunteers. The services offered to the community and the women make an impact to families and create a better pathway of knowledge. The center programs events that invite the community families and encourages women to participate. I had much fun participating and gaining this new experience. 
Women's Intercultural Center Inc	285581		/users/profile/375584	mobileUser375584	Volunteer	3	04/11/2016	The personnel/volunteers are very friendly and respectful.  The nonprofit could improve by offering more workshops during the evenings and workshops to children and parents.  Also,  not assuming that volunteers know what the expectations are of doing certain things if they aren't shown or given examples of what is expected.  Also, give volunteers the opportunity to interact more with the community,  instead of doing secretarial work.

Women's Intercultural Center Inc	282446		/users/profile/372602	Sharon175	Volunteer	5	03/15/2016	I've visited The Women's Intercultural Center for numerous years, initially donating books and other items so I've had the opportunity to watch it evolve. As a found object artist who is tired of 'lugging' my work around to small markets, I decided at the end of 2015 that I would contact nonprofits from Las Cruces, NM down to El Paso, TX offering my art to be used in fundraisers. Nice idea until I realized the time, etc. in doing that! One day, out of the blue, I receive a phone call from Mary Carter. She told me how she remembered the art curating I had done some years back at a local utility company and  'might' I be interested in doing the same for The Center? WOULD I? YOU BET I would!  Also that she recognized the need to expand the art programs which would also benefit the community. I am SO looking forward to working with this dynamic person, curating, conducting art workshops and bringing more affordable art to the area. Art is a venue that lifts people up, that teaches life skills along with problem solving. It's an equalizer in the sense that anyone can create! on and on and on!2016 WILL BE a great year for The Women's Intercultural Center!
Women's Intercultural Center Inc	282147		/users/profile/372264	mobileUser372264	Volunteer	5	03/11/2016	I was a volunteer at The women's intercultural center and it was a really good experience.  This center is helping the community to grow; it is doing a really good job by giving different programs and classes to people to learn something new. Each members are kind and treat you well.  It was a really good experience. I think they can improve if they put the information of their programs in schools so that more jouth can come into the center to learn something new, get them to involve in their community and not being outside in the streets.

Women's Intercultural Center Inc	275561		/users/profile/365191	mlcornejo	Volunteer	5	01/04/2016	I volunteered at Women's Intercultural Center from October 2015 up until January 2016. It was an unforgettable experience. First, with Mary,  executive director of WInC. From day one that I met her she drowned me with her intelligence and advice. In these few months she taught me different life lessons, and opened a different perspective on how to look at things. I was able to gain different types of work experience. Whether it was being the emcee at special events to marketing, she always believed in me and knew I would do a good job. The staff here at WInC are very welcoming, very polite and they treat you with respect. The way the Center helps so many people, giving away canned food and clothing for the less fortunate, gifts for Christmas, some free programs, etc., it's something that I will forever be in awe. I love the programs that the Center has to offer and I encourage you to inform yourself of the different events and programs the Center has to offer.   I'm glad I got the opportunity to work here and be able to learn so many different things here at Women's Intercultural Center.
Women's Intercultural Center Inc	272842		/users/profile/361971	Writer	Volunteer	5	11/24/2015	I volunteered at the Women's Intercultural Center for the past few months.  I was impressed by the wide variety of cultural events and social services that they offer to the local community.  The topics of classes range from the English language, Zumba, guitar, and U.S. Citizenship.  They also host a variety of other programs and services to community, focusing on culture and empowering women.  Overall, it is a great place and I learned a lot from my volunteer experience there!
Women's Intercultural Center Inc	272286		/users/profile/361303	Writer	Volunteer	5	11/17/2015	I did service learning hours at the Women's Intercultural Center and it was a great experience. They treat people with respect and dignity without distinctions, even though the center is intended to help transform the lives of women they also open their doors to men and children. It is a place where you can see a multicultural agency developing where stereotypes are breaking down and consciousness is being raised.

The women that run the center are so friendly and welcoming, they make the center feel like home. Not only that, but the classes they offer are spectacular. They have a wide range of classes and most, if not all, are in Spanish which is great for our community. They also have a thrift shop where most everything is 25 cents; this helps the center raise money and also helps community members that might not have sufficient resources to buy as $25 shirt. Overall, my experience at the center was amazing and I encourage everyone in the area to drop by sometime.

I was impressed with the Women's Intercultural Center, both in the building's architecture and with the work they are doing in the local community. Everyone who works at the Center has certainly achieved creating a safe haven for women to take classes to further their education, and to relax by going to yoga, zumba, or reiki. I greatly enjoyed volunteering at this Center; it is a very happy place to be.

It teaches those who arrive the tools needed to navigate, succeed and survive in the U.S. The program I worked in was called "Remapping Our Home" and we learned what the community has to offer us in hopes of becoming more active in the community. There's a very strong sense of solidarity among every women that arrives in the center and strong bonds of friendship are formed.

I believe this agency is doing their job in meeting the community's needs from different aspects including the need of volunteers to complete community service.

Not only physically, but mentally. I was with him since I was 14 years old, he was very possessive, until recently, he decided to attack me.  Someone had already told me ababout this great place, before I was brutally attacked, but I always took is as a "I'll go later." Not until it happened was when I decided to go. I've got to admit, at first I was very embarrassed because of the situation, but they give you such a welcoming and warming experience, they treat you and make you feel like you're actually worth something. I highly recommend this organization to any woman who is facing any type of abuse.  Whether it's emotional, physical, or mental abuse.

Luckily, The Womens Intercultural Center was able to work with us in a timely manner and accommodate to our needs. Our retreat was a success in great part for the wonderful and inviting facilities, dorms, a full kitchen, classrooms, a rooftop, and even a fire place! Every one of our participants was fascinated with the location and inspired by the genuine work this center does. This center welcomes everyone like family and walks side by side with their clients to achieve their success. A welcoming and friendly spirit is perceived the moment you walk through their doors where everyone is ready to give a hand.

I was very impressed to find that their building is built with recycled tires and glass and that not only do they recycle the usual items: cans, plastic, glass -- they recycle clothes and even make new items from recycled materials.  The center empowers the members through GED training, employment training, micro-business training and civic engagement.  They rent out their facility to the public and house volunteers to help them run the organization.  They have empowered and assisted many women to become more self-sufficient and leaders in their community all while using very innovative fundraising strategies and useful programming.   Congratulations to the Women's Intercultural Center and keep up the good work!
Women's Intercultural Center Inc	171411		/users/profile/226957	supreethag	Volunteer	5	09/23/2013	I interned at WIC during the summer of 2009. It was the summer after my freshman year in college and I had just recieved a travel grant to intern at organizations that worked on the U.S./Mexico border.  Being from the east coast,  New Mexico, Mexico and Texas was completely foreign worlds to me. However, while interning at the center for those few months, I was pretty much from day one welcomed with open arms.  There were many things, experiences and people that I still remember fondly from my time there, but most of all I remember learning to always dream big. Mary Carter has just taken over the executive director position at the center, and she had a vision for the center that I had only caught a glimpse of during my time there. However, she always encouraged me to come up with orginal ideas for programs, to see past the current functions of the center into it's  limitless future and when I presented my ideas, she listened! As a meager to-be-sophomore this was and still is one of the most important lessons I learned in life. Moreover, the women I met at this organizations were wonderful,  intelligent and moving in their passion for the organization, their families and the community. I got to know everyones stories, many filled with struggle, and saw how much their loved being at the center everyday, and it was incredible. Being surrounded by so many strong woman was such a positive experience for me because it was not everyday on the east coast that I existed in organizations and structures entirely run by a group of women.  The work done at WIC is not only necessarily, but inspirational for the many young girls who hope to become young women someday. Girls who are seeking role models, how to dream and safe place to be themselves. I cannot thank them enough for the opportunity they gave me to learn this at such a young age.

The center empowers women to fulfill their dreams through educational, political and economic resources. Many of the people that are helped by the center have never had the self esteem to begin their own business. There are numerous successful Alumni.  The dedication and strive for women's education is something I have seen in no other organization.  The center assist women in developing action plans on financing and/or using the centers resources for various educational pursuits. For some it may be college for others it may be a specific trade. The summer program which immerges students in the border region is a well known program; which helps highlight the issues on the border.

Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/17/2011	The center helps develop self reliance in the participants of the program. It is based on a three step approach. The approaches are circular in nature so none is more important than the other, but simply build upon each other. These three approaches are education, economic self sufficiency and consciousness raising for change.   In the education aspect the center has partnered with Dona Ana Community College to bring the participants opportunities to study ESL, citizenship and GED programs.  The eventual goal is to bring the participant up to the level of being a self sustaining entrepreneur who can make a difference in the community and pass on the opportunities to other needy individuals in the area.

In the way of how they completly just close the doors for many women in the center and of course i am one of those. Yes they may be another Zumba there but yet its not the same , with ZumbaAnnette in at the center we felt like home even though there were at times where we didint felt welcome but i  loved the class Annette would give us there, besides it was really close to my home which thats a big plus.  i feel things should have been different in the way they manange the center. Maybe handling at their own time and more private, because getting our instructor Annette out of the restroom is not right or out of her class, just to simply because they need it to talk to her.One of the main reasons they gave us  was because of our children, for the reason being our children could not attend the class and because of them the center was a mess now..i strongly believed that we are in a community where we all need to help each other and the center should have a place where our kids can be part of it, they should consider having  a day care in there or someone that can helped other women while they get some streess off their shoulder.

TODAY more than 50 women that attended Annette's zumba class were proved wrong. The center wasnt made for all the women in the community of Anthony,  it is only opened for the women that are wanted there! Annette is known to be one of the best instructors in the community and has helped many women with there health, depression ext. Annette  class has personally helped me with my overweight and depression. With the class being canceled  it will affect all the women that got together every morning and every afternoon to dedicate one hour to them selfs. I believe that the decision that was made today was poorly and obviously the women that attended the center specifically for Annette's zumba class were put aside and we all feel that our vote as women did not count.

I have been doing very well doing Zumba my dr advices me not to stop doing my Zumba and my instructor has motivated me keep it up. I would just like to see what we can do to stop this injustice and I do believe the woman that is in charge at this time is not being fair on kicking the Zumba class out of the Center. Again THE WOMAN'S CULTURAL CENTER IS FOR THE WOMAN AND WE ARE GETTING KICKED OUT! We need to find somebody that cares for the woman and help the woman of this community.

Women's Intercultural Center Inc	160913		/users/profile/74131	allen	Volunteer	5	06/18/2013	I have volunteered for the Womens Intercultural Center for about a year now. And what I can say is that they surprise me each day. They always have something useful for people who are in need for help. They always find ways to provide classes for people who are in a need to learn. They always have the answer to anything. They do not give up on anybody and they give away free books to help empower education to its community. They reach far and beyond to help each individual who needs help or just some advice. The staff is wonderful that they talk to you personally including the executive director Mary Carter who is able to sustain the center for so long and help out individuals to reach there goals. I have no idea how she does it. The type a dedication I see throughout the staff is something so rare that it is something to be cherished and grateful to still have people like this in a time like this. I am glad to volunteer for such a wonderful organization that has help me developed a greater sense of community. 
Women's Intercultural Center Inc	67821		/users/profile/74131	allen	Volunteer	5	02/14/2011	I've volunteered and attended many of the events this center has had to offer. They offered an opportunity when the City of Anthony first became a City to talk to the candidates running for Mayor and the Trustees by asking them questions that we thought was important in our community. By doing this the Center allowed us to pick who we believed would be the right people to run for the City and who would make the changes we believed we needed in the community. They celebrate their participant and volunteer's birthdays which was really nice because I've never seen anything like that before. Over the summer they have workshops for youth that help mentor them into becoming successful in the future. The best part about this center is they also offer counseling if you have any problems you need to talk about. Not only does the counseling help but just befriending the ladies that come to the center and talking with them. Once you step in the door your life changes forever.

Women's Intercultural Center Inc	160298		/users/profile/212570	nicolenico	Client Served	5	06/11/2013	I had a chance to attend the Border Awareness Experience at the Women's Intercultural Center and if I had to use one word to describe it, it would be "INCREDIBLE". Of course I can use more words than that such as amazing, inspiring, educational, fantastic, life-changing, eye-opening, unbelievable, there's just so much I can say about it. When I first signed on to take part in the Border Awareness Experience I was expecting to be stuck in presentations and just full on powerpoints on immigration, honestly something that would put me to sleep, but the experience at the center was nowhere close to that. I was truly immersed into the experience by having a chance to go on a Border Patrol Tour with actual Border Patrol Agents, host family stays, hearing from a Federal Judge at a Federal Immigration Court, visiting organizations around the city that work with immigrants, and what made the experience truly extraordinary were our hosts at the Center. Two guys by the names of Saif and Eric lead the experience and we met with the Executive Director Mary Carter who was just an inspiring individual with anything she had to say. It was these people that made the experience so much better. Saif actually coordinated and planned out everything my school did for the whole week we were there, and what surprised me the most was that he was so young. I didn't expect someone so young to plan such an amazing experience and be so knowledgable on immigration issues. Saif provided us a lot of insight on the History of the Border and not only the history of immigration and the issues it faces. He was very open and honest with us and I loved it. If the experience would have been just a week hearing from him, I think it would have been perfect as well. Besides being captivated by everything we were learning it was also nice to have the leisure time that was given to us to have fun, go shopping, and hang out with our hosts. Saif and Eric are hilarious and fun to hang out with. They are the perfect combination of seriousness and jokesters they made the experience unforgettable. All I have to say is to anyone that reads this take on the Border Awareness Experience if you have the chance and if at all possible request Saif and Eric to be your guides. Thank you Mary, Saif, Eric, and the Women's Intercultural Center for providing me a life-changing experience that I will never forget.

He asked me if I would be willing to take time to come in and help him pick up donations as well as strategizing ways to boost fundraising and create programs for the youth. I was hesitant at first but I decided to go with. After taking the time to volunteer and visit to the Center, I was amazed at how much work they do and how many people they help throughout the year. They truly are beneficial to not only the Anthony community but the surrounding communities such as El Paso and Las Cruces. The people that I met that we were helping really changed my life. I realized what was important and how we needed to lend a hand. They brought me in with welcome arms and so did I. I am still working with Saif in fundraising and also creating programs for all the youth to help them develop as individuals and also work the border awareness experience to teach individuals around the globe about the important of border and immigration issues.

One of my closest friends volunteers there as well and that is how I originally learned about the Center. Upon my arrival to Center it was a truly life-changing experience just walking through those doors. Everyone was so kind with me and brought me in like I was family. At the time I was helping the Center pick up donations, working in their thrift store, and being trained to help the Border Awareness Experience Director run the Border Awareness Experience. I was able to learn so much just with the few months of time I put in there. I will be helping with the Border Awareness Experience groups next year and I am really excited because it is something I had not done before. Volunteering at the Center has given me not only a great experience but has allowed me to grow a lot as an individual. I set aside whatever time I can to go to the Center and help them anyway possible. If you want a great volunteering experience this is one of the places to go.

Women's Intercultural Center Inc	113446		/users/profile/154376	cpsc	Volunteer	5	05/31/2012	Just a couple weeks ago I spent a week with the Women's Intercultural Center in there Border Awareness Experience (BAE) and it really impacted my life. Seeing the border and really experiencing the humanity behind the issue changed the way I approached the topic of immigration. So many people hold inappropriate opinions of immigration and the migrants themselves. Before the trip my opinion was shortsighted in many ways. But the Women's Intercultural Center put together the BAE and changed the way I thought about migration. I really enjoyed talking to all of the nonprofits and government organizations that the Women's Intercultural Center presented to us. I loved the border patrol tour and just seeing the fence and how migrants really struggle to live in America. Lastly, I really loved just being at the center, they really treated us well and I felt at home the whole time I was there. Getting to see how the organization empowers women in a culture where it is hard for women to find their identity was refreshing and enlightening. They are really changing lives and even though they are really just "fixing" one aspect of the issue of immigration on the border, the educational experience they offer through the BAE taught me that that is probably the best way to really help the problem. It's going to take a lot of people doing their part to focus on the humanity of the issue. That was by far the most important lesson I learned at the Women's Intercultural Center

It was truly a life changing experience. I went down to the border not really knowing what to expect. In all honesty, I thought I would only see one side of the immigration-border argument. However, the WIC did a terrific job of showing all aspects. Perhaps the best thing that I got from the trip was learning about the culture. Everyone was so proud of their heritage, and wanted a better future so badly. It was inspiring, and gives me hope that in the future the border area will less troubled by conflict.

Women's Intercultural Center Inc	113229		/users/profile/154086	Sean R	Volunteer	5	05/30/2012	I volunteered at the Center because the Technology Director Saif recruited me on to do some construction at the Center. I honestly must say I though it would be a simple job get in and get out. Now I'm not saying that the job was hard it was actually pretty simple but I have never been so astounded by a non-profit. This was truly an amazing organization as you can see the results of the organizations impact on the community the second you walked in the door. All I was doing was basic work such as fixing the roof and replacing doors, but everyone there treated me like family. They fed me lunches and brought me drinks because they were thankful for the work I was doing. Although what impressed me the most was that they kept inviting me to join them for their classes. I decided to take some time and check out the painting class. I was hesitant at first because I can't draw or paint but they welcomed me with open arms. Everyone in the class including the instructor walked me through and gave me great tips on how to paint. They were patient with me and needless to say in the end I learned a lot and was very proud of my painting. No other place can match up to this center as they are truly welcoming and the second you come in you feel like family. I send my best to the future of the Center.
Women's Intercultural Center Inc	112298		/users/profile/152809	Sandra21	Client Served	5	05/17/2012	The Women's Intercultural is such an amazing influential place. There is absolutely no other place like it. I visited the Center for a program that my university offers known as the Border Awareness Experience. This was not my first time coming for a Border Awareness Experience as in the past we did the program with another organization in El Paso, TX. This year we did it with the Women's Intercultural Center. I have to say that I was very happy that we decided to do it with them because it was truly different and more educational. Now what made this program different was a couple of things. 1. I got to see both sides of the issue from both pro-immigrant groups and governmental entities including law-enforcement which was an unbelievable Border Patrol Tour. The other experience we went with did not offer this and I have no idea why. Through this experience you learn you have to understand both sides of the issue before you can advocate for anything. Trust me you want to know both sides because what you are seeing everyday on the news, is most definitely not what is happening down at the Border in Anthony and El Paso. 2. The second reason this experience is amazing is because the Women's Intercultural Center really has it going on. Who knew that an organization that only started from a 2 car garage and a house would now be serving over 3,000 women. All of the staff and participants truly made an impact on my life just by talking to them. I will be honest I was expecting to see victims that were hurt by immigration or the law, but this is not what I saw, what I saw was educated and empowered women who are stronger than some of the women I see everyday back home and we cry over the littlest things. These women have been through a lot but the Center has created a way for them to overcome any problem they face. This brings me to the best lesson I learned from the Executive Director Mary Carter which was that we cannot view another person as a victim. If we view them as victims and treat them as victims they will always be a victim. Instead treat them as an equal and help educate them on the issues so they can empower themselves and light that spark inside of them that helps them overcome anything they face. These were inspiring words and I took them back home and share them with everyone. Finally the ultimate best thing that set apart the experience was their Border Awareness Experience Coordinator Saif. This amazing young man planned our program and made sure our agenda was full of a ton of educational visits and also set aside some leisure time to visit museums or go shopping. He's also very smart, as I remember the first day he told us he would be happy to answer any questions we had on the Border and Immigration and he nailed everyone I threw at him. I threw in a couple of trick questions to stump him, but no he answered every single one correctly. He made our experience worthwhile and one to remember. My school is going to keep bringing students because of this amazing person. If you are going to come down for the program you have to ask for him. Learning from him was truly inspiring and being able to organize all of these exclusive tours and presentations takes a lot of connections. I thank him for giving me opportunity to speak one on one with Border Patrol, to visit the Federal Immigration Court and see that Judges and Attorneys are a lot different than I pictured. and I thank him for giving us one on one time with him to get to know more about the Border since he has grown up here all of his life. This man will change the world because I truly believe he is destined to. I will remember this experience because of the influence of the Center and this man.
Women's Intercultural Center Inc	111475		/users/profile/75952	alicewonders	Client Served	5	05/06/2012	I came to learn about the Women's Intercultural Center because I came down for their border awareness experience to learn about the border and immigration issues that they face down in the south. I will be honest what I experienced I truly was not expecting. What surprised me the most when I came and was picked up at the airport was our coordinator for the experience was a guy. I figured since it was a women's center it would be a woman greeting us, but I would have it no other way. His name was Saif and he was a very smart individual who I found out redesigned the border awareness experience and I must give him a huge thank you because he did a great job. He designed an experience that shows both sides of the issue. I was able to meet with organizations that advocated for undocumented immigrants and I even met with the Border Patrol which was especially exciting for me. When I heard about our group taking part in a Border Patrol tour I figured we were just going to get a little presentation at their facility. No what we got was one on one time with the agents and a tour of the different areas that the border patrol covers along with a presentation, and a visit to one of their facilities on the border where they control the cameras and speak to the undocumented that have crossed over. This is an experience that should not be missed out on because I was able to ask questions to the agents that were with us and they answered all of them. I have been trying so long to get my questions answered by Border Patrol and never could, but here with this visit to the Women's Intercultural Center and taking part of their program I was able to speak with the Border Patrol. Every individual that has doubts about them needs to take this experience. They truly opened my eyes and I still remember one of the agents telling me, "Look I know a lot of you probably don't like my job, but if you want a piece of advice and want to change the way we handle things on the border, then change the law and I promise you we will follow it." I was amazed he told us to advocate for others if we truly wanted to make a change. This experience was truly amazing and the organizations that advocate for immigrants truly inspired me to work harder and advocate myself. They taught me how to make a difference as well and now I am more knowledgeable on the issues. If you want to learn about border and immigration issues this is the program you need to choose. They will open your eyes and you will leave with an abundance of information. Also what will also make a difference in your experience is see if Saif can join you because he has a lot of amazing information to provide the group and he is very inspirational. I truly have never met an individual like him and he is one of a kind. The experience he created in top notch.  
Women's Intercultural Center Inc	69507		/users/profile/75952	alicewonders	Client Served	5	02/16/2011	I came here with my college through the Border Awareness Experience Program and I must say my life was changed forever. I never knew how the Border and Immigration Issues could affect our entire nation. I didn't know everything that these people go through working so close to the border. Everything that happens across the border affects their city. We got to learn from different organizations and learned how they viewed the border and immigration issues. Best part is we were also given a tour by the U.S. Border Patrol and were able to talk with them one on one. I mean how many people can say they've done that. They took us all around the border and showed us their operations it was amazing just being able to ask them any questions we felt we wanted an answer to. There wasn't one question they wouldn't answer and they were very open with us as well. I loved the experience and our coordinator Saif was amazing he was very knowledgeable in immigration issues and he had grown up on the border all of his life. Just hearing his experiences and what he believes could help the issue was amazing. Learning from him was an incredible part of the experience as not only was he very open and honest, but he was funny and was always willing to make this our experience the way we wanted. Thank you to the Center and Saif for being so amazing.
Women's Intercultural Center Inc	111474		/users/profile/69398	Zaid U.	Donor	5	05/06/2012	I have been donating money and items to this organizations thrift store for almost 3 years. I truly believe in this organization's work. All it took for me was one visit to see how they were impacting people's lives in not only their community but the communities in Las Cruces and El Paso. This organization truly makes a difference in people's lives and if you don't believe it, all you have to do is stop by and take a look for yourself. I plan on taking part in their new dance classes coming up in the new semester, and on that point it really surprises me the abundance of classes and trainings they offer here. I recommend that everybody should stop by and see the center for themselves. 
Women's Intercultural Center Inc	63474		/users/profile/69398	Zaid U.	Volunteer	5	02/04/2011	I have nothing but great things about this center, the way they treat their participants, staff, and volunteers is amazing. Everyone is treated as a key asset to help create a better community and a better world. They look for input from everyone to help make the areas they serve better. The center also keeps me up to date on the issues going on through not only the nation but the world through their facebook and twitter. The people they have maintaining their facebook and twitter accounts is unbelievable it almost seems like they are up and running 24/7 and stay on top of all the issues. Upon the many classes and services they offer it's hard to decide which is my favorite. Although if I had to choose one it would be their Border Awareness Experience (BAE). They host college students from around the nation to learn about immigration and border issues which I believe is very important as much of the nation does not understand how easily immigration and the border affect our nation. Help this center continue it's incredible work.
Women's Intercultural Center Inc	111334		/users/profile/151591	katierockgirl	Client Served	5	05/03/2012	I came down to learn about the border and immigration issues through the Border Awareness Experience offered by the center. Hands down it was one of the most amazing experiences of my life and I have to highlight the best parts were the professionalism and how much the center does to meet the needs of the community, the experience was perfectly designed to show two sides of the issue anti and pro immigrant. It was amazing learning about the law enforcement and governmental hardships that are faced when dealing with the border and immigration. I saw a face of Border Patrol and the Justice System that does not appear on the news at all. Everyone should take an experience just like this so they can learn more about what happens on the border because it affects us on a national level. My final comment deals with what was the best part of the experience and that was dealing with the Border Awareness Experience Director Saif. I have never met any individual like this as he was very knowledgeable on the issues affecting the border and immigration. He went above and beyond to make sure we were happy with the experience and added anything we needed. His values were exceptional and if you come down to take part in the program ask for him and you will never regret it. Saif is an inspiration and I hope to one day meet him again when he runs for politics. Good luck to the future of the Center.

I was very impressed at how knowledgeable Saif and Teresa were with Border & Immigration Issues. Every question we shot their way they were able to answer. My favorite part about the Border Awareness Experience was that it showed two sides of the Border Issues. We got to meet and speak with Border Patrol, while being provided a Border Patrol tour, and we got to meet with Pro-Migrant groups and how they view the issues of the Border. With the center's role of being unbiased it creates a perfect opportunity for students and adults from around the nation to learn about the Border. I applaud the Center for the many classes that are offered their as speaking to the participants they highly enjoy them. I couldn't imagine Anthony without WinC been in the mix. They are a truly exceptional non-profit. All my love and prayers go out to the Women's Intercultural Center.

The week was incredible!! The staff at the center were professional, knowledeable, accommodating, and kindly willing to serve as our teachers, guides, and translators for the week.  The community of clients at WinC was inspirational.  There was a positive, happy healthy spirit in all of the classes, programs and social events that we observed and particpated in.  I have worked as a social worker at many non-profits in my career, and the WInC is truly special.  All are welcome, services are directed by the needs of the people served, and staff are happy, open and supportive of one another.  It was truly a healthy envioronment, emotionally and spiritually, and I am conviced that is why their programming is so successful in helping their clients meet their goals.  We left our week-in-residence at the WInC feeling so inspired, uplifted, and hopeful.

From touring with Border Patrol, visiting nonprofit organizations, staying with host families, the Women's Intercultural Center provided us with the knowledge that we needed to be informed persons in society.  I think that this center is the best way to learn about these issues, and I wish that everyone could experience the border in the way that the Women's Intercultural Center has developed its Border Awareness Experience.   The services that the organization also provides with to the women in Anthony and El Paso help them better their lives.  They provide services for women so that the women can get ahead in life.  This truly is the best organization I have ever worked with!  I am confident they will continue to do wonderful things for the world.

While in the New Mexico/Texas region, the Women's Intercultural Center was nice enough to host us and share with us their experience of the border. While there we were accomodated to food and housing as well as many fun outings and informational tours. We were also able to stay a few nights with some of the women from the center in order to get a more personalized experience, which was my favorite part. I learned alot about what the center does for the women (and men!) who come to the center and the opportunities they provide for the women to learn, be creative, and be self-supporting. The women I encountered were strong and independent and excited about all the center had done for them and their family. The staff was knowledgable, curteous, and fun while sharing with us a personal perspective to the issues of immigration and culture which we came to learn about.

I plan to visit again this summer, it is such a wonderful place and I believe this is a safe haven for many women and more than worth putting time and effort into to support.  The women in El Paso and surrounding communities have and will continue to greatly benefit from the support provided at this center.

Honestly at first I didn't know what I was getting myself into and what the Center did at all. It only took me a couple of the days to realize how incredible and beneficial this Center was to the community. They did everything in their power to help women and men of all cultures and income levels to become educated and empowered. I got to see many of the classes in action and how happy the women were with the education they were getting. Each day I learned more and more about the Center and everything they do to help these women and men. They have English as a Second Language classes, GED classes, Small Business Academy classes, sewing, art, mechanical classes, counseling services. You name it they got it or there on the way to creating more programs to benefit the women. I was astounded and amazed that this organization cared so much for it's people that I decided I would give as much time as possible to help them. Whether it would be volunteering or donating, I will always support them.

The classes at the center helped her not only to learn English, but also helped improve her self-esteem with workshops on emotional issues, health, and many more.  The building is beautifully built, and the amount of lives helped through this center is innumerable. Please support this important place.

Often times I didn't know how just talking to these women can help them overcome any obstacle that they run into. The Center provides a great service to the community and they truly achieve their goal of educating and empowering women. These women come in and introduce themselves seeking a way to escape depression and isolation and they come out like superhero's ready to take on the world. The classes offered at the center are not only educational but their fun. When I had to volunteer at the center I didn't know what I was getting myself into, but I don't regret seeing these amazing results.

I have had discussions and worked with the Womens Intercultural Center on many occasions usually associated with programs our church has been involved with. In Anthony, NM and TX (dual city) we have a majority population of Hispanic and many poor and needy residents.  What has impressed me most about the Center is that they are engaged in changing the lives of the ladies who attend the Center.  Most programs in our area are engaged in hand-outs for these people.  The Center gives them programs that change their lives by training them to help themselves and the confidence to take risks to improve their economic and social standing in the community.  I have talked to ladies who attend the Center and they tell me about how much they have changed since attending.   The workers at the Center truly believe in what they are doing and they are dedicated to changing our community one lady at a time. Please help them any way you can to continue their mission.Thank you,  Nancy McClure

The Center is an incredible place for everyone of all ages, genders, races, and cultures. They truly show the example of the definition of Intercultural, no one is denied and they are always there to help. Who would have known that something that started out from just a house and garage would grow into the facility they are now. Though I'm only able to volunteer once in a while this place has made an incredible impact in the way I view life. Before coming here I didn't know how many people needed help rather did I care at all. They opened my eyes to a new world that I had never seen before. The way they help people with their ESL classes, GED classes, computer, zumba, counseling services. They tackle on depression like it was nothing and they even help women and men find the voice to tackle community issues that affect the community greatly. I hope this center can stick around to affect many more lives.

When I was going through it there was no where to run, no one to help or talk to.  It was believed back then that it was the woman's falt for not obeying.  I had to go through it by myself.   It took a long time and a lot of work on myself before I could see it in a different way.  That being, it was a very empowering experience and it is a big part of who I am today.  A strong independent woman that has worked for many years to heal herself to the point where I see that life is about our choices.  We all have a choice to stay or go.  It is not easy, although the choice is there.  We are creating our journey, our lives and our children's lives.  Once we accept that, it is very empowering.  At this point I thank my abusers for the lessons, the opportunity to grow.     The lesson being that I am worth more than that.  I am worth being loved and by that I mean, being loved in a good way.  I don't deserve anything less and I will not settle for anything less.     I am a woman and I love it.  I am strong, gentle, nourishing, loving and I walk in beauty. I thank the women of this center for your courage and your devotion.NamasteYolanda Martinez
Women's Intercultural Center Inc	65293		/users/profile/71372	publicimage	Volunteer	5	02/09/2011	I worked alongside this Center and their Technology Director in taking photos and videos of events. The people are incredible and the people they serve brighten my day every time I think of them. This are women that come into the center to change their lives, but they don't know what their getting themselves into. They become a greater power for good, an incredible person that changes their community with the knowledge they gain at the Center. With a Center like this nothing gets in the way of these wonderful women. It kind of reminds me of Bubble Boy, when they first walk through those doors their stuck in a bubble unaware of their talents and what a huge impact they can make on the community, but then they come in and they tear apart that bubble and release their talents and release themselves upon the world. This Center, these women, and men that come to the center are our future and it is important to keep them around.
Women's Intercultural Center Inc	63469		/users/profile/69394	acarter	General Member of the Public	5	02/04/2011	The Women's Intercultural Center is something I have never seen before, it's a very unique center and very important to the community. I learn that all of their programming is initially thought up off by the participants. They give the participants an opportunity to speak up and share what they think are the major issues affecting the community. The center in turns creates programming to fit their needs. I hope people will help this organization grow especially when funding is becoming a major issue in this economy.

The information shared between the students, Center staff and participants was very interesting because it would turn out to be a learning experience for all of us.  I enjoyed taking part in one of the many programs that the Women's Intercultural Center offers.
Women's Intercultural Center Inc	63041		/users/profile/68926	Rosie H.	General Member of the Public	3	02/03/2011	The WInC is a geat place for women of the surrounding communities to come together and experience companionship, personal growth, strength, compassion, and knowledge.  I have been a member since October 2010.  I attend the exercise class only, but I have seen the fruits of many other women who attend a number of other classes, such as painting, sewing, and jewelry making.  I am a native of Anthony, but I never really knew what a blessing I have in my own neighborhood.   That blessing is the WInC! I have recently retired from a school district after 25 plus years of service. My intention is to continue learning about the center and of the many services it provides. I want to contribute in some way.

It's almost unbelievable how much work these people do, but I truly appreciate them for all they have to offer especially when it comes to empowering women. They never stop and that's why I will always support them. When times are tough and the economy started to impact them, they didn't turn away from their participants they were always there to educate and empower the community.

Women's Intercultural Center Inc	49385	6	/users/profile/50575	miguel1	Volunteer	5	08/07/2010	Doing an internship at the Women's Intercultural Center was an amazing experience. Everyone at the center is really nice and helpful. I leaned something from everyone who is part of the center, this includes: staff, volunteers, and participants. Everybody has something to offer and are always willing to help in anything they can. The environment at the Center is great. It's a place were you can find peace, think about your goals in life and recharge your batteries. The Center offers people from the community services which are based on their needs and not based on the decision of the staff. The organization is moving forward on the right direction and to continue doing so, funding is necessary. The Women's Intercultural Center is the catalyst for change in the community and the lives of the participants.

It was peaceful and a nice place to work. I've been volunteering with the center for about a year now and I have to admit it's the best decision I've ever made. My skills have grown so much, each day I'm put to the test and offered a new assignment. The Center got me into creating promotional videos for them and I have to say it is an honor editing videos it was a talent I never knew I had. Among that I get to bring out the art of my photography for the Center and get to take new photos of their events and classes. Technology is the best part because that is where I am truly needed I get to help them with their computers and teach them how to resolve the issue when the day comes that they don't have me. This is a great place and I've seen all the help they do for people and it is extraordinary. Not one non-profit I've been to can compete at this level.

As a doctoral student in counseling psychology at NMSU, I feel that I am gaining important experience and constantly learning through my work with the organization.  I look forward to continuing my work with the Center over the next two years.In addition, I am consistently impressed by the breath and variety of educational courses, arts classes, and support programs offered by the Women's Intercultural Center.  The Women's Intercultural Center is truly a grassroots, community based organization, as it values and utilizes the strengths of its members to work towards more widespread community empowerment.
Women's Intercultural Center Inc	38639	8	/users/profile/39524	toneta	Board Member	5	05/11/2010	I have lived and worked in this community for 30 years.  During this time I have met many families and are aware of their educational, economic, spiritual, and political needs.  This goes hand in hand with the mission that the Women's Intercultural Center strives to accomplish. To be able to take part in the growth of this organization has been rewarding since my reason for volunteering was to take part in helping the families progress. This includes surrounding area communities.  By volunteering I feel I show God gratitude for His blessings in my life.

Within 48 hours of applying, we had experienced a home visit and our dear Beau was delivered!  It was indeed a miracle!  One week after losing Lilly Belles 3 month old puppy (the one we kept for herreally ourselves), we were not on the road to recoverythe house was QUIET, Lilly Belle was obsessed with us, and there was no more puppy play.With broken hearts, how could we face a visit to the shelter where we would see so many needy pups and stress about how to choose one?  Normally brave, but overwhelmed with sadness, suddenly Facebook revealed that a dear friend liked Lapdog Rescue of NMthat was at 8pm Wednesday evening.  A message was sent that night, the online application submitted by 10am next morning, home visit same day, Beau brought by Brian, the President of Lapdog Rescue of NM the next afternoon!  We had anticipated attending the adoption event that Saturday, but it turned out that since we loved the picture of Beau, and passed the reference check and home inspection visit, we didnt need to go to the event (and Brian said that it was easier on the puppy not to have to attend). Discovery of Lapdog Rescue of NM was exceptional treatment for our broken-hearts!  It was amazing to learn that they follow specific enlightened precepts developed by Brians mother, who founded the organization more than 20 years ago.   These precepts include:1.	All rescues are fostered in homes by experienced foster families (our Beau was bottle fed from birth!).2.	Socialization (people, other dogs, cats, potty-training) is an important part of preparing Lapdogs for adoption.3.	Home inspection visits are required.4.	References are required.5.	Lapdogs come with a package of information specific to their history and needs.6.	All shots, chipping and neuter/spay costs are included in the fee.7.	Advice about the correct food is clear and directive (we changed to a recommended food from one that has been associated with serious side-effects).Lapdog Rescue of New Mexico rescued our puppy, and importantly they rescued us!Today is Valentines Day  one month ago Brian brought a 5 month old Chihuahua puppy named Beau (bottle fed since birth!!) into our home and now our hearts are on the mend.  We are so grateful and know that this organization will continue to serve our community with the high standards and goals that produce the best and most heart-felt love-matches!  Thank you to Brian and his mother, all the foster-families and to those that are adopting from Lapdog Rescue of New Mexico!

I shared I just lost my daddy (this was 9+ years ago) and I needed a "baby". She shared with me about a medium sized Yorkie cross. Later that week, a volunteer brought us this wonderful, amazing dog, Millie. After an hour long interview and Millie checking out our place, she was left with us for 2 weeks. After that, the volunteer returned to see how we all were doing and if okay, we then would sign adoption papers. Well, Millie was what they guessed was 4 yrs old, but that was fine with us! We were so in love with this baby, no way could we give her back! The volunteer stayed in contact with us for awhile, always checking how Millie was. Well, we were Blessed to have our Miss Millie until she crossed the Rainbow Bridge last summer. We miss her so much! But we were thankful for Marie and the volunteer for putting us together, but still checking on us for a while and watching over Millie's well being. Thank you for allowing us to be Millie's forever home! We are forever grateful and will always have in our hearts Marie, the volunteer and mostly our Millie!

That is when we decided to try Lap Dog Rescue. We adopted Oliver (Maltese) that had been with them for a very short time. I was immediately impressed with Lap Dog and the screening process. They don't just adopt dogs out, just for the sake of getting them into a home. Immediately when a dog goes into their program, they are fostered in a home. I have to say this is so beneficial. These homeless dogs immediately learn potty training, and basically how to succeed in a home. I will always be grateful to Lap Dog for Oliver.

They, and the pets adopted in previous years, have been cherished members of my family.  I also have fostered a few until they were placed by the organization in appropriate homes.  It is their practice to give whatever medical care may be necessary, including spaying/neutering, vaccinations and dental care before the pet is offered for adoption, as well as visiting the potential home first, in order to insure success for the pet and new owners.

The process they use to screen potential furever homes is comprehensive. From the application to the home visit, they ensure  that it is a great match. The fosters love and care for your dog and are able to give valuable information about their foster pups. Our foster doubles as a groomer and boarder. When we left on vacation, we boarded our first dog there. She sent us pics of our dog and his new best friend. When we got home, we had two dogs.

When my husband and I were considering another dog, we wanted to find one that really needed a home. After looking at various rescues we saw a picture of Nardo. He looked so sweet with his one big beautiful eye. He had been abandoned at four weeks old at a high kill shelter with a very damaged eye. His chances for survival and for adoption were not good. Lapdog took him in and gave him a chance.  They removed his damaged eye and worked tirelessly to find him a good home. They had him for a whole year before we found each other. I had already had experience with a pekingese  before, and our other dogs just loved Nardo when they Lapdog came out to make sure our home was a good home for Nardo.  Later on, when Nardo had issues with his front legs, and had to have a very expensive surgery to fuse his ankle so he could walk, Lapdog helped us out with the expense! They even helped with our fundraiser for him. They are the most wonderful rescue I have ever had the pleasure of being in touch with. I don't know what all these poor little souls would do without them. Nardo was not an easy dog to deal with or place, but they gave him his best chance, and his is such a wonderful little love. Thank you, Lapdog, for saving our little Nardo, and for all the amazing work you do!

Insight didn't tell me how to think, it helped me with my thinking and allowed me to see what I believed more clearly, and helped me to move forward into the life I desired.

You become aware of patterns that have gotten in the way of the individual or group from being fully present.  I am changed for the better....I have seen others over the years reap a more productive successful life...just through an awareness and knowing of yourself.

It was in Miami and really made me learn many important things about me in the mirror of others. I love the program, I wish for an insight III in Miami or in my town city, Puerto Rico. I would recommend it to anybody who want a real open eyes experience about oneself.

Insight University	152616		/users/profile/203566	cptinfo	General Member of the Public	5	04/05/2013	I've attended three Insight seminars and have volunteered in various capacities.  I found the experience life-changing, not only in myself and in others as well.  Actuallky, I would have to say that experiencing the change in others was more profound than the experience within myself. I mean that I expected the process to assist my own path of personal growth and transformation, but to see and experience the often spontanious change in others was so powerful that I felt such an explosion of joy that it brought me to tears, and being somewhat stoic, that is the highest praise I can offer.  Insight presents material in a way that is easy to understand and implement immediately for anyone being open to change and transformation. The Love and Grace I've experienced attending seminars and volunteering have made more more aware of my humanity and how the smallest of efforts positively affects my quaility life and with those with whom I interact.  
Insight University	152574		/users/profile/203539	Mary Lou J.	Client Served	2	04/05/2013	Insight Seminars changed my viewpoint about life, the significance of lovingkindness as an underlying glue in human relationships of all kinds. It gave me a new view of my own potential to contribute in small (or large) ways to my culture, in the view of myself and all human beings as non-victims.  It enhanced my sense of the potential for lasting well-being no matter what was happening outside me.It also inspired me to go on to further graduate work and studies, and introduce others. I also donated many, many hours as a volunteer, after experiencing such powerful changes myself.

Nem ns. H mais de 10 anos estive em um Seminrio Insight e o valor dessa vivncia espelhou-se positivamente em diversas reas de minha vida.Penso que, a cada dia, temos escolhas disponveis que afetam como avaliamos nossa existncia em termos de sucesso ou fracasso: avanar ou no em um projeto sonhado, arriscar-se em novas relaes, cuidar-se melhor... E estar consciente disso  decisivo para caminharmos com maior confiana e maturidade.Um seminrio de 5 dias pode fortalecer sua clareza, sua viso do futuro, auxiliar na resoluo de conflitos e inspir-lo a viver com maior liberdade e efetividade.

Insight University	143042		/users/profile/189468	Juan S.	Volunteer	5	11/26/2012	I signed up for this program because I heard from a friend that it was a great program, and so I went. Friends and school mates went as well. I arrived at the begining of the program, and had absolutely no idea of what to expect. To be frank, the first day was overwhelming, in the sense that there was so much things being thrown at you. I felt like a deer in headlights. The second day, was even more unbearable. I got home late from the previous day, and could not sleep much because I had to wake up early for the second day of Insight. Later that day, things got much better. Before this program, I alreay had awareness; I kind of knew what was going on as far as my feelings go.  However, Insight helped me develop those skills further, and introduce me to other life skills. I would say that I'm somewhat positive, and ambitious, though very insecure and simply hard on myself a lot of the time. This program has strengthen me, and made me a much more positve person. It help me find ways to clear off the insecurity, and other negative things in my life. Most importantly, Insight helped me step out of my comfort zone. I use to be very shy; the kind of person who was scared to meet new people. I just couldn't, I couldn't go up to someone I did not know and simply say hi. Thanks to Insight, I'm now comfortable saying hi to someone I don't know, and start a conversation, it's become natural to me. This program is really, an amazing program. Hands down, five stars. I met people who were not excited, nor happy to have been in the program on the first day, but by the last day, they absolutely loved it. All my friends that went had such an amazing time at Insight, they loved it. I loved it as well, it was the best 4 days of my life!

Insight me ensinou a perdoar, amar, valorizar no aos outros, mas a mim e ao prximo.  muito mais que um seminrio ou uma ferramenta:  um estilo de vida!

Ever since taking my first seminar in 1996, I've continued to return to continue learning, looking inside myself, and contributing to others doing the same.  Both participating with and volunteering for Insight has altered the course of my life in so many positive ways.  I have greater self-confidence. I am more comfortable in my own skin.  I relate to people with an open and loving heart.  I deeply value my experience with this organization.

Por esta razn mi vida no era fcil, estaba separada y tena tres hijos adolescentes. Un buen da mi hijo Jos me cont que iba a tomar un seminario. Lo hizo y a partir de ese momento tuve un hijo nuevo, maravilloso, de buen humor, feliz, comprometido y mucho ms. En vista de esto yo decid tomarlo tambin y mi vida dio un vuelco total, podra decir tantas cosas, pero creo que lo que resume todo es que descubr el poder de llevar mi vida donde yo quiero y el resultado de ello es que se convirti en una vida FELIZ. No voy a decir que se terminaron todos los problemas, estamos en este mundo que todos sabemos como es, pero mi actitud frente a ellos ahora es positiva y tengo las herramientas precisas para solucionarlos, con rapidez y efectividad. De corazn le recomiendo el Insight a todo el mundo, para m es lo mejor que me ha pasado.Carmen Alvarez.

Como pap acabada de morir, tambin trabaj mucho con eso y con mi niez... aprend a valorarme, a quererme, el valor de demostrarme amor con cuidados y siendo honesta y clara... y descubr cunto podemos querernos las personas, a pesar de estar mirando nuestros errores y defectos... sucedi hace 8 aos y sigo en contacto con varios de los compaeros...

Translating: there I had the opportunity to discover fields of my life, where I wasted energy, likewise fights, wrong opinions, revenge, and many other negative emotions, about I was not aware of the negative effects that had in my lifes. I also discovered the effect of clear intentions, so that i could better focus my energy. In a nutshell, I clear discovered de good effects of having more awareness of what to do, and what not to do. Thats why it is an extraordinary experience.... Hope you can also take part of that. Cheers, Fernando!

What do I do here on this planet? and others...I am a different person today after taking all four seminars. I am very grateful and would like to ask anyone to take these seminars, as they are life-changing.

Insight is a stellar university and organization that has a way of teaching that far exceeds many other comparable institutions. They give a person an experience and the information to become a greater person, a stronger leader and a person who will contribute to society in a positive expanded way using their full potential.  Their teen programs, are gratefully, extremely successful in changing the course and guiding the course of life for kids from blame to responsibility, from ineffective to empowered.

Insight University	132270		/users/profile/177893	frankvitale	Client Served	5	11/01/2012	I came across Insight back in 1998, and I can say hands down that my life has never been the same since!   The practical skills and "insights" (pardon the pun) I learned in effectively managing and navigating through the challenges in my life has been, and continues to be of utmost value to me. Insight's experiential learning model, coupled with very articulate, skillful and caring Facilitators was most gratifying intellectually, emotionally, and, dare I say - spiritually. I have continued to stay involved with their many programs as both a participant and a volunteer as time allows as I thoroughly enjoy reconnecting with others who have participated; furthermore, have found the learning simply does not end, only deepens. With this said, if learning to be happier, wiser, and to love & take care of myself and others more effectively is considered a cult, well then I 'drank the kool-aid' and have no regrets! :)

Insight University	131891		/users/profile/177489	An Escapee	Professional with expertise in this field	1	10/31/2012	"Insight University" is the faux-secular recruitment facade of the "Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness" cult that has been running since the 1970s. The group is actively harmful, with actions ranging from vandalism and death threats against those who try to leave the cult to its leader's penchant for coerced sex with young boys. I would strongly encourage thorough and cautious research into this group and its founder before any involvement with them.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movement_of_Spiritual_Inner_Awareness http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John-Roger#Accusations_of_cultism.2C_criminal_conduct_and_abuse http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20100035,00.html

And they are constantly deepening and expanding. It has assisted me in knowing myself as the magnificent person I am, far beyond what I thought possible. Every time I get involved with Insight I learn something new which substantially impacts the progression of my life.  I have had the joy of witnessing, over and over again, others having the same, individual experience of the personal process of releasing what isn't working and grounding themselves in their own strengths, truths and heart.

Numerous members of my family have participated as well and it has transformed our relationships.  It is such an integral part of the person I am today.

My voice softened and I felt more at peace.
Insight University	131530		/users/profile/177092	gss268	Volunteer	5	10/31/2012	I became aware of the Insight seminars a number of years ago and participated in a series of the programs. I found them to be of significant value in helping me refine the way in which I presented myself in the world. The skill set  I gained from the programs was practical inasmuch as it provided me with the means of achieving several  goals I had set for myself.  After having a series of jobs, I decided that I would like to try my hand at being the boss. For the last 20 years I have run a successful business that has not only provided the material things of a comfortable lifestyle, but has afforded me the flexibility and freedom to explore interests outside of my business. I have been married to a wonderful woman for the past 30 years and I attribute at least part of our successful relationship to concepts and understanding gained through Insight.

Insight University	130917		/users/profile/176434	Michael Dwyer	Client Served	5	10/29/2012	Insight was life transforming for me.  There are many self help books that are out there and many are very inspiring, but taking action is the key.  When you take an Insight seminar, then you "live" their teachings during the seminar.  Reading and doing are two completely different things.  If you go into an Insight seminar with an open mind and with a willingness to transform, then you will "experience" Insight's  philosophy of life.  Insight baby steps you through how to create happiness as a state of mind instead of a life with happy moments.  Another great part about Insight seminars is that their leaders use the Insight Philosophy to teach the class.  In some other personal growth seminar companies, mental gymnastics are used to get you to the same goal.  That can make getting to the goal a little tougher.  Insight uses compassion to show you how to live compassionately.

IU has been a major support for me to trust myself, my own inner voice, and validate the power of being a loving presence in everything I do.  It truly has been an investigation into the mysteries of the universe, and the practical applications of love and service.

Insight University	129543		/users/profile/174908	Marcos Cajina	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/26/2012	Classical capitalism is cold at its core. The mental model that has ruled management is that reason is superior to wisdom and; therefore, emotions, feelings and intuition are rarely available.  We now see how companies are riding through the greatest outbreak of confusion since the inception of classical capitalism. Do we need to upgrade capitalism and redesign the way we create prosperity?. Insight University Doctoral Programme in Transformational Leadership, integrates the heart with the mind to improve the effectiveness of leadership in the revolution we need.

Now, after 25 years, Insight and its teaching are part of my daily life. I'm the one en charge of my life and because I have an amazing tool-box provided by Insight so many years ago.

I'm Grateful for having made the choice to spend a week in a seminar room back then, to learn so much about myself. I live my life based on the basic ground rules that Insight taught me: To Take Care of Myself so that I can help take care of others; To not hurt myself  and to not hurt others; and To use everything for my upliftment, growth and learning. Because of that, and me practicing and using the tools, I can say that I'm happy, I'm Grateful for my life, and I'm HONORED to be part of this organization. And to finish, I can honestly share that I live my life every day to the fullest, and One day at a time. I'm Blessed!!!

The work guided me in transforming my life beyond what I could imagine, and I have personally witnessed the education, connection and growth of literally thousands of others around the world.

Insight University	104744		/users/profile/140521	Laren	Client Served	5	01/27/2012	I was attracted to the work of Insight University because of experiences I had had with their Continuing Education Division - Insight Seminars. The work I did there and the resources for living I gained have served me consistently through my life, providing greater enrichment and fulfillment and assisting  me in making a positive impact through my efforts. I recently attended the graduation of an Insight Teen seminar and was just astounded at what I saw in those kids, from diverse social, ethnic and racial backgrounds. The words I kept hearing was "we are family." To see the rich kids from LA's Westside and what appeared to be gang bangers from South Central embrace the commonality of the human spirit was awe inspiring. Now I am also starting to hear about the work of the Degree Granting Division, creating transformational leaders through the experience of transformation. Thanks to the work of Insight University, I find it easier to think there is hope for our country and our planet.

When in 1985 I was introduced to Insight Seminarsto its sanity, optimism, breadth, and efficacyI thought to myself, if we could get every teacher in the country (or even a small fraction of them) to take this program, wed revolutionize public education. We teachers would have new tools to aid in communicating with, motivating, assisting, and inspiring students. And schools could become places with more happiness, more energy, more beauty, more fun, more learning. Now that Insight University is founded, I thrill at the possibility of this graduate program producing truly transformational leadersfor schools, for non-profits, for any institution or business. Theres probably nothing more important to our world right now than wise leadership, and I know of no better foundation for that than the one on which Insight University rests.      Esther Jantzen, Ed.D.

It was truly the most important gift I have given myself and the transformation I experienced in my life was very tangible and real. It was not merely a shift in how I felt; rather,  Insight Seminars provided me with powerful tools to dramatically transform my life. Moreover, I not only gained a greater understanding of my own value, wisdom, and strength, I learned to see that beauty in others. By the end of the seminar, every participant, regardless whom they were coming into the seminar, were like family. We all left with a profound clarity. The question was no longer whether I was worthy or able to achieve what I want in my life; rather, it was determining what I want more of in my life because I knew I could create it.

Wings Ministry	300008		/users/profile/390837	Cloe1996	Volunteer	5	08/10/2016	I began volunteering at Wings for my very first introduction to Social Work class. I was so excited when they told me I would be working with a population who needed help, a hand, and some guidance. I talked with families and children whose family members were away and from the words they spoke, I could tell all of them were just trying to be strong, stay strong. Even though these families and children are free and not locked away in jail or prison; they are still struggling with personal pressures and societal pressures of being without their family member. That's where the volunteers and the Wings members help guide them, with talks packed with helpful and needed information about; how to budget, parenting classes, ukulele classes and tutoring for the kids, how to get and keep a job, tattoos, what to ask probation/parole officers, going back to school etc. All of these talks are to empower these individuals whether they be a returning citizen, a child whose mother/father is in prison or jail, mothers of incarcerated individuals. Wings is there to offer a healthy, safe, friendly, educational, helpful, easy environment that is judge free. Being the supportive organization for people who need to be empowered, remembered, heard, and seen. I loved volunteering at Wings and even though my Social Work class has ended, I am still planning on volunteering in my free time. :)

I have been volunteering with them for about 3 months now and I can attest to their commitment and passion for what they do.  In helping incarcerated individuals and their families, they impart a sense of hope that many of these people have never had. Breaking the cycle of incarceration is the way to keep our children out of the system and WINGS provides the tools and skills to help do that. WINGS is desperately needed and I hope to see them being used by more judicial systems all over the world.

Wings Ministry	267342	1	/users/profile/356071	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/26/2015	I am so thankful to be a volunteer with Wings for Life ministry.  Ann Edenfield is one of the most dedicated and tenderhearted persons I have ever met. Her love for the families is so obvious at each and every event that she plans for the inmates and their families.  She welcomes the families with open arms, she engages the children and makes them feel special, she encourages open communication from the families and makes them feel that they are important and valued.   I watch as the families are encouraged and uplifted by the  speakers that minister in the Monday evening gatherings.  The families receive a meal , a lecture or teaching and a wealth of information and resources to help them overcome the obstacles and difficulties of dealing with a family member who is incarcerated.  They receive training in life skills,  rewards for their achievements, prayer, and lots of love from Ann and the group of volunteers that support the Wings for life ministry.  The inmates and their families need all the support that they can get from this community and Wings for Life, in my humble opinion, heads the list of ministries achieving that goal.   I am blessed  and proud to be a part of this ministry and I hope that Wings for Life is recognized for the vital role that it plays in this community.

I have supported the ministry financially and attended their outreaches often during this period, albeit not much over the past two years.   This is ONLY because I am cutting back on my own outreaches as well, being 70.   Ann, like me, is very personal in her outreach as, I think, was Jesus.  The difference between us is her 1)energy and 2)ability to motivate others and to achieve consensus and accomplish Wings Ministry outreach goals.  In both of these areas, she FAR exceeds expectations.   She is outstanding and has attracted like minded outstanding individuals.  If you are interested in helping families of incarcerated and formerly incarcerated individuals, Wings Ministry sets the standard!  I equivocally recommend this ministry.

Wings Ministry	117007		/users/profile/159195	nieceb1976	Volunteer	5	06/28/2012	Wings is AWESOME!  In a normal visit in many prisons in Ohio, the family must sit around a table.  There are reading rooms for the kids but they must be accompanied by an adult who isn't incarcerated, so this takes away from the visit time with the Inmate.  The kids must be quiet and aren't able to run around.  At a Wings party, there are games, songs, crafts, fun, laughter, an interactive Bible story, a shared meal, hugs.  The family gets to act like a family who doesn't have a loved one in prison.  The Inmate gets to feel like a person, which sadly isn't always the case.  I have been so blessed by working with this organization.

The programs are always encouraging and educational for this population.  People need a hand up and not a closed door and Wings is there for t he lucky ones.

I have also attended some of her weekly meeting for the families of prisoners.  Her ideas for these people work!The growth of her program even to other states, indicates the value of her program.

I have worked with Ann for many years and remember her trudging through the snow to a juvenile detention center around Christmas to see the young people incarcerated there and we joked that if we weren't going in to see these individuals they would not see any familiar faces.  Tough time of year for them but Ann realized their needs and responded selflessly as usual.   Carl D
Wings Ministry	265557		/users/profile/354292	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/20/2015	Wings for Life provides support and hope for families of incarcerated persons as well as those in prisons and jails.   I have participated in several prison parties and I see the joy in the families as they reunite and celebrate their families and their faith.  Wings for Life also works in the community, providing Monday night meals and speakers, clothing and school donations, and much more.  It is meaningful for staff, volunteers, the families and other community members to work with those incarcerated and offer them love and support and hope for their futures along with inner peace.
Wings Ministry	265555		/users/profile/354290	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/20/2015	AMAZING ORGANIZATION!!! They are changing lives around the country!
Wings Ministry	265545		/users/profile/354279	Claude F.	Client Served	5	10/20/2015	This is an awesome organization helping our nation's prisoners cope with their incarceration. Do you know we have 5% of the world's population and 25% of all the prisoners. Most prisons are overcrowded with terrible health conditions. For example, Alabama is at 200% capacity. This organization provides inmates with time with their loved ones in the form of parties. They call them parties and they are simple get togethers with food but to the inmates who rarely see fresh food, it is a party.  This is an awesome organization doing what it can for those who may have made a mistake in life but don't we all? 
Wings Ministry	265539		/users/profile/354274	Writer	Client Served	5	10/20/2015	I haven't come across an organization quite like this one.  Wings volunteers serve inmates, returning citizens, families and the community by offering education, training in life skills and love to those who want it
Wings Ministry	265520		/users/profile/354254	Elsia	Volunteer	5	10/20/2015	Volunteering at a Wings Ministry function this summer was a blessing to be with the children as they visited with incarcerated fathers, as the children were able to touch their dad,  pray with their father, eat pizza with them, and participate together in fun craft activities. It was an awesome time and all because of the nonprofit WINGS. WINGS truly deserves to be known as a great nonprofit bringing families together. 
Wings Ministry	265493		/users/profile/354229	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	10/20/2015	   Helps families of inmates maintain their focus on getting through the ordeal of prison time being served by a loved one.  That's valuable but equally valuable are the weekly meetings with "Returned Citizens" (ex--inmates) that coach the returned citizens on re-entering civilian life.  Very useful.     The "Parties" in prisons can be a good influence as well.  I met a lady in Walmart who had recently been released from the Grants Prison for women who was positively affected by having attended a Wings Party in prison.  Good work, Wings!
Wings Ministry	265481		/users/profile/354220	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/20/2015	Wonderful organization that helps without judgment.  
Wings Ministry	265469		/users/profile/354209	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/20/2015	Wings is an inspiration to all who attend.  Everyone who attends Wings for LIFE learns lifeskills  through training in meeting people and talking to them about common subjects that they would be intrested in.They learn to set banquet tables for 100 PEOPLE.  This way they can wait tables as a job to make a living while they go to school.The staff are caring and that is felt by all that they serve at the Monday night dinner or meeting their loved ones in prison for family days.  Education for families is of the utmost importance  for success.I am a member of the Wings team and I believe  that this program is a preventative way to stop the children of prisoners from following in the families footsteps into the corrections.   It costs 173,000 per year to house a juvenile inmate.  Whereas it pays only 8,000 to send a child to school.  About 76 per cent of children who are in juvenile detention centers will go to prison.I was nominated and received the volunteer of the year award for the city of Albuquerque.  This is a true psssion for myself and the other dedicated people who work for Wings for LIFE.DO WE WANT A HIGH INCARCERATION RATE OR PRODUCTIVE CITIZENS WHO DO NOT WANT TO STAY OUT OF PRISONS
Wings Ministry	265452		/users/profile/157039	ChristSongSinger2	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/19/2015	Ann and her team have such a heart for the families of the incarcerated. These families need love and help.They show the love of Christ to all.... 
Wings Ministry	115290		/users/profile/157039	ChristSongSinger2	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/14/2012	The Wings Ministry touches the hearts of inmates AND their children in a mighty way. When the children are allowed to spend the day with their parent having fun and learning about the love of Jesus, it touches a place in their hearts that they have kept guarded.  Everyone gets involved and learns to have fun with the supplies at hand. It is easy to forget that they are still in prison! The children get to see their parent having fun and playing with them, sometimes for the first time. It can be a life changing experience to feel their parents love and the love of God at the same time. I highly recommend this ministry.
Wings Ministry	265450		/users/profile/354192	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	10/19/2015	I was so impressed seeing the work and dedication first hand when invited to one of the meetings in NM. One young man was passionate about gaining a job and the help and advice offered was extrordinary. He lived with his family in a tiny community with no form of transportation.  Bus routes and time tables were sought and within a  fairly wide rang. Jobs were looked for, that this former offender could apply for knowing he could travel, albeit adding a considerable time each end of a working day.  He was positively excited at the prospect.  Work with the families left behind when a person is incarnated is so heart warming.  Such tools are so very needed not only helping in guidance to help these people to learn to help themselves but the parties lift spirits, form friendships and motivate the children to connect and give. Well done Wings Ministry.

At the end of the party, we present 1 banner to the prison warden to display in the prison chapel. The second banner goes to Ann Edenfield to hang in the Albuquerque, NM headquarters of Wings.  It touches my heart and my husband's to see families reunited briefly, thanks to many moms' good conduct for a year!       ~Diane in Cookeville TN

Wings Ministry	120355		/users/profile/163696	LynnN	Volunteer	5	08/10/2012	In working in prison's for 18 years, WINGS is the only time I have seen inmates and their families spending quality time together, quality bonding and sometimes a second chance to help rebuild those bridges that were once destroyed. Keeping this bond between the incarcerated and their loved ones is one of the most important keys to helping those behind the  bars and fences have a chance to stay out of prison once they are released. Also, having a Christian-based theme helps to keep the Lord on their side and in their hearts. How can such a wonderful program be denied!
Wings Ministry	119043		/users/profile/161858	deborahdeediaz	Volunteer	5	07/22/2012	Wings Ministry Prison Parties is the only program, that I know of, that gets the respect and and trust from the Wardens so completely that the Wardens allow intimate contact between the parties. Fathers and mothers get to hold, kiss, and hug their small children through out the 3 hour program. Mothers, fathers, grandparents and other framily members get to touch, hold, and hug their adult incarcerated kids. They get to create several kids crafts, eat pizza and cookies, and more importantly havew fun and laughter together. These families are used to visiting through a piece of glass or across a table where they get two brief hugs, upon entering and leaving and are told to be very quiet and absolutely no touching.  I'm constantly amazed at the level of trust Ann Edenfield, our Director, has been able to cultivate with Wardens all over this country.  I know she doesn't do this program in a vacuum. God is in the details. The volunteers represent different cultures, ages, religions, and faiths. Their only agenda is to give each family and inmate love, respect and a great time. I will work with these volunteers anytime and have for more than three years. This is the only program in the country that focuses on the families and allows them the ability to give so much unrestricted swupport to their incarcerated loved one. Wings Ministry and Wings for L.I.F.E. deserves to be replicated all over this country. 
Wings Ministry	117679		/users/profile/159996	Comienzos	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/04/2012	A dedicated founder.  A sizeable and seemingly always growing group of volunteers.  And a mission that is desperately needed for children and families of the incarcerated.  Wings Ministry is a model non-profit and an inspiration to many.
Wings Ministry	117055		/users/profile/159242	Peggy Lively	Volunteer	5	06/28/2012	I have attended 2 Wings parties at a local prison in the Dallas area. It was an opportunity to serve that had unexpected results. As a victim of crime, I was reluctant to participate in prison ministry. After my experience at the Wings party, I was able to overcome my reluctance and hear the call to serve in prison ministry regularly. The service to inmates & their families is heartwarming and such a gift of love for inmates, families and volunteers.
Wings Ministry	116657		/users/profile/158796	cpdna	Volunteer	5	06/27/2012	The Wings Ministry has filled a gaping hole in prison-related ministries by reaching out to the FAMILIES of prisoners.  The founder and executive director, Ann Edenfield-Sweet, experienced the discrimination and isolation family members face when her first husband was arrested and convicted.  She dealt with the challenge of raising their four boys (7 yrs old and younger) alone, with a greatly reduced income and with noone from their church home of 12 years reaching out to help. Inspired by her experiences and the huge population of hurting, isolated families, Ann started the Wing's Ministry in order to share Christ's love with families members and inmates...their number one rule is that "Everyone is to be treated as a child of God". Through community and prison parties, the Wings Ministry volunteers model this behavior to everyone: family members, inmates and even guards, creating a conduit to connect the families into caring church communities.   Life-skills education is available through their Wings for L.I.F.E. program.  I would highly recommend this ministry for contributions - monetary and for volunteer opportunies- due to its positive impact in our communities and the wise stewardship they have exhibited in their use of limited resources.
Wings Ministry	116497		/users/profile/158589	MaryAnn Gay	Volunteer	5	06/25/2012	I direct a Wings Ministry affiliate in Warren County, TN.  We have a partnership with three elementary schools to do Wings for L.I.F.E. classes every other week for children of prisoners.  The children love it and they learn a lot!  One mother sent us the following letter of thanks that shows how her fifth grade son became a mentor for his whole family after serving as a leader of a small group for 2 years in our Wings class.                                                                                                                                           Dear WINGS: My family and I had never experienced such an overwhelming change in life style as we experienced when a member of our immediate family was incarcerated.  We did not know anything about the court system or child services and the children and I were immediately alienated from one half of the extended family that my husband and I once shared and that we had trusted for seventeen years. We had to attend many court dates and we were exhausted from the legal battle that had been placed upon us by his crimes.  The emotional stress, as well as the financial stress was almost unbearable.  This was the crucial time when WINGS first became a part of my sons life, and soon thereafter, my other four children and myself.  My pride prohibited me from attending the family meetings for sometime, but inevitably I was convicted by the change of heart and mind that WINGS was able to nurture in my son with the weekly meeting at school.  In essence, he had not only become much more capable of dealing with his own insecurities but had become an effective role model to his younger two siblings and our household as a whole. My son was an inspiration to me and we got involved as a family.  We began attending the family meetings held at Bobby Ray and also events held at local entertainment and churches.  This provided us with a support activity that was not only emotionally rehabilitating but also a form of entertainment for my children and I that we would have not been able to otherwise afford.  We were able to connect with other folks that had been through and continuing to struggle with the same types of issues and also have the opportunity to help out which is very rewarding.  The WINGS program works where many others fail because it never made us feel like a charity case.  It is an experience that not only changes the prospective, the self-image, the expectations, and the motivations of a persons own will, but also offers a means of filing away the memories and emotional trials by building self discipline, respect for yourself and others, and the ability to turn bad things into new found strengths in a fun way!  Thank you so much for your school program and thank you for all the valuable survival skills that we have picked up just from hanging out with you all!  I will always hold your efforts close to my heart.Sincerely,Angela

First the friendship that develops between the members that work  for them and the volunteers that give there time and heart  .  Wings hasbecome part of my life because i found help and people to talk to when i was lost, not knowing where to go for help or who i could talk to.   the purpose of wings is to help families of prisoners    cope ,learn avenues  to go to . When people come out  there so  lost in this world that they hqave't been in a while and find themselves indespair. But once they find out babout wings and  the Monday night gathering, dinner, company , speakers who may be there to talk about questions they don't want to ask, but are at the meeting. ex-prisoners, we love you and were not going to leave you.

Wings Ministry	116180		/users/profile/158183	PatABQ	Volunteer	5	06/22/2012	I volunteer with Wings because I feel it is very important to help the children whose parents are in prison. We want to teach them lifeskills and encourage them to do good.
Wings Ministry	116128		/users/profile/158115	lisakharmon	Volunteer	5	06/21/2012	We held a WINGS Prison Party at the Youth Detention Facility.One young man said he didn't want to attend because his parents couldn't come.  One of the Facility staff members told him he should come and "she would be his mom for a day."  The young man did come to the party, and later on, he told us it was the most fun he had ever had in his life.  He was released from the Facility two months later, and shortly thereafter, he was killed in a drive-by shooting.  When I heard about his death, I was very thankful that we were able to provide him with a wholesome, really enjoyable memory before he died.       At another party, a teenaged girl came with her mom to a Prison Party at an adult detention facility.  She didn't want to have anything to do with her dad, who was an inmate, and she seemed very embarrassed by him.  But as the party progressed, I saw her start talking to her dad, and later, I saw her sitting next to him with her head on his shoulder.  I was so glad we had a part in helping to reunite that father and daughter.  I could tell dozens of such stories about how WINGS has helped to encourage prison inmates and their families and how it has helped to strengthen family ties.
Wings Ministry	116108		/users/profile/158093	Katalina	Volunteer	5	06/21/2012	I've attended a Wings Ministry Party and it's the most wonderful, inspiring, uplifting event I've ever attended.  How awesome it was to see families interact, fathers interacting with their children; husbands and wives having the opportunity to connect and talk to one another, and the smiles that come from deep within from the very depth of their souls. Wings is a God Send to the families of the incarcerated citizen. It gives incentive to the incarcerated individual to make better choices so they can have the opportunity to visit with their families, it gives the children, wives and girlfriends excitement and peace that they will have the wonderful opportunity to visit with their loved one. Wings is a needed ministry with the prison institution. Not only does it unite families for a few hours, it makes a significant difference in the lives of children to interact with their parents and strengthens relationships.

Wings Ministry	116049		/users/profile/158015	jim zanios	Donor	5	06/21/2012	I have always have felt a need to help people that have been incarcerated, and then Wings showed me how much there is a need for the families of the incarcerated. This program and ministry can help connect both issues and bring love, encouragement, and life training to the desperate. I have watched Wings for 17 years grow from a vision to a very successful reality with great oppurtunities for growth. Along with helping families it does a tremendous service for the local and state governments when we help people reintergrate to society. 
Wings Ministry	115962		/users/profile/157893	jefro2	Volunteer	5	06/20/2012	I volunteered at a prison in Dallas-area with Wings.  I had not spent any time thinking about what the experience would be like, but it was very touching and really made me think about all the innocent families and wives and children who whose husbands are in jail. you could tell that all of the inmates and family cherished their time together.

Wings Ministry	115832		/users/profile/157739	Joyce O.	Volunteer	5	06/20/2012	In October 2000 I became the Director of Music MInstry at Central United Methodist Church in Albequerque, NM.  I met Ann Edenfiled who is an alto in the Chancel Choir.  I bagan to hear about the Wings Ministry.  We had several Wings Parties in our church fellowship hall.  The first party for me was one of disbelief.  I saw the inmates interact with their families, the volunteers and with Anne.  We sang songs,  prayed, acted out Bibles verses, listened to Anne tell her story, ate and played games with the families.  When everyone left, I was totally in awe.  I know that God was present and transformations in our lives were happening.When I moved backed to Arlington, TX our church, Trinity United Methodist, became involved with Wings and we have participated in this ministry at Hutchins State Prison.  My husband and I are also financial contributors.   I hope you fly to the Wings Ministry and become involved.   Joyce Olson, Arlington, TX
Wings Ministry	115820		/users/profile/157725	lindan	Volunteer	5	06/20/2012	I first attended a Wings for L.I.F.E. party when my son was incarcerated.  It was so wonderful to be able to interact with my son and other inmates playing games, singing songs and acting out bible stories.  We had fun, acted silly and ate pizza!  Since then, I have volunteered for other parties.  i'm not sure who gets more out of this - the volunteers or the inmates.  It is so wonderful to see families having fun together, singing, doing crafts and SMILING and laughing.  There is not much to smile about when you are incarcerated and some of these families have never been in church before.  Everyone came away feeling a sense of hope and maybe not is all lost when you are incarcerated.

Wings Ministry	115327		/users/profile/157077	Corinne R.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/14/2012	I began working with Wings while I was Program Director at Dismas House New Mexico, a transitional living facility for newly paroled individuals in Albuquerque, New Mexico.  I knew the importance of having ex-offenders live in a positive environment with strong role models. At that time left out of the equation was the ex-offenders family.Thanks to Wings Ministry, an arrangement was made to have program participants attend the Wings bi-monthly meetings with their family members.  This coming together was a huge success. Dismas House program participants looked forward to the meetings.  This gave them a chance to be with their loved ones and to experience positive moments together.What I witnessed was encouraging.  Wings Ministry provided a stable learning environment not only for the residents of Dismas House but for their family members.  The workshops and dinners gave many something that had been missing from their lives, a safe haven within such a positive environment.  The children felt safe and the family that was once torn apart by prison grew stronger through Wings Ministry.I am thankful that Wings Ministry provides such an important service to families that need support in trouble times. I am thankful that Wings Ministry is now a national program and that others in faraway places can experience the joy and blessings that Wings Ministry shares.Corinne Rodriguez, Director.

They also try to help us keep our families together even when our loved one is locked up.  It is great to know that they care enough about us to pray with us as will as for us.

Wings Ministry	115218		/users/profile/156959	maryc1	Volunteer	5	06/14/2012	As a retired clinical social worker I am amazed at the contribution Wings Ministry is making within this community. This is due largely to the energy and vision contributed by the founder and director, Ann Edenfield Sweet. This agency functions on a shoestring. I have never witnessed how much a "shoestring" can be stretched. Volunteers of all sorts amass into an army providing a very wide range of supports. Food and other necessities are sought from hither and yon . All are acknowledged in agency literature. Promotional materials are informational and budget wise.This is an extraordinary agency. I have attended several functions . What is most noticable is the manner in which everone attending participates in some way--from oldest to youngest. All of us leave uplifted and many loads are lifted from burdened shoulders. The agenda is simple and straightforward. Participants have their sense of dignity and value affirmed and renewed. This program is an excellect example of what can be done.
Wings Ministry	115207		/users/profile/156940	prisonvolunteers	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/14/2012	Ann Edenfield Sweet and the Wings volunteers do a great job building and strengthening inmate family bonds that contribute to the successful return of an incarcerated loved one to the community.   The laughter and smiles by volunteers and inmate families who attend Wings events are a source of encouragement and hope that continue long after the initial Wings event has come and gone.  
Wings Ministry	115186		/users/profile/156910	MissPegg	Volunteer	4	06/14/2012	I have volunteered with other prison ministries.  Many prision ministries are there once a year, and you never hear from them again.   Rarely do they assist with the family on the outside.  On the inside you're left on your own and that's tough in the prison environment.  WINGS makes connections with families and their loved ones who are incarcerated.   Connections with the church in the area the family lives, training for life on the outside for the family and the released loved one, major visitation time once a year for encouragement, care, and fun!  Being a volunteer with WINGS has helped me understand more fully what the family goes through and how to help remedy the situation.  It is the best  ministry in New Mexico, and they help other ministries in other states and around the world.
Wings Ministry	115180		/users/profile/156899	Vallejos	General Member of the Public	5	06/14/2012	I highly recommend any donations to the organization.

Therefore this helps the children to believe in themselfs and not follow there parents footsteps.  This organization does help so many individuals and has such a great program.  
Wings Ministry	115173		/users/profile/156890	Larry T.	Volunteer	5	06/14/2012	My wife and I participated in Wings Ministry in-prison parties in 2008 and 2009 in Tennessee and New Mexico.  The parties are one of the most cost effective and impactful events that I have participated in. In my job, I work with national and regional prison focused ministries. Wings Ministry is one of the best organizations that I work with. Wings Ministry does more with less than any other organization that I know. Their outreach and continued growth is only limited by resources. I have worked with Ann Edenfield Sweet their Founder and Executive Director for seven years and find her to be very professional, passionate and a great advocate for the families of prisoners. I highly recommend Wings Ministry.

Wings Ministry	115169		/users/profile/156884	lwyckoff	General Member of the Public	5	06/14/2012	I work for a public media station. Our mission is to spotlight issues that the community is grappling with. A subject that was coming up often was bullying.  Attending a community meeting on the subject, I met and spoke with several people about their personal experiences. The presenter that day was articulate and very informed about how to deal with the problem as a by stander and trusted adult. She was so effective that we brought her into our TV studio for a community discussion on bullying.  Wings Ministries helped us to focus our Public Square episode on the real experiences of young people and families and focus on solutions rather than problems. http://www.newmexicopbs.org/productions/publicsquare/bullying/   Wings Ministries is a valuable resource to the whole community.

Wings coordinates the entire event for several inmates and provides everything necessary to make the event one that absolutely changes lives, changes families, and blesses volunteers in God's plan for this ministry. I am one of those volunteers who has been blessed while watching incarcerated parents get to hug their kids, talk to them, just sit and look at them, play with them, and love them as only a parent deprived of daily contact with their children could. What a prlvledge, what a blessing, what hope for these children.

From the visits to the medical clinics in Kathmandu to the Chitwan and Pokhara adventures, the Mountain Fund was there to assure great lodging and true Nepali experiences.  In addition, the time we spent up in Manku village at the Farm was the highlight of the trip and we will be extending our time there next time we visit.  
The Global Mountain Fund Inc	321730		/users/profile/415238	Danielle108	Volunteer	5	01/21/2017	I went to Nepal with a group for a healthcare study abroad trip. Scott planned everything out for us. He met us at the airport and he and Sunita graciously accepted us into their home. Staying with them for a couple nights in Kathmandu was a great transition into the country. We became acclimated to the culture and got to meet Namuna. They took us up to Her Farm where we stayed another 2 nights. The sisters and children were all very excited to have us and made us feel right at home. Shanti took us on an early morning hike up the mountain to watch the sunrise. The sisters showed us how to make Mo-Mos and we had a dance party to celebrate the New Year (we were visiting over New Year). Since we were healthcare students, we were able to see villagers at the health clinic on the farm. It was very inspiring and uplifting to hear some of the sisters' stories. There is an overwhelming armosphere of acceptance and love at Her Farm. They were all complete strangers to me and my group but became more like family during our stay. Sunita is filled with more compassion and enthusiasm than anyone I've ever met. I could sit and listen to her talk for hours and never get tired of it. It's very evident that Scott and Sunita put their whole lives into the Mountain Fund and Her Farm. This is a wonderful organization that is making a positive difference in many lives. We loved Scott and Sunita so much that when we returned to Kathmandu after traveling to Chitwan and Pokhara, we had to meet up with them for pizza before heading back to the US.
The Global Mountain Fund Inc	319462		/users/profile/410936	Marjan d.	Volunteer	5	11/25/2016	Our stay at Her Farm in Nepal gave us the opportunity to taste what rural life in Nepal is! It is impressing to see the renewed confidence and strength the women living at Her Farm get. Everyone has the community feeling which gives them a safe environment to live. The way they take care of each other is amazing and everybody is equal. And with the additional school support and the little health care clinic, the positive influence is not only for the Her Farm people, but also for the surrounding villages. We only stayed two weeks at Her Farm, but is was an unforgettable experience. 
The Global Mountain Fund Inc	298854	1	/users/profile/389742	Meagan7	Volunteer	5	08/01/2016	One of the most rewarding experiences i have had!  To completely immerse myself in a community of people who love and share and give so others can enjoy a more rewarding life.. there is nothing else like it!I spent 5 weeks living at Her Farm, working along side the amazing women here.  I taught English in the school in the mornings and worked with the women during the day farming, preparing food and painting classrooms.  I learn't so much from this experience, as it gave me so much perspective on life and the things we take for granted.I hope to return one day, as this is an organisation led and run by amazing people, and it seems to be growing and expanding in order to help and reach more people.
The Global Mountain Fund Inc	298180	3	/users/profile/389024	MichaelaM	Volunteer	5	07/26/2016	Many thanks to Mountain Fund for proving me with such a great opportunity to shadow doctors in Kathmandu's local hospital during a two-week Pre-med program. Doctors are willing to share their experience and explain students medical background of cases of numerous patients. You are allowed to attend various wards in the hospital and ask doctors about their profession. A simple motto applies there: The more you ask and the greater interest you demonstrate, the more you can learn. It is a great way to become aware of a  health care system in a developing country and issues that Nepalese doctors face every day. Moreover,  you get a chance to meet new people - both Nepalese and volunteers from other countries, which will make your horizons broader as well. I can only recommend joining Mountain Fund as a volunteer - I believe you will not regret it. 
The Global Mountain Fund Inc	293169	1	/users/profile/383753	abbycarine	Volunteer	5	06/16/2016	It's been three weeks now since I left the Her Farm in Nepal and every day since I have thought about those people kindly and my experience there fondly. These are truly humans chasing the good in life and finding happiness in helping others. There was not one day I spent in my two weeks at the Her Farm where I 1) wanted to leave or 2) felt unloved by these once strangers. I came there to help where I could but it paled in comparison to what these wonderful people did everyday for me. What a great organization and a hard working non-profit that truly makes the most of everything they have and everythings they're given. 10/10 would recommend again.
The Global Mountain Fund Inc	292963	1	/users/profile/383518	acerecedes57	Volunteer	4	06/14/2016	From the moment I got off the plane, the Nepali people made me feel as comfortable as possible. The sisters are very hospitable and make sure you always have enough to eat. They always try to plan a tour around their wonderful city and make sure you leave satisfied. Overall, my experience to Kathmandu through the Mountain Fund could not have been anymore thrilling. 
The Global Mountain Fund Inc	292880	1	/users/profile/383450	kristinlipe	Volunteer	5	06/13/2016	It is because of the impeccable people working with The Global Mountain Fund that I had a remarkable experience in Nepal. Clearly an sane human being would be nervous packing their bag and heading halfway around the world to immerse themselves in an unknown culture, surrounding themselves with strangers, but once I got to nepal, these women made me feel like I had known them my whole lives. Each and every person at her farm and helping hands community hospital made me feel right at home, which made the experience that much more enjoyable. The program definitely returns as much as you give, meaning, the more you give, the more you get. It may not be returned in extravagant experiences, but you can learn more from these incredible women in one day than you can imagine. This experience has proven invaluable to me, not only for the impeccable medical experiences I gained, but for the memories I made with fabulous people from around the world and the knowledge I gained from the souls of truly wonderful people. Also exploring in Nepal wasn't half bad. Trekking was spectacular -- I went to EBC, but the annapurna circuit was wild apparently. Pokhara was beautiful and I did a 12 day meditation retreat that changed my life in more ways than I can explain. Her Farm and the women that run it, truly have taught me more than I could learn in any classroom. Not only about myself but about the ebb and flow of life, and for that I am eternally grateful. 
The Global Mountain Fund Inc	292414	2	/users/profile/382931	Haleigh F.	Volunteer	5	06/07/2016	I honestly can't say enough good things about my experience with Her Farm. Going halfway around the world to stay with people who were basically strangers was nerve-wracking to say the least, but from the second I stepped foot on the grounds I felt like I was at home. The staff here are truly TRULY amazing, hardworking, and selfless people doing absolutely fantastic work for their community. The children and adults who live here are incredibly kind and accepting, and even on the days where I worked the hardest at the Farm I was so elated to be there with such caring people who could make even the most mundane task fun. Being here was a truly eye-opening and wonderful experience.

The Global Mountain Fund Inc	291718	3	/users/profile/382166	Vava A.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/01/2016	I came to know Her Farm and The Mountain Fund during difficult times of restoring Nepal after the earthquake. Sunita and Scott were organizing an earthbag building workshop for volunteers willing to rebuild villages using natural earth-conscious and earthquake-resistant technologies. Workshop  that I participated in took place at their farm in Dhading, and I got to know these wonderful people at that time and kept in touch with them ever since. Sunita, who overcame her own humble conditions and became an advocate for women liberation, education and happiness in overly traditional, rigid areas of Nepal where tradition is still more important than human happiness, is helping poor women to become independent and raise their children in the environment of equal opportunities. Scott, who has been helping villagers and mountain communities for years, has been introducing advanced agricultural and building technologies into the underdeveloped and poor communities, as well as teaching local kids English, computer skills and cinematography.The farm is vibrant, functional,  self-sufficient, and full of joy and laughter. They are also doing a rare job of successful rehabilitation of mentally ill women who had no other place to go - a task that nobody else in Nepal is ready to undertake. As a project manager and a non-profit worker with experience in different non-profit fields, I know how difficult it is to have a successful project of this scale in a country like Nepal - to tell you the truth, it is close to impossible! That is why I salute my friends  and wish them all the best in all of their endeavors. They are doing something truly amazing.
The Global Mountain Fund Inc	291681	1	/users/profile/382125	Jessica279	Volunteer	5	06/01/2016	I had an amazing time with everyone at the farm. We came as a big group and they were more than ready to deal with us. They had the projects ready and participated alongside us during every endeavor. You wont find another real life experience like this. They fed us well, took care of our stomachs and made sure we were fully rested throughout our time there. Would definitely recommend going to the farm for anyone who wants to get a better insight on the world!
The Global Mountain Fund Inc	291514	3	/users/profile/381943	Writer	Volunteer	5	05/31/2016	     Working with the Mountain Fund was an unforgettable experience. The people alone made the trip worth the while. Being at the Kathmandu house and Her Farm, it is hard to see the people who work there as an organization because they come off far more strongly as a family.  Volunteering with them, I was able to become part of that family.  The sisters are some of the most genuinely thoughtful and caring people I have met and it was always a pleasure to be around them. They took great care of me and accommodated me in every way possible.       The organization sets itself apart in a few ways.  First, everyone who works there cares deeply for Nepal.  I witnessed the love and concern for the country from everyone I spoke to.  Second, the mission is gravely needed.  The issues Mountain Fund address are serious and I'm glad people are making efforts to fix them.  Admittedly, the organization is too small at the moment to attempt to change practices on a national level, but each person they help makes the effort worthwhile.       Being at Her Farm was a much needed change in perspective.  It's hard to fathom what people in other countries go through and live like without experiencing it firsthand.  The learning aspect alone made me appreciate my trip, but the opportunity to contribute to the cause as a volunteer made it all the better. I highly recommend the Mountain Fund and Her Farm in particular for anyone who wants to experience and/or help Nepal.  
The Global Mountain Fund Inc	290543	3	/users/profile/380898	shingjohnson	Volunteer	5	05/22/2016	I have had a wonderful time in mountain volunteers! I have a high degree of freedom to rotate in different departments in Helping Hand Community Hospital in Kathmandu during the Pre-MED program. The health care workers there are very willing to share their experience of work to me.Besides hospital attachment, I also joined a village visit for 2 days during which pediatricians carried out general body check for children. I have learned some clinical knowledge and made friends with local people as well as foreign volunteers from the US.The sisters in the house took care of almost everything and they are indeed very nice to the volunteers! Their arrangement on the living was great. I highly recommend Pre-MED program and Her Farm program to everyone! From these programs you can definitely help the underprivileged Nepalese, and make true friends with other volunteers and nice, local Nepalese. You won't regret to volunteer through mountain volunteers!
The Global Mountain Fund Inc	280412	3	/users/profile/370283	Writer	Volunteer	5	02/17/2016	My name is Mitch Metzger and I volunteered on HerFarm for a little over a month. Honestly there is no review, no amount of words I can write, to convey how much the farm means to me. I've done a lot of volunteer work around the world, and most of the time I leave disillusioned and angry, all they do is give volunteers the "feel goods" for their money without actually doing anything or even perpetuate the problems they want to solve. Not so with this project. It will actually change the way you see the world if you care enough to let it. The Mountain Volunteer is fundamentally different from anything I've experienced. They are a family, and for a brief time (too brief in most people;s experience) they wholeheartedly welcome you into that family. Scott and Sunita are incredible people and did more for me without a second thought than most people in my life ever have. The girls on the farm are the strongest, kindest, most beautiful people I've ever had the privilege of being around. They are smart and very welcoming, and will do all they can to make you feel at home.If you want a vacation, if you want the hotel experience while doing a little bit of volunteering then honestly this is not for you. But if you want to experience the real Nepal, one most tourists will never see, if you want to do meaningful work for extraordinary people in a setting that will blow your mind (sunrise over the Himalayas anyone?), and if you want to be a part of something bigger than yourself then this is exactly the place for you.Living at the farm was the happiest I've ever been and since the moment I returned to America I've been planning on how to get back. 
The Global Mountain Fund Inc	278985	1	/users/profile/369003	Writer	Volunteer	5	02/03/2016	I volunteered with the Mountain Fund in 2015. The experiece was great. They were a small enough organization that things were not completely planned out, but they actually had work that you could help with. The staff and Nepali ladies living there made you feel incredibly welcome and were very kind and fun to live with. I felt that I actually helped (which, on other volunteering experiences, I haven't always) and I felt that they wanted to learn from me and teach me. It was a very good experience. Not too templated or organized but well enough managed and run that it was a very good experience. Thank you!
The Global Mountain Fund Inc	253965	2	/users/profile/342262	Martha-Froy	Volunteer	5	08/25/2015	Volunteering with the Mountain Fund at Her Farm was a truly life changing event. The women are truly inspirational, and Sunita is one of the strongest, vivacious, innovative women I have ever met. She has inspired me to do so much, and her strength motivates me every day. She has the biggest heart, and more drive and resilience than any one I have ever met. Despite surviving the earthquake, and what felt like endless aftershocks in Nepal, I have never had a more amazing experience. Scott is fascinating to talk to, he has taught me so much about sustainable development, women's rights in third world countries, American Politics (I'm a Brit) and life in Nepal than I thought it possible. Three months at the Her Farm taught me more about humanity, and strength than anything else. The Mountain Fund is an example if an exemplary NGO, and despite volunteering with and meeting numerous NGO's in Sri Lanka and Cambodia, none of them have quite what Her Farm has.  I was terrified travelling to Nepal. I was 19 and it was my first trip alone, and my second time outside of Europe. Within about 30 seconds of meeting Shanti at the airport, I knew I had nothing to worry about. I loved teaching at the farm, there are children there with so much potential, who we have so much to learn from. Every day I miss Sagun (resident Her Farm genius child) and co. more and more. I cannot wait to go back. It's about more than just volunteering, it's about sharing our cultures, and becoming this strange, bizarre, but very functional family. Life there consists of teaching class to a group of around 25-30 village girls, some of whom, despite horrendous home lives, and unimaginable poverty, are so eager to learn, farming, and helping the sisters do whatever needs to be done. It is very much up to you to take the initiative and use whatever skills you have to in some way aid the development of the farm. I personally discovered that I love teaching.  The earthquake was a tragedy, but never have I met a more resourceful, courageous group than the Nepalese. I know it seems dangerous to go now, and as Scott liked to remind us "Geological time is now;" how right he was. Don't be put off by the earthquake and the aftermath, the shops are open, the buses are running, and there is plenty of food and water. I for one will be back as soon as the bank balance allows. Nepal needs help so badly and this is the best time to go. Even during the earthquake itself we were fantastically looked after, there was always food and water. Nepal is safe, and tourism and volunteering are the best ways to help.  Nepal is not an easy country, its poor in a way few countries are, it has issues so huge it's impossible to know where to start. Follow Stories of Nepal on Facebook for an insight into some of the problems Nepal faces, as well as the strength, resilience and beauty if its people. The Mountain Fund is a fantastic, life-changing, NGO committed to real, sustainable, rural, community development. Life is tough, but the Nepalese are strong.

Once you are part of it, you are part of the mountain fund  Family forever!I started working with the organisation 8 years ago, as a shy young woman, with little English and unaware of the rest of the world. And now I feel like I found a second home.Sunita is the matriarch of the Mountain Fund. Her strength, dedication and positive attitude are truly inspiring. She is the teacher, the mother, the mentor. She can be bossy at times but after all she has a good heart, always ready to forgive! Being part of this amazing team taught so many new things, such as farming, Computer skills, teaching, and of course, English.But most importantly I learned about life, the  responsibilities, the importance of family, happiness, kindness and the joy of  helping one another.   So thank you Mountain Fund! You'll be forever in my heart!  
The Global Mountain Fund Inc	253074	2	/users/profile/341224	rhernan1	Volunteer	5	08/16/2015	Dr. Rene' HernandezSaginaw Valley State University It is indeed my pleasure to write this review of The Mountain Fund and its founder, Scott MacLennan.  I was charged with planning a study abroad experience for a group of health professions students in 2014.  At that time, I contacted the Mountain Fund for assistance as I had found a small bit of information regarding the organization online.  To my pleasant surprise, I was assisted in every way imaginable from transportation to and from the airport to meaningful daily agendas for myself (and, eventually, students).  The lodging in Kathmandu and at Her Farm is comfortable and the staff is more than welcoming.  I have been involved with many educational and medical trips abroad, but have never had the support of such an organization.  It is true that an organization is only as good as its people.....and so, I would say hands-down, The Mountain Fund wins! I originally visited Nepal in December, 2014 with the sole purpose of arranging for a group of health care professional students to experience a study abroad trip (see above). The second time I visited, the university that I work for (Saginaw Valley State University) sent myself with a small group of health care providers to the region to join the humanitarian relief efforts following  the April, 2015 earthquake.  While the group I was with did not meet up with Scott and Sunita face-to-face due to the aftermath chaos, we stayed in Kathmandu at the Mountain Fund lodging and were delighted with our accommodations and the staff.  No one could predict how difficult it would be navigating the town and securing all of the daily living needs a group of Americans might need during their stay, but Shanti and Asta were consistently there to anticipate our every need.  We could not have asked for more.  In addition, because of the close contact that Scott has with the Nepali system, he was instrumental in securing health benefits to a young woman living in a tent in Bhaktapur even while he was working at Her Farm to make sure that the village and his family were taken care of.  Thank God for his ingenuity and technical expertise as I was able to reach him electronically for advise and reassurance.  I cannot imagine going to Nepal for any reason without securing the Mountain Fund and its staff (along with Scott and Sunita) as my in-country coordinators and family.  Thanks for all you do!

Working there has changed my way of doing things and helping people. I admire the work Scott and Sunita are doing there. All the sisters who work there are very cooperative and caring.  They not only gave me a way to improve myself, but also gave me chance to learn different perspective of life. Working as a volunteer at Her Farm, completely changed my outlook on life and what I wanted to do as a career. I realised that I wanted to do a job that helps people. I am now more responsible than before, I am more aware that we make a better life by what we give.

I came to know GMF via a relative who was very heavily involved - and her drive and passion for the work, the almost superhuman zeal to help others and bring forth the wellness and happiness in people via work reflects the core of what it does. GMF is run by some of the most caring and well meaning people that I know. It is hands down the best non profit currently operating in Nepal.
The Global Mountain Fund Inc	249326	2	/users/profile/337158	annieuphigh	Donor	5	07/22/2015	I had been following Her Farm with great interest for almost a year. When the April 25th quake ended my climbing expedition in the Khumbu area, I contacted Sunita and Scott to see if I could be of some help. What I experienced was nothing less than amazing!  The women who manage the farm, the volunteers, and all the children are remarkable. Beyond this, I saw firsthand how they added a community outreach endeavor, providing earthquake relief to the 85% destroyed village.  Although I returned home after two weeks, a part of my heart will always be in Mankhu and I will continue to support and promote Her Farm and Mountain Fund Volunteers. I highly recommend anyone of any age to support Sunita and Scott in the development of Her Farm, whether as a volunteer, a donor, or simply a few words of praise and thanks for their heart-warming compassion.
The Global Mountain Fund Inc	237833	4	/users/profile/322752	JonathanL.Ehrlich	Volunteer	2	02/10/2015	I posted this same review on another site.  I rate the experience hear as below expectations not because the experience was bad, but because the expectations for the programs gained from the descriptions on the Mountain Volunteer website set the bar far above what the administration, staff, and program seemed capable of actually providing.  For instance, (1) despite what the staff tells you, the Kathmandu house is not in a nice part of town, it is in a safe but loud part of town.  The ring road is nearby and the supermarket is just beyond the back fence.  The house across the street has a dog that barks the whole day long.  Needless to say, the time spent at the house is mostly without peace.  What appeared to me and my fellow travelers to be the nice parts of town were seen from the cab when going near the zoo, and from the airplane window on departure over the southwest part of the city.  (2) The Mountain Volunteer website description for the premed program at Helping Hands Hospital did not accurately portray my experience or observations.  Doctors there work mostly from their OPD offices, and only one I shadowed did rounds on wards.  A lot of a premed student's time is spent finding what doctors are in that day, and then hoping that the doctor will let him or her sit in, then hoping that the doctor will take the time to explain what is going on, and then deciding what to do when the doctor gets up and leaves unannounced and without instruction.  It is a lesson unto itself, and I enjoyed it.  However, it is not the delight that is described in the website description, and a timid or unexperienced student would not enjoy it much at all I suspect. About my time and mission in Nepal: I was an undergraduate who went to Nepal to complete a global health ethics directed study. I signed up through Mountain Volunteer for two weeks of the Premed Experience, and an undetermined amount of time of the Global Health Internship. My total time in Nepal was 43 days; December 13, 2014 - January 25, 2015. I spent 10 days going to Helping Hands Hospital, and just 2 days at Her Farm. The rest of my time was spent either in Kathmandu at the house or around the city, in Chitwan, or in Pokhara. The reason for the short stay at Her Farm is that I went the day before Christmas. The Global Health Internship "rural clinic" nearby was closed on the holiday, and closed the day after. Even had it been open, it was reported by other "volunteers" to be staffed only by CNA level workers, and saw just 4 patients/day. Instead of waiting for the clinic to open to see 4 patients/day with a CNA, or tolerating other "volunteers" and Her Farm staff staying up late drinking and having a dance party, the dogs barking all night, and a group of "volunteers" smoking marijuana many times per day, I returned to Kathmandu. I put "volunteer" in parenthesis because I did not witness any "volunteering" in my six weeks. Mountain Volunteer "volunteers" ought to have been called donating be-ers. The Mountain Volunteer administrator talks about "being" in Nepal, and I agree that "being" is important. However, I can "be" in Nepal without Mountain Volunteer in the middle.  In fact, the best and most memorable activities of my six weeks in Nepal were all arranged without help from the Mountain Volunteer staff.  The memorable activities were: USAID briefing at the US Embassy arranged by me; visit to the Nepal Leprosy Mission arranged by other students through Helping Hands Hospital administrator; visit to a government primary health clinic in Kathmandu arranged by other students through Helping Hands Hospital administrator; hiking in Shivapuri National Park; and many wonderful meals in Thamel despite the awful portrayal of Thamel given to me by the Mountain Volunteer administrator, and to other "volunteers" in the first-day orientation briefing (you will see what I mean if buy a Mountain Volunteer program and the orientation stays the same).    The Kathmandu house staff is fun, and friendly. I miss them, and if you go and spend much time around them with a respect for them as your equal, you will likely miss them when you leave too.  My recommendation: if you go to Nepal, "be" there, and stay with Mountain Volunteer for one or two weeks to get settled, and to know your way around. Then get a 1000NPR (10USD)/night hotel that offers a hot shower and travel services (many do). Arrange memorable activities yourself, or through your hotel. Remain flexible, and DO NOT think that things will go according to planned, or according to a schedule, or according to what you think SHOULD to be the case.
The Global Mountain Fund Inc	237773	2	/users/profile/322638	Yojana	Volunteer	5	02/08/2015	First and foremost, I would like to thank Sunita didi and Scott for giving me an opportunity to explore her beautiful village and making me realize what I can really do for my country. Being a Chiropractic student in US, I always wanted to help  Nepalese  in need but I didn't know how to start. After talking to Sunita didi, I felt like "YES!!! this is what I wanted to do." I must say Sunita didi is great. I was amazed with all the wonderful  work she's done for the village. Sunita didi and Scott  are sincerely  devoted to their work. The staff members are awesome, they are very friendly and helpful. I can't wait for a Summer break. I am definitely going back to the Global Mountain Fund and start  public awareness campaigns for Nutrition, ways of preventing  Back Pain and Ergonomics. If anyone's interested to help  us, please email Scott. If you have a sense of adventure, a passion for working with Nepalese, and the desire to have a real impact on their lives, then volunteering in the Global Mountain Fund might be  ideal for you.Yojana ShahiChiropractic Intern at the University of Bridgeport College of Chiropractic, CT, USA
The Global Mountain Fund Inc	237483	3	/users/profile/322135	Becca B.	Volunteer	5	01/30/2015	I took a semester off before starting college. I have a deep passion for South Asia, and had spent a bit of time in India but had never been to Nepal before. I heard about The Mountain Fund from a friend who spent part of his gap year at Her Farm, and gave it glowing reviews. I decided that it sounded like a very solid organization, and Nepal sounded cool, so I went ahead and signed up for two months.  I had no idea what an incredible experience I was in for! I was so impressed by the staff (or, as they prefer to be called, "the sisters,") at Her Farm. They are all absolutely wonderful, and really go above and beyond to meet the needs of both volunteers and members of the local community. They were all exceedingly lovely, warm and welcoming right from the start.  I stayed at the Mountain Fund guesthouse in Kathmandu for my first couple of nights. Having a "home base" in the city was very convenient. It's like a little oasis in the midst of the chaos, and it's very easy to hop into a taxi or bus and go anywhere you want. Volunteers are free to come and go as they please, and the sisters provide a delicious breakfast and dinner each day. On my third day in Nepal I left for the farm. As anyone who has been lucky enough to spend time there will tell you, the farm is an amazing place. It's only about an hour from Kathmandu, but it feels like a different world. The village is definitely an authentic representation of what most of rural Nepal is like, although the farm itself is equipped to support volunteers (there is wifi most of the time, and a couple of western toilets). Volunteers typically share simple but very clean and comfortable rooms. The sisters cook every meal, and the food is absolutely delicious. Most of it is locally produced and organic, and a lot of it comes from our own farm! They take extra care to wash and cook things properly, and I never had any stomach problems in the entire two months that I was in Nepal. Basically, while the farm is definitely not a fancy place, you well be exceptionally well taken care of.  The farm actually serves a number of functions. It is an organic farm, a women's shelter (only two women are using it as a shelter at the moment, but I believe that they are looking to expand their outreach), a school, an area for villagers to just come hang out, and (most recently) a clinic, with an emphasis on women's health. I worked as a teacher at the school on the farm, which is really more like a tutoring center. Most of the students do attend the local village school to fulfill their official education requirements, but they come to the farm for a few hours each day. I feel that the farm definitely plays a crucial role in their education, however, as it is their only chance to learn English and critical thinking skills, amongst other things.  Its also a great opportunity for them to have access to computers. During my time there, we had about 40-45 students showing up each day, ranging in age from two to thirteen or so. It was definitely overwhelming at first, but there are lots of resources in the classroom for both students and teachers. Previous teachers (myself included) have left behind some notes to help future teachers. I'm also more than willing to answer questions and give advice to anyone who is considering teaching at Her Farm. Just ask Mountain Fund to put you in touch with me. I didn't really have much teaching experience before I got there, and it was certainly a challenge at times, but it ended up being immensely fun and rewarding! The students are adorable. They are so earnest and eager to learn, and they pick things up quickly.  Nepal itself is an incredible country. One of the things I love about The Mountain Fund is how flexible they are in allowing volunteers to take time off to explore. They are very helpful if you should decide to take a few days off. They will even set up hotels, tours, or treks for you if you want! I highly recommend taking advantage of this opportunity to explore a fascinating part of the world. There are definitely certain areas that are pretty full of tourists (the trekking industry and tourism in general has taken its toll on parts of Nepal, ever since it opened its borders in 1951). However, its not hard to get off the beaten path if you want to, and the sisters can definitely help you do that. Im eighteen years old and this was my first time traveling on my own, so I was a little bit nervous at first, but I found that its very easy to get around in Nepal with minimal hassle. Although I obviously had to use common sense when travelling on my own, I never felt unsafe. I also got to travel with other volunteers on a couple of occasions, which was very fun! The Mountain Fund tends to attract really interesting, kind, and adventurous individuals. I met some wonderful people.  In short, Her Farm is an incredible project, in a wonderful and very close-knit community. The Her Farm family could not be more welcoming. Mountain Fund is a great organization overall, especially if youre young and travelling by yourself. They are very flexible, and give volunteers as much or as little independence as you want/need.  So go spend some time at Her Farm. It will change your life! 
The Global Mountain Fund Inc	236474	3	/users/profile/320390	Simone F.	Volunteer	5	01/07/2015	Arriving in Nepal from New Zealand at the end of November 2014 for 6 weeks I didn't really know what was in store. Having read reviews on Mountain Fund, and emailing Scott a fair bit I came up with a rough trip outline and set off. Now nearing the end of my trip I can honestly say my experience with Mountain Fund and Nepal has exceeded my expectations. I was met at the airport by the lovely Sante, arriving at the Kathmandu house where I meet Scott and Sunita along with a few of the Nepali sisters at Mountain Fund. From the first introductions the passion of everyone involved with the organisation was evident, expressing their passion and commitment to the visions of the fund in their own way.  Some like Sunita gets stuck into daily happenings with energy and charisma, while others go quietly about their day engaging volunteers in running the farm, teaching at the school or showing volunteers the ins and outs of the local health clinic. I liked the variety of approaches and personalities amongst those running the fund as I meant the volunteers who stay at both the HerFarm and Kathmandu house also have a variety of personalities and experiences so there is something for everyone. The day to day experiences of Nepali life which the fund offers are varied from communicating with Nepali sisters learning about the culture along with the challenges women and children face, helping at the health clinic or getting stuck in to farm life carrying rice, gardening and cooking. What I also loved about the farm was the love and kindness which extends from the Nepali sisters to the volunteers. Not once did I feel alone or uncared for in a country so different from my own, with a common theme emerging from the farm of connectedness with one another which has made for an incredible experience. A wee bit of advice to future volunteers going to the HerFarm is take a pair of flip flops these come in handy, old clothes to work in for farm or maintanence work (painting, building ect) and a head torch for when the power goes out which it does often with the government load shedding. Also be prepared for a bit of culture shock, things at first can be overwhelming but everyone makes you feel as welcome as possible. Don't be shy to communicate with Scott, Sunita or the Nepali sisters at the Kathmandu house or HerFarm they incredibly hospitable and want you to enjoy Nepal as much as possible so ask questions, and get involved. It's totally worth it. 
The Global Mountain Fund Inc	236468	2	/users/profile/320382	lmarti16	Volunteer	5	01/07/2015	This is a wonderful group of people who are truly passionate about the work they do. In the summer of 2011 I volunteered in Nepal with The Mountain Fund at a school for street and slum kids. It was an eye-opening experience because The Mountain Fund family shared the truths about Nepal that most tourists fail to see. And tried explain us, the volunteers, what the real problems familys there face everyday and how The Mountain Fund is trying to conquer those battles. They are the strength for those family's that are too afraid to fight. They give a voice to the children that can't speak out.The Mountain Fund family welcomed me and many volunteers into their home and showed us Nepalise culture and shared with us their values of love and family. They're beautiful people with a fantastic message and I and so greatful to have met them.

By the end it felt as if we had gained a second family. I will not soon forget the great friends i made as we spent time on the farm building a cow shed, harvesting rice etc. An amazing experience that has changed my life, ideas and outlook for the furture.
The Global Mountain Fund Inc	236141	2	/users/profile/319949	Shari12	Donor	5	01/01/2015	My oldest son went to Nepal with the Mountain Fund in 2011 to serve as a medical trekker and to help with Her Farm. I can not say enough great things about this organization! - From the incredible, legitimate work they do to the way my son was well taken care of. At first I was worried, as all mothers would be, for one of their children to take such a far journey away from home. I soon realized that he was in safe hands. The experiences had and the memories he made during his 5 month stay has changed him for the better in unimaginable ways. My son left a boy, but came home a respectable and appreciative man. Thank you, Scott MacLennan!
The Global Mountain Fund Inc	321737	3	/users/profile/415249	Rene15,	Client Served	5	01/21/2017	The Global Mountain Fund is one of the best non-profits I have worked with to set up a faculty-led study abroad experience for a university group.  13 of us traveled to Nepal for 2 weeks recently with Scott and Sunita as our hosts and we could not have been better taken care of.  From the visits to the medical clinics in Kathmandu to the Chitwan and Pokhara adventures, the Mountain Fund was there to assure great lodging and true Nepali experiences.  In addition, the time we spent up in Manku village at the Farm was the highlight of the trip and we will be extending our time there next time we visit.  
The Global Mountain Fund Inc	235915	2	/users/profile/319628	ccalvin	Volunteer	4	12/25/2014	I volunteered with the Mountain Fund as a premedical volunteer for about 2 months. It was a great time, I learned lots about medicine, and I was quite satisfied with my experience. Working in the hospital as a premed, you probably won't get much practical experience (besides occasionally taking someone's blood pressure), but you can learn a lot from the doctors there if you're enthusiastic and ask questions. Being able to scrub in for surgeries was a huge bonus. As far as actually doing things that are helpful for the community, going up to the farm and teaching local kids english and working on projects up there was really satisfying and a great option to enjoy an authentic, beautiful rural Nepal setting. The Mountain Fund staff (the sisters) were really friendly, the food was delicious, and the accommodations were clean. If you're alright with the occasional cold shower and you're looking for a volunteer program abroad I definitely recommend this one!

It was one of the most amazing experiences I can ever encounter. Words and pictures cannot describe how amazing it was. The family and mountain fund are extremely helpful and very caring. You become part of the family and felt safe and happy throughout my time there. Personally, my favourite experience was 'Her Farm'. It was such so inspiring to work with the sisters there, preparing meals, farming and teaching. The children are brilliant. They are so willing to work and learn. The language barrier is hard but patience and persistence from both you and the children thrive with success. Going there was very scary. I was very cautious and nervous as well as excited, but you get lots of reassurance and guidance. I would highly recommend using the Mountain Fund, it's an experience I will always cherish. When people ask me how it was the only words I use is amazing. I miss the people I have met and the places I have visited. I will be returning to them in future years because a part of my heart now belongs there :) a must do experience! 
The Global Mountain Fund Inc	212348	2	/users/profile/275345	DeniseMcCarney	Volunteer	5	08/26/2014	I have just returned from the experience of my life. I haven't travelled a lot and as a 52 yr old (just single) woman thought it was all too late - but 'Mountain Fund' proved me very wrong indeed. I thought they'd laugh at me but I was welcomed and befriended like any other. I feel privileged and honoured to have been a part of the Farm family for two weeks. I cut and carried grass; I ploughed and prepared fields;  I planted rice;  I helped to graze the oxen; I sang Nepali songs and danced; I picked corn; I ate jack fruit, pears and mangoes straight from the trees; I ate freshly harvested and cooked food (of which the rice pudding deserves special mention) but most of all I met fantastic people up on the farm. I was truly inspired and motivated by all of you and your happy; hard working; never complaining; attitude to life. I will never forget you and will always have very special memories of my time on your farm. Thank you for making it special for me. 
The Global Mountain Fund Inc	210674	2	/users/profile/273459	MarshallK	Volunteer	5	08/14/2014	An amazing month thanks to all the Mountain Fund staff.

Volunteer	5	08/10/2014	Along with 30 other people, students and teachers, I volunteered and traveled in Nepal with The Mountain Fund at Her Farm. Knowing just how important education and care is for single, widowed, or divorced women and their children, this project, and all the people involved, quickly wormed its way into my heart. The hard work I did everyday, though just for a short time, always contained an element of fun, as the women and children of Her Farm possessed unalterable high spirits. Though I'm back in Canada now, I'm always dreaming of Nepal and my family there, and I'm counting down the days until I go back. 
The Global Mountain Fund Inc	209890	2	/users/profile/272633	HaleyWestra	Volunteer	5	08/10/2014	I am a recent graduate of Stelly's Secondary School and a recent traveler to Nepal where a group of over 30 students, including myself, helped build a community centre at Her Farm through the Mountain Fund.  Living in Nepal was one of the most life-changing experiences I've had and I would give anything to go back to see the beautiful children and the intricate culture.  The Mountain Fund provided us with excellent care and truly gave us the opportunity to see Nepal from some amazing perspectives.  As well as introducing us to the farm where our service and work was much needed and appreciated, we were introduced to the community where ceremonies and celebrations took place.  I instantly fell in love with all the children and every day they are on my mind and in my heart.  They are so very precious.  Today I am still in contact with the wonderful people who run The Mountain Fund and I am blessed to call them my new family.  There is a certain warmth and dedication about this organization that captivated me.  I only hope that more people like me will one day discover all that Nepal has to offer through The Mountain Fund.

Volunteer	5	08/10/2014	A group of eager secondary students and I came to Nepal in March of 2014 to continue a project at The Mountain Fund that my school, Stelly's Secondary started several years back to aid in the construction of a women's shelter.  The people at the Mountain fund were amazing!  They brought in over 30 outsiders and made us feel like members of a tight knit community.  They made us feel like family.  We had such a blast working with the volunteers from this amazing organization.  They personally checked in on us often to see how we were doing, and the never once made us feel like a burden.  I would certainly suggest the Moutain Fund to anyone looking to do volunteering work in Nepal, and I would most certainly go back to Nepal just to see those humble, incredible people again.

The Global Mountain Fund Inc	209856	2	/users/profile/272602	cdichang	Volunteer	5	08/10/2014	I'm a second year medical student who just returned back from Nepal for their Global Health program. I spent a month in this wonderful place during the Summer and would do so again in a heartbeat. Mountain Fund helped me organize a trekking trip up to the Gosaikunda lakes and it all worked out. They were able to arrange all the buses and places to stay with no problem.  I trekked for a week and then spent 3 weeks volunteering at the Rural hospital where I had the opportunity of observing Nepalese health care and the medical issues they face - many of which are very uncommon nowadays in the United States. The staff and the physician present were fantastic - they allowed me to be more hands on in addition to the shadowing. The hospital consists of a small ER, an OPD clinic, an X-ray machine, lab room, and a pharmacy - they are fully equipped. I saw things such as typhoid fever, gastroenteritis, gastritis, tumors, COPD, road accidents, and plenty head traumas. Although it was slow at times, it was still an enjoyable experience to see how things are run in this country and the many challenges they face. I did have some issues at the place I stayed at during my time volunteering in the Rural hospital. I happened to be the first person who arrived to this house and who would volunteer at this hospital. The electricity in the bedroom did not work well and there would be no water in the mornings, or no water in the 3rd floor where I was staying at. I attribute this problem more to the owner of the house who wouldn't follow through, rather than Mountain Fund itself but I would have appreciated if this was addressed before I arrived. However, the staff from Mountain Fund worked daily to make things better and eventually fixed the problem by buying a huge tank of water. I appreciated that they would always be there and call to make sure that everything was alright. I believe this shouldn't be an issue anymore for any other volunteer since everything was working fine after that week.  Mountain Fund is a very flexible organization. Pretty much anything you want to experience they can help you arrange it. They let me spend couple days in the Helping Hands clinic to observe some surgeries - this is usually their pre-med program. I happened to see a hysterectomy and a skin graft on a patient who was recovering from Necrotizing fasciitis. They also helped me arrange a trip to Pokhara and that was a fantastic experience - highly recommend it.  I loved volunteering with Mountain Fund. Although I tend to be hesitant about doing things at the last minute and I'm a bit uncomfortable with not being able to plan ahead, I realized that this was something that happens to be common in developing countries. However, Mountain Fund was always flexible and never lost sight of what I wanted to do or where I wanted to go. They always kept in contact with me wherever I was and I felt very safe as a solo female traveler. I think what makes Mountain Fund so unique is the people - the sisters who are your guides, help you settle in the house you're staying at, and cook some amazing food, are some of the most fantastic and bright young women you will ever meet. Scott MacLennan and Sunita Subedi were also amazing people to meet - I highly recommend you to chat with them if you happen to get a chance, they know so much about Nepal, the people, the culture, the politics, and also give great life advice. This is a wonderful organization that helps empower women and is giving a great contribution to the country. It gives a great opportunity for outsiders to learn and live the real Nepali life. I look forward to going back someday! 
The Global Mountain Fund Inc	208991	2	/users/profile/271751	wrobar	Volunteer	5	08/06/2014	I am a med student who visited Nepal for a month between my first and second years.  We wanted to do some trekking, get out and see the world and hopeful learn a little while helping a few people.  Our experience with Mountain Fund was excellent.  The trekking that they helped set up for us worked out so much better than we had hoped.  Excellent guides and the weather did help by being better than expected.  after the rain delays for our flight to the start were dealt with no extra hassle.  The medical volunteering was more shadowing, but did provide an excellent glimpse of Nepalese health care at all levels.  Often the doctors would let you get more involved but as we were a group of 4 that was a harder to manage. Volunteering at/visiting Her Farm was another of the highlights of the trip for me.  The women and the other workers there were so much fun and welcoming and they work very hard to make sure that you have everything you need, while taking care of the farm and the herd of small children that come to learn english every day.  As others have said you need to be flexible, Nepal(and most third world countries) run on their own schedule and as such can't be planned to the minute.  But amazingly things just always seem to work out.  Scott and Sunita are great at getting things done there and are amazing interesting people as well.  Their plans for the future mean that their facilities will just keep getting better.   I enjoyed every day of my time there and meeting all the warm welcoming Nepalese people.

The other 2 weeks I spent on the Everest base camp trail, which Scott had organized completely for us and it ran without a flaw!The two weeks with Mountain Fund was incredible. I am a Medical Student in the US and was able to visit three different health care settings in Nepal while I was there. We saw surgeries in the helping hands hospital in Kathmandu, then were able to see rural care in a small hospital outside of Kathmandu and also a governmental health post in the mountains. Other time we spent helping out at a farm and enjoying the company of the Nepali people. I have never met such loving and caring people!!The best part of this volunteer organization is how flexible they are and truly help you see as much as Nepal as possible!
The Global Mountain Fund Inc	198811	1	/users/profile/259603	parkertwebb	Volunteer	5	04/24/2014	I have worked for the Mountain Fund for 4 and a half months. I was in Nepal, located on a farm in the Dhading district, close to Kathmandu. I have had no bad experiences. Everyone who is located at the farm and in Kathmandu are helpful and friendly. I went to Nepal for 8 months, part of that time climbing, part of it volunteering with the Mountain Fund, and the volunteering has been, and will remain, the most memorable part of my time in Nepal. While teaching English at the farm, I truly felt I was making a difference to the community seeing improvements in the children's English skills. Not once have I felt lonely, scared, or in any way more of a burden than a help. You will always eat good food with the Mountain Fund, which has lead to me gaining a few pounds. If you have any problems, the girls will help fix those problems by any means they can. The Mountain Fund truly has been very influential to my life and has changed my life. 
The Global Mountain Fund Inc	198138	1	/users/profile/258829	MasonHarrelson	Volunteer	5	04/17/2014	I volunteered  at the Her Farm as an addition to a climbing trip that brought me to Nepal. The time  I spent at the farm was the most enriching experience of a 8 month stint of travel in Asia. What made my time there so special was the enormous sense of community that radiated out from the farmhouse on the hill. I reccomend spending at least a few weeks and really embracing the subtle difference between the western world and the farm-life of Mankhu. Enjoy!
The Global Mountain Fund Inc	187334	3	/users/profile/244329	Jane McGarvey MD	Volunteer	5	11/01/2013	I just got back from almost 3 weeks in Nepal, part of which I spent with Mountain Fund volunteering my medical expertise.  I am an ER doctor and, thanks to the organizers of Mountain Fund, I was able to bring basic medical care to 2 villages outside Kathmandu where there are no healthcare providers.  First, Mountain Fund facilitated my meeting with a local doctor at a hospital in Kathmandu so that I could learn about the disease processes that are most commonly found in that region and determine what medications would be most useful to bring with me into the villages.  I was given a tour of the small city hospital and it was interesting for me to watch the local doctor at work.  In the villages, I was challenged by the lack of laboratory and radiology and I really got to use my clinical skills.  My translator was a young Nepali woman currently in nursing school and it was fun to teach her a few clinical pearls while she taught me a wealth of cultural information about the patients.  My greatest impact was probably just treating the majority of patients for worms; however, there were two children under 5 who likely had pneumonia and I was able to give them the antibiotics they needed.  The experience I had in the villages was humbling and rewarding and gave me a renewed energy and love for my profession!  I am thankful to Scott and Sunita, the organizers of Mountain Fund, for providing me with that opportunity and taking care of all of the logistics.  They also took me out to the village of Mankhu to see Her Farm, a self-sustainable and safe place where women can live and work and have their children cared for and schooled.  Eventually, there will also be a health clinic (run by the above-mentioned nursing student once she completes her degree!).  I cannot say enough about the wonders of Her Farm!  I spent 3 days there and wished it could've been more.  Besides the obvious value of this project (i.e., allowing women in a country with limited women's rights to regain their dignity and independence and remain with their children) there is the gorgeous scenery, the fresh air, the stars like I have never seen, the just-picked guavas, the animals, the children, and the camaraderie of the volunteers and Mountain Fund staff.  It was a mini-vacation all in itself.  Had I not asked Scott to organize a trek for me and my niece (which he did, taking care of all the details before we left the US and accompanying us to the trekking company in Thamel to confirm arrangements), I would have stayed at Her Farm longer and helped out with the farm work and/or building projects (like my niece did after our trek).  All in all, I have only glowing things to say about Mountain Fund, Scott, Sunita and all the young women in their support staff.  I was made to feel welcome immediately and in a very short time felt almost like part of their family.  The food that was prepared was delicious (especially the Nepalese dishes!) and the room/facilites were always clean.  I am excited to follow this organization to see their progress and what new projects they come up with next.   Some day I hope to return to Nepal and volunteer my time at Her Farm's health clinic!
The Global Mountain Fund Inc	171582		/users/profile/227189	tpaltiel	Volunteer	5	09/24/2013	The Mountain Fund made my trip to Nepal absolutely unforgettable. The whole trip was wonderfully planned. Thanks to the Mountain Fund we got to experience everything from Kathmandu life, to camping in the mountain sides, to living in a little mountain village and the touristy Chitwan national park. The volunteer project was extremely successful and it is all thanks to the lovely people behind The Mountain Fund.
The Global Mountain Fund Inc	169991	1	/users/profile/225276	DGosney	Volunteer	5	09/16/2013	I volunteered with The Mountain Fund from Jan. 2012 - Jun. 2012 mostly in Helping Hands Community Hospital and several remote villages in the surrounding countryside. It is an amazing charity doing real, lasting good for the Nepali people. Scott and his wife Sunita devote immense time to researching and determining the validity of the groups that The Mountain Fund is involved with so that volunteers can be confident they are actively participating in worthwhile causes. And because they offer so many avenues through which someone may work, a person would be hard-pressed to stay with Scott and not feel like they've accomplished something. As an example, I would balance my extra time either assisting a nearby school (Orchid Garden), helping beginning construction of their abused women's coop farm/housing project (Her Farm), running small clinics throughout the country, or just traveling and exploring. The experience I gained while working with Scott was invaluable and I would thoroughly recommend The Mountain Fund to anyone who wants to do real charity work in an area that desperately needs it.  That being said, I have two warnings for new volunteers in Nepal: - First, be prepared to live in a third world country while you're there. Nepal, although safe, is limited in it's modern conveniences. Pack appropriately and research the area, climate, etc.  - Second and most importantly, do not come here expecting to be spoon fed opportunities. Although Scott and Sunita work very, VERY hard to meet everyone's expectations during their stay there, ultimately what you get out of the program comes down to you. Be proactive, jump at opportunities when they arise, and I guarantee you'll get more from The Mountain Fund than you can imagine.

They really made us feel at home and gave us the opportunity to volunteer on a life changing project and explore the beautiful country of Nepal.
The Global Mountain Fund Inc	169749	1	/users/profile/224976	Elenajson	Volunteer	5	09/14/2013	This organization devotes so much time and energy into making things better for those who could use a hand. I felt very safe with them, and when you spend enough time with these wonderful people they become your second family. The Global Mountain Fund concentrates their efforts on issues that aren't well known for those of us who live a good distance from any 3rd world country.  I volunteered with the mountain fund with a school group in March 2012 and it was by far the best experience I've ever had. Scott and Sunita are truly inspirational people who not only made the work we did more fun but also comfortable. Nepal was completely awe-inspiring and to be able to interact with the families we were affecting was something I'll never forget. 
The Global Mountain Fund Inc	321737	3	/users/profile/415249	Rene15,	Client Served	5	01/21/2017	The Global Mountain Fund is one of the best non-profits I have worked with to set up a faculty-led study abroad experience for a university group.  13 of us traveled to Nepal for 2 weeks recently with Scott and Sunita as our hosts and we could not have been better taken care of.  From the visits to the medical clinics in Kathmandu to the Chitwan and Pokhara adventures, the Mountain Fund was there to assure great lodging and true Nepali experiences.  In addition, the time we spent up in Manku village at the Farm was the highlight of the trip and we will be extending our time there next time we visit.  
The Global Mountain Fund Inc	169730	1	/users/profile/224951	heatheriteachlearnlive	Volunteer	5	09/14/2013	It is now only two weeks before I fly to Nepal and join the Mountain Fund team at Her Farm.  I would just like to say a big thank you to Scott for matching me up with this project, fully answering all my questions so promptly and sending out tips and ideas before we start.  As well as the great admin and support, Scott has arranged for contact with the other two volunteers who will be there at the same time, so I am really looking forward to finally meeting with them and bringing our little part of this big Mountain Fund to life.  Great work being done by the team and proud to be able to say I'm a Mountain Volunteer.   
The Global Mountain Fund Inc	169693	1	/users/profile/224909	lauralee	Volunteer	5	09/14/2013	I was a medical volunteer with the Mountain Fund back in 2006 (was it that long ago?) on one of the earliest versions of what have become amazingly organized and effective 'moving medical camps'.  The experience did change my life-the cliche is appropriate here, the story long and as beautiful as the Nepali people we met.  I have watched Scott and his team work to develop an organization that is in tune with the culture, true to the ultimate goals of self sufficiency and empowerment and pretty much absent ego (not easy to achieve as a "well- to -do" western charity in asia).  I returned for another trek/medical mission in 2010 with a friend who also had an amazing experience-a chance to fulfill a lifelong dream of doing medical volunteer work as well as see the majestic Himalaya. ( A win-win win for him as he also returned with photos that took multiple awards in professional shows).  I continue to keep in touch with the staff at the KTM office on my frequent returns to Nepal. So that was my personal experience-as a 50 something woman I always felt safe and free to experience what I had come to do.  I strongly encourage anyone who wants to see Nepal for real, to see what your heart looks like (for real), to check out the volunteer opportunities with the Mountain Fund.   Scott, Sunita and the organization they work so hard to support are what non profits should be.
The Global Mountain Fund Inc	169498	1	/users/profile/224612	hsharples	Volunteer	5	09/13/2013	I went to Nepal to work with the Mountain Fund with a class of about 30 students, and the experience was far beyond what I expected. Scott and Sunita are kind, genuine people, and did a great job in informing us as to exactly what kind of impact we were making with our work in the community. By staying in the village we were able to interact with the women and kids who were going to be living in the structure we were building, making our efforts feel personal and rewarding.  The whole setup was extremely well organized, from the worksite to mealtimes, and this made it easy to feel comfortable in the routine and much less homesick for western amenities. The village was very welcoming to our presence, and the kids were absolutely adorable to play with! Everything about the experience was fun, challenging and moving. 
The Global Mountain Fund Inc	169485	1	/users/profile/224573	annakrat	Volunteer	5	09/12/2013	I became involved with The Mountain Fund through my high school in a class called Global Perspectives, in March of 2013. Our trip was so enjoyable and that was largely due to all the work Scott, Sunita and the rest of the Mountain Fund contributed! Our travels throughout the country went smoothly and I actually felt that the work I did made an impact. Not only did we build a shelter for families, but we also met the families that were going to be living there, which was quite amazing. 
The Global Mountain Fund Inc	169468	1	/users/profile/224556	ekonantz	Volunteer	5	09/12/2013	In 2011, I travelled to Nepal to work in an orphanage.  I taught English and other subjects in English to these children of all ages.  We were given weekends to travel around Nepal and evenings to explore the city.  This was always a safe environment where I felt secure.  The Mountain Fund is truly sensational.  
The Global Mountain Fund Inc	169466	1	/users/profile/224554	jnite06	Volunteer	5	09/12/2013	 Came to Nepal with a school group, Scott and Sunita welcomed us with open arms. All the staff and guides were extremely fun and nice. We all had a great time helping construct a shelter for women of domestic abuse in the mountain village of Mankhu. They also offered wonderful visits to many sightseeing locations with local guides. (Made communicating very easy). Everyone spoke very good English and we had absolutely no problems. You can tell Scott and Sunita are dedicated to helping people and it's close to their hearts. Definitely  would go through the mountain fund again!

The Global Mountain Fund Inc	169434		/users/profile/224515	Sarahk1	Volunteer	1	09/12/2013	Wasn't too happy with the mountain fund experience. Hospital placement isn't even a placement it's just a building in which they set you free and no doctors want to talk to you so it's pretty unfulfilling. Very disorganised. Honestly, there weren't doctors who wanted to help you understand what they were doing. And it wasn't just me... There were probably 10, maybe 15, other medical volunteers there while I was and all of them felt pretty jipped. There's no consistency between what they advertise and what the experience is actually like. Luckily Nepal is a really exciting place and lots to do!
The Global Mountain Fund Inc	169397		/users/profile/224476	Kelli V.	Volunteer	5	09/12/2013	I volunteered for mountain fund last October and was so impressed with the whole organization.   They immediately make you feel like family and their compassion and caring for the plight of the Nepali women and children is moving.  Scott has made it his mission to prove the conditions for women and children and his deeds back up his words.  He has been a positive impact on the lives on countless number of women and children.  I would volunteer again for the organization.  They have integrity and vision that will change many lives in the future of Nepal and hopefully impact the nation for positive change.
The Global Mountain Fund Inc	169378		/users/profile/224456	Toni14	Volunteer	5	09/12/2013	I volunteered with The Mountain Fund in 2011 for four weeks at Helping Hands Hospital in Kathmandu, Nepal.  It was such an amazing opportunity!  I was able to observe various medical departments such as emergency room, obstetrics/gynecology, radiology, surgery and pathology.  The doctors spoke English and discussed the procedures, diagnosis and treatment options.  On the weekends, the Nepalese girls who lived with us gave us so many different options on what to do.  Our group went to Nagarkot (a village in the mountains) and spend the night at a small hotel/house to wake up before the sunset and see Mt. Everest.  I also took dance lessons after volunteering twice a week to learn Bharat Natyum (an Indian dance style).  Scott and Sunita were very accommodating and are very passionate about their non-profit organization.

The Global Mountain Fund Inc	169345		/users/profile/224422	Ian_5	Volunteer	5	09/12/2013	My wife and I had 2 weeks of extremely rewarding experiences in the high stress environment of a low cost private Kathmandu Hospital (Helping Hands Community Hospital).  It was an incredible yet eye opening experience. if you are planning to volunteer in the big city of Kathmandu, a trek of any length is a must do if you want to get a more complete vision of the stunning country of Nepal. The medical trek would be ideal, but our timing was a little bit off. Scott from Mountain Fund was more than generous with his time and expertise on trekking and, after deciphering what was and wasnt sarcasm, we felt he was truly encouraging us to embark on this journey even though it wasnt traditionally the best time to go. Because of the revolving door of people coming and going and departing and arriving we were able to talk to other people who had completed treks and we were even able to meet some of the guides they employed. The hike beyond description and was the icing on the cake to a great volunteer experience.  We WILL BE BACK because Mountain Fund is doing EXACTLY what they claim they are doing. Help them make a difference.
The Global Mountain Fund Inc	169282		/users/profile/224360	marykay.mccaw	Volunteer	5	09/12/2013	I was a volunteer with the Mountain Fund in Nepal 4 years ago. It was an incredible experience. I worked with The Women's Foundation of Nepal which is partially funded by the Mountain Fund. I wanted to work with women, so The Mountain Fund suggested this group. Scott MacLennan and his wife, Sunita, and their lovely team prepared me for my stay, helped me with practical details, and gave me an understanding of the political culture, and the mission of the organization and those that it funds. I had a life-changing experience being in Nepal and working with the beautiful, courageous women involved with the Women's Foundation. The Women's Foundation provides a safe haven for women and children who are fleeing domestic violence and/or abandonment. The plight of women in Nepal is dire for many, to the point that suicide is the leading form of death for women between the ages of 18-35. Many women have no documents (birth certificates, marriage certificates, etc.), no money, few skills, and children in tow. The Women's Foundation, a Mountain Fund beneficiary, provides legal aide, shelter, food, skill training/employment, education for children, and a path to a life of independence and dignity for women and their children. All of this is done with joy, generosity, and love by the Women's Foundation. The Mountain Fund and the well selected smaller groups it funds, knows where the need is, and fills it, but with the goal of empowering those that are being helped to help themselves. The medical treks that the Mountain Fund leads bring medical teams and care to for people in remote villages in Nepal. Although I did not participate in that experience, I did speak with one of the doctors and nurses who did participate (volunteers from the U.S.). Their passion for the mission and their respect and support of Scott MacLennan were evident. Scott MacLennan has built deep relationships with the people of Nepal and grass-roots leaders who know what needs to be done and how best to do it, with the least amount of money. There's no waste, or bureaucracy in the Mountain Fund. They are defined by intelligence and action. In a country where the government does not choose to take care of its people, the Mountain Fund provides a model for how to help those in need in a deep and transformational way.

It is a well run organization and provides opportunities for medical professionals to volunteer in a majestic setting.  I am looking forward to many years of service with The Mountain Fund.
The Global Mountain Fund Inc	169198		/users/profile/224238	bradbaba	Volunteer	5	09/11/2013	I had an experience of a life time while in Nepal as part of the Mountain Fund organization. I meet a wide range of people both in the Mountain Fund Volunteer House and in the Kathmandu Community. My placement was visiting an orphanage each day and helping with homework etc. The opportunity to get to know the kids was incredible and is one of the most enjoyable things I have done. I also had the opportunity to go on a Medical trek with a group of amazing people that, with limited supplies, make a difference in small remote communities. The memories I have from my experience always put a smile on my face and make me want to go back. I think what Mountain Fund is achieving in Kathmandu is incredible. It allows two worlds to connect which can only be a positive thing.

Under the leadership of Mr Scott MacLennan the Mountain Fund has continually grown to be able to helping folks who would otherwise struggle.

They are very aware of what needs to be done, and know how to make an impact in the lives of those in need. They take time to get to know those who they help very well, and continue to build relationships. I had a wonderful time volunteering along side this organization and noticed that not only was I changing the lives of those in need, but my life would also be changed forever.

They are particularly interested in improving living conditions for children and women, plus developing sustainable livelihood for women.  They have developed valuable projects to this end.  Their website contains details about their projects:  www.mountainfund.org.  I do not work for this organization, but have watched them move the mountain of poverty in Nepal.  They have an extensive volunteer program which helps to fund their projects, so that 100% of your donation is used on the ground in Nepal.  If you have funds to give, I have 110% confidence that the Global Mountain Fund will use them wisely to create positive change for those they serve in Nepal.  Cheers!

The mountain fund however is one of the most caring honesty, and just all around good heart groups of individuals I have ever had the distinct pleasure to have worked with. I can't say enough good things about the folks involved. I can only hope that other follow suit of all the great work done in Nepal, and around the world.

Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/02/2012	I am an expat. who lives in Kathmandu part of the year and own tourist base businesses in Nepal.  I have seen and heard from many volunteers in Nepal over the years and have worked with some of the local volunteer organizations.  I have to say I am most impressed with the work being done at the Mountain Fund.   Scott and his team look for meaningful projects in Nepal and then call on volunteers to help meet the goals he sees will truly help Nepali people.    The Mountain Fund is one of the only volunteer organizations in Nepal that I truly believe in and would feel happy recommending to anyone interested in volunteering here.   They are small, genuine, accountable and really care that each volunteer has a wonderful experience while doing some much needed service for Nepali people.  
The Global Mountain Fund Inc	113384		/users/profile/154301	Pam_7	Client Served	4	05/31/2012	I have traveled to Nepal 8 times since 2005 to facilitate humanitarian work and decided to stay at Mountain Fund this year. I worked with and for some of their long term projects andI stayed  for 8 weeks, off and on from Feb 18th- April 17th ( 5 weeks there). I was able to know this organization well. In order to be effective in Nepal one has to love the country and it's people.   In my experience I have come to understand that most Nepali people want to leave Nepal and not return and many NGO'scollect funds to enhance their own lives first and others second. To my delight I found Mountain Fund to be genuine in their concern for others first. Scott and Sunita and their staff are people who are "in love" with the Nepali people and have a heart to help them to be lifted up from the burdens they carry in this impoverished country. Mountain Fund supports many organizations in Nepal who have excellent reputations.    They keep well informed on the progress of projects in order to keep  funding going where it is said to be going. The Women's coop ,one of their new projects in a very rural area,  completely satisfied me that Mountain Fund will be able to help  impoverished families and women with the careful structure that Sunita has put in place from the Nepali side while Scott has worked on the Western side to get this up and running. The Mountain Fund facilities are well located and are as good if not better than frequented hotels. The staff are kind, well informed, friendly and very willing to help in any way they can.  I would highly recommend this Organization to facilitate Volunteers and donations.

Their houses are safe and welcoming, for those who experience some culture shock when they first arrive to Kathmandu. The local guide in collaboration with The Mountain Fund is next to perfect! The houses are situated in a great spot within the city, and nothing so too far to see. Their work with orphanages and local hospitals is key to the learning of those who wish to partake in the life-changing endeavour. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to make a difference, and have an amazing adventure at the same time.

I went w my husband and another resident - who had been to Peru w Scott in medical school.  We volunteered for the medical trek, expecting great vistas, busy clinics, and some hiking.  What we received was far more than that.  Yes we had amazing vistas, incredible villages, generous villagers, and great hiking, but it was the overall finely coordinated trek that made the experience wonderful.  Our cook was fantastic, the porters amazing, and the support staff incredibly fun and helpful.  The tea houses and tents we slept in were sparse - but clean and safe and served to get the job done.   the bookends of the trip - the few days before and after - were spent in kathmandu at the volunteer house - and the girls there are phenomenal.  all our needs were met and they were fun to be around.  Coordinated trips to the tourist must-sees around town were provided, and it was an easy way to see a magnificently complex city.   We can't wait to go back - it was worth every penny!

Animal-Kind International	303771	3	/users/profile/394937	Sophie13	General Member of the Public	5	09/12/2016	Animal-Kind International is an amazing nonprofit that is reaching animals (dogs, cats and donkeys) that have had no chance to a life without fear, pain and starvation.  AKI has made it a priority to educate people, starting with the children, (as a regular class in school) on how to treat these animals with kindness, see to their needs and to provide them with a proper diet and in return they will receive unconditional love.  AKI provides much needed money and supplies (through donations) to house, feed, spay and neuter and healing for both medical and psychological problems for  animals and in some places where people do not traditionally touch, let alone hug and pet and play with  dogs and cats. The kindness to animals later translates into kindness for other humans. The money collected by AKI is used exclusively for the above purposes.  I donate to numerous animal welfare nonprofits, but AKI is my favorite and thus gets my biggest donation.

Animal-Kind International	303546	3	/users/profile/394720	Samantha84	Donor	5	09/12/2016	I have first hand experience of seeing this charity in action and I am really impressed with their passion for and dedication to improving the lives of hundreds of animals across the world.   I enjoy regular personalised feedback informing me of where my money is going and love the stories of hope on their facebook and webpage. 
Animal-Kind International	303332	3	/users/profile/206582	Ali M.	Volunteer	5	09/12/2016	I worked with AKI's affiliate in Kingston, Jamaica, and can attest firsthand to the huge difference this incredible organization makes. With partners all over the world, AKI is manifesting big change by helping animals. And it's not just the animals that benefit. I witnessed the huge shifts that the people in these communities experienced too as we delivered food, medicines, and love to animals in some of the poorest neighborhoods in town. People's lives have been turned around by their experiences helping to care for and defend these animals. By helping animals, AKI helps the whole world!
Animal-Kind International	155642	3	/users/profile/206582	Ali M.	Volunteer	5	04/22/2013	My sister and I spent several days working with AKI-affiliated Deborah Binns in Kingston, Jamaica. Alone or with the help of only a few people, Deborah travels a different route around Kingston every day to feed and medicate malnourished dogs and cats. Her work has saved countless lives. On top of that, Deborah's efforts have led to incredible changes in the communities she visits. She has inspired people within these areas, especially children, to see animals differently. Because of this they have become more humane, not only to the dogs and cats of the streets, but to themselves and other people as well. Deepest love and respect to Deborah and to AKI!! 
Animal-Kind International	303330	3	/users/profile/394491	Jane115	Donor	5	09/12/2016	Well run non-profit that ensures 100% of donations go directly to their agents in the field who care for animas in developing countries.  Excellent documentation of their work and the work of their field agents.  AKI efforts manifest love for all creatures; as such, they are changing human and (other) animal lives for the better.   
Animal-Kind International	303306	3	/users/profile/190504	hondudog	Client Served	5	09/12/2016	Animal-kind International has consistently helped the less fortunate animals in countries around the world where they are often ignored or even harmed.  AKI and Karen Menczer have helped by donating medical supplies, by funding spay/neuter surgeries for rescued animals, and also by being available for emotional support. I whole heartedly give them an A plus for all they do.
Animal-Kind International	240294	5	/users/profile/190504	hondudog	Client Served	5	03/31/2015	Animal-Kind International has consistently supported Helping Hands for Hounds of Honduras.  AKI helps not only with financial support to treat, vaccinate and spay/neuter abandoned, sick and injured dogs and cats, they also help with food, construction, and paying people to help with the cleaning and upkeep of the shelter. Knowing they are there to support and give advice is a big plus in a country with little regard for animals left to die on the streets. They respond quickly to any inquiries made by tourists about animal welfare here. 
Animal-Kind International	218778	6	/users/profile/190504	hondudog	Client Served	5	10/01/2014	AKI has been a constant support, both financially and emotionally (thank you so much Karen for always being there with an understanding ear and great advise), from the very start of their great work. The vet I work with has been able to use the donated vet supplies sent by AKI to spay/neuter abandoned animals and to treat their illnesses.  In Honduras, there is still a lot of work to be done in animal welfare, but thanks to AKI and their great director Karen, I am able to help lots of animals left to die in the streets of Tegucigalpa.
Animal-Kind International	198125	3	/users/profile/190504	hondudog	Client Served	5	04/16/2014	AKI has helped Helping Hands for Hounds of Honduras for the last seven years or so. Without their help, HHHH would not have the funds to help the stray dogs and cats on the streets of Tegucigalpa. These animals are provided with medicine, food, shelter, spay/neuter surgeries and yearly vaccinations thanks to AKI. Besides the financial and material support, Karen is always available to discuss any problems and provide helpful input. AKI helps some of the neediest animals in eleven countries and all donations they receive go to help the organizations in these countries who are helping these animals.
Animal-Kind International	152327	3	/users/profile/190504	hondudog	Board Member	5	04/05/2013	Animal-Kind International has consistently helped the neediest of animals in Europe, Afica, Central America and the Caribe. They help with spay/neuter clinics for animals owned by individuals who would overwise be unable to afford this surgery. They have helped with financing construction of shelters at the dog refuge and with humane education talks at elementary, high schools and the universities here in Honduras. Karen Menczer, as the director of AKI. is always available to help in anyway possible to address the many animal welfare concerns here and in the other countries where her partner organizations work. AKI and Karen Menczer have been of immense help and I am incredibly in debt to them. Thank you from all the abandoned, homeless and sick animals you have helped. Gracias 
Animal-Kind International	144009	3	/users/profile/190504	hondudog	Client Served	5	11/28/2012	Animal-Kind has supported Helping Hands for Hounds of Honduras almost from the start. Without their help, we could not rescue, spay/neuter and save so many abused and abandoned animals. Besides the economic support, AKI gives emotional support. They are my rock and I so depend on them.
Animal-Kind International	303300	3	/users/profile/190544	Nicole D.	Donor	5	09/12/2016	Animal-Kind International is one of my favourite charities.  They are actually on the ground supporting countless shelters and individuals all around the world who are actually making a difference for animals.  
Animal-Kind International	144048	3	/users/profile/190544	Nicole D.	General Member of the Public	5	11/28/2012	Animal-Kind International is by far my favourite animal charity in the world.  They have gone above and beyond for so many shelters and rescue groups around the world who have found themselves in the most dire situations and often times in countries that are going against everything they are standing for in regards to animal welfare and animal rights.  I have had the pleasure of bringing various donations and supplies to AKI supported shelters such as the USPCA in Uganda and Helping Hands for Hounds in Honduras.  From my first hand experiences, I know for a fact that Animal-Kind International is a class act charity that deserves all the support and recognition that they can get!!
Animal-Kind International	303295	3	/users/profile/241780	Mary229	Donor	5	09/12/2016	I have been a donor to AKI for years, I personally know the dedication, integrity and compassion of this organization. I too assist in international animal welfare along the US border and through my animal welfare work I ran across AKI, they are an amazing organization, working on the ground with local shelters in some very tough places to be an animal. Completely trustworthy nonprofit with a true global vision so help improve the lives of animals working through local groups. 
Animal-Kind International	303293	3	/users/profile/394457	Ulli I.	Donor	5	09/12/2016	I bow to Karen Menzer for all her engagement for cats and dogs around the world.
Animal-Kind International	303287	3	/users/profile/282291	Myra H.	Volunteer	5	09/12/2016	There are very few organizations that donate 100% of your donation. There are probably even fewer that fit in visiting these organizations around their other job. I personally know one of the shelters that are supported by Animal Kind and know how desperately they rely on this income, to be able to continue to help the animals in some of the poorest countries there are. Countries that poverty and disease are rife and people (often children) still die of RabiesWithout our only shelter the only option for the dogs and cats, is a life scavenging on the streets, feared by many and often sent away, sometimes violently, When a bite or a scratch is a threat to your life or to your child, it is hard to be compassionate.  I and all who help, at every shelter, say thank you AKI. Without your support the world would be a far worse place.  Also a mega thank you from all the animals that have been rescued, treated, and found homes.  
Animal-Kind International	218711	5	/users/profile/282291	Myra H.	Volunteer	5	10/01/2014	Hi I volunteer at Uganda Society for the protection and care of animals, who without the help from AKI would really struggle to not only do what they can, but may have trouble existing at all. Charity and volunteering is a fairly new concept here, they deal with problems in a different way, villagers are family and will help family however unrelated. Even when they have little themselves. But with the help from AKI we are getting the message out there, through spreading the word at both an adult and school level, to the extent that a few months ago the council agreed to call the shelter when an area has a problem, rather than laying poison to solve the problem, not that it will. The shelter is our only one in Uganda and it would be a far worse place without the good work they do with help from AKI, who deserve a heck of a lot of credit for what they do, so many animals in some of the worlds poorest area's have benefited from their donations, THANK YOU ANIMAL KIND INTERNATIONAL Myra Hill
Animal-Kind International	303282	3	/users/profile/345171	Writer	Volunteer	5	09/12/2016	Animal-Kind International absolutely do what they for animals in need. I know this for a fact, because the Chair of said foundation came all the way to my country, the Republic of Suriname (South America) to observe and see where AKI could help. Since then we have been able to execute spay/neuter projects and buy food for the stray animals we feed on a daily basis. We also have been able to buy a meat grinder, with which we grind the meat we get donated from local companies. Every day we cook good food for the animals. We would really like to see AKI as a GREAT NONPROFIT because they spend all donations on those who need it: animals in need.  Cynthia Ashruf (Foundation Henk Abrahams)
Animal-Kind International	256774	4	/users/profile/345171	Writer	Board Member	5	09/12/2015	We are the Foundation Henk Abrahams, an organisations which helps stray animals as much as possible. By giving them food, water and if needed, medical care by a vet. We also spay/neuter all the animals we feed on the street. Thanks to Animal Kind International, we have been able to continue this work. Especially regarding the donations we get through AKI and which we use for spay/neuters, some food and vaccinations. Without the help of AKI we really wouldn't have been able to do so much. Fact is that the business community in my country, the Republic of Suriname, is not so willing to donate for animals in need. We are very fortunate to have AKI as a partner/donor. 
Animal-Kind International	303281	3	/users/profile/394444	Writer	Volunteer	2	09/12/2016	They  are a non profit  with  a difference. They  send  100 recievables to beneficiary  organizations. Their  presence is also  in the deprived  west African countries
Animal-Kind International	303277	3	/users/profile/190492	mmevitrac	Donor	5	09/12/2016	Every single penny that is contributed goes toward the care of neglected/abused animals in countries that lack the financial infrastructure to satisfy that need.  Without AKI, these animals lives would be largely ignored. Funds for educating the local populations is money also well spent. 
Animal-Kind International	152760	3	/users/profile/190492	mmevitrac	Donor	5	04/06/2013	There are animals in desperate circumstances all over the world. However, we in the US, have many resources to rescue and help our own animals. AKI is like Doctors Without Borders, addressing the needs of animals WORLDWIDE who need food, shelter, health care, protection and love. This organization knows no limits and works tirelessly to improve the lives of animals in desperate need of aid. Every single cent donated goes to the cause, the way non-profits are supposed to operate.  
Animal-Kind International	143993	3	/users/profile/190492	mmevitrac	Volunteer	5	11/28/2012	AKI addresses the needs of an often ignored population. As heartbreaking as abused and neglected animals are in the United States, at least we have a working safety net. Many places around the world do not.
Animal-Kind International	303271	3	/users/profile/394432	Petra4	Board Member	5	09/12/2016	AKI is helping animal shelters all over the world. Wonderful work well  done. I have met Karen while on a work project in Barbados, where she spent  all of her weekends donating her work and free time to The Hope Sanctuary Barbados. A true loving soul. She also has supported The Hope Sanctuary in other ways, mailing sponsorship proposals etc. Thank you, AKI for all your support for Barbados.
Animal-Kind International	303269	3	/users/profile/394430	lsjohnston	Donor	5	09/11/2016	Wonderful organization helping animals worldwide.  Karen responds quickly to questions about how donations are spent and provides updates on programs through a Facebook page and a newsletter.  100% of donations go towards helping animals. 
Animal-Kind International	303268	3	/users/profile/394429	Lori175	Donor	5	09/11/2016	Animal Kind International helps animals around the world, in the neediest pockets of our earth...bringing help, love, hope and life to many animals who would otherwise go hungry, homeless and sick. Thank you for your unending, kind and selfless efforts. 
Animal-Kind International	303264	3	/users/profile/394425	Writer	Donor	5	09/11/2016	I've donated to several projects and know where every penny of the money went to. I'm given frequent project updates and progress pictures. I've  kept up with the organizations progress and feel confident that all of my donations are used wisely to improve the lives of animals. They have given me the opportunity to help and I trust them.
Animal-Kind International	303263	3	/users/profile/394424	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	09/11/2016	As a member of an animal welfare ngo. in the Caribbean, I have watched the work of AKI and  fully support this org. They are helping those that cannot speak for themselves, and there can be no greater calling than this. 
Animal-Kind International	303262	3	/users/profile/230569	Robyn14	Donor	5	09/11/2016	When  even human rights  are compromised in many developing countries, Animal-Kind has helped people with compassion help 'those with no voice'...and this starts the process of respecting human rights as well.  I know this because I am a Returned peace Corps Volunteer, and AKI has helped me meet humane activists  in many countries.  I've seen their good work!
Animal-Kind International	218773	5	/users/profile/230569	Robyn14	Volunteer	5	10/01/2014	I am a Returned Peace Corps Volunteer.    Most places in  the developing world have  very little in the way of human rights----but there is always a minority watching out for animals---the most vulnerable.  This really helps people understand the role of community in compassion. Without the  assistance of Animal-Kind, they could not do what they do.  I think this 8is a great organization, and commend Karen for  keeping it going.
Animal-Kind International	198116	2	/users/profile/230569	Robyn14	Donor	5	04/16/2014	I am a Returned Peace Corps Volunteer.   Most of the developing world is challenged by human rights, and animals come last.  However, I also know that  many  people have compassion for all. they need  assistance, and they need to know they are not alone---that  the global community supports them.  This is what Animal-kind International does.
Animal-Kind International	174300	4	/users/profile/230569	Robyn14	General Member of the Public	5	10/05/2013	Lots of people want to help animals, especially when we travel.  Because of  AKI. I have been able to meet  people all over the world and help them when i can.  This  organization  runs on a very lean budget.  You can donate to them &  they make sure it gets  overseas.
Animal-Kind International	302790	2	/users/profile/190476	Elizabeth89	Board Member	5	09/07/2016	I am proud to be a board member of Animal-Kind International.  AKI supports our partner organizations in poor countries. These partners organizations do great and much needed work protecting and medically serving domestic animals.  AKI is financially transparent and your donation all goes to our partner organizations.  AKI keeps donors updated with newsletters, blogs, twitter posts,  Facebook page and web page. 
Animal-Kind International	220053	4	/users/profile/190476	Elizabeth89	Board Member	5	10/05/2014	I am very proud to be a board member of Animal-Kind International (AKI).  AKI provides our partner organizations with critical  supplies and services.  We pay for  spay and neuter days.  We pay for emergency care for domestic animals.   AKI also helps fund shelter buildings and repairs. AKI provides much needed food and medical supplies.  AKI is a transparent nonprofit that gives 100% of all donations to our partner organizations.    
Animal-Kind International	154096	3	/users/profile/190476	Elizabeth89	Board Member	5	04/10/2013	I am a board member for Animal-Kind International so I know first hand what great work we do with our partner organizations in countries with very limited financial resources.  The great thing is our organization is so transparent you can see everything we do.  And 100% of your donation goes directly to one of our partners of your choice.  We have no overhead.  That means more spay and neuter days more humane education and more money going towards humane treatment of domestic work animals.  
Animal-Kind International	143978	1	/users/profile/190476	Elizabeth89	Board Member	5	11/28/2012	Animal Kind International is unique in giving all  donations directly to partners orgs and does a great job of keeping donors informed with a website and a newsletter.  I am proud to be on the board of this organization.   
Animal-Kind International	302630	3	/users/profile/190481	Ron Stryker	Board Member	5	09/06/2016	The animal rescue organizations that Animal-Kind International raises money for really rely on AKI supporters. This is a case where without AKI support, many of the animals would not be helped. AKI is committed to being transparent and fully accountable to donors. I feel confident that my donation is going to help animals and not in anyone's pockets!   
Animal-Kind International	246702	3	/users/profile/190481	Ron Stryker	Board Member	5	06/30/2015	Animal-Kind International is one of the few organizations that raise money for animal welfare organizations in poor countries. But not only that, it's probably the only one that gives 100% of money raised, and the only one with close ties to partner organizations and that can do the due diligence to ensure funds are used for animal welfare and to report to our supporters. 
Animal-Kind International	143982	2	/users/profile/190481	Ron Stryker	Board Member	5	11/28/2012	After working overseas for more than 30 years, I've seen a lot of orgaizations that want to help people and animals, but few that really have an impact.  AKI really does do what they say they do-they raise visibility of the work of existing animal welfare organizations ad support the priorities of the animal welfare organizations, rather than being top-down and telling the organizations what to do with the funds AKI sends.  
Animal-Kind International	302579	2	/users/profile/191956	E. Margaret	Board Member	5	09/04/2016	I am both a donor and board member for AKI.  It's the only non-profit I know of where all donations go to support the beneficiary organizations, unless a donor affirmatively specifies the money can be used for administrative expenses.  There also is no question that AKI works to fill a need -- support for local organizations working to end the suffering of animals -- in settings where the need cannot be questioned.  AKI is a model of philanthropy supporting indigenous reform efforts, and It's an honor to be associated with it in any capacity.
Animal-Kind International	145464	2	/users/profile/191956	E. Margaret	Board Member	5	12/01/2012	I have worked with and around many non-profits, and AKI is exceptional.  It is focused, efficient, and its structure matches its mission -- to help grass-root organizations improve the lives of the animals in their areas.  It is a perfect example of the truth of Margaret Mead's quote:  "Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world.  Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has."
Animal-Kind International	257268	2	/users/profile/345673	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	09/15/2015	AKI is doing a great job to help the poor animal around the world

Animal-Kind International	257085	3	/users/profile/345489	lshafiroff	Donor	5	09/14/2015	This is a unique organization in that it reaches developing and underserved communities in countries that lack in humane education and fair loving treatment of dogs and cats.  I only hope that this organizations continues to grow and partners with rescues in the United States to encourage more humane treatment of animals internationally. Karen is incredible and I would love to accompany her on a trip to a shelter that AKI helps fund.  Thank you and please let us know how we may help more!
Animal-Kind International	257056	3	/users/profile/345461	sedona12	Donor	5	09/14/2015	The work and efforts for animals made by Karen Menczer and the members of this group are phenomenal ! I am proud to be a donor and plan to support this group as they continue their great work worldwide. Thanks for what you do!
Animal-Kind International	257049	4	/users/profile/282354	EllenPittsburgh	Donor	5	09/14/2015	I love so much about this organization - the transparency with which donations are treated, the many stories and pictures of what the organization does, and the real results that support for AKI brings to animals in limited-resource communities around the world. The organization's memorial page is also a really nice way to show sympathy for those who have lost a pet. 
Animal-Kind International	218763	5	/users/profile/282354	EllenPittsburgh	Donor	5	10/01/2014	I recently made memorial donations to this wonderful organization when family members lost their beloved pets. I was so happy to have an opportunity to turn a sad event into something positive, and I think it helped my grieving relatives as well. Karen is wonderful about sharing feedback and photos - you can see for yourself that your donation is making a real difference in the lives of animals, and supporting those individuals who care for them in sometimes very difficult circumstances. What a great resource for animal lovers!
Animal-Kind International	256791	3	/users/profile/345189	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/12/2015	We have been working with AKI for several years now to help with stray dogs of Bosnia. We know how much effort goes into their operations and every donation will go to the right hands. Thanks Karen and AKI for everything you for those who have no voice. 
Animal-Kind International	256773	3	/users/profile/345170	Venstar	General Member of the Public	5	09/12/2015	Everything I have seen and read about this organization says it is wonderful.  I am thankful that they support animal  caregivers all over the world.  It is never enough because the need is so great, but they do what they can.  They provide plenty of pictures of animals before and after and show how money is being used.  I have no questions  when donating to them and hope they continue to grow and spread.
Animal-Kind International	245490	3	/users/profile/332664	KarenMenczer	Board Member	5	06/17/2015	AKI fills a huge gap for animal welfare organizations in poor countries. There are so few foundations and other grant making organizations that support animal welfare outside the US, Canada, EU, Australia. We help fill that funding gap (although so much more money is needed than what we are able to raise so far). I'm proud that we have such great relationships with all our partner organizations, as well as with other animal welfare orgs in poor countries, so we are able to let donors know just what their donations are doing, and we're helping some very worthy organizations that are not partners [yet!] to become stronger.

Animal-Kind International	232825	1	/users/profile/148165	info55	Donor	5	11/04/2014	The nonprofit that I run has partnered with AKI for several years in an effort to get veterinary supplies to animals in need around the globe. Karen works tirelessly to deliver these supplies, often traveling to remote areas herself to be sure that veterinary equipment, medications, syringes, suture material, etc all make it to their destination. Thank you Karen for all of your hard work!
Animal-Kind International	220963	3	/users/profile/284658	StephAbq	General Member of the Public	5	10/08/2014	I love when I donate to AKI that I get feedback on how my money is used to benefit the animals and organizations that I know need money desperately.  I'm always so impressed with how much the organizations in these poor countries can do with so little money.  The people who work for and volunteer for them are so dedicated, I'm happy to support them. Stephanie M.
Animal-Kind International	219144	5	/users/profile/282761	KimB.	Donor	5	10/01/2014	I first learned about Animal-Kind International (AKI) when I traveled to Yerevan, Armenia for work and was appalled and saddened by the treatment and attitude towards street dogs. In doing a search to try to find if there was a charity or shelter in Yerevan that I could donate to, I came across AKI and learned of their financial support of the country's only animal shelter. From my very first contact with Karen Menczer, I felt that this organization was quite different than other non-profits and exceptional in its dedication and service. The difference lies in the personal contact with donors and close familiarity of partner organizations and the devotion to transparency as also expected in its partner organizations.  It is AKI's tireless campaigning for its cause and its always evolving creative communications, such as putting a face to the names of partner organizations through the AKI website and Facebook, that is also remarkable. I admire the commitment and authenticity of AKI and its director, Karen Menczer. 
Animal-Kind International	219029	3	/users/profile/282645	joycestolaroff	General Member of the Public	5	10/01/2014	I have known Karen Menczer, the founder of Animal-Kind International since we were in college together. I have watched her unwavering dedication to animals in need around the world. Stories she has humbly shared of her life in Uganda and of the animals that she has fed, spayed and neutered as well as educating countless community members on how to care, love and respect dogs, cats and farm animals alike.  Animals that would have never had a chance of survival are now safe, healthy and loved because of years of commitment that Karen has lovingly and fiercely put into this project on their behalf. I admire you so very much.

Animal-Kind International	218870	3	/users/profile/282471	miriamjemez	General Member of the Public	5	10/01/2014	I greatly admire the work of Animal Kind International and Karen Menzer.  This organization's commitment to service has helped countless dogs and the communities where they live.  It is heartwarming to see before and after pictures of AKI's success stories where there are plenty of happy dogs and smiling faces.  I love that all of the money they get goes directly to helping animals and gratified to see such a wide network of volunteers worldwide who help get the work done.  It's great to see a wonderful organization doing a great job.
Animal-Kind International	218816	2	/users/profile/191484	Maggie Z.	General Member of the Public	5	10/01/2014	A very close friend is the hand behind Helping Hands for Hounds of Honduras and over the years I have seen her struggle to maintain her shelter with inadequate funds.  What a difference ANIMAL-KIND INTER-NATIONAL has made to her efforts to rescue street dogs, give them good care with veterinary assistance and maintain  them in the only available animal shelter in Tegucigalpa, Honduras.  AKI has helped in every way, providing food, medications, surgery (both emergency and sterilization), veterinary and shelter care supplies, and support.  And I know personally that every cent of every donation goes directly to AKIs projects.  To me, Karen Menczer and Sherry (Pilar) Thorn are angels, direct descendants of Saint Francis of Assisi, and the world is a better place for their work.  Thank you, ANIMAL-KIND INTERNATIONAL and Karen, for your invaluable contributions!
Animal-Kind International	144930	2	/users/profile/191484	Maggie Z.	Volunteer	5	11/30/2012	I have personly witnessed the results of the funding by AKI to the Helping Hounds of Honduras shelter. Pilar would not be able to maintain her rescue shelter without the direct financial help from Karen Menczer.  The money is used for food, maintenance, medications, vet care, spray and neuter events, chemotherapy, whatever her beloved dogs, cats, birds need.  It is a challenge just to keep the facility running.  The cost alone of just feeding everybody can be astronomical.  The budget is so tight. AKI makes such a difference.  I know that the shelter is so very grateful.  Seeing the animals receive such kindness and love along with their necessities is a blessing.  As a volunteer at the shelter, I give thanks to Karen and AKI for their assistance to a very unique, deserving, and grateful organization that fills such a great need here in Honduras.
Animal-Kind International	218809	2	/users/profile/282404	MickMaus	Donor	5	10/01/2014	I applaud all who work for AKI.  Karen Menczer, the founder and director, is a neighbor and friend.  She really is generous with her time and her caring for animals everywhere.  Imagine 100% of the donations go to  helping animals!  You bet I'll donate again to this wonderful organization.  
Animal-Kind International	218750	3	/users/profile/282337	jmgbn	General Member of the Public	5	10/01/2014	I am very impressed that 100% of donations to AKI go to the rescue, protection and care of animals in developing countries. This shows the depth of dedication of the people who run AKI. Clearly for them the animals come first!
Animal-Kind International	218744	3	/users/profile/282330	Ashley105	Donor	5	10/01/2014	AKI is one of the most effective and dedicated organizations I have encountered, not to mention that 100% of donations go directly to helping animals in developing countries who would otherwise have no hope. Karen is an amazing and fearless leader who truly cares about this cause. She gave me support, advice, and most importantly, her time, when I was trying to start my own welfare group in Senegal. Thank you AKI for all that you do!

Animal-Kind International	218708	2	/users/profile/190462	Karen145	Board Member	5	10/01/2014	I am proud to be founder and director of Animal-Kind International.  From my insider's view, I know that we are honest and transparent with our donors and our partners, that we are small, yet powerful, that we use all donor money for ONLY animal welfare purposes (no overhead, every penny raised goes to our partner organizations), and that we fund the best animal welfare organizations in developing countries--and we will continue to do this until our funds are no longer needed! 
Animal-Kind International	143963		/users/profile/190462	Karen145	Board Member	5	11/28/2012	Animal-Kind International sends 100% of all donations received to their partner organizations. All the money raised goes directly to helping animals in the countries and by the organizations that need it most, and also by the organizations that really make a difference in these countries.

Animal-Kind International	157355	2	/users/profile/208688	Christina49	Donor	5	05/08/2013	I've visited Uganda Africa many times and I have witnessed the ongoing suffering of stray animals/street dogs in Uganda.  I have been donating to the Uganda SPCA and I deeply appreciate the support they receive from Animal Kind International.  I will always support AKI as they strive to make the world a better place for animals.   Christina Coburn, Victoria BC Canada
Animal-Kind International	155722	2	/users/profile/206675	Patti Foy	Donor	5	04/23/2013	I've been hugely impressed with Animal-Kind Int'l for quite some time.  I know the founder (Karen) personally and can assure you of her integrity and the legitimacy of this organization. It's been a labor of love for her and she's extremely dedicated to it -- at the same time she's an excellent organizer with great connections so it all runs very efficiently. It's established and has a great track record.  I think it's an excellent place for any of us who love animal-kind to put our dollars
Animal-Kind International	155305	4	/users/profile/206195	Tracy Whittington	General Member of the Public	5	04/18/2013	I interviewed the director of Animal-Kind International for a profile of my blog, streetdogstory.com.  Having spent the last decade overseas in countries with serious street animal problems and knowing how difficult it is to find reputable organizations to which I can donate, I am double impressed by both the concept and the efficacy of AKI.  They have done a careful vetting of animal charities in some of the most devastating (for dogs and cats) situations in the world, allowing would-be donors to be certain their money is being well-spent.  When I published the interview on my blog, I got many comments from people who had excellent experiences with AKI and with the charities they represent.  I strongly recommend this group as an exemplar of one getting it right.
Animal-Kind International	155289	1	/users/profile/148368	yukonmesa	Donor	5	04/18/2013	What makes this group different from many others is that 100% of your donation goes directly towards helping the animals. I was impressed when promptly after my donation, I received a personal thank you. Animal-Kind International assists many small, relatively unknown rescue groups & often these shelters/clinics are the only ones in that particular country. In the AKI newsletters, I enjoy reading the recipients' thank you notes which state exactly what the money was used for. Someday I would love to visit one of the projects they support. 
Animal-Kind International	155279		/users/profile/206165	RobynM	General Member of the Public	5	04/18/2013	I am not sure how I found Animal-KIind, but Karen Menczer does a great job of publicizing   groups in developing countries that need assistance. I have  donated to a group in Malawi, where i served as a Peace Corps Volunteer, and with Karen's help was able to visit a  forest dog sanctuary in Istanbul.  Animal-kind International does a lot with very little.
Animal-Kind International	155276		/users/profile/206162	Vedrana C.	General Member of the Public	5	04/18/2013	I could sit here and go on about the wonderful things AKI does for animals, the countless strays they save, but we all know those stories, we've seen them most of our lives. Animals are the ones people always forget. The ones who can't speak for themselves, and so, organizations like AKI speak for them. However, what is truly special about AKI is that they speak for the animals that are the most forgotten, the ones on the outskirts of the world, in countries torn with war/conflict/poverty. In these countries, people mostly focus on the people, getting them food, shelter, water, which is understandable of course, but there is a tendency to forget that there are animals suffering in these countries too. I can't justify one life over another; a person's over an animal's, so I am really grateful for organizations like AKI who don't forget the animals in these countries like Bosnia, where I'm from, or Honduras. In Bosnia dogs are beaten, have acid thrown on them or simply shot. While many people are suffering in Bosnia after the war, this does not justify this abysmal treatment of animals. In Bosnia it is typical to hear: "Animal rights? Forget animal rights! What about human rights?!" - this alone gives you a clear picture of where things stand in post-war countries. Thank you AKI for not forgetting that animals feel pain too, regardless of where they are! You're truly amazing and the work you do is truly life-changing for these animals, and honestly, gives me hope. Thank you!

And.. IF they could get visas, she would have thousands and thousands of grateful dogs, cats, goats and every other 4-legged animal at her door to hug and kiss her! Animal-Kind International is wonderful, simply wonderful....we won't forget her, ever.
Animal-Kind International	144043	1	/users/profile/190539	Barbara97	Donor	5	11/28/2012	For over 30 years, Karen Menczer, founder and director of AKI, has devoted all her spare time to helping abused and neglected animals around the world.  Through her travels throughout Africa, South and Central American and Eastern Europe, she has help to found or fund SPCAs or animal welfare groups in the poorest countries in the world.  These countries do not have the funding that the US provides to our ASPCA.  100% of donated funds are sent to the animal welfare organization of your choice.  My daughter's high school animal welfare club is in the process of raising money for AKI's partner organizations.  Please consider getting involved by fundraising for Animal Kind International. As Karen has explained many times, society learns to be kind to their people by being kind to animals.

So I asked my family to make a donation to Animal-Kind International instead of buying a traditional gift.  As an animal lover, it is the best gift I have ever received to know that my family and friends' donations went to support such a worthy cause.  
Animal-Kind International	144031	4	/users/profile/190526	Mandy8	General Member of the Public	5	11/28/2012	I have had heart warming experiences with AKI, with both their Honduras and Uganda shelters. They help an area of the world where humanity is suffering so animal life is usually lowest on the priority list. Without AKI these animal populations may be forgotten or severely underfunded.

Keshet	316308		/users/profile/407571	gr3atn0npr0f1ts	General Member of the Public	5	10/28/2016	Keshet is a community builder, bringing the love of dance to all who are interested, unique cultural storytelling and supports students in building personal portfolios from a variety of backgrounds. Keshet is accessible (pun intended). 
Keshet	315194		/users/profile/406524	Jessica317	Client Served	5	10/27/2016	When I first moved to Albuquerque I decided to join Keshet's volunteer program. I worked the front desk every Saturday morning in exchange for free adult hip hop classes. The class itself was so much fun, but the community I gained was the greatest gift. Keshet is an incredible organization on all levels. They make dance accessible for everyone! I haven't been back in over two years but still run into other volunteers and dancers and am always received with love - it's like an extended family. 
Keshet	315098		/users/profile/406434	Mary Dee D.	Volunteer	4	10/26/2016	I've been to several of the Keshet events. They've all been entertaining, fun and very enjoyable. Lots of talent and variety. I highly recommend them. Some of the performers are in different classes Keshet offers and it's fun to see them perform. I've volunteered at Keshet and experienced the care and hard work that goes into their events.

Keshet	309983	1	/users/profile/401333	wandari	Client Served	5	10/12/2016	My initial experience with Keshet began many years ago when I signed my (then) 7 year old daughter up for dance classes and summer dance camp. I like that Keshet promotes a non-competitive environment which is open to all abilities.  Keshet was also nominated for the Ethics in Business Award, which says a lot about Shira and the Keshet staff. I am now proud to say I am a member of the Keshet team and understand the passion of the staff and volunteers, and the feeling of community this organization provides.
Keshet	308982	2	/users/profile/400343	Tom_102	Advisor	5	10/08/2016	I chose to become an Intel Encore Fellow working for Keshet Center of the Arts because of several reasons. My initial meeting with Founder Shira Greenberg was inspiring. I was very impressed by her passion, committment and vision. The Keshet programs offer tremendous benefit to the youth of our community in many ways and their local success is now being recognized nationally. The result is that Keshet innovation in regards to dance education is now being copied as a template that is benefitting other communities thoughout the US. Dancers are getting paid,  troubled youth are given new hope for a future and not returning to jail, and less-than-able bodied people are finding joy and increased health with integrated dance. I couldn't ask for a better place to contribute to as an Encore Fellow.   
Keshet	308979	1	/users/profile/400340	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	10/08/2016	I recently attended artSLAM: The Ultimate Variety Show at Keshet Center for the Arts. I was so impressed with not only the show - the variety and caliber of artists was amazing; but the value that Keshet staff placed on the artists who were performing reinforced their mission of valuing the arts, the artist and the audience. It was a privilege to see a glimpse into that side of things and really spoke to Keshet's passion not only for what they do and who they serve.

Every facet of Keshet is remarkable, from dance classes, to performing arts showcases, through creative business development support, to community outreach and participation -- every member of my family has benefitted from our relationship with Keshet. It is, in a sense, an extension of our family; it is community and inspiration and support all wrapped up in one. The variety of Keshet's services combined with their scholarship program means that everyone is welcome and nobody is excluded. As a result, the Keshet community is vibrant and diverse, adding an extra layer to the benefits of engagement. I am so happy to have found Keshet.

When I first started, I came with training elsewhere that didn't really personalize to me and promote my growth as an individual. But at Keshet, the staff immediately were there to help me improve and succeed in my dancing and I began to learn really fast and excel rapidly. I took community classes for three years and then joined the pre-professional program for an even bigger challenge. The environment at Keshet made me feel confident with my dancing and want to improve. I can easily say I am a whole new dancer because Keshet has exposed me to so many opportunities like mentorship/teaching roles, community outreach experiences, dance classes from people around the world and learning understudy parts for larger roles. The belief from Keshet that anyone can dance has opened my eyes to see dancing in a new way and I am thankful to Keshet for helping me to develop as a dancer but even further, as a person. 
Keshet	262685	1	/users/profile/351373	amystangel	Board Member	5	10/09/2015	I have been involved with this nonprofit for over 7 years,  as both a parent and now committee/ board member.  Keshet has grown and changed over the years, and continues to inspire youngsters to not only dance, but also to be positive role models in their community.  My daughter began dancing as a toddler in Keshet's community classes and graduated to participate in the Pre-Professional Program and Nutcracker On The Rocks.  All of these programs have had a tremendously positive influence on my daughter's self-confidence and self-image.  At Keshet, she is part of a community that promotes care for one's self through movement and good nutrition, promotes care for each other, and promotes care for the larger community.  These principles are present throughout the organization. 
Keshet	262586	1	/users/profile/351266	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/08/2015	My life has changed since joining Keshet! The teachers are live changers the dancers are so supportive and encouraging. Not your typical dance studio. No agendas, no drama just supportive people helping each other become better.

Dance and the arts are an essential part of a healthy thriving community and Keshet's contribution is undeniable.  
Keshet	261262	1	/users/profile/349858	Writer	Donor	5	10/02/2015	I don't have enough superlatives to describe this organization. In addition to their courses and basic programming, their involvement in the community is a model to be followed by others. They bring dance to a wide variety of people, providing opportunities for artistic expression and personal development and exploration to people who traditionally are denied such access due to physical, cultural, or economic circumstances. Their programs and personnel are the embodiment of how art is critical to a full life, enhances quality of life, and is critical to personal growth. While addressing programming to all sorts of purposes and audiences, professional to marginalized, they also serve as a driving force in the arts community and culture of Albuquerque with their innovation center. Keshet is a thriving and vibrant performance, development, incubator, and support center unlike anything I have witnessed in many years of being around the arts. At Keshet, everyone belongs, everyone learns and grows, and everyone has a home in a context of artistic growth and development.  Phenomenal is an understatement.

Keshet does an amazing job of making sure that the git of dance is available to anyone who is willing to seek it out. From creating scholarship and work study programs to engaging physically integrated classes Keshet makes sure that people not only can experience the amazing world of dance but that they can do so in a comfortable and familial space. It is an amazing organization that has helped me with so much and I couldn't rate them high enough for all of the wonderful things they do for individuals as well as the community.

Every piece and part of Keshet is just plain wonderful- it touches sooo many people in so many amazing ways.

I started getting involved at Keshet as a volunteer and joined the staff a little over a year ago and it has been one of the most fulfilling experiences of my life. The people I work with on a daily basis inspire me to be a more creative and openhearted person - most of them have become important role models in my life. I try to emulate them and the Keshet mission to explore unlimited possibilities through dance when I work with volunteers in the Work/Study program.

Keshet	229126		/users/profile/292788	Bianca9	Board Member	5	10/28/2014	I learned about Keshet last spring when a friend of mine who is a board member invited me to volunteer for the "Imagine the Possibilities" Event. I had such blast working with the entire Keshet team, that I joint the board a few months later. As I learn more and more about the organization in that capacity, I continue to be amazed at the depth and breadth of Shira's vision, of the reach of programming that she and her team have designed, and at the enthusiasm and verve with which everyone there is completely engaged.  I'm not surprised that Shira's deep personal believe in the power of creative expression and limitlessness draws to her an ever increasing number of amazing people that share that believe. I'm honored to serve and excited to be part of new growth and expansion in the future; there are places of light. This is one of them.

When you walk into the door of Keshet you get hit with this homely feeling. Do you know why? Because Keshet is like a second home to many of the dancers. We are also treated like family. I look forward to volunteering and dancing at Keshet each week.
Keshet	229087	1	/users/profile/292754	sebrena.keshetdance	Client Served	5	10/28/2014	My daughter started dancing at Keshet Dance Company 6 years ago.  The non-competitive scholarship made this possible. The next year she joined the KP3 program which has taught her amazing life-skills, like perseverance, self-reliance and commitment. Not to mention the beautiful skills of a lovely dancer. I have seen many shy children blossom within the walls of Keshet into amazing teenagers, teenagers into wonderful adults.  I now work at Keshet, and I have to say, it is the most open and accepting environment I have ever experienced. If you want to dance, then Keshet is the place to dance!!

In my years of teaching dance in California, I worked at numerous dance studios that trained recreational and competitive dancers. Although those teaching experiences were imperative to my development as a successful teacher, Keshet has brought a new joy and light to what I do. Keshet is truly a place of unlimited possibilities. No person is turned away for lack of skill or physical ability, nor are they limited in any financial way. Keshet offers unlimited noncompetitive scholarships for youth, and a work study program for adults. It is so refreshing to see a company that is actively bettering the community through spreading the art of dance to every single individual it can reach.  Keshet has also given me the opportunity to learn and grow in ways that surprised me. I am constantly challenged by the technique classes that I take. I continue to learn endlessly from my peers about everything from cognitive functions of the brain to ways to engage all different types of students.  If you are looking for a place to learn, grow, dance, have fun, and meet new people, Keshet is the place for you. If you do get a chance to stop by, be sure to check out the huge, new, beautiful dance studios as well!

It was definitely a challenge trying to find interesting, engaged non-profits from abroad. Keshet sounded like the most welcoming, fun and inclusive of all that I read about. And it has indeed met and exceeded my expectations! Kylie, the volunteer coordinator, was great at communicating before I even arrived, and once I found Keshet (a little hard to get to by bike but in an awesome space!) she was just lovely in person, taking the time to explain how stuff worked and show me around. At the induction, I got a feel for how friendly and easy-going the whole place was, and I have thoroughly enjoyed my work-study time from the moment I started. I wondered whether I would need any kind of experience, but everybody at Keshet made it easy for new volunteers to help out and feel included. A typical shift is very satisfying: quite easy, but you can tell you are needed and are making a difference. Generally, I would man the front desk along with others (you don't work alone until you are confident with it), do some light cleaning, occasionally assist with classes and other small tasks. In exchange for an hour of work, I took part in an hour of probably the most fun dance classes I've ever taken. I have taken contemporary and yoga, and can recommend both of these. The teachers are fun and incredibly competent. There isn't an air of competitiveness, as with many other dance classes, but a relaxed atmosphere, even when the class itself is challenging. I was nervous about taking part, but had absolutely no reason to be! I look forward to my classes every single week, and have taken on an extra shift and class in my second session. The only thing I wish is that I had more time to spend at Keshet. The classes are usually quite small, making for a more personal experience, which I love. There are all kinds of dance and fitness classes, and the work shift times are flexible.  I can honestly recommend the work-study program to anyone who has a couple of hours to spare during the week, and wants to help out and feel good!
Keshet	228882		/users/profile/292560	Swill	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/28/2014	I have had the pleasure of working at Keshet Dance Company for the past four years as a ballet teacher. Two of Keshets core values that I aspire to uphold in every class I teach are Personal Growth and Excellence. These values apply to professional, pre-professional, and community dancers. With each class, I intend for each dancer to find something new, anything they can ameliorate physically, mentally, or emotionally. I hold strict standards as demanded by the field of ballet. All the while, I firmly believe that anyone can and should have the opportunity to dance, and that's why I work at Keshet. Coming to work is one of the great joys of my life.
Keshet	228725		/users/profile/292403	MBehm	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/28/2014	As a professional dancer, it is incredibly rare to find one job that allows you to engage in so many facets of the dance and arts world. At Keshet, the possibilities for this are truly unlimited. I am able to rigorously train and remain artistically fed and challenged as a dancer, as well as teach, bring dance to the greater New Mexico community through outreach projects, and help to plan and be a part of performances and events that promote that connection and growth of contemporary dance and arts as a whole in New Mexico and beyond. I am incredibly lucky to work for this amazing organization with a hard-working, dedicated and kind staff. At Keshet, I will grow infinitely as a professional dancer, teacher and well-rounded artist. 
Keshet	228715		/users/profile/292394	keshetmcm	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/28/2014	I found myself in the field of dance because of what dance helped me learn about myself and the world around me. keshet has given me the tools I need to help others in the same way. I work in Keshet's outreach program teaching dance to incarcerated youth. I have no words to express how much of an impact Keshet has on these young men and women, and on the direction their futures may take. Keshet changes lives, and I've been fortunate enough to see it first hand. 
Keshet	228615		/users/profile/292303	seanh10	Board Member	5	10/28/2014	I've been around many non-profits and to me Keshet exemplifies what a non-profit should be.  You have  a visionary leader in Shira that is passionate, talented, empathic, and willing to take calculated risks to move the organization forward for the benefit of Keshet's patrons.  The staff has bought in to the idea of Keshet and it's multifaceted programs.  Keshet excites, empowers, enlightens, and embraces a community thirsty for artistic endeavors and community building.  I'm proud to say I'm a board member of this wonderful organization. -Sean H.
Keshet	228601		/users/profile/292289	RandyNM	Board Member	5	10/28/2014	The only professional dance company that employs dancers in NM year-round... then uses those dancers to change the lives of kids, parents, aspiring dancers, homeless and incarcerated youth, the physically and mentally disabled..... AND NOW has launched New Mexico's first Arts Business Incubator to help arts based entrepreneurs make a living off of their passions while at the same time generating jobs and prosperity within the community.  This website needs a 6th star for Keshet.
Keshet	228554		/users/profile/292241	CJTobias	Client Served	5	10/28/2014	My daughter fell in love with Keshet and our family quickly followed suit. She began taking community classes and is now in her first year in Keshet's Pre-Professional Program (KP3). Alana has grown as a dancer but more importantly it is what the Keshet team have taught her about herself and others that makes me proud of her...and proud to endorse Keshet. Keshet truly live their mission of "unlimited possibilities" for ALL. How refreshing!
Keshet	227932		/users/profile/291643	melissaelise2890	Volunteer	5	10/27/2014	When I first stumbled upon the Keshet Dance Company, it was still located in a small, somber building close to the heart of the downtown area. Going into my first ballet class there, I had no idea what to expect. My immediate reaction to the space was dubious, but I am pleased to say that Keshet proved me entirely wrong. I soon found that it was an incredibly welcoming and friendly environment, filled with people who love to dance. From my first experience, it became clear to me that Keshet was passionate about dance, and, moreover, passionate about bringing dance to the community. It has been over a year since I've visited that small little space downtown, and I am happy to say that Keshet finally has the space and the facilities that it deserves. The atmosphere is still the same; warm, welcoming, friendly, full of energy, and passionate. I am currently a part of their volunteer work study program, which allows me to trade hours working at Keshet for hours dancing at Keshet. As a part-time student, full-time server, this program is especially important to me, as it enables me to take dance classes when I otherwise would not be able to due to financial restrictions. It is apparent to me and to many others who dance here that Keshet really cares about the people who participate in its classes and programs. The Keshet Dance Company certainly does not bar people from dance due to their physical or financial limitations, and instead attempts to incorporate and include the greater community. Dance is for everyone. I know that and Keshet knows that, and I feel so grateful to have finally found a dance studio that I can call home. I look forward to many more years of dancing here! 
Keshet	227802		/users/profile/291525	hl_dancer	Volunteer	5	10/27/2014	What drew me to Keshet was its heartfelt belief that dance is for everyone.  I had grown up dancing, but had been about 5 years out of practice when I moved to Albuquerque.  In my search for a studio that would take adults, I found Keshet.  Along with their professional youth programs, Keshet offers a range of community classes for all ages.  The teachers are incredibly kind, patient, and they know their stuff!  This is a great place for beginners or someone who's returning to art of dance.  I have been fortunate to participate in Keshet's work study program which offered an affordable opportunity for someone on a tight budget.  More than that, though, I allowed me to get involved, and to learn more about Keshet, its mission, and the wonderful people who work and dance here.  Keshet has many programs and opportunities to get involved.  I'm so glad to have found a welcoming community of people who love and appreciate the art of dance!
Keshet	188563		/users/profile/246072	Monica46	Client Served	5	11/14/2013	My 2 daughters and I are so lucky to have found this dance studio!  We are participating in Nutcracker on the Rocks this year and having the time of our lives!!!  We enjoy getting to know all the great staff and our fellow dancers!!  I feel that this dance company offers everything and more that is needed and desired for dancers from young to old (like me:)The community outreach and physically integrated classes are a true asset to our community!!  Keep up the amazing work Keshet!!!  
Keshet	181003		/users/profile/237716	Matti Straub	Advisor	5	10/22/2013	Keshet is not only an amazing Dance Company. There reach-out programs with young adults in prisons with dance, performance and life-skills is inspiring and a great role-model for many other areas on this planet. Keep on rocking!
Keshet	151651		/users/profile/202490	amstangel	Client Served	5	03/26/2013	My daughter has taken classes and has participated in Nutcracker On The Rocks for three years.  Not only has she grown as a dancer, but has grown as a person.  I love that Keshet is such a diverse, yet very welcoming community.  I recommend Keshet to everyone I know with children.
Keshet	135718		/users/profile/181598	gm021211	General Member of the Public	1	11/08/2012	My 9 yr old daughter entered The Nutcracker and was kicked out after missing 2 classes when the rules said if you miss 3 classes, they said that because she missed 2 classes she wouldnt know the play well enough, when she had already been attending for 2 months, she knew the dance perfectly. They are unfair and would never recomend this school to anyone. 
Keshet	113081		/users/profile/153897	ecwoods	Professional with expertise in this field	4	05/27/2012	A small company with big heart and unwaivering dedication to its mission. Keshet Dance Company creates possibility where others see limitation.
Keshet	112882		/users/profile/153640	maria Montoya chavez	Volunteer	5	05/24/2012	I am very proud of Keshet Dance Company's direct involvment with the community and the amazaing impact is has had on our New Mexcio Children. Shira Greenberg and her staff are dedicated to making a postive difference in this often difficult world we live in. 
Keshet	112754		/users/profile/153464	arlyn	Board Member	5	05/23/2012	Keshet is more than a non-profit dance troupe.  It is a community outreach organization that touches people throughout the community. In fact, I have never seen an organization with such a sense of community and respect for everyone.  That  respect, that sense of community makes me proud to say that I am on the Keshet board.
Keshet	112673		/users/profile/153358	myadobehut63	Board Member	5	05/22/2012	Keshet Dance Company has as its foundational premise that individuals should be able to experience the unlimited possibilities the universe has in store for them.  Professional dancers give their time, expertise, compassion and skills to provide access and opportunities to any and all that want to take the next step on their journey.  Along that path, participants learn to express themselves through movement; they become emotionally confident; they learn literacy skills; they become professional dancers themselves; they find hope and set goals.  The scope of Keshet is very broad, but at the same time, very focused and precise in regards to using the art of dance to enhance life in Albuquerque, the state, the nation, and even abroad.
Keshet	112646		/users/profile/153326	EB12	Volunteer	5	05/22/2012	When I moved to Albuquerque in the fall of 2011 I knew I wanted to find a place that I could dance and potentially get involved as a volunteer or teacher. When I discovered Keshet I couldn't have been more excited. I have lived in several different states and have never found an organization quite like this one. Professional quality performing company, classes for the community, physically integrated dance, outreach with Title 1 schools and Juvenile Detention centers... Keshet does it all. Keshet uses dance to change people's lives, and I am proud to be involved with this incredible organization.
Keshet	112644		/users/profile/153322	MLCastCPA	Board Member	5	05/22/2012	I first became involved in Keshet Dance Company in 2009 though a project in Leadership Albuquerque. It was an instant attraction to the energy and passion of the team that led me to be interested in serving on the BOD. The staff of Keshet give more of themselves in one day than most people do in a lifetime. They serve children and families many others would never consider being involved with by helping them have meaning and fulfillment in their lives. They give them a means to education they may not ever have and help them find ways to succeed. They are an amazing and dedicated team!
Keshet	112643		/users/profile/153321	Sam Allison	Board Member	5	05/22/2012	Since 1996, Keshet Dance Company (Keshet) has been creating and performing innovative, experimental and inspiring dance works.  Keshet currently serves over 8,000 individuals annually by providing an unlimited, non-competitive scholarship program, a physically integrated dance program, and a pre-professional program. In addition, Keshet partners with the Title I Homeless Project and the Youth Diagnostic and Development Center to reach students who may not be able to come to Keshet.   
Keshet	112459	1	/users/profile/153056	cpriesz	General Member of the Public	5	05/19/2012	I attended a performance and was especially moved by the inclusion of dancers of all abilities and ages.  The unique way that students in wheelchairs danced,  left a lasting impact on me.  This dance company is truly inclusive of all. Thank you Keshet, for helping many find their dream by teaching them the way that you do! 
Keshet	112315		/users/profile/31280	blg	Advisor	5	05/17/2012	Keshet is involved in the community, and making such a positive impact on so many.  A parent at one of their performances stated that she loved to watch the show because the audience "can see the whole world on the stage".... professional dancers, students, dancers in wheelchairs, and more. Keshet provides programming to children who are homeless, children who are incarcerated, any child who wants the opportunity to dance.  And through dance students learn and grow and see the unlimited possibilities their life holds. 
Keshet	30282	4	/users/profile/31280	blg	Former Volunteer	5	02/23/2010	I have seen this company grow & blossom & extend it's vision of 'unlimited possibilities'  to the entire Albuquerque community & to everyone who comes in contact with their amazing programs & extraordinarily talented dancers.
Keshet	112307		/users/profile/152824	Ilana2	Client Served	5	05/17/2012	Keshet Dance Company helps to improve the lives of so many by opening the arts to anyone interested.  Keshet opened my mind to unlimited possibilities!!  It is a great organization!
Keshet	112305		/users/profile/152821	Sarah505	Volunteer	5	05/17/2012	Keshet Dance Company is one of the most wonderful Non-Profit Organizations that I have ever come across, and I have volunteered quite a bit.  I started volunteering in 2008, and loved it so much I had to come work here!  The company is completely run on passion, commitment, and love.  EVERYTHING they do is done unselfishly.  They have successfully continued to grow, bringing dance to those that normally would not have access, such as incarcerated & homeless youth.  During this growth, they have maintained a home/family environment for all those involved, from staff to students.  I love Keshet!
Keshet	112297		/users/profile/152806	S.R.	Volunteer	4	05/17/2012	After running away to the big city, I found Keshet under the volunteer section on Craigslist. I had been wanting to get into dancing again, and their workstudy program was the perfect opportunity for me, being an adult. I started in the summer of 2009 and I'm still there. I ran the front desk, cleaned, and assisted in childrens classes, and in exchange I get to take classes. I've performed in Nutcracker on the Rocks and other performances, and it has always been very positive and fun. Shira is awesome, and the teachers & rep dancers are very accepting and admirable.  I've been to other local dance studios in Albuquerque and other towns, and none of them can even hold a candle to Keshet's sincerity, acceptance, creativity, and kindness. The only thing that is lacking is the current building, but Keshet is on it's way to a new and improved space! Thank you Keshet~
Keshet	112287		/users/profile/152781	jamiea.book	Client Served	5	05/17/2012	My name is Jamie Book and I started dancing with Keshet over 6 years ago. Recently graduating from their Pre Professional Program, also known as KP3, I cannot say how much my time there has influenced my life for the better. I made so many friends and connections its unbelievable. Today I am still good friends with a girl that came and danced with us for a year in eighth grade who lives in Israel. My mentor, and idol at Keshet, Lisa Nevada, once told me in a conference, "Im afraid of what you might be doing if you weren't at Keshet at all the time." and the more I think about it the more I know its true, Keshet kept me out of a lot of trouble, not only because i spent all of my time there but because that is where i wanted to be. I cannot list all the things Keshet has done for me over the years, but a few things I can say is they gave me a home away from home and a second family when I needed it most. 
Keshet	31146	7	/users/profile/32073	twc	Former staff	5	02/25/2010	I started at Keshet as an adult student and volunteer and progressed to become an instructor, company dancer, and administrative staff.  As I became more involved in this incredible organization my dance training evolved with unparalleled opportunities for performance, teaching, collaboration, choreography, and training with amazing guest artists.  As a staff member, I had the opportunity to  meet and work with some of the most open-minded, open-hearted, hard working, and dedicated people I have ever met - including students, parents, volunteers, board members, dancers, and staff.  In my 6 years in Albuqueruqe, Keshet had a profound influence on my life, and that of my family, igniting my passion for dance and inspiring me to help others reach their full potential, just as they do at Keshet.
Keshet	31093	6	/users/profile/32021	jeanne2	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/25/2010	I worked with and for Keshet for nearly 6 years. I did office work, was a dancer/performer, choreographer, outreach facilitator, and taught studio classes. Besides providing me with a space in which to grow professionally and artistically, my experience at Keshet opened me up to a wide range of dance experiences that I had not (and have not since) experienced, such as working with physically integrated dance classes, teaching class with the Title 1 Homeless Project and working with youth at the Juvenile Detention Facility. The range and breath of Keshet's programing is amazing. I have been back to visit Albuquerque three times since leaving in 2007 - Keshet is an important part of these visits and I love seeing how it continues to grow and improve!
Keshet	30615	7	/users/profile/31580	leah1	Former staff	5	02/24/2010	I danced with Keshet about 4 years or so ago. It was one of the most wonderful experiences of my life. It inspired me to be an artist. I live with passion and i feel like i picked that up from my time with Keshet. Shira Greenberg will always be an inspiration to me. We worked so hard to put shows together for the city in a program called ASI. What a wonderful company! I hope that they continue to inspire young people to live with passion though dance.
Keshet	30351	7	/users/profile/31340	zayde	Donor	5	02/23/2010	Keshet uses limited resources to provide unlimited opportunities for kids and adults to learn, grow, perform and achieve fulfillment on many levels.  As one audience member shared with me after a KDC performance, "If the purpose of art is to expand the horizons of your mind, Shira (and KDC) has been very successful."
Keshet	30290	7	/users/profile/31288	bstangel	Volunteer	5	02/23/2010	As a small business owner and someone not previously involved with non-profits, Keshet Dance Company changed my perception of the non-profit and arts world. This organization is as professionally run as any business I have been involved with.  The people that benefit however, are not the owners, but the people who choose to participate or get involved...at any level.  Students, volunteers, at-risk youth, incarcerated youth, people with disabilities, professional dancers, teachers, etc. are the real beneficiaries.  The type of people this organization touches is endless.  As a volunteer the last two years, I find it tremendously refreshing to assist an organization that is genuinely giving back to the community at all levels.  That is truly a unique position to be in and I feel fortunate to be a part.
Keshet	30280	4	/users/profile/31278	lisa9	Former Volunteer	5	02/23/2010	It has been my pleasure to be part of this organization on many different levels. As a volunteer, I have experienced the commitment and hard work that the dancers and crew put into every performance. As an audience member, I have laughed, cried, and enjoyed every moment. As a donor, I have received a great return on every dime.I am so proud to feel a part of Keshet and the amazing people who make it what it is.

Keshet	30132	6	/users/profile/31126	mary4	Volunteer	5	02/23/2010	Keshet is an amazingly supportive place, always ready to help you find a way to follow your dreams and make things happen when it comes to dance in the community.  I started dancing at 34 and can't imagine stopping anytime soon.  I don't think I could have done that at most other dance companies.  I have had the opportunity to begin teaching creative movement and dance and to assist in professional productions, aside from just dancing for myself.  The PID program, in particular, is so inspirational to me.  I want to be a part of keeping it strong and helping everyone see themselves as having a creative dancer inside of them.
Keshet	30115	2	/users/profile/31108	kornblumshelley	Volunteer	5	02/23/2010	Keshet is a wonderful, inclusive organization and the performances are life-changing. From it's outreach program to the Nutcracker, everything is done professionally, but with an enormous amount of hear.

The Market is truly a life changing global event and captures my heart every time I attend.

Folk art traditions worldwide are threatened by many factors, including the importation of cheap copies of the baskets, pottery or other traditional arts that they create. I am passionate about the mission of the Market because the opportunities afforded to artists by the IFAA create a lifeline of sustainability for countless artisans and their communitiesalready more than one million people are estimated to have been served by this organization. They say that thirty cultures go extinct every year and that 50% of cultural diversity will be lost in the next one or two generations. I am proud to be a part of the IFAAs effort to sustain folk art and cultural traditions worldwide. 
International Folk Art Alliance	187301		/users/profile/244296	sylviaseret	Board Member	5	11/01/2013	The International Folk Art Market Santa Fe is truly a "miracle, not a market". The phenomenal event that takes place each year thanks to an amazing system of volunteers and staff is but one part of that miracle. What touches me and others about IFAM Santa Fe  are the countless stories of lives transformed...the lives of the artists who attend, and those of their communities that they represent. It is an organization like no other on this planet and serves a sector of the developing world that had been struggling with globalization and lack of markets. Only ten years old, IFAM Santa Fe has had an enormous impact and I can only imagine the positive contributions IFAM Santa Fe will make in the next ten years. I have been both a volunteer and board member and am a huge fan and supporter of the work of this amazing non profit. 
International Folk Art Alliance	231364		/users/profile/294958	maryvn	Donor	5	10/31/2014	I am so dedicated and supportive of the Santa Fe International Folk Art Market and Alliance for many reasons. The organization has a well defined mission to assist emerging third world artisans in a dynamic and multi-faceted way. When I became involved about six years ago the market just was evolving from a start-up event to a major market in Santa Fe. Since that time the evolution for the artist participants has grown to include marketing classes and other education and now even online marketing in the form of an international online store. The market's mission is to help not only the artists, but their towns and villages as well,  by promoting this idea of contribution to the well being of not only folk art, but third world economies. The continued expansion of ideas and outlets for the market mission of helping the artists and the third world is so impressive. Supporting the third world artists with sponsorships and participation in the market is a very positive, feel-good experience for me!
International Folk Art Alliance	230042		/users/profile/293699	katkingcole	Board Member	5	10/30/2014	The International Folk Art Alliance is the most amazing non-profit organization I have ever been involved with. The Alliance helps folk artists all over the world sustain their craft, become self-sufficient, market their beautiful work and create better lives for themselves, their families, and their communities. The cornerstone of our organization is a market which is held each July in Santa Fe, New Mexico, to which over 20,000 people come over a period of three days to see and buy art from artists from all over the world. At the end of the market, 90% of the proceeds of the sales are sent home with the artists. Last year, our artists sold over $3 million in arts and crafts!  For many of these wonderful artists, the money they take home to their communities truly provides life-changing opportunities:  for medical care, for education, for clean water, for housing.  We are making a difference in people's lives!
International Folk Art Alliance	230040		/users/profile/67331	Suzanne Sugg	Board Member	5	10/30/2014	I have attended IFAA's International Folk Art Market-Santa Fe each year since it began eleven years ago. The market has the highest quality of artists from around the world who  keep their traditional art alive by representing their cultures and heritage. The artists have received awards and recognition in their own countries, as well as, from world organizations such as UNESCO and the World Craft Council. IFAA is a well run non-profit providing artist training in business and marketing, and markets for traditional artists to create a sustainable life in the world market place.       
International Folk Art Alliance	61646		/users/profile/67331	Suzanne Sugg	Board Member	5	01/29/2011	The mission of the Santa Fe International Folk Art Market is to foster economic and cultural sustainability for folk artist and folk art worldwide and to create intercultural exchange opportunities that unite the peoples of the world. IT DOES IT! The market has empowered women from under developed countries to overcome their hardships, including physical abuse and violence, to unite together in cooperatives. These women create beautiful art using historical and traditional methods to promote and share their culture. Through the sale of their art they have acquired confidence and improved not only their lives but their children's lives. These women have enriched our lives by sharing their experiences and selling their art with us at the yearly market.
International Folk Art Alliance	229957		/users/profile/293611	NoreenSF	Volunteer	5	10/29/2014	After moving to Santa Fe and experiencing my first Folk Art Market, I was hooked forever. For the past few years I have taken on the responsibility of finding interpreters to work with the artists. The generosity of spirit of the interpreters is so heartwarming. Many travel in from all over the country to be interpreters during the training sessions, the panel discussions at the Folk Art Museum, and during the Market itself. They help the artists connect with the public. My favorite story from this year's Market is Kitty, an 81 year old French interpreter from North Carolina who is herself a potter. She spent all three days working with Habibou from Burkina Faso, becoming fast friends. As she wrote, "Serving as an interpreter was a wonderful experience and having lived in Habibou's country made it really special.  Turns out that he would have been 6 years old when I was there.  Actually the same age of our son when we lived there.  Habibou called me "Maman" which was very sweet.  The whole time I was running on adrenaline and was full of energy, happy, and not tired although I hadn't had much sleep.  Being surrounded with beautiful art and artists from around the world was amazing.  I felt like a kid in a candy shop!  (Being 81, that's a great feeling to have again!).

The Folk Art Market Mission is why we return each year which states in part 'helping to empower women' and find Market humbling and exciting at the same time as we can, in some small way, help to better the lives & villages of folk artists around the globe.j&bcasper
International Folk Art Alliance	229791		/users/profile/293439	TheTanners	Donor	5	10/29/2014	The International Folk Art Alliance is a superb organization that helps folk artists from around the world in preserving their traditional art through opening avenues for sales--and the support necessary for the artists to enter a world marketplace.  My husband and I have sponsored artists for the last 2 years.  What a delight to meet them and have a small role in helping!  In addition, the shopping experience was unequaled-- with artists from more than 60 nations offering their unique and beautiful wares.  "The Market" is a highlight of our year!
International Folk Art Alliance	229740		/users/profile/293384	buenospastores	Volunteer	5	10/29/2014	This nonprofit puts on an incredible market each year that manages to offer something for everyone involved.  Above all, the Market benefits the artists/artisans bringing their work and giving them a wider audience to appreciate what they have made in the preceding year.  Volunteers receive a memorable experience helping the artists in their booths to display and sell their work.  Visitors are treated to an array of arts and crafts that astonishes, and they are given the opportunity to acquire art forms that they may never have seen before..  There is even a special day when kids can get "passports" and go around the market gathering the flags of each country represented.  The International Folk Art Alliance helps create a community that spans the globe.  
International Folk Art Alliance	229719		/users/profile/280122	WovenDreams	Volunteer	5	10/29/2014	I have been a fan of this organization for four years and continue to be impressed with the quality of the people involved.  They have a national group of advisors who are committed to helping empower the artisans who apply to the market.  It is truly an inspiring place!
International Folk Art Alliance	229686		/users/profile/293334	Kathleen Fasanella	Donor	5	10/29/2014	I'm also a professional with expertise in craft development (manufacturing). My husband and I have been financially supporting artists with IFAA for the past 3 (4?) years and of course, buying many wares too. The advantages to clients is of course, improved standard of living, education, health but less obvious is the reduction in the economic motivation to move to urban centers (further straining challenged infrastructure) and retaining cultural heritage as an economic base. Buyers benefit by meeting the makers and by knowing their dollars have a direct impact as opposed to whatever percentages are whittled away via middlemen.  As to IFAA itself; I'm not privy to its inter-workings but as a show visitor, I can say that this show is the best show I've ever attended -and I attend a lot of trade shows (internationally). 
International Folk Art Alliance	229644		/users/profile/204246	PatriciaC	Volunteer	5	10/29/2014	The IFAA is an organization with a compelling mission that is also great fun. We attended the market as customers of the many skillful international artists in 2012 and were so impressed that we volunteered to help out in 2013 and be team co-chairs in 2014. The hook for us is the great good that the alliance does in encouraging and supporting artists and their communities, its impact on fostering global relationships and the just plain fun of shopping and interacting with the artists. If you haven't been to the market, come on down to Santa Fe in July 2015!
International Folk Art Alliance	229621		/users/profile/66772	zulu	Board Member	5	10/29/2014	In selecting my role, I was not able to indicate that I am additionally a volunteer and donor to this fabulous organization.  I have been involved on one level or another for over 9 years, and am more amazed with each passing year at the organization's ability to continue evolving and impacting the lives of so many in the work that it does.  It truly is unique in every sense of the word.  
International Folk Art Alliance	61194		/users/profile/66772	zulu	Board Member	5	01/26/2011	I began work as a volunteer and am currently a Board Member.

International Folk Art Alliance	229604		/users/profile/293253	ThePeters	Donor	5	10/29/2014	    IFAA/Santa Fe International Folk Art Market is a unique and wonderful organization that searches worldwide for little known but talented native folk artisans or individuals cable of and interested in producing folk art native to their local.  All are from challenged socio-economic areas of the world and when they come together for Folk Art Market it is a beautiful gathering of people, color, talent, festivity, opportunity and reward.       IFAA helps these artisans identify what might be best sellers, how to improve methods and materials, ways to present their items more favorably, etc. through extensive training and coaching.Best of all, the obvious joy and excitement of the artisans at Market who, away from home generally for the first time, are seeing a world they may not have known existed and experiencing the benefits of selling in a vast market place at favorable prices to the artisan and the customer.Lastly, they return home with resources rarely enjoyed with a commitment to share the rewards of their participation with others of their community and fellow artisans in hopes of making their communities better places and that the other artisans may too have an opportunity to enjoy Folk Art Market in a future year.    We are extremely impressed with the purpose, methods, organization and unselfish passion displayed by all involved in the ongoing and evolving process of Santa Fe International Folk Art Market.

International Folk Art Alliance	229587		/users/profile/293234	Boogie	Donor	5	10/29/2014	I love being involved with the International Folk Art Market.  It is so inspiring to see all the different artists from all over the world and their beautiful works.  It is so rewarding to know that you are helping not only the individual artist but also many more people in their communities.  I have loved getting to know some of the artists and learning more about their cultures.  Here's to lots more successful years for the market!
International Folk Art Alliance	229578		/users/profile/293228	PeggyGaustad	Board Member	5	10/29/2014	I have been involved with this organization since its inception, as a Board member, artist liaison, volunteer and shopper.   It is quite a privilege to work with the artists that gather in Santa Fe every summer, to hear their stories and to celebrate their successes.  The IFAA brings them not only this opportunity for financial gain but also reinforces the notion that what they do is vital and worthy of our respect.  The artists leave with money for schools, vaccines, wells, extended families, and various other individual and community projects.  That they also leave with a sense of pride and purpose, is the story of the IFAA.Peggy Gaustad     
International Folk Art Alliance	229554		/users/profile/293204	Annette22	Volunteer	5	10/29/2014	I love this organization. It is an extremely satisfying experience to volunteer during the Folk Art Market weekend in Santa Fe in July. Folk artists from around the globe interacting with each other and with the people from all over the US who come to see their beautiful work. As a volunteer I know I am valued by the organization itself. The staff are very verbally appreciative of all that volunteers contribute. It is one of the highlights of living in Santa Fe to be able to participate in such a wonderful endeavor.
International Folk Art Alliance	229508		/users/profile/293157	carolrobertsonlopez	Board Member	5	10/29/2014	Being a part of the IFAA and Santa Fe International Folk Art Market brings great joy and satisfaction.  To meet artists from around the world and learn about their cultures is priceless.  To know that you are making a difference not only the lives of these artists but the thousands who attend the market is so satisfying.   To see children merrily explore the Market and meet artists who give them a flag stamp for their countries is such a joyful learning experience,    Whatever you give to the IFAA you will receive back so much more......
International Folk Art Alliance	229482		/users/profile/243213	Catherine45	Advisor	5	10/29/2014	I have been involved with the Mentor to Market training program since the beginning and attending the  Market in Santa Fe since the first one. I am consistently surprised and delighted by the Market, the impact on artists, the opportunities to find amazing folk art, and the dedication and capabilities of the staff. It is an amazing operation and nonprofit. And as it continues to focus on sustainability for the artists, the global impact will be a game changer.
International Folk Art Alliance	186221		/users/profile/243213	Catherine45	Advisor	5	10/30/2013	The Santa Fe Folk Art Market is an amazing success and story.  I have attended each year since it started and have been working with the Mentir to Market Training programs for artists for the last 4 years, bringing in executives from all over the  US to help the artists.  Everyone who comes, including Ambassador at Large for the State Depart,met for global Women's Issues, Melanne Veveer, have been so impressed with the quality of the handcrafts and art, the scale of activities, the impact on the artists, the impact on the community, the dedication of the volunteers and the exceptional yet small staff that puts it all together.  It has to be seen to be understood....it is a market, a training week, an economic development platform, a dedication to folk artists and a really fun time.  This nonprofit deserves five stars and the award.
International Folk Art Alliance	229476		/users/profile/293128	Helene S.	Donor	5	10/29/2014	I have been involved with the IFAA as a volunteer and donor since the beginning. The success has been amazing! By providing a market for the talented and often deprived artists of the world, this market has resulted in a huge success and had a world wide influence. Here's to many more years!
International Folk Art Alliance	228687	1	/users/profile/292367	eddstepp	Board Member	5	10/28/2014	My wife and I were honored to be asked to be among a core group asked to help financially support the launch of the first International Folk Art Market, and we have been deeply involved in this amazing organization ever since.  I was even more honored to be asked to serve as the first Chair of the newly formed Board of the Market, now part of the umbrella organization, IFAA.  I have been pleased to serve on several other non-profit boards, but none have been remotely as rewarding as service on this board.  The mission of the organization, to preserve artistic and cultural  heritage and to economically empower artists around the world is unique.  It is noble to aid the disadvantaged, but to me, giving a way for them to earn a living and retain their dignity is even more important.  IFAA deserves the many accolades it has received for its tremendous accomplishments.
International Folk Art Alliance	228560		/users/profile/292246	Nlsloane	Donor	5	10/28/2014	My wife and I have been donors for several years as well as volunteers and enthusiastic purchasers of the IFAA market's wares. I  have been actively involved in social purposes organisations in the US and in Europe for nearly 20 years. Most all such organisations espouse and strive to provide empowerment for their beneficiaries. The IFAA does this in spades. It connects great crafts people to new markets, provides them with new skills that are relevant to survive and thrive globally and has created various new channels to market that enable these crafts people to earn sums of money that would have seemed impossible beforehand. So the Crafts people get skills, market access and money to support their communities; all this is in their hands. How is that for real empowerment. The IFAA IS REMARKABLE in so many ways. Beyond the benefits for crafts people, there is the joy that consumers in the West have by seeing and buying phenomenal arts and crafts AND living and learning from the artists as hosts and volunteers. As I said, IFAA IS REMARKABLE! 
International Folk Art Alliance	228458		/users/profile/292147	Cuerno	Donor	5	10/28/2014	 The IFAA / Santa Fe International Folk Art Market are platforms that support, encourage & promote the lives of folk artists worldwide. The impact that has resulted in the past 10years within the artist's communities has been life changing!  In addition a more educatedand growing international support base is being created.....living in Santa Fe for 36 years we never seen a more positive arts organization.  We have proudly served as volunteers,meeting market artists @ the airport who have traveled for days,  co-chairing the music/entertainment committee, and past co-chair for the Folk Art Market.   Ray & Judy Dewey  
International Folk Art Alliance	227967		/users/profile/291678	joannbalzer	Board Member	5	10/27/2014	I serve on the Advisory Board  and am a HUGE FAN and SUPPORTER  of this outstanding non-profit.  Producing the world's largest Folk Art Market, IFAA provides opportunities to folk artists coming from all over the globe. For many of the participating artists, the income received from the weekend International Folk Art Market Santa Fe represents 10x more than they would earn in a year at home. When they return home, this income can translate into clean water for their villages, girls in school, improved health care, and thriving folk art communities. I am proud to be a part of an organization that contributes so much to so many and is "making a world of difference."  JoAnn Balzer
International Folk Art Alliance	227431		/users/profile/291161	swedeen	Board Member	5	10/27/2014	I serve on many boards and am involved with many worthy causes, but IFAA is absolutely one of the most amazing organizations I have ever been associated with. The impact on the economic self sustenance of over 25,000 artist worldwide, improving the lives of over a quarter of a million extended family members is astounding. And, the role IFAA plays in global cultural preservation is huge. The market alone is a real life-changer, where the artists keep 90% of their sales revenue, made possible by the work of over 1500 volunteers. When an artist returns to their home country with 20 or 30 thousand dollars in sales, often in countries where average daily wage can be under one dollar... well you can do the math. Even more significant is the IFAA's commitment to robust and effective training programs and classes for the artists so their ability to market their art and achieve success in other ways and places is further enhanced. This organization is so incredibly well run, with the most committed and active board I have ever experienced. I am blessed to be associated and committed to IFAA.
International Folk Art Alliance	227372		/users/profile/291100	PennyRembe	Board Member	5	10/27/2014	I am no longer on the Board but I have known many of the people who put this together for years and when I was asked what I thought the Board needed I said it needed an insurance policy on Charlene and Judy because they were absolutely indispensable for the creation of this incredible market.  First of all, they lived the vision and not just for the lives they have changed in the many countries abroad but in the lives of the volunteers and staff. In a small town, to have over 2,000 volunteers, year after year - is unheard of.It is also remarkable that the City has been a partner in this event. Their help with the transportation has saved the market thousands of dollars. I think it is the most exciting event in New Mexico. And the folk art merchandise is better than anywhere else in the world. To meet the artists, arrange for the merchandise to come to New Mexico, to get it packed and unpacked and priced is a monumental achievement when you consider the language barriers,the distances, customs etc. - it is monumental. And when the board has a new idea, it is carried out before the next meeting. These people are truly amazing. And what they have done is beyond incredible.Penny Rembe

International Folk Art Alliance	186204		/users/profile/243195	mlvandervelde	Volunteer	5	10/30/2013	My husband and I have always loved folk art.  When we visited the International Folk Art Market-Santa Fe for the first time 6 years ago, I actually got choked up seeing the long lines of people who also appreciate the wonderful folk art that is sold at the Market.  We resolved to return to volunteer the next summer, and, amazingly, we did.  We were impressed with how well the Market is run, how well the artists are respected, and how many dedicated volunteers it takes to make this incredible event happen.  By the fourth year of volunteering, we found ourselves looking at houses in Santa Fe and moved here full time the next spring.  We have had a leadership chair position for the last two years with a lot of responsibility.  The Market staff is so dedicated, and as a volunteer I always feel valued and appreciated.  It is a wonderful feeling to be a part of such an incredible endeavor where artists are able to sell their beautiful wares and return to their homes with the funds to improve their lives.  Each artist's story is a beautiful story of devotion to their culture and family.
International Folk Art Alliance	185330		/users/profile/242290	Santa Fe Volunteer	Volunteer	5	10/30/2013	For the last six years I've volunteered at the International Folk Art Market--Santa Fe. The opportunity to assist artisans who have the backing of such a well-run organization keeps me coming back yearly. The Market cares deeply about the artisans and that shows in its high support for them emotionally, physically, and financially.  
International Folk Art Alliance	185316		/users/profile/242277	frank30	Volunteer	4	10/30/2013	For six years my son and I have volunteered at the Market, as waterboys giving cool refreshment to attendees.  He was just 10 when we started, and it's been a great experience for him.  Although we play a tiny part in the weekend, we are always treated with professionalism by the organization's staff, even as the event increased exponentially in scope.  It's a wonderful event and my son and I are very proud to be a part of it.
International Folk Art Alliance	185281		/users/profile/242237	mlittrel	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/30/2013	As someone whose academic career has focused on artisan enterprise development, i give the International Folk Art Market-Santa Fe a 5* rating.  They are encouraging excellence in folk art creativity and production and then offering a venue for the artists to market their goods.  As the artists come together in Santa Fe, they develop community among themselves which serves as a valuable ongoing resource for their future work.

By creating this venue, the Market has not only given these artists an opportunity to receive the recognition they deserve and income to support their families and communities, but it has also given Market attendees, staff and volunteers the opportunity to open their eyes and hearts to the world.

International Folk Art Alliance	185215		/users/profile/242175	nbenkof	Volunteer	5	10/30/2013	For ten years I have volunteered with this wonderful organization that really does change lives. After just the first year we learned something so stunning, so amazing.that if we could put just a small amount of earned money into the hands of mothers, we provided a huge life line of support not just for her, but for her daughters, who could now be sent to school and avoid the nightmare of pre-teen or early teen marriage.  Young sons would be sent to school instead straight to the fields or factories.  As an artist returning home with money in her hands, the mother established a position of respect in the family and in the village as an income earner.  That respect helped to keep her safe within the marriage.  All this benefit for the woman, her sons, her daughters and her village just by taking the brave step to apply for a booth at an annual art sale thousands of miles away in Santa Fe, New Mexico.   What a miracle!
International Folk Art Alliance	185138		/users/profile/242100	scrivener	Volunteer	5	10/30/2013	What an exciting experience to be a part of an extraordinary organization that brings together people from all over the world, provides many of these people with an essential portion of their annual earnings as well as with a venue to share their culture with others and provides the volunteers with the satisfaction of knowing that they are contributing in a significant way to making this all happen.  The International Folk Art Market-Santa Fe is a swirl of colors, languages, music - a rich and exciting experience for all involved.

International Folk Art Alliance	185013		/users/profile/241952	muevegirljackie	General Member of the Public	5	10/30/2013	It has been such a joy to watch this event evolve over the last decade - I remember wheeling my then 5-minth-old through the first market on a dreary, wet summer day, impervious to the weather because of the amazing energy and vibrancy of the market.  Now, 10 years later, my family looks forward to attending each year.  The stories that each of the artists bring are just as important as the art they create, and we all leave feeling inspired and alive.  By far one of the best events in Santa Fe each year!

International Folk Art Alliance	81503		/users/profile/89259	santafe folk	Professional with expertise in this field	5	03/08/2011	The Santa Fe International Folk Art Market is changing lives across the Globe by increasing awareness and appreciation of traditional arts. Since the market began in 2004,   Artists have used market profits to dig wells,  build schools, and other community improvements; things that were not possible before are now possible.  Since the market began in 2004, it has grown to largest of it's kind in the world, and has continued to attract more visitors and increase sales every year.  Artists keep 90% of all sales, and artist payout is complete within 24 hours of market closing.  The Santa Fe International Folk Art Market and it's partner, The Museum of International Folk Art, provide unparalleled economic opportunities for artists, and a fantastic experience for visitors.
International Folk Art Alliance	81275		/users/profile/88924	DebvH	Volunteer	5	03/06/2011	I have attended the Santa Fe International Folk Art Market every year since its inception.

International Folk Art Alliance	81210		/users/profile/88807	Irina	Volunteer	4	03/04/2011	I attended IFAM in Santa Fe almost every year with feel of joy and was looking forward for the incredibly colorful event every time to be amazed and amused by the endless creativity and skills of Folk Artists from many countries. In 2010 I decided to offer myself to be a volunteer as a translator (I speak Russian and Hungarian languages). It was simple to register online and close to the event I was invited for an orientation. i did not mind to drive from Albuquerque (altogether 6 times ) to join the crowd of volunteers to make the visit of participating artisans (many of them for the first time in the US)  more comfortable. I was assigned to 2 young ladies from Kyrgyzstan along with 4 other Russian-speaking volunteers - i am sure we did our best in helping the Artists to communicate with the buyers during the 3 days of  busy market. The Artists were very happy with the sales and expressed their hopes to be able to participate next year as well.
International Folk Art Alliance	61645		/users/profile/67329	Joan Parman	Board Member	5	01/29/2011	I've been involved since the inception of the Market and have continued to feel enchanted, emotionally moved to action, and privileged to be involved with such a special group of artists, staff and volunteers.   Every year there are stories from the artists about how the Market has changed their own lives and those in their communities.  And the more we learn about the artists and their communities, the more we all want to help them preserve their folk art and folk ways.  We have thousands of volunteers who feel as though this is "their" market, as well as artists who depend on the income from the Market to care for their families, send their children to school, and build basic infrastructure in their communities.
International Folk Art Alliance	61614		/users/profile/67292	patrick	Volunteer	5	01/29/2011	I had one of the best and most educating experience of my life.

It is the single most well-run, inspiring, influential and meaningful non-profit I know that provides opportunity for traditional artists throughout the world that they would not normally have. It makes all of the difference in hundreds of folk artists' lives--healing whole communities, providing housing, hospitals, roads and more, helping communities provide resources for orphans with AIDS, and improving the health of the artists and the arts throughout the world.
International Folk Art Alliance	61442		/users/profile/67069	Countess	Volunteer	5	01/27/2011	I have been involved with the Folk Art Market (IFAM) since the beginning, and just love it. At first, when it was starting out, it was exhilarating--all hands on deck, let's make this happen. It's still exciting as it's matured and our respective roles have solidified.  I love the mission of creating sustainability one artist at a time; I love the experience of the market--so many people from so many countries--very vibrant.  The event is very well organized and continues to improve year after year
International Folk Art Alliance	61395		/users/profile/67015	amy conway	Volunteer	5	01/27/2011	I love this market for many reasons the most important being that many of these artists from impoverished villages and cities earn enough money to support themselves and their community. I have heard stories of market participants building fresh water systems for their village, or  starting schools. The market is an invaluable resource for many many people. I also love that the market brings artisans from around the world and that market goers are able to learn about different cultures. This market has a wonderful 'passport' game for visiting children who have their 'passport' stamped by an artisan from each country - just one of many educational programs.  I also love that the market provides an impetus for the artisans to continue producing their local crafts - so that ancient handcrafts will not be lost. This SF International Folk Art Market is truly a great nonprofit!
International Folk Art Alliance	61375		/users/profile/66991	Saritat	Volunteer	5	01/27/2011	The Santa Fe International Folk Art Market is one of the most exciting events I've ever participated in or attended.  I've been an active volunteer ever since attending the first Market (6 out of 7) because I wanted to be a part of something that literally helps people all over the world in the most direct way possible.  The artists from many countries bring their beautiful art work, sell it to people from all over the US and go home with money they can use to put their children through school and buy supplies to create more art.  The organization is extemely well-organized with minimal paid staff.  Over 1600 people volunteer over the course of one week.  It is the most "win-win" event that could exist for everyone involved.   
International Folk Art Alliance	61332		/users/profile/66945	amyc	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/27/2011	The Folk Art Museum is a research facility as well as an exhibition space.  It is notorious for introducing people not just to fields they didn't know but also to fields they never dreamed existed.....Unlike traditional academic art, Folk Art does not need to pass through a filter into the viewer's aesthetic nerve center.... 
International Folk Art Alliance	61313		/users/profile/66920	CChosa	Board Member	5	01/27/2011	The international Folk Art Market is a soulful, spirit-filled endeavor that I've been blessed to be a part of the past few years.  Attending the market itself is an incredible experience.  And to realize the impact this event and organization has on our city, state, national and international community is something to be proud of wholeheartedly.
International Folk Art Alliance	61238		/users/profile/66820	A Severine	Volunteer	5	01/26/2011	For 5 years I have worked with indigenous artist cooperatives from Saraguro Ecuador.  The women make and sell wonderful seed bead necklaces.  It has been a joy to see the growth in sales each year and to hear stories about how the money earned has helped families and villages.  The Santa Fe Folk Art Market is the first place these artists have had an opportunity to sell on a large scale.  The artists who attended learned how to sell, export, price goods and much more from the market staff.   This year for the first time we will see the Mega Cooperative from Saraguro.  It is an organization of 5 coops and the profits will be split between all of them.  They hope to be able to come to the market every year.  There is nothing to compare with the Santa Fe Folk Art Market anywhere.
International Folk Art Alliance	61012		/users/profile/66537	Devoted fan of the SFIFAM	Board Member	5	01/25/2011	I became involved in the Santa Fe International Folk Art Market seven years ago when I was asked to sell water for a two hour shift. The United States had invaded Iraq, and I was at a low point in my feelings about the U.S. I had been wondering what the rest of the world must think about our country. I knew that the politics of war did not represent the "best" that the U.S. could do for the world. As I walked up the steps into the Market, I was greeted by the most glorious sights and sounds. People from all over the world were sharing the market experience.  Literally, tears swelled up in my eyes....I realized that yes, we in the U.S. were capable of showing the "world" that we cared about them, and that we were not just a country of war mongers. The stories that I heard back from the artists confirmed my conviction that the Santa Fe Internatonal Folk Art Market was truly acting as a peace ambassador. Artists who had never left their own countries, and who came reluctantly with fear of Americans, had their own stories about the generosity of the Market and its 1,000 plus volunteers. My work with the Market took on a new level when I was asked to join the Board of Directors almost five years ago. Since then I have served for two  years as the Chair of the Board. Now I see the on a day to day basis the year round dedication and commitment of the staff and volunteers to the mission of the Market.  The Market truly is devoted to helping preserve cultures all over the world by providing an opportunity for folk artists to sell their art.    For the past two years I have also been involved in the community outreach of the Market. We are bringing children from improvished areas of New Mexico, many of whom have never left their own towns or pueblos let alone has the opportunity to visit a foreign country. The Market in conjunction with the Museum of International Folk Art is providing these children with the opportunity to experience hands on arts projects with our international artists.  I believe the Santa Fe International Folk Art Market truly is bringing the world together in a meaningful way.

General Member of the Public	5	01/25/2011	In Santa Fe we are fortunate to be surrounded by art -- cultural, historical, and contemporary -- which we can sometimes take for granted. The Santa Fe International Folk Art Market is a wonderful reminder that for some, art is more than a way of life, it is a means of living. The work of SFIFA is so important to those who rely on their work to support themselves, their families, and their communities. It is important to those of us who enjoy art and want to contribute to the arts and know we are doing something more.
International Folk Art Alliance	60882		/users/profile/66371	Linda Belote	Volunteer	5	01/25/2011	I have attended the Santa Fe International Folk Art Market (SFIFAM) every year since 2006 serving as translator for the bead artists who come from Saraguro Ecuador.  SFIFAM has been an incredible experience for me and especially for these indigenous women.  Not only do they sell more beadwork there in one weekend than they do in an entire year in Ecuador, but the market has provided courses to the artists which give excellent training in sales techniques, pricing, and marketing.  To date five different bead artists have come from Saraguro to the SFIFAM, and they take their knowledge home with them.  In addition, the monies earned have improved the quality of life for ca. 100 families, the members of the cooperatives.  This money has been used for microloans administered by the cooperatives as well as many other family expenses.
International Folk Art Alliance	60869		/users/profile/66340	DeSilva Imports	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/25/2011	The Santa Fe International Folk Art Market is an incredible organization that spreads cultural understanding here at home, and around the globe. They unite artists from around the world, and help them to sell their traditional arts at a massive festival held annually in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Run by an incredibly talented and organized staff, and amazing volunteers, the market is a well oiled machine that never ceases to amaze. Three incredible action packed days, and everything runs smoothly, even with over 22,000 people in attendance. The 2010 market brought 132 artists from 50 different countries, with over $2 million in sales. At the event artists take home 90% of the profits from the sales.. something no other organization can claim. Artists return to their home country, and many times reinvest these profits in community development. This elevates the standard of living for countless individuals, and makes a positive contribution towards social justice around the globe. The goodwill developed around the world is just incredible, and the cultural exposure for both the artists themselves and the attendees is enormous. The market honors endangered folk traditions, and increases their longevity by educating consumers, ensuring that the beauty of hand made works of art remain in our modern world. The market provides important contacts for artists that enable them to assure a fair wage and living conditions, as well as a boost to the human spirit. The impact is just enormous, and I am thankful that such a wonderful organization exists. We have attended the International Folk Art Market twice now, and look forward to many more years of participation. I have made numerous contacts for my own business, and appreciate the exposure to cultures that I do not encounter in my folk art business in Latin America. It is a true win win experience for all!
International Folk Art Alliance	60865		/users/profile/66333	Penny	General Member of the Public	5	01/24/2011	Santa Fe International Folk Arts Museum/Market is one of my favorite places in the world! To me it is the world. A trip around the globe meeting the people, geography, culture and colors that make it spin. More than a just a static monument, SFIFAM is alive. An organisation that celebrates and perpetuates the creativity that bursts, pulses and expresses what lives in the soul of humankind.

International Folk Art Alliance	60852		/users/profile/66315	Bonnie C.	Volunteer	5	01/24/2011	I volunteered for the first time with the Santa Fe International Folk Art Market in July, 2010, as part of their Artist Training Program.   The first thing I noticed was the commitment and level of dedication of their volunteers, some who have been working with the organization since the inaugural market in 2004.   Working with the staff, volunteers, and artists in the week prior to the Santa Fe International Folk Art Market opening, I quickly realized what an invaluable service the Market provides to the artists they work with.  Not only does the Market provide artists, including women's cooperatives, from developing countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America, Central Asia, Eurasia, and the Middle East, an opportunity to sell their work and retain 90% of their sales, they also provide training to new artists at the Market in areas such as marketing, pricing, and display techniques.   The Santa Fe International Folk Art Market truly lives up to its vision and mission statement of "fostering economic and cultural sustainability for folk artists and folk art worldwide and creating intercultural exchange opportunities that unite the peoples of the world".

But Voices for Biodiversity does just that....and with an all-volunteer staff to boot (which is amazing). Stories are the key to change in the world, and with Voices for Biodiversity, you can find stories written by experts in their field, to better understand the issues facing the planet. Amazing organization shining the light on critical issues.

Voices for Biodiversity	304917		/users/profile/396121	csymgn9	General Member of the Public	5	09/15/2016	This non profit ezine provides very thought provoking articles about the environment.   I enjoy the original content by top experts and beautiful photography.  I always learn new things here and am exposed to ideas that may or may not conflict with my own.  Through this site they open my mind to new thoughts and considerations and I appreciate this.  I have learned a lot here and have passed the site on to many others!

Voices for Biodiversity	304701		/users/profile/395880	Writer	Donor	5	09/15/2016	I rely on Voices for Biodiversity to keep me relevant and informed of the issues concerning our natural environment. For example, I first heard about the "Sixth Mass Extinction" on V4B and not the issue is cropping up everywhere. V4B attracts passionate and compassionate individuals who bring us stories of this astonishing earth in compelling and vivid detail. Thank you, V4B!!
Voices for Biodiversity	304557		/users/profile/395744	Hilary13	Donor	5	09/14/2016	This is an inspiring, thoughtful, and educational web-magazine focused on issues pertaining to biodiversity as relayed through global stories. I enjoy everything from looking at photographs of elephants from Africa to reading a first-hand Massai accounting of indigenous culture and spirituality. V4B uses the power of storytelling to help us become conscious of our interdependence and thus shift our behaviors and habits to better serve the whole of life. Excellent organization and web magazine!

Voices for Biodiversity is doing a great job, informing about the environment and societys interaction with it. This is an anthropological, conservation-media platform that needs all the support it can get, for the sake of La Tierra, our Mother Earth and all the species that live on it.
Voices for Biodiversity	304306		/users/profile/395473	LW_AZ	Volunteer	5	09/13/2016	I am a volunteer in the web production department of Voices for Biodiversity. I wanted to volunteer time for a cause that showcased the issues with our environment, resources, animals, and the human element, and how we can strive for a balance that allows the earth to flourish. Voices for Biodiversity publishes many articles and photo galleries that show how this balance is possible, and it's been a very rewarding experience to work with this team bringing these stories to the public.

The organization is swiftly moving in exciting directions and has a great potential to grow into something much bigger with additional funding. I highly recommend supporting this organization through donations and volunteer time!

Voices for Biodiversity	271394	1	/users/profile/360226	sabdelra	Volunteer	5	11/06/2015	Volunteering with Voices for Biodiversity has been a fantastic experience! The organization sets itself apart from others by elevating the voices of local people and community members from around the world. I am fascinated by how much the world can learn from these people whose lives and cultures are so closely intertwined with their surrounding environments. Their worldviews can inspire the entire world to adopt a less self-centered, and more mindful and respectful approach to conservation.
Voices for Biodiversity	109635		/users/profile/149378	Catherine16	Volunteer	5	04/11/2012	I wanted to volunteer with Izilwane because of their interest in connecting the human animal to biodiversity conservation. People often forget that we influence lives of other species around the globe.  Iz provides articles and information about our influence on other animal demise. Izilwane has provided me with experience in writing that I would like to pursue as a career. Everyone is welcoming and helpful. I am glad that I have had the opportunity to work with such interesting people and a great organization! 
Voices for Biodiversity	109615	1	/users/profile/149357	Chelsea4	Volunteer	5	04/11/2012	I started interning for Izilwane in November because I was attracted to their vision to change perceptions about The Sixth Great Extinction in order to alter human being's negative impacts on biodiversity. Izilwane makes the connection between humans and the natural environment that needs to be understood in order to change the actions of all people. Izilwane takes an anthropological approach unlike any other nonprofit that I've seen. My experiences interning with Izilwane as an Outreach Assistant have taught me about the hard work that is put into running a successful nonprofit and the importance of organization, communication, and leadership. The Izilwane adventure is an awesome organization that is making strides to bring together the human animal and the global ecosystem. 
Voices for Biodiversity	109349		/users/profile/148980	dph9298	Volunteer	5	04/09/2012	Izilwane's approach to the biodiversity global issue is unique.  They're idea of teaching young people to become eco reporters is Great!  It's through educating our young that lasting change will become a reality.  What better way than teaching them a very useable writing skill while at the same time the young peole learn the importance of biodiversity at. 
Voices for Biodiversity	109316		/users/profile/90966	zoek	Volunteer	5	04/09/2012	Izilwane reminds me everyday that this earth is a home we share with all creatures. As the species that has carved out the largest claim on the planet we have a responsibility to be good stewards, a job we often dismally fail at and sometimes rise to the challenge. Izilwane brings both to light and informs across continents the work that needs to be done. I have written articles for this non-profit that focuses on the science and politics of our threatened biodiversity, while celebrating the beauty and soul of the natural world.
Voices for Biodiversity	82483		/users/profile/90966	zoek	Volunteer	4	03/17/2011	When I first heard about Izilwane, I was puzzled by the name. It means "animals" in Zulu, with the richness of a language that ties everything in the biosphere together, the human animal included. The mission of this non-profit organization is to hold the tide of extinction before our eyes. The losses of species, traditional land-based societies, and our precious wild places may seem to be as inexorable as the tug of the moon on our watery planet, but there is hope in this call to attention. Izilwane calls us to notice what is passing before it is too late. It gives hope with the stories of research and activism that touch our deep connection to nature and remind us that in caring, we can work to boom the tide, all of us, together.  
Voices for Biodiversity	109292		/users/profile/148871	altairehtcambata	Volunteer	5	04/08/2012	Izilwane is the perfect place to engage with the nexus between people and the environment. It functions as a tremendous public service, illuminating contemporary environmental information in thorough, creative ways. I admire the mission of this nonprofit as well as the countless hours of free hard work that go into making sure it operates. I am proud to be associated with such a progressive, interdisciplinary news source that raises awareness about one of the most crucial issues of our time.
Voices for Biodiversity	109289		/users/profile/70422	kirali	Volunteer	5	04/08/2012	Izilwane is truly a remarkable online magazine. I began volunteering for Izilwane in June of 2010 and I continue to find the work rewarding and educational. Contributing to the content of the magazine and helping with outreach truly makes me feel that I am making a positive impact on the world. 
Voices for Biodiversity	64407		/users/profile/70422	kirali	Volunteer	5	02/07/2011	I first encountered Izilwane.org and Perception Inc. in June of 2010 and was immediately touched by the mission of connecting the human animal to the global ecosystem. I immediately wanted to be involved. By helping enhance the global human population's perceptions of the natural world, izilwane and Perception Inc are making a huge impact on the quest to preserve biodiversity. By sharing articles ranging from academic to personal experiences, and by sharing photos, video and interviews there is something for any individual to connect to on Izilwane.  
Voices for Biodiversity	109279		/users/profile/148852	Juliet H.	Volunteer	4	04/08/2012	Izilwane is innovative in its mission: teach the human animal how imperative all other animals (and all wildlife, for that matter) are to our ecosystem, well-being and livelihood.  Izilwane decrees that humanity is not superior to all other life on earth, but, instead, integral to the planet's welfare. With compelling photo essays, videos and articles that share how people across the planet are impacting change, Izilwane is reshaping how humans think about humanity.  
Voices for Biodiversity	109272		/users/profile/148840	thenickfreedaband	Volunteer	5	04/07/2012	Izilwane offered me the opportunity to get involved and give back to the community in ways that most 18-year-olds can't.  I don't know many peers who have had the opportunity to work with volunteers from all over the world, working to spread a positive message and contribute to global discussions.  If it weren't for this organization, I would have spent my freshman year doing "normal" things, and not getting involved with a group that's trying to make a difference.
Voices for Biodiversity	109262		/users/profile/89967	Kathryn P.	Volunteer	5	04/07/2012	I first came on board at Izilwane because of their unique perspective on conservation: instead of focusing JUST on the hard science, they attempt also to examine and evaluate humans' connections to the environment and what makes us want to protect it. They use a fascinating, multi-media platform in order to engage the general public and encourage them to participate in their discussions of conservation and our role in conservation actions. Izilwane is made up of passionate, creative individuals who each bring to the organization their unique perspectives on culture and the natural world, and I'm glad to see their reach growing far and wide! What a great group!
Voices for Biodiversity	82006		/users/profile/89967	Kathryn P.	Volunteer	5	03/11/2011	This small, brand-new online magazine approaches conservation from a completely different standpoint: rather than focusing on the science, per say (though there is plenty of it!), the writers focus on the human experience with conservation and the natural world. Instead of talking about the science of trees, they look at why human beings love trees and the culture surrounding hiking, picnics, climbing trees and other outdoor activities. Instead of talking about how the wolves fit into a great ecosystem, they talk about the cultural connections people have with wolves and the role wolves can play in the culture of tourism. It's a brilliant and new way to look at the roles we, as humans, play in conservation.
Voices for Biodiversity	108932		/users/profile/148240	Leesteffy J.	General Member of the Public	5	04/04/2012	Izilwane rocks. I "liked" them on FB because they have truly interesting articles that i often "share" with my FB friends. Izilwane keeps me educated and up to date about animal/human/environmental issues.  I learn things that i wouldn't learn otherwise, and i really appreciate that. Hope they are able to continue to offer such a great service to the public. 
Voices for Biodiversity	108830		/users/profile/148116	Brian28	General Member of the Public	5	04/03/2012	Izilwane is bringing much needed information to the public, via articles and awareness.

Voices for Biodiversity	84693		/users/profile/93991	Anne Johnson	General Member of the Public	5	04/02/2011	I am grateful to the volunteers who bring this "ezine" to me. I wish it were mandatory reading for all schools for IZILWANE  is a way to help people reconnect with nature. Our world is in a difficult place and IZILWANE has articles that help us see our interrelatedness with all living things and the importance of learning to live with all living things. Reading this "ezine" has strengthened my resolve to live in ways that help the environment.  I am using my own bag and bottles when shopping, use cloth garbage bags that I can wash after emptying them, planting a garden organically, buying all organic produce. Now I am trying to buy a car that gets better gas mileage. I am planting more plants that attract animals and birds also. IZILWANE has strengthened my resolve to talk to the local stores about stopping using plastic bags which I will be discussing with the local ecology board this week.

Voices for Biodiversity	83382		/users/profile/92351	DevD	Volunteer	5	03/27/2011	The best thing that made me want to volunteer for Izilwane were the people who have made this non-profit such a great place of interaction, ideas around bid-diversity and the blinding passion that each one of them exhibits to grow the place into a community of like minded people who are all working towards one common goal. Bring about a positive change, Be it Tara's unwavering passion and hard work or the entire team's commitment to the vision and mission that Izilwane stands for today, it is an amazing feat that in such a short time, the team has grown beyond borders from New Mexico to Bangalore with a plethora of talented professionals who have come forward on their own to make a dream come true. A dream to build a better world... a more sustainable world And they all believed in this dream because they became a part of it....and made Izilwane a part of their lives. Izilwane  values its human capital to bring about a change in this world. The work ethic is no less than that of a centre of excellence but unlike  research centres, here people do it for the simple reason;  They want to make this work..they live the ideals the organisation stands for In age Izilwane is much younger to many great established non profit organizations, but in pride, passion and focus, to me they rank right there at the very top

Voices for Biodiversity	82895		/users/profile/91670	ppebsworth	Volunteer	5	03/22/2011	In 2009 I was introduced to Izilwane.  At that time the organization was Tara Lumpkin.  Her enthusiasm and conviction to education the public on issues relating to loss of biodiversity, living sustainable, protecting and recovering wild spaces was (and remains) palpable.  It is rare to find someone with this level of conviction and commitment. Over the past two years the organization has morphed and Izilwane has developed its own identity.  The organization has grown and the passion that Tara feels has attracted many like-minded people.  Izilwane is doing a fabulous job of providing the public at large with information on the state of the Earth and challenges people to become involved in the process of protecting our precious resources and living less species-centric.    
Voices for Biodiversity	82871		/users/profile/91632	JimB	Donor	5	03/22/2011	Izilwane has such a unique, cross-discipline take on ecology and conservation. The articles on the Web site are fascinating and informative.  The report on the study of zoo patrons is one great example.

While researching how I could contribute, I found a lot of information on organizations focusing on conservation, biodiversity, and sustainability but really wanted to lead my efforts to an outlet that was also involved in the cause. This is how I discovered Izilwane. Editor in Chief Tara Lumpkin was looking for a managing editor and our conversations lead to forging a long distance professional relationship. For the next four months, I worked with Tara on the redesign of the site, the functionality, content management, and submission guidelines. I continue to keep abreast of Izilwane's work and intend for our affiliation to grow
Voices for Biodiversity	68937		/users/profile/75327	Jack	Volunteer	5	02/15/2011	Izilwane is an excellent organization that coordinates efforts of conservationists from a broad range of disciplines. It provides a place for anthropology in the world of biodiversity and provides a new perspective on a topic that was previously dominated by biologists. Izilwanes aim to connect individuals to the issue of biodiversity through broadening their perspectives is a model strategy for all conservation organizations especially those that deal with public relations.
Voices for Biodiversity	68178		/users/profile/74494	Jami W.	Volunteer	5	02/14/2011	I seemed to become a bit of a black sheep in my graduate department as I began to discuss my plans to study wolves from an anthropological perspective. People would jokingly point down the hall telling me that the wildlife biologists were that way while they silently wondered how I was going to study wolves under the discipline of Anthropology. I knew that my research would make sense once it became clearer and I was able to better explain the concept.  It was from my German Shepard, Trooper, that I was shown how significantly people's reactions to him vary, while he remains the same. The human is never asked to adapt, or even look at their reaction to the animal, it is the animal that must adapt to humans. As my research took shape and I argued that conflicts surrounding wolves were more often conflicts between groups of people about wolves than actual conflicts between wolves and people, my research was acknowledged as legitimate and important, even published. Not surprisingly, my search for jobs was discouraging and I wondered where I was going to be able to apply what I thought to be very important knowledge regarding our human relationship with animals. Then I found an ad in High Country News for Izilwane. It was unbelievable how perfect it was; studying loss of biodiversity from an anthropological perspective was right up my alley.  I've been an integral part of this dynamic, intelligent, motivated team ever since. The fact that we are all volunteers makes our participation an ongoing choice, continually strengthening our level of commitment to a cause that we all feel is necessary and long overdue.  I am very grateful for my involvement with this professional, well-run, amazingly organized,  non-profit organization
Voices for Biodiversity	36916	5	/users/profile/37681	judithc	General Member of the Public	5	04/25/2010	I learned about Izilwane in the summer of 2009 and was immediately struck by the concept of relating to the animal kingdom as a co-habitant rather than as a member of the separate and supposedly superior kingdom of Man (re the medieval the Kingdoms of Plants, Animals, and Man).  With a national forest for my front yard, I had frequent and daily opportunities to be in proximity to elk, deer, coyotes, birds, and rodents, and enjoyed the beauty and charm of their wild and non-imposing company.  When I adopted a dog that Fall, however, I began to think about my relationship with other animals at a much more personal level.  Izilwane was a key element in my growing awareness.  The numerous stories that were shared among the staff were both inspiring and informative, and my interest in experiencing my own animal nature more directly as well as expanding my ability to relate to another animal species became a new adventure.  At this point, I am most struck by the simple awareness of a clearly evident consciousness that is capable of communicating its non-human self.

Through education and research they are highlighting these similarities so that we may co-exist and thus secure the future of our planet.
Voices for Biodiversity	36085	6	/users/profile/36876	james9	Volunteer	5	04/17/2010	Izilwane is a very inspiring organization and I look forward to the positive impact it can have on our planet. While being involved in Izilwane, I have learned about how we, as human beings, perceive our environment and what we can do to shift our perception to be more united with the entire ecosystem.
Voices for Biodiversity	35912	6	/users/profile/36702	phillip1g	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/15/2010	It is an organization based on a unique vision for protecting the planet's ecosystem. The talents and enthusiasm of the people involved with running the project give it a dynamism that is impressive. And the range of people excited by the concept, as evidenced by the followers on Facebook and the Izilwane website, is encouraging at such an early stage in the organization's development. This is an important idea backed by innovative ideas and innovative thinkers.

This is a necessary aspect for the survival of the planet. They are in hope that with the launch of their new online magazine that they can reach a large audience and spread this message around the globe. I have enjoyed learning many things regarding these topics over the last few months and am glad to be able to help get this message across through my involvement with the project.
Voices for Biodiversity	35747	5	/users/profile/36550	john19	Volunteer	5	04/14/2010	Izilwane is a nonprofit that is educating the public on the importance of the connection between humans and animals. Day to day, we continue to ignore the decrease in biodiversity and the enormous impacts that human population has on the other inhabitants of the Earth. Izilwane provides the understanding of the connection we have with global ecosystems. This organization is increasing awareness which will help develop more solutions to deforestation and extinction. This is shown through explorers notes from the field and research about the connection between humans and other species. Every biotic and abiotic organism plays a related role in its ecosystem.
Voices for Biodiversity	35591	5	/users/profile/36416	sophierane	Volunteer	5	04/12/2010	My experience with Perception International has been wonderful so far.  I work as part of a time dedicated to launching the Izilwane online magazine, an effort to document human-animal relationships and help humans understand their role in the global ecosystem.  What I love about the vision for the project is the sense of connection it fosters, as we have been working on collecting notes from the field from people all over the world with all different levels of experience.
Voices for Biodiversity	35544	5	/users/profile/36365	morgan3	Volunteer	5	04/12/2010	In working for this organization, Ive become more aware of how each species plays an important role in the ecosystem. Also, Ive learned more about how each human beings carbon footprint can damage the environment and reduce the number of species on the planet. Id been previously unaware of the Sixth Great Extinction and now, having been introduced to this concept, Ive been surprised at how many species are dying every day. Also, Ive been trying to educate other people to make them more aware of how much harm we are doing and to realize that, armed with this knowledge, we can stop the loss of biodiversity. My work on the interactive magazine aspect of this organization allowed me to see that even a simple story, such as one about a woman rescuing baby rabbits, illustrates that almost all of us interact with other species and that we are all a part of a larger global ecosystem.
Voices for Biodiversity	35471	6	/users/profile/36300	epotent	Former Volunteer	5	04/11/2010	I love this organization! Perception Inc is a unique non-profit with a mission that is both subtle and critical to our own survival. It is not a tangible thing to alter the perception of a single individual or even the masses- but for us to change our behavior and our relationships with the natural world, we must first have access to new ways of thinking about it and our role in it. Personally, Perception Inc and it's Izilwane project continue to provide that for me! It's not a concept that, once gotten, can be set aside and moved past. It's a concept that continues to evolve in a personal way and changes how I see myself and how I act! However, this project is badly underfunded! It could benefit hugely from money to not only get the word out but to provide us with a variety of experiences and examples to draw on. We can't change the world without changing ourselves; this is an education, people!! Please help this cause to help us all.
Voices for Biodiversity	25822	6	/users/profile/26828	Tara	Board Member	5	01/19/2010	PERCEPTION INTERNATIONAL promotes perceptual diversity worldwide. The organization is dedicated to the concept that, just as biodiversity is necessary for the survival of the environment, different ways of perceiving reality are essential for the survival of the human species and, in turn, other species. This is referred to as perceptual diversity.Perception posits that loss of perceptual diversity, biodiversity, and cultural diversity, are interrelated and that current narrow ways of perceiving contribute to the destruction of other species and the environment. The organization states that perceiving reality through many different perspectives allows human beings to better understand, interact with, and develop a closer relationship with other species, nature, and the universe as a whole. It also proposes that this approach can lead human beings to a higher degree of adaptability and evolutionary consciousness.PERCEPTION INTERNATIONALs mission is to explore, research, document, and educate the public about perceptual diversityhow human beings' perceptions shape the way humans view the world and the way people interact with each other, nature, and the universe. The organization seeks to provide new perspectives on these issues and their inter-relationships.Perception's areas of interest are: (a) The relationships between human beings, animals, and nature (anthrozooecology), (b) The relationships between perceptual constructs, (c) Indigenous knowledge and traditional healing, (d) Dissemination of the perceptions of a variety of people and cultures, (e) Protection of biodiversity, (f) Community conservation, (g) Sustainable global human population, (h) Reduction of the human footprint on planet earth, (i) Communication between human beings, animals, and nature.

They are a group of highly engaged individuals who are making big strides in the local community by giving the gift of reading to adults.  One young woman was able to acquire her GED and continue with her studies which was bound to be passed along to her  children.

I watched my learner progress from reading at a second grade level to reading at a fifth grade level. When he was able to go to the doctor's office and fill out the paperwork without assistance, he felt enormous pride and accomplishment. And as his tutor, I felt very happy for and proud of him.

My learner and I owe much of his success to the tremendous support system created by Reading Works.  Their training sessions for tutors are interesting and extremely helpful.  They provide an excellent array of teaching materials and workshops, and they are always coming up with new and interesting ways to help our learners in their quest for literacy.  I would not be able to be an effective tutor without them!

Reading Works provides a caring environment, free from judgment, allowing students to meet their literacy goals. The one-on-one tutoring sessions provide personalized instruction, which is a large part of both the students' and Reading Works' success. Each benchmark that students achieve enhances their contribution to their familial, economic, and social responsibilities. This has a dynamic effect, which is becoming apparent within the community they serve.

Parents who cannot read and write at a level above their children aren't able to support their child's learning, have trouble connecting with teachers regarding their child's education, and frequently miss out on crucial communications from the school.

It is a professionally run organization with both the needs of the students and of the tutors  in mind.  RW leadership also focuses on reaching out to the community and to other agencies and organizations with related missions to better leverage limited resources. The initial training I received, the frequent tutor workshops, and  the resource materials available help me provide better help for my student.  I can't say enough about the students who work so hard to improve their reading and writing ability.

Reading Works serves a very critical and urgent need in the community, particularly given the importance of literacy and education in this difficult job market. The organization is well run on a very limited budget. The importance of funding and maintaining the facility on Anderson St. SE cannot be emphasized enough. Personally I find it a safe and convenient place to meet for tutoring. One key benefit of tutoring at the Reading Works office is accessibility to readily available resources, e.g.,   expertise, computers, books and other teaching materials.

When we have more literate individuals in our community, and more with their GED or more who have become fluent in English, we have a richer and stronger community.  The lives of our volunteer tutors have also become richer through the opportunity to give back what others have so generously given us.

Reading Works provides generous support to volunteers and learners alike: For the tutors, in addition to a wide variety of teaching materials, it offers regular workshops and even individual advice when needed.  For ESL students Reading Works hosts conversation groups to give them an opportunity to practice their new language skills.  Learners on the waiting list for a regular tutor are provided interim tutoring to get the process started and to avoid the discouragement learners may feel while they're waiting for a permanent asignment.

Although I expected to only work with a couple of students, my involvement has grown.  I have been tutoring an Intermediate group of 10-12 parents at a local middle school and helping support two other volunteers at the same school.  In the last 11 months, our one site has grown from 6 total students to 20 students and a waiting list.  During this time, Reading Works has supported the other tutors and me unconditionally and is constantly recruiting students who need our services.   Any time I have asked if I could do something new, the answer is always "Of course!  Let us know how it works!" This is an amazing organization which changes the lives of real people.

Reading Works helps provide solutions to this seemingly insurmountable problem by providing tutors, reading materials, valuable resources and a committed, wonderful staff for those in need.  It not only assists learners, but provides great support and training to the tutors.

Since then I have worked with three different students, all immigrants from the Middle East or northern Africa. All are hard-working, extremely motivated young men with an intense desire to learn.

Reading Works Inc	140085		/users/profile/186248	mdiamond1225	Volunteer	5	11/15/2012	I have been a Reading Works tutor for almost 2 years.  Throughout my entire life, I have been an avid reader and writer, embracing these skills as "core blessings."  Whenever I consider illiteracy - - a huge disadvantage for so many across the world - - I have an urgent wish to help.  That wish became a reality for me once I retired from my 46-year career as an RN.  My very first retirement "project" was to join the Volunteer Program at Reading Works.  The 16+ hours of Orientation blew me away with its breadth and depth.  I learned so much.  Next came my acquaintance with Reading Works' staff, truly a remarkably dedicated and ever-supportive group.  As I began with my first student (a bright and highly  educated man from Kurdistan), I discovered the wealth of teaching tools that Reading Works has compiled, a library just bursting with helpful resources.  Currently, I am working with a Vietnamese learner, a woman whose over-arching goal has been to become a U.S. citizen.  For this, she's needed to improve all of her literacy skills and prepare for her Citizenship examinations, both oral and written.  Yesterday, she passed with flying colors!  During my tenure as a tutor, I've watched with awe the commitment and hard work of Reading Works' administration.  This is a tightly-run ship, every day a productive and successful contribution to the community.  Reading Works deserves every shred of assistance possible.
Reading Works Inc	140047		/users/profile/186203	martyfarmer45	Volunteer	5	11/15/2012	I have been with Reading Works since 2008 as a board member, tutor, and project leader.  I am so pleased to be working with highly talented and devoted tutors who so generously share their talents with people wanting to change their lives by improving their literacy skills.  As a tutor, I am always learning more about the subject we are studying and love the thrill of seeing a breakthrough in a person's understanding!  That is the payoff for me!  Plus, the friendships I have with my students enrich my life.  The Board is unique because they are actively involved with the program rather than just a board that sets policy or raises money.  Because we do not have an agency housing us, the challenges of raising money and seeing that our community-based program keeps improving in innovative ways keeps their involvement high.  Our office is used for training and for tutoring, has a good library for our tutors, and is located in a neighborhood that we think may find our services useful.  Our board president, a founder,  has vision and high energy so she keeps moving us along.  With the literacy levels so low in a great percentage of our citizens, the need is great, but we are working to get our name out and to increase our contribution to our city.  I am so glad to be involved with this pioneering group in Albuquerque.
Reading Works Inc	140017		/users/profile/186171	ailchubb	Volunteer	5	11/15/2012	I started doing GED math tutoring with Reading Works in September of this year. Thank goodness for the RW scanner; now all my handouts are on a memory stick. I am particularly happy to have a math tutoring connection to the people of DVRC via Reading Works. It is my way of investing in the community here.
Reading Works Inc	130964		/users/profile/176485	inashkeimages	Donor	5	10/30/2012	Reading Works serves the community with a program that directly assists non-literate adults. One of the most fundamental and necessary skills required in our society today is literacy. So many of us take this skill for granted, yet the statistics on the number of adults unable to read and write are truly startling. I am impressed by the many dedicated tutors who work selflessly to teach reading and writing. I am equally impressed by the clients that work so hard to acquire these skills. It is a privilege to be part of something that can so profoundly impact the quality of a human being's life.

We came in to visit & were asked if we minded sharing a review of our experience with AH. Happy to. We come here for family time even when we are not looking for a dog, just to show our kids how they can help others in need. It's a great place to visit, to adopt, and talk to the great staff and volunteers. They've come a long way in making the shelter awesome. 
Animal Humane New Mexico	309845		/users/profile/401197	manglais	Donor	5	10/11/2016	My wife and I started giving to Animal Humane New Mexico in 2016 after visiting the shelter. We were blown away by the growth of their footprint and the serenity & joy of meeting the cats and dogs. The cats have their own luxury quarters - so private and serene from all the dog activity. You will definitely not walk away feeling sad or stressed in finding your perfect new animal. 
Animal Humane New Mexico	275159	2	/users/profile/364737	cocker-owner	Donor	5	12/30/2015	I am a dog owner as I have four dogs(3 Cocker Spaniels & 1 Basset mix) and I consider them to be my four legged children. I have used Animal Humanes health Clinic to get one of my Cockers fixed as well as operated on for a hernia on her stomach. Not only did I get exceptional service but the dedication of the medical staff on taking care of my Baby Girl made me believe in Animal Humane. I recently donated a SUV to Animal Humane for their Fund raising. I wish I could donate working there at Animal Humane but my health does not allow me to do this. The facility at Animal Humane is for the well being of the animals which are cared for there. People who are looking for a new adoption can be assured the animals are very well taken care of and will be ready to be adopted. THIS ANIMAL RESCUE IS A NO KILL FACILITY AND I WISH PEOPLE WHO GIVE UP THEIR ANIMALS WOULD TAKE THEM TO ANIMAL HUMANE(pay the fee) SO THEIR DOGS OR CATS WOULD HAVE THE BEST CHANCE TO BE ADOPTED. THATS THE LEAST YOU CAN DO FOR THE ANIMAL YOU ARE JUST ACTUALLY DUMPING BECAUSE CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW SCARED THEY ARE WHEN YOU LEAVE THEM. IF YOU HAVE ANY FEELINGS YOU NEED TO DO WHATS BEST FOR THEM AS THEY ARE YOUR RESPONSIBILITY. ANIMAL HUMANE IS A GODS SEND AS THEY ARE DEDICATED ORGANIZATION TO SEE UNWANTED ANIMALS ARE TAKEN CARE OF IN WAYS. PLEASE DONATE TO THIS FACILITY BECAUSE THEY REALLY DO AN EXCEPTIONAL JOB IN THE CARE OF THE ANIMALS THEY ARE TRUSTED WITH. I BELIEVE IN THEM 100%! THANK YOU JOE CARRASCO
Animal Humane New Mexico	172344	4	/users/profile/228098	Tammy50	Volunteer	5	09/29/2013	I need to comment on Linda Lou Funky Finds comment.  I volunteer at the Animal Humane center and Retail Store. I can't believe she thinks the prices on the furniture and clothing are high. Hello!!!!!! The money raised at this store goes to save animals, provide low cost vet medical care to low income families, get loving animals adopted to new homes etc.... not  a 'profit' in the same sense as her store.  I feel her comments were simply to get people to come to her store instead. Why else would she make such a comment. 
Animal Humane New Mexico	166799	3	/users/profile/221599	Linda Lou Funky Finds	Donor	1	09/03/2013	I am a small business owner of a re-sale shop in Alb., and I use to shop at the Animal Humane Thrift store on Menaul.I would get such a good deal on everything there.I then would donate 5% of my monthly profits to the Animal Humane Center. The store recently changed its policies. The prices on their furniture are now double what they should be,the clothes are three times the price. They are now just another over priced junk store. I was told they have a new manager, and she has decided to make more profit. Unfortunately I can no longer shop there,and my donations are few.

Animal Humane New Mexico	48612	2	/users/profile/49733	vegan-man	Donor	5	07/23/2010	I was anticipating just to meet Donna Stumpf but instead was given the royal tour of the entire facility and wow, and what a facility the AHANM is!  The facility supports animals lives in ways that I did not even imagine a facility could.  For example, the facilty has a walking area that trains dogs to be obedient so that their chances of adoption are improved. On the day of my tour, this area was staffed with volunteers!  Additionally, I was duly impressed with the cathouse where felines could climb onto different stairs and look out of windows, while staring at trees that contain birds!  The AHANM has too many beautiful components to list, many of which are staffed by volunteers.  The AHANM facility in Abq. is truly a wonderful place for its clients, the animals that have been placed in its care.
Animal Humane New Mexico	104873	2	/users/profile/140743	Elisabeth Jennings	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/29/2012	Animal Humane-New Mexico has become a leader in the sheltering field in New Mexico and the region. Recent important initiatives include Meet Your Match adoption approaches to ensure animals and their guardians are well suited for one another, humane dog training, impressive upgrades to the physical shelter, agility training for high-energy dogs, an ambitious "street cat" program, a desperately needed veterinary care program for the animals of indigent individuals, an off-site adoption facility, and increased foster capacity. AH-NM, its talented staff and ambitious programs that are making a difference for New Mexico's animals should serve as a model for other shelters throughout the state. 
Animal Humane New Mexico	104829	1	/users/profile/140676	LongLeash	Board Member	5	01/28/2012	My experience with Animal Humane New Mexico (AHNM) spans back five years.  During that time, it is impressive to review the positive evolution of this organization.  Lead by a dynamic Executive Director, it seems as no task is too monumental.  What strikes me the most is the multi-faceted approach that AHNM takes to accomplish their lofty goals;  innovative tactics to achieve record-breaking adoptions, low cost spay/neuter programs, microchipping and vaccinating pre-owned pets, foster care for special needs animals, responsible pet parenting classes for students, cat adoptions via local businesses, humane dog training and agility classes, state conferences that address all aspects shelter operations and large-scale public events like Doggie Dash & Dawdle.   The list goes on.  These remarkable accomplishments are made possible by the dedicated management, staff and amazingly tireless volunteers.  And just who benefits from these endeavors?  All of us, but especially those animals in the shelter still looking for their forever home. Being a local pet supply business owner, we started as a partner with AHNM on a variety of events and occasionally via monetary contributions.  Over time, we observed the tremendous value AHNM brings to the New Mexico community and thus augmented our support to the point of becoming a sponsor for their outdoor training area/agility field.  As part of this collaboration, we offer free scholarships to select new pet parents who wish to enroll in a free six-week positive training class at AHNM.  For the AHNM shelter dogs, some on our favorite activities include the daily enrichment programs.  These programs should be a model for the rest of our shelter operations here in New Mexico.   Recently, I began serving as a board member with Animal Humane New Mexico.  I am excited to participate in one of our states leading shelters, both in standards and by the numbers.  It is an honor to be involved with an organization that gets things done by knowing how to walk the walk.   
Animal Humane New Mexico	104635	1	/users/profile/140340	ecwdvm	Board Member	5	01/26/2012	I have been a board member with Animal Humane New Mexico for about the last 2 years.  During that time, I have been impressed time and time again with the quality of the volunteers and staff, the knowledge and passion exhibited by the executive director, and the care and thoughtfulness with which all decisions are approached by the officers and the rest of the board.  As a veterinarian, I have worked with many rescue groups over the years, and AHNM is unquestionably the most well-run I have come across.  I am proud to be associated with this organization, and to be a small part of all of the good it does in our state.
Animal Humane New Mexico	104488		/users/profile/137620	pamnichols	Volunteer	4	01/25/2012	I have been a volunteer at Animal Humane NM since 2007. I have volunteered in adoptions, the clinic, marketing, mobiles and dogwalker. There has been great growth and improvements since I began. I have found all staff to be professional, dedicated and motivated to provide the best care and best "forever" homes as humanily possible. I read the negative review below and I have to say I am unaware of what this individual is saying. While there is always room for improvements, I believe that Animal Humane NM strives to be the best shelter. The staff are always looking at other shelters and how they have made changes and improvements for the animals they care for and the community they serve. Keep up the great work.
Animal Humane New Mexico	103740		/users/profile/138809	Jaynesage	Client Served	5	01/18/2012	We volunteer for a non-profit, New Mexico Animal Friends, that works in collaboration with Animal Humane and The City of Albuquerque to spay & neuter feral cats for the trap, neuter return program. Animal Humane has led the way for this program to grow by securing funding and providing surgeries for this program. They have been receptive to our needs for daily surgeries and provided our organization, without charge, the space to hold it's own monthly clinic. Animal Humane is truly a leader in both the Trap, Neuter & Return program and the spay & neuter of owned cats to help humanely reduce the over-population of cats in New Mexico.
Animal Humane New Mexico	103692		/users/profile/138730	Jeff N.

I have found an openness to the sharing of research-based behavior management. This is critically important not only to the lives of pets and those who love them but in keeping adopted pets with their families. I have been delighted with my experience with the staff at all levels of Animal Humane.   Jeff Nichol, DVM
Animal Humane New Mexico	103578		/users/profile/138487	prachu.s	Volunteer	4	01/17/2012	Animal Humane New Mexico is undoubtedly a wonderful organization. I have been volunteering with them for the past three and a half years and have always had a wonderful experience in every department I worked with. They have dedicated staffs who work tirelessly to improve the lives of the shelter pets.  I am glad to see the improvements they have made to the facility in the past few years. The dog parks and the cat house are a few of the improvements that I love and it has a very inviting environment. I work with high energy dogs and they seem to love the park and also the agility equipment. It gives the dogs an opportunity to learn new things and learn to work with you. The cat house is a great addition to the facility because it gives the public a chance to spend some quality time with the cat before they decide to adopt him/her.  As a foster parent, I would like to say that they have a great foster care program that provides help for orphaned puppies and kittens, recuperating pets, and dogs and cats that need socializing.  I am humbled to be a part of this organization and will continue to support them in anyway possible.
Animal Humane New Mexico	103515		/users/profile/111258	NP Wilkins	Volunteer	5	01/16/2012	Based on my long association with Animal Humane I felt compelled to offer an alternative perspective to the recent post by a former Animal Humane employee/volunteer.I am an active volunteer for Animal Humane and in the past 20+ years have served in a variety of capacities for the organizationvolunteer HR consultant, board member and President, Interim ED, adopter and donor.  I have witnessed positive and negative changes in that period which have impacted the care of the animals and the number of adoptions and euthanasia.  The most dramatic positive changes have taken place in the last five years, subsequent to the hiring of Peggy Weigle, the Executive Director.  Since her arrival she has never wavered in her efforts to improve the well-being of the animals, increase adoptions and reduce euthanasia.  She challenges staff and volunteers to come up with new ideas to improve these areas and encourages departments to establish and meet goals in the best interests of the animals.  Positive changes in these areas have brought about improved conditions/morale for staff and volunteers and reduced turnover of both.  As a result donations and funding have increased, along with community support that further Animal Humanes good work.Animal Humanes ever growing foster program is only one of many programs that address the health and behavior of animals and reduce euthanasia (others mentioned in Peggys post).  Puppies and kittens (1,380 in 2010), too young or sick to survive in a shelter environment, were placed in foster homes, along with many adult animals recovering from injuries, surgery, medical conditions or behavioral issues.  In 2012 the new Foster2Home program will address the needs of more adult animals with longer term medical, stress related or behavioral issues through off site adoptions.  The result will hopefully be less euthanasia of more problematic animals, who in the past may not have been adoptable. This program not only gives these animals more one on one care, training, and potential for adoption, but also increases the shelters ability to take in more animals and find them forever homes.  During times when we may get too many animals all at once, e-mails and phone calls go out to foster and volunteer networks, calling for temporary fosters so that euthanasia does not become the solution to the problem.Under the guidance of Peggy Weigle, Animal Humane has become a role model for all shelters in New Mexico.   In addition to the many improvements at Animal Humane, she encourages collaboration among various animal organizations that reduces over population through spaying and neutering and education, all of which address the issue of reducing the need to euthanize.  Read Animal Humanes Annual Report and learn about all their wonderful programs and progress and come visit the main campus and satellites anytime.  A picture is worth a thousand words.  Talk to Peggy and hear her vision for improving the lives of homeless dogs and cats.  You will have no doubts as to her commitment, sincerity, integrity and passion for quality work on behalf of homeless companion animals and Animal Humane.
Animal Humane New Mexico	95740		/users/profile/111258	NP Wilkins	Volunteer	5	08/15/2011	As a former board member and President, foster parent, adopter, donor, and volunteer since 1972,  I have seen an amazing transformation of Animal Humane.  The keys to Animals Humanes great success are the wonderful staff, board and volunteers who team together for the benefit of the animals and our community.  They are kind, caring, and knowledgeable and receive the necessary ongoing training to do their jobs well. The main campus and satellite adoption sites are first classinnovative, cheerful, clean, and well maintained. The focus is on the animals well-being from the time they may enter foster care, to where they are housed, to where they play, to their health care; to the activities and training they are offered to enhance their behavior so their next stop is a Forever Home.   You cant help be impressed with the full service veterinary clinic that serves the shelters animals, other animal rescue groups and provides low cost services to folks with lower incomes.  Spaying & neutering and reducing the overpopulation of animals is a #1 goal, with 10,000 spays & neuters in 2010.    Animal Humane is also the state coordinator for SPAYNM, a statewide clearing house for low-cost spay/neuter resources.  Animal Humane is one stop shopping for all your animal needs before and after adoptioneducation on breeds & who meets your needs through our Meet Your Match and Meet & Greet programs; real life day to day photos and stories about the animals on the web site and kennel cards to help you get acquainted;  resources for caring for your new pets; counseling on behavior issues; behavior training classes; products, advice and resources that address the nutritional, exercise, physical and emotional needs of you & your pet.  I am proud to be associated with this well-organized, financially sound, business with heart! It is a great place to make a positive difference for animals and people.
Animal Humane New Mexico	102727		/users/profile/135396	kenthompson60	Board Member	5	12/30/2011	My relationship with Animal Humane New Mexico extends back to mid-nineties, when we adopted two dogs and became donors.  I have served on the board for the past five years, and as board president in 2011.  There was a negative review written on this site a few months ago, and I write partially in response to that, but also feel compelled to write simply out of support for the organization.  The factual errors in the negative review were addressed by our Executive Director, Peggy Weigle, and I further extend her offer to visit the facility at any time to learn more about the operation.  As a board member, with an ethical and fiscal duty to the companion animals, the organization itself, and the communities we serve, I am very proud of our practices and our transparency.    I can say with great confidence that the public face of Animal Humane is in complete alignment with its mission and its day-to-day operations.  I believe a very real testament to this consistency is continued and increasing donor and volunteer support.  Our volunteer numbers have grown to something in the neighborhood of 400 people with more than 50 new applicants being reviewed each month.  Another indicator of the soundness and humaneness of the organization is this very large number of dog and cat lovers who routinely observe and participate in the day to day activity of the organization.   
Animal Humane New Mexico	102486		/users/profile/133735	renad	General Member of the Public	5	12/19/2011	Having spent many years volunteering in various animal welfare capacities, I can say with confidence that Animal Humane New Mexico is a standout private non-profit shelter. This is not easy work by any means. It is emotionally fraught, and tough decisions always have to be made. But I know of no other organization in the state whose staff and volunteers are as knowledgeable and dedicated to animal welfare as those who work at Animal Humane New Mexico. The organization has no doubt blossomed under Peggy Weigle's executive directorship. Thanks to her leadership, a progressive board, and the excellence of her staff, the organization has attracted a cadre of volunteers who help with animal exercise and socialization, implemented a cutting edge behavioral department, and regularly sponsors innovative and fun off-site adoption events that successfully rally the community. It's also the only shelter I know of that utilizes Meet Your Match in the adoption process and offers post adoption puppy and adult training classes. All in all, a model shelter and a model adoption program.
Animal Humane New Mexico	100318	1	/users/profile/121849	PeggyW	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/05/2011	From Peggy Weigle, Executive Director, Animal Humane | New Mexico  There are too many erroneous statements regarding our operations to let the post below stand without a response.  Since 2007, under my leadership as Executive Director of Animal Humane | New Mexico, we have demonstrated a consistent progression towards reducing euthanasia, so I take strong exception to the claims made in this posting.  I invite all readers to review these numbers and our progress in saving companion animals lives and let you decide for yourself how we are conducting our services for homeless animals.  In 2006, Animal Humane euthanized 1,424, or 27% of the animals sheltered that year.  This included many healthy animals, euthanized for age, color, or length of stay.  This was the state of affairs when I arrived as Executive Director in September 2006.  Starting in 2007, we began setting goals to both increase adoptions while at the same time reducing euthanasia.  In just one year, euthanasia was down to 935 animals or 17% of intakes, a reduction of 34%. We invested in a mobile adoption vehicle to further increase adoptions, thereby saving more lives.  By the end of 2009, euthanasias were down by 55% to 644 or 13% of intakes. Of those 644, only 72 were healthy pets, so we realized the goal of adopting 100% of healthy pets was within reach.   To achieve this goal, Animal Humanes Board of Directors authorized more investments to save lives.  We opened a new adoption center at 9032 Montgomery Blvd. NE and later that year, opened a third adoption center in Corrales.  These two centers accounted for an additional 1,300 adoptions in 2010.  Thanks to those investments, and other programs which I will describe shortly, as of this writing, we have achieved 100% adoption of healthy pets and have maintained that achievement for 22 consecutive months.  In fact, so far this year, our euthanasia rate is running 45% below 2010 numbers and is at only 10% of total intakes.  We feel this is quite an accomplishment from our 27% rate in 2007.  With that said, we will not be satisfied until 100% of all healthy and behaviorally/medically treatable pets are adopted at our facility.  While it is true that sometimes dogs are euthanized for kennel cough and cats for upper respiratory infections (URI), it is because the animal is not responding to treatment.   Often these pets have been in treatment more than once, twice, even three times before we make the painful decision to euthanize.  It is never done for space.  These are the animals whose immune systems are compromised.  We continue to improve our sanitation and handling protocols to reduce the spread of disease.  A case in point; at the beginning of 2011, we began a concerted effort to reduce stress in our cat population, stress being the major contributing factor to cats becoming ill with URI.  The incidence of URI in our cat population is down from 50% to only 10% of total cat intakes.  The even better news is only 6% of those with URI have had to be euthanized this year compared to 34% the previous year.  So I challenge the notion we are euthanizing cats and dogs with URI and kennel cough for space.   The post also cites our May 2011 intake numbers being greater than our adoption numbers as proof we are euthanizing for space.  Yes, we took in 482 animals and adopted only 355 in May.  However, our animal holding capacity far exceeds the intake number.  At any given time, we have the capacity to house at least 400 animals.  We have 195 cages/kennels at our Main campus, plus 40 additional spaces at our two adoption centers totaling 235.  In many cases, kennels had litters of puppies so the capacity was closer to 255.  In addition, last May we had 146 animals in foster care for a total capacity on a given day of 400.  With that much capacity and our goal to save every healthy pet, why would we euthanize for space?  Further, since the creation of our behavior department on my watch, we have rehabilitated countless behaviorally challenged dogs and cats that have gone to successful new lives.  And, thanks to our free Behavior Helpline and Meet-Your-Match programs, our return rate in contrast to the number stated in the post is a mere 6%, well below the national average of 10%.   We have been tracking all these numbers in detail since 2007 and will happily make them available to anyone who wishes to review them.  Our policy and practice regarding surgeries is that animals must remain on campus at least 24 hours after their surgery.  From time to time, incisions can open up if an animal licks the surgery site or becomes too active.  With over 8,500 surgeries performed each year, some animals will suffer post surgical complications.  We track fatalities and our results are comparable to the best private veterinary practices.  That said, we strive to have no post-surgical complications and routinely examine and modify our protocols to achieve that goal. And finally, yes we are planning to renovate the campus.  Why?  To improve the housing for the homeless pets we serve.  The goal of this project is to create housing that is equally excellent for every dog and cat on campus, regardless of whether they are available for adoption , in treatment, quarantine, or in stray holding.  The reality is our current facility, which includes buildings that are 30 years old, does not provide a supportive, stress-free environment for every pet.  That is why we plan to upgrade our facilities.  Our model is to provide housing that is equal to the quality of our Robbie Jones Memorial Cat House.  Better housing means happier, healthier animals and a more welcoming campus for the adopting public.  This investment is indeed an investment in animal care.   I thank anyone who has read this far and invite you to come visit our campus, unannounced, to see the care and quality of our work and our commitment to saving animals. 
Animal Humane New Mexico	99871	1	/users/profile/121234	Scoutdog Kerberos	Volunteer	1	10/27/2011	I volunteered at AHNM for over 3 years, and I was an employee for several months. The animals do receive excellent care, and the volunteers are absolutely wonderful. The staff that actually work with the animals and care for them are all fantastic and they truly care for and love these animals. That being said, the higher ups (which includes the director, Peggy Weigle) aren't being completely honest in what they tell the media and the public. AHNM recently proclaimed that they adopted out "100% of their healthy animals", which is true...to a point. Many times animals were euthanized for space, and were listed in the computer system and on file as being euthanized for a common illness (kennel cough for dogs, upper respiratory infections for cats). When confronted about the falsifying of the records, Peggy denied the allegations and said that those animals were euthanized for health reasons. When the employees who actually euthanized the animals were asked about it, they were confused as to why Peggy was saying that, as the animals who were euthanized and listed as being unhealthy did not show any signs of illness and were in fact euthanized for space. Again, when Peggy was confronted with the allegations, she denied it and several employees (including myself) ended up leaving because she refused to tell the truth in order to maintain AHNM's "good image". I still keep in contact with several employees and volunteers there, and the news isn't good. Peggy is still telling the media and the public lies, and is spending more money on "upgrades" to the facility  than for the care of the animals. In the veterinary clinic, we had several issues with Peggy and Diane Day (the adoptions adviser at the time) wanting spay and neuter surgeries rushed because they wanted litters of puppies at adoption events. Puppies were spayed/neutered the day of the event, and on transport to the event, their sutures opened and several of the puppies intestines fell out. We ended up having to euthanize most of the puppies. There have also been several cases of dogs or cats being euthanized by "mistake", and healthy, adoptable animals being euthanized in order to make room for transfers from other shelters in order to improve AHNM's "good name". When looking closely at AHNM's adoption/intake records, more animals may have been adopted out, but over half of those animals ended up being returned and euthanized for various reasons. In May 2010 the intake/return rate was higher than the adoption rate, but later on that year it was publicly stated that AHNM had adopted out 100% of its healthy animals. In the end, while I completely support the volunteers and lower-level staff of AHNM who truly love and take care of these wonderful animals, I will no longer support Animal Humane New Mexico with donations, advertisements, etc. until Peggy Weigle is gone or the truth comes out (which according to several current staff members and volunteers, may be happening very soon).
Animal Humane New Mexico	96849		/users/profile/113162	SarahMoon	Volunteer	5	08/29/2011	My name is Sarah and I used to work for Animal Humane.  While I do not work there any longer, I still serve as a volunteer on the Doggie Dash and Dawdle committee.  I've been volunteering with Doggie Dash for three years now and I an honestly say that there is no other event in Albuquerque that I look forward to more.  Yes, a lot of hard work is put forth every year to make this incredible event happen; but no matter how tired, cold, or worn-out I am, watching people with their dogs flood the entrance becomes a more gratifying experience every year. To know that there are people out there who care as much for animals I do makes me feel like a part of this great community. Knowing that the staff and volunteers at Animal Humane strive to do everything they can to find the perfect forever home for each pets helps me sleep easier at night.  I always tell people who feel sad or sorry for the pets at Animal Humane, that they are receiving some of the best care and love.  I'm in charge of Dash Bash, the carnival for people and their pets.  I love when people stop and tell me what they participated in the year before, and how excited they are to try bobbing for hot dogs and to receive a professional pet portrait.My most favorite memory was running into an Animal Humane graduate at Doggie Dash. Her name is Gila and I did her in-take when I was a part of the Adoption Staff.  She came to the shelter on a sweltering day in the summer. To make matters worse, she had ridden in the trunk of an old sedan and came to us overheated and filthy. She was under socialized and the product of some horrible backyard breeding.  Not sure if she could handle the stress of a kennel, we said a small prayer and hoped for the best.She was still at the shelter when Doggie Dash came around and we included her in the rent-a-dog program.  Still a little shy, the staff at Animal Humane put their faith in Gila's little spirit and sent her off.She met her forever parents that day and a couple from Santa Fe ending up falling in love with her and eventually adopting her.  A year later, I ran into Gila and witnessed the sweet and out-going dog she had become.  No longer shy, she shined and wagged her tail.Without the care, dedication, and the little faith each employee and volunteer has at Animal Humane, Gila could have easily fallen into a darker hole than from where she came.
Animal Humane New Mexico	96498		/users/profile/112629	clc3567	Volunteer	5	08/24/2011	In June, I had the privilege of taking part in Animal Humane New Mexico's 24/7 Adoption Event.  Campus stayed open for 60 straight hours and with the enthusiastic help of 70 staff members and more than 100 volunteers, 112 formerly homeless pets found new forever homes!  It was amazing to see the happiness and dedication in EVERYONE who was involved.  An event like 24/7 is just one of the many reasons I am so proud to be a volunteer for Animal Humane New Mexico!    
Animal Humane New Mexico	95650		/users/profile/111112	Ramona G.	Client Served	5	08/13/2011	Thanks to Animal Humane we have two of our three forever pets. Rio, our red heeler, was adopted from Animal Humane in 2003. Fiona, a/k/a Baby Cakes, was adopted in 2010. Fiona was taken to Animal Humane in March, 2010 after suffering a terrible accident in her home which burned her paws, belly, and fur. Animal Humane was able to treat her injuries and care for her until she was ready to be adopted into her forever home. My family was lucky enough to be that home, and Fiona touches our lives every day with her beautiful, loving spirit. This happy ending, and many others, are made possible by Animal Humane and its supporters.
Animal Humane New Mexico	95620		/users/profile/111059	Michelle Franks	Board Member	5	08/12/2011	I am so pleased to serve on the Board for Animal Humane|NM!  This is an organization that is truly about making the world a better place for our furry friends.  AH|NM offers wonderful, diverse programs meant to help current owners keep their pets, as well as programs established to facilitate adoptions of The Best Pet Ever!I've had the pleasure of using the Behavior Hotline in an effort to curb some aggressive behaviors that my dog was exhibiting.  The counselor that helped me was very friendly and knowledgable and respectful.  Never once did I feel silly because I needed help.  In fact, I felt better informed and more understanding of what my dog was experiencing, which helped me change my approach.  It really was very helpful!As I'd said above, AH|NM is very effective at facilitating adoptions.  I had the pleasure of working the recent 24/7 event.  The motto for this event was "We won't go home until they do!"  Literally, for 3 complete days, AH|NM was open for adoptions.  We had people arriving at all hours of the day, and found forever homes for 112 pets.  It was an amazing event and so much fun to see so many happy families leave campus with such love and joy (from both the human members and the new furry members)!I truly love this organization and am so grateful for what it does now and what it will do in the future.  We, the Board, are in Long Range Planning sessions that will establish the direction of Animal Humane|NM for the next 10 or more years.  For me, it's very satisfying to see animal care progress in such a positive direction.
Animal Humane New Mexico	95558		/users/profile/110969	Anne Apicella	Volunteer	5	08/11/2011	I have been a volunteer at AHNM since 2002, and have seen the organization evolve into one of the highest quality shelters I have known. Due to the dedication of the leadership, staff (76) and volunteers (410), in 2010 we reached our goal of adopting 100% of the healty pets (4,812) in our care!   AHNM has implemented a number of programs to support its mission of improving the lives of companion animals through sheltering, adopton, community education, providing quality low-cost veterinary services to families in need, and programs that reduce pet overpopulation.  All of the programs are too numerous to list here, but you can see them at the Web site: www.animalhumanenm.org   AHNM does not receive any government funding.  It is supported by fees for services and donations.  But even with these limited resouces, AHNM continues to strive and innovate to reach their goals, and the results are impressive.  It is an incredible organization and I wholeheartedly support them and their mission!
Animal Humane New Mexico	49033	8	/users/profile/50278	ritapitts	Donor	5	08/01/2010	I am so happy to have the opportunity to tell you what a wonderful organization Animal Humane New Mexico is.  I have been a supporter of the organization for many years and all my four legged friends have been residents there prior to living with me.  So, I feel qualified to say that this organization excels in all areas.  They are beloved in the community for their commitment to small animals having the support of the local news media, many business establishments and countless friends like me.  They use their funds efficiently, having recently completed a new Cat House, opening a new, hugely successful, satellite location in another part of town and more recently another satellite in still another location!  AHNM was actually approached by the owner of one of these locations and asked to become a resident, at a reduced rental rate, because of their reputation and commitment to animals!   They have a medical facility run by dedicated professionals, own and run a successful Thrift Shop and are in the process of planning and building a new dog play area (park). Their employees are totally dedicated to the betterment of the animals as are their loyal volunteers.  They provide low-cost medical urgent care services to low income pet owners and have a Pet Food Bank for owners who want to keep their pets but are financially struggling.  For those wanting to adopt a friend for a four legged member of the family, they encourage the Meet and Greet concept.  Ive done this several times and heartily recommend this method to bring a new doggie member into the family.  Their employees come and stay!  Just another indication of good management practices!  Once youve entered the doors to AHNM, you become a family member of this well run, happy organization!
Animal Humane New Mexico	49002	9	/users/profile/50247	scoutparker	Board Member	5	07/31/2010	Although I was a board member of Animal Humane|New Mexico, I had resisted adding an additional pet to our home for years.  Once the Cat House opened up at the Virginia Campus, my resistance was won over.  The Cat House offers four individual rooms with outdoor patios for the cats to play in and show their real personalities to potential adopters, and also to show how well they get along with other cats.  As I already had one cat at home, it was important that the new cat had good social skills.  After visiting all four rooms in the Cat House, a beautiful gray cat, who had obviously been "on the lam", won over my heart with his sweet nature.  The set up of the Cat House allowed me to visit with a variety of cats at my leisure, and find one that was just right for me.  As I was leaving town the next day, Animal Humane|New Mexico made arrangements to take care of "Scout" until I could get him to my house.  Dr. Neal went over some concerns I had about introducing Scout to my current cat - time well spent.  I am grateful to Animal Humane|New Mexico for being there to take in strays like Scout, who once they are placed in the right home are valued members of the family who are taken care of the way every animal deserves to be taken care of.
Animal Humane New Mexico	48985	10	/users/profile/50218	heather-ferguson	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/30/2010	In my four years of work with Animal Humane of New Mexico, I have seen a perfect combination of a driven and compassionate team of professionals who have made themselves, their expertise and their facility available for caring for cruelty cases in New Mexico.  They have treated, trained and housed animals from all over the state from hoarding cases and animal fighting cases.They have an excellent director who has taken this organization to new levels as soon as she came on board.  She has elevated their work with the media, fundraising events and work with other local rescues and advocacy groups.When I worked with local law enforcement to coordinate a raid on a New Mexico property that was posing as a "rescue" and was housing over 93 sick, starving and injured dogs, AHNM was the first to immediately offer to take in as many dogs as they could.  Their veterinary staff is top notch and triaged every dog that we brought in.  One of those dogs is one of the best success stories we have had from a cruelty case.  Lilly came in severely malnourished and likely wouldn't have survived without their immediate care and is now thriving in her foster home.Animal Protection of New Mexico and all others involved with Lilly's case are so grateful for AHNM's quick ability to act and assist in cruelty cases as well as the tremendous work they do every day for the animals that they take in.Thank you AHNM!
Animal Humane New Mexico	48927	8	/users/profile/50148	allspts	General Member of the Public	5	07/29/2010	I hve been involved with AHNM for many years as a vendor, donor and adoption coordinator with a breed rescue organization. They are in the top 3 of non profits I have been associatedwith. Their community involvement, from theDoggie Dash and Dawdle, Artists for the Animals, Newsletters, Adopion Clinics and so much more, promotes their mission to the fullest. The entire staff is remarkable and dedicted to the animals. AHNM, is quite frankly, a remakable organization and one that makes our community proud of their accompishments.
Animal Humane New Mexico	48902	10	/users/profile/50118	kredwards1	Donor	5	07/29/2010	AHANM provides opportunities for pet lovers to meet their fur-companions and to develop bonds with other pet lovers in the state. From Tail Dates to their annual Doggie Dash and Dawdle, AHANM continually brings the community together in the shared love of pets. I adopted my Nadia in 2000 and while she has passed away, I am still thankful for an organization like AHANM for bringing Nadia in my life and providing opportunities for her and I to play with other people and their fur-kids.  AHANM is a top notch organization and I am proud to contribute each and every year to their cause.
Animal Humane New Mexico	48819	2	/users/profile/50022	sunnyben	Board Member	5	07/28/2010	I have been on the Board for about a year and a half.  In that time I have found the organization to be exceptionally well run by the staff.  The Executive Director is very professional and extremely knowledgable about running a shelter, and she clearly cares very deeply about the mission of the organization - to find homes for cats and dogs that are homeless, to provide veterinary care for low-income pet owners and to lead the way in spay/neuter programs.  Her professionalism and caring approach have been instilled in the management team and in all the people who work or volunteer at the shelter.  As a result of the effectiveness of Animal Humane New Mexico, during my time on the Board it has consistently received donations in excess of the amount budgeted.    I am proud to be affiliated with such an outstanding and well run organization.
Animal Humane New Mexico	48804	3	/users/profile/50005	wheezersmom	Volunteer	5	07/28/2010	Animal Humane New Mexico is a most amazing organization with incredible staff, board and volunteers.  As with many shelters, AHNM is wholly supported by donations - and they do it all.  From the wonderfully cared for dogs and cats (all looking for their forever homes), the low-income clinic, the spay/neuter program, behavior assistance, and pet shop -- Animal Humane is a one-stop shop.  Animal Humane is a great community partner.  I am proud to be a part of its extended family.
Animal Humane New Mexico	48783	3	/users/profile/49982	3blackdogs	General Member of the Public	5	07/27/2010	All three of our wonderful dogs were adopted through Animal Humane, and I can't say enough good about this fine organization.  From building the first clinic in Albuquerque to provide veterinary services to those with limited financial means, to opening an adoption facility in the Northeast Heights that provides easier and more visible access, Animal Humane New Mexico is always looking at the next strategic move it can make to find good homes for many pets as possible, to educate the population about preventing overpopulation, and especially to mitigate pain and suffering of our fellow creatures.  I am proud to be a donor and supporter!
Animal Humane New Mexico	48757	3	/users/profile/49945	slshires	Volunteer	5	07/27/2010	As a volunteer I get to work with many of the thousands of people and pets helped by this amazing organization.  This past Saturday I helped a woman who came in with her eleven year old daughter to surrender their cat.  They were upset because the economy had forced them to move to a place where they couldn't keep pets.  While it was a difficult situation I felt good assuring them that we would take good care of their pet and do our best to find her a new home.  The week before I handled an an adoption to a couple that had adopted their last dog from us more than 12 years ago.  Once again they found a wonderful adult dog to complete their family.  Another couple told me that their vet had suggested they come to Animal Humane to look for their next dog because he knew that we were doing a really good job of caring for our dogs and cats.  As a board member and board president I know that this organization is run very efficiently and makes excellent and effective use of the private funds we are given by thousands of donors.  I am especially proud of the low income veterinary clinic that we opened nearly two years ago.  I know that so many more people are able to care for and keep their pets because of this service.  It is the only such clinic in our state.  I have the privilege of making thank you calls to some of our donors.  They usually end up thanking us for what we do.
Animal Humane New Mexico	48728	6	/users/profile/49905	kyla1122	Volunteer	5	07/26/2010	This is one of the best run non-profits I've worked with.  When people donate, they know that their good money is suppored by good management.  The board and management view this as a business as well as a service to the community.  As a volunteer for a fundraiser, the support staff has been superb and the committee stellar.   Their creativity to distinguish themselves from other shelters has made them into one of the best non-profits in the state.  Kyla Thompson
Animal Humane New Mexico	48711	3	/users/profile/49879	levineshelby	Donor	5	07/26/2010	My wife and I started off as donors to Animal Humane NM.  Our relationship evolved when we found a dog at our city shelter that was very quiet and timid.  Around Christmas time that dog, a terrier cross, developed kennel cough.   He was not responding to treatment at the shelter and we became concerned that he might be euthanized there.  We arranged to have him transferred to Animal Humane.  He was immediately given treatment for the kennel cough and began to respond.  For the next three months I went to Animal Humane on a daily basis to walk Quincy and give him additional attention.  During that period I observed the staff and volunteers.  They all were very professional.  I saw the satisfaction they felt when a dog or cat found his/her forever home.  They seemed to know the names of most of the residents which is no simple feat. In the meantime Quincy was found to be food aggressive.  He went through their behavior modification training and was eventually adopted into a loving home with other animals. Animal Humane is the only organization that I am aware of in New Mexico that has a low cost veterinary clinic for low income individuals.  This allows those people to keep their beloved companion animals even when they require medical care.  Their new cattery is the finest one that I have ever seen.  The cats residing in that new facility have access to an enclosed outdoor facility where they can climb and watch birds in the adjacent trees.  Animal Humanes tireless efforts have significantly improved the lives of the homeless animals that find themselves staying on their campus.
Animal Humane New Mexico	48706	3	/users/profile/49872	robbiejones	Donor	5	07/25/2010	I have been supporting AHNM's spay/neuter efforts since 2003.  Since then, the program has grown from doing a few hundred surgeries per year to sterilizing thousands of pets of low income families, hundreds of cats and dogs in rescue and hundreds of feral cats each year.  Animal Humane's management is committed to helping to end cat and dog over-population in New Mexico.  Their Clinic is a state-of-the art facility staffed by dedicated professionals and volunteers.  Last year they performed 10,000 surgical procedures.AHNM also allows another local non-profit to use their Clinic one or two Sundays per month for high volume feral cat spay/neuter clinics.As a donor, I am impressed with the fact that every Animal Humane client is treated with respect and compassion.  I also know that every dollar I donate goes to help end the needless killing of healthy pets in New Mexico.  I really hope that all animal lovers will choose to support Animal Humane's programs.
Animal Humane New Mexico	48655	2	/users/profile/49798	petlosscounselor	Donor	5	07/24/2010	Each time I visit the main campus of Animal Humane New Mexico, I am thrilled to see the continued improvements.  With the comfort of the dog and cat residents, as well as the public in mind, they have created a warm and welcoming environment. The staff is friendly and helpful and eager to assist people in finding a forever friend. I am so pleased with their committment to help reduce the number of unwanted animals through robust spay/neuter programs and provide veterinary care for the pets of people who are low-income.
Global One to One (D.B.A. Project Peacepal)	318982		/users/profile/410310	Peace_Monger	Volunteer	5	11/16/2016	Project Peacepal is a great nonprofit that help me and others. It also provided means for communication for people in countries around the world. Which, as a result, connected many in more than one way.
Global One to One (D.B.A. Project Peacepal)	298604		/users/profile/389490	gerrib	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/30/2016	I have been a part of Project Peacepal for almost 10 years. After graduating from college, where Peace Studies had been one of my focuses, I was contacted by Sarah Wilkenson, the founder of PeacePal. I began volunteering in the office and then helped to work on the curriculum for the program. When I became the librarian for La Cueva High School I started an after school PeacePal club.  This group works on fund raising and participates in letter writing. The students learn about the culture and customs of their Peacepals from one another, rather then from a teacher lecturing. The one to one contact has a huge impact on the students who wait anxiously for each return letter from their new friends. They learn that all people have the same basic needs; food, shelter and love. They find that the different cultures and traditions are interesting rather than strange or scary. They learn difference is good and can be respected rather than feared. Connecting students on a one to one basis has a lasting positive effect on our children and helps to bring us together globally. PeacePal changes students lives for the better and many who join the club participate the entire 4 years. This program has also made the kids more aware of the needs of the people in their own community and has inspired my groups to work with homeless students at one of our elementary schools. PeacePal is a wonderful program and is one of the positive pieces of the puzzle of education, respect and service for students world-wide. 
Global One to One (D.B.A. Project Peacepal)	298419	1	/users/profile/389278	Chintan	Volunteer	5	07/28/2016	I came to know about Project Peacepal when I was an exchange student in the U.S. During my exchange program, I got the opportunity to participate in a PenPal program between my class in the U.S. and a class in Togo. I participated in various fundraising events for the Stamp Out Malaria program. Through this organisation, I also got to take a service learning course at the University of New Mexico.   After coming back to India, through Project Peacepal, we started a Letter Exchange program between schools in India and the U.S. The participants also participated in various Skype Call sessions, where they exchanged various ideas and got to clear some of the misconceptions that they had about each other. They got to showcase their traditional dance/music to their PenPals.  Inspired by the Global One to One and its programs, I now plan to start a regional Letter exchange program between states of India to bridge the cultural gap between them.  Since the beginning, Global One to One has believed in cultivating cross-cultural understanding and peace between countries though its various programs. I am very proud to be a part of this Organisation!
Global One to One (D.B.A. Project Peacepal)	298367	1	/users/profile/389213	Writer	Client Served	5	07/28/2016	This is a true grassroots organization started by a woman with a passion for peace and maintained over the years by herself and others who share her vision and hope.  A main premise is that by promoting connections, communication, and understanding between students in different countries we can build a more peaceful society.  The kids love the interaction and the organization is very supportive and gives you everything you need to have a great experience.  A+ for the concept and for the people who have very unselfishly given their time and talent to make it successful.
Global One to One (D.B.A. Project Peacepal)	298332		/users/profile/389173	Rachel180	Board Member	5	07/27/2016	Incredible program I've been so fortunate to serve. Facilitates communication between students in 11 different  countries--3,000 letters a year! Intercultural dialogue benefits all program participants by broadening minds and encouraging empathy and curiousity, but it's a functional literacy project, too, as it teaches a digital generation to handwrite letters. Couldn't recommend G121 highly enough. Take a look at the leters--I'll let the kids speak for themselves.

Global One to One (D.B.A. Project Peacepal)	226376		/users/profile/290106	EA123	Volunteer	5	10/24/2014	I joined PeacePal as a student volunteer in the 9th grade, and I have enjoyed working with the staff and I have made great friends with the people and students PeacePal has attracted. To be honest, I joined PeacePal by accident. My 9th grade Humanities teacher had a poster to a student summit for PeacePal, but I had no idea what the event was about- I only knew my classmates would be going. I quickly learned the ropes of what PeacePal was about and because I loved the goals of PeacePal, I have been a volunteer ever since! PeacePal made it really easy for me to stay connected with the founder and coordinator, and I feel that it is an effective program that builds community, awareness for its many programs, and full of people who genuinely care about making the world a better more peaceful place. I have a lot of gratitude to PeacePal for the learning I have obtained from its many programs and service opportunities.

Global One to One (D.B.A. Project Peacepal)	285700		/users/profile/375715	Tabresha L.	Former staff	5	04/12/2016	Global One to One is the first of its kind that I came across during my search to do more meaningful work. I was instantly attracted once I discovered that the organization's main goal is to help future leaders learn about tolerance and cultural differences to eventually develop a dialogue that can change the way the people of the earth interact on a daily basis. With this organization, communication is a major key and as someone who knows the importance of communicating, I can honestly say that it is one of the best proactive programs that seeks to promote unity and relationships.  I've seen children's letters crafted by children in the penpal program. They are genuine and sincere and I think that's what is needed in order for people to get along and get past racial or cultural differences and to a point where they can instead focus on more important things like science, environment and business. Global One to One teaches valuable skills and is a unique way for kids to get involved in something that will not only give them a different perspective, but that can also change the perspective of the world as they grow into the leaders that Global One to One aims to mold.

I looked forward to her response letter each and every time I sent a letter to her. It was a fascinating experience to say the least. I understand Project PeacePal to be for school children so they can start communicating with other children around the world. It is a great lesson for the kids to understand the ways of the world in other countries. I am so glad to be apart of it. It is such a wonderful and meaningful organization!

Global One to One (D.B.A. Project Peacepal)	231878		/users/profile/295442	FaithAnn B.	Board Member	5	10/31/2014	Project PeacePal. an NGO based in Albuquerque, New Mexico, brings together teachers and students from around the world to inspire young people to be peace building leaders through its letter writing and service learning programs. What is interesting about Project PeacePal is that for minimum costs its programs produce quality results that are measurable, because you are connecting individuals as equals and progress is seen by following their actions. Unlike similar programs, letter writing is the basis for the program, rather than an option. The project does not reinforce stereotypes of the developing world with portraits of children seen as poor, dirty, and sad to get sympathies and funds as seen in the numerous late night and day time commercials asking for potential patrons for less than a $1/day to sponsor a child. Through the letter writing, US participants gain just as much as their peers abroad and are often inspired into action to help their new friend.  Through the letter writing, the Project PeacePal is able understand the needs of the community and to direct its service learning program towards a few targeted goals to provide maximum assistance for each dollar spent. The projects Stamp Out Malaria Program is example of this. Through the letters from Ghana and Togo, US students learned of the tragedies that malaria brought onto families and friends of the corresponding students, Project PeacePal assisted with help of the regional partners to purchase with 1,000s of mosquito nets that proved effective in combating Malaria. Individually, students also developed projects on their own. For example, a local student organized a bake sale and car wash to support their fellow pen pal to continue school. NGOs like Project PeacePal are positive example how an idea can blossoms into action and through practice (repetitive letter writing and service projects) brings common devotion and understanding among the participants. With a stroke of pen and a hello, the grassroot programs like PeacePal have the potential to preemptively moderate our prejudices and in-differences before they have a chance to solidify in our characters, opening a chance for a reprieve from conflict that inevitably emerges when people are disconnected from each other.  For this reason, I volunteer and serve as an active board member.

They are truly commited to the cause and the goals of the organization: "To empowers youth by developing essential life skills such as global competency, effective communication, intercultural understanding, and critical thinking. Our goal is to create mindful leaders for tomorrow through the development of person to person connections across borders and over time." In our ever-changing and rapidly diversifying world and as the parent of a young child, I believe these values and goals are some of the most important things to learn and remember in our world.

Their correspondence curriculum connects students in the United States with students all over the world. From Nepal to Kenya, thousands of young people have been impacted by PeacePal's commitment to tearing down cultural barriers to foster the next generation of peace-building leaders. As a member of the board of directors, I have seen the success of these programs firsthand. I am constantly amazed at how such a small nonprofit organization can make such a big difference on an international scale. Project PeacePal truly epitomizes the rarest of human qualities: compassion, devotion, and tolerance.

The sky is the limit culture coupled with its' nostalgic hand written letter writing process makes Peace Pal unforgettable.

Founded and flourishing in Albuquerque, NM, the organization engages local volunteers in planning and promoting community events in support of a rigorous schedule of letter-writing and international bonhomie.  This is an organization that brings home the message, "Let there be peace on earth and let it begin with me."   .

I first began volunteering with the organization during my undergraduate years and was immediately blown away by the wisdom and passion of the individuals working with PeacePal. It's amazing to me how one simple idea grew so beautifully as a result of both hard work and dedication. PeacePal's work is an elegant approach to connecting all citizens of the world and teaching young children about the interdependency of all nations, communities, and even individuals.
Global One to One (D.B.A. Project Peacepal)	227492		/users/profile/291223	RikkiQ	Volunteer	5	10/27/2014	Project PeacePal is an amazing organization run by a passionate group of people.  Their letter writing programs that connect middle school and high school students in the US with their peers abroad have a lifelong impact on the participants that gives them a global perspective, helps build strong inter-cultural communication skills, and  eliminates stereotypes on both sides.  They are building global citizens one student at a time.   And even better, Project PeacePal accomplishes so much on a shoestring budget, when other international organizations do less with a much larger budget.  Project PeacePal is also a model of the collaborative model, designed to grow the size of the pie for everyone. 
Global One to One (D.B.A. Project Peacepal)	227450		/users/profile/291180	Karen307	Volunteer	5	10/27/2014	There is one word to describe PeacePal's communication program:  exceptional.  I had heard about the organization for years but just got involved about a year ago.  One of my great passions in life is to be involved with promoting global awareness and international understanding.  PeacePal brings young people from around the world together with students in New Mexico to learn about each others lives.  The participants connect with one another on a personal level through exchange of photos and letters.  It is truly inter-cultural communication at its finest.  Karen Schafer
Global One to One (D.B.A. Project Peacepal)	226993		/users/profile/290721	Peter.Lukes	Client Served	5	10/26/2014	I am a public high school teacher and I am in my fourth year of participating in the PeacPal letter writing program with both middle and high schoolers.  It has been an invaluable source of international mindedness for my students.  The PeacePal volunteers and staff have produced a complete, extremely professional, and common core connected program.  The students love the program and I always have many that are not in my class the next year, but still beg me to participate in the letter writing!  I have watched several of my students move from letter writers to activists themselves.  The experience is empowering!  I have been involved with and worked for non-profits in the past, so it is with experience that I can say that PeacePal is a fantastic and professionally run organization.  Bravo PeacePal!

I think that Project PeacePal is one of the most impressive organizations that I've dealt with. It's wonderful to see the types of international and intercultural communication that comes about as a result of their letter writing program. I have had a chance to see some of the impact, and it's been refreshing.

When you read the letters from kids around the world, it is at once wonderful to see all the common denominators and moving to realize that basics such as school supplies, sports equipment - even bed nets to prevent malaria - are in short supply.  It is so inspiring to see the US penpals raising funds and doing special projects to help their new friends in faraway lands.

Their Summer Shakespeare Season on the Plaza is also a great move.  With 28 years of experience Vortex is a great cultural asset for Albuquerque and New Mixico
Vortex Inc	69506		/users/profile/75951	Hugh Witemeyer	General Member of the Public	5	02/16/2011	Over the past few years, the Vortex has offered productions of the highest quality. I believe it is the most consistently interesting of the 37+ theatre-producing organizations in the greater Albuquerque area. I am thinking of shows like "Medea," "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf," "Much Ado about Nothing," "The Little Foxes," and "Glengarry Glen Ross"--all of them first-rate. The theatre is also receptive to new work by contemporary playwrights, with a new-short-play festival every year and sometimes a full-length new work as well. Finally, the Vortex is an outstanding citizen of the theatre community, helping other theatre groups and participating in community-wide theatre initiatives. Congratulations to the Vorticists for maintaining their longstanding tradition of superb live-theatre activity.
Vortex Inc	68748		/users/profile/75119	CA-girl	Volunteer	5	02/15/2011	I began volunteering at The Vortex after being wowed by their summer Shakespeare Festival.  Fabulous performances, especially John Hardman as a helmet-thwacking policeman.  They produce a wide variety of pieces, from classics to locally-written, which gives me a new appreciation for theatre and exposes me to works I'd never see otherwise. All-in-all, The Vortex is a vital part of the Albuquerque arts and theatre scene.  We're lucky to have it.
Vortex Inc	68195		/users/profile/74516	Leesa	Volunteer	5	02/14/2011	The Vortex Theatre is awesome. They put on first rate productions from the classics to contemporary. They support new and local playwrites. Provide great learning ground for interns. Given that Central New Mexico Community College does not have a theatre, classes are held at the Vortex. This enhances the theatre classes offered at CNM allows for technical classes where the students learn hands on in an actual theatrical shop. it is a great venue to experience the joy of live theatre
Vortex Inc	67296		/users/profile/73554	smith100	Volunteer	4	02/12/2011	The Vortex has a very special place in my heart as this was the first theatre that I performed in.  The relationship that the Vortex has with  Central NM Community College is wonderful and gives new actors a place to hone their craft in both the classics and new pieces.  They encourage writers throughout NM as well as the country to have their pieces performed for the first time and gives the audience the opportunity to be the judge during their 10 minute play festival.  The theatre is small and cozy allowing the audience to become almost a character within the play.  Very unique experiences are to be had for both the audience and performers.  
Vortex Inc	65751		/users/profile/71872	Linda	Board Member	5	02/09/2011	I have been involved in live theatre for many years, including volunteering at the Vortex Theatre in various roles.

Among the 20 or so theatres in Albuquerque, they are clearly one of the best.

Along with keeping the bar high, the Vortex is always pushing for more from their productions. I am pleased to be assocated with this venue.

It's a wonderful place to get involved in community theater--after a small amount of stage experience in high school, working at the Vortex always feels like The Big Time to me. I'm awed by the sets, props, costumes, tech, direction, and stage management in every show, not to mention the exemplary actors with whom I've had the good fortune to work.

Vortex Inc	65169		/users/profile/71235	Noah Pardo-Friedman	General Member of the Public	5	02/08/2011	The Vortex has been producing quality theatre here in Albuquerque for longer than I've been alive (1978).  They work with children frequently and local talent exclusively.  Many of the shows I've seen there have been among the best I've ever seen, and I've been in theatre for twenty-six years and seen shows in New York City.  Important members of The Vortex participate in the local colleges as teachers, and many original works have been showcased over the years at the Vortex.  The Vortex is truly an invaluable and integral part of the local arts scene here in Albuquerque.
Vortex Inc	65127		/users/profile/71189	jamer1993	Client Served	5	02/08/2011	The Vortex Theatre is an amazing program that offers quality theatre to the Albuquerque Area.

Vortex Inc	64954		/users/profile/71014	Cathy	General Member of the Public	5	02/08/2011	I love the friendly atmosphere of this venue.

Vortex Inc	64921		/users/profile/70978	Charles Fisher	Board Member	5	02/08/2011	As a transplant from London, fearful that New Mexico's desert might extend to theatre, I have to thank the Vortex for 35 years of paving the way for the theatrical scene that now flourishes in Albuquerque.  Many, if not all, of the City's 40+ theatre companies owe a debt to the Vortex.  It has consistently offered the community: the broadest range of theatrical experiences, vintage through contemporary, classical to brand new work; rich opportunities to actors, directors and technicians, ranging from local students to enthusiastic retirees; rigorously high production standards that few community theatre organizations can match; an intimate black box setting to heighten the theatregoer's experience; and an unflaggingly energetic and unfailingly approachable group of volunteers who conduct themselves like a welcoming family to all who visit the theatre.  As an audience member, I have usually been impressed and always been stimulated.  As an actor, I have thoroughly enjoyed the company and the audiences in every production.  So much so that I was honored to be invited recently to become a Board Member and was delighted to accept.  I am proud to say that out-of-town and foreign visitors whom we have taken to Vortex productions have left green with envy that we have such a theatre organization in our town.          
Vortex Inc	64896		/users/profile/70950	operacase	General Member of the Public	5	02/08/2011	The Vortex has always managed to provide an entertaining or challenging evening despite the theatres' small size. We've been attending performances there for nearly all the 17 years we've lived in Albuquerque and have seldom been disappointed. The pool of talent from which they draw is not large but they always seem to manage to find the right people for each role. We highly recommend them.

Vortex Inc	64805		/users/profile/70850	kfd7	General Member of the Public	5	02/08/2011	I have seen many productions at the Vortex since its inception many years ago-- most memorable were Waiting for Godot which having seen it in NYC and other places, this was by far the best production. Also, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf--simply riveting...They now have a very strong and dedicated board and have continued to bring often great theatre to the community.
Vortex Inc	64764		/users/profile/70809	Ellis	Board Member	5	02/08/2011	The Vortex Theatre is one of the bedrocks of the Albuquerque community theatre scene.

Vortex Inc	64747		/users/profile/70791	RainierBob	General Member of the Public	5	02/08/2011	This is an excellent community theater. Tickets are very reasonably priced $15-$20, and the plays produced cover a range from theater standards like Shakespeare to recent and original works. The acting is sometimes superb -- I think of King Lear a year or two ago in which both Lear and his fool were great -- and otherwise ranges from strong to good. It's a fairly small theater, no bad seats.  A great asset to Albuquerque's cultural/entertainment resources.

Additionally, I am looking forward to seeing their subsequent play of Tennessee Williams' The Night of the Iguana, later in the spring.

The theatre has kept its doors open through good and bad economic times and has done major collaborations with local school and community organizations. I ahve been proud to have been a part of this Albuquerque tradition for 24 years now and expect to continue working with them as well as enjoying the great theater perhaps for another 24.

I have found the quality of the productions quite good.  Perhaps the best show I've seen at the Vortex was the Oscar Wilde play.  It was very well done, and I attended the discussion afterward with members of the cast and representatives of the ACLU.  I'm looking forward to this summer's Shakespeare repertory.  The improvements to the venue (air conditioning, e.g.) are appreciated.

Having lived in Chicago, Alexandria, and now Albuquerque, I have to say the Vortex is probably second only to Steppenwolf of Chicago in quality for a non-professional company. The verve and dedication of their actors, directors, technical people, volunteers and board members cannot be surpassed.

The NWP informs people about the importance of environmental sustainability and what they can do to help.   One of my favorite aspects of this organization is that it emphasizes that everyone can have a postive impact on the environment.   The Apprentice Ecologist Initiative engages people around the world.  Apprentice Ecologists are young volunteers that conduct their own environmental project and write an essay about their project.   Three Apprentice Ecologists are selected to win an $850 scholarship each year.  As an Apprentice Ecologist, I have learned about the power of taking initiative and how I can contribute to establishing a more environmentally-sound planet. Moreover, people of all ages participate in the NWP's annual Make a Difference Day and National Trail Day.  The organization also promotes recycling and works to eliminate nonnative species.   Also, the NWP sells Eco-Socks, which are made from all environmentally-friendly materials and/or recycled materials, and are produced by sock manufactures that practice fair trade and fair labor. I highly encourage you to support the NWP and become a volunteer!

Nicodemus Wilderness Project	59995		/users/profile/65103	John H.	General Member of the Public	5	01/13/2011	I ordered organic cotton socks, because I have an allergic reaction to regular socks. I ordered size 9-11 for my size 10 feet. Apparently, however, that size for socks translates to size 4-7 for men's shoes. I posted an angry note on the Website, and then wrote them off. However, I got a personal response from someone who had obviously read my post with real concern. They offered to take back the socks and send me the correct size. Which they did, even though I had already washed the socks (didn't realize they were too small until I tried them on after washing). They have followed up several times since. What was a bad experience has turned into a very good one. Could not ask for a better response.

Nicodemus Wilderness Project	37502	4	/users/profile/38227	duende	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/29/2010	The Nicodemus Wilderness Project (NWP) teamed up with the City of Albuquerque Open Space Division to adopt the Piedra Lisa Open Space in 2000.  At this time the Piedra Lisa Canyon was still suffering from the abuse it had seen prior to it becoming a part of the City of Albuquerque's Open Space program.  Since adopting this canyon within the Sandia Foothills, with its rare riparian area, the NWP has helped organize 3 conservation projects each year to help elimate evasive plant species, replant native trees and shrubs, remove graffiti, reduce erosion, construct and maintain trails, and cleanup trash and recyclables.  Throughout the last 10 years the NWP has recruited over a thousand volunteers to participate in these conservation projects, with a special focus on involving youth groups. The efforts of the NWP, locally here in ALbuquerque and internationally, have made a difference in the lives of many young people and has had a positve effect on our natural environment.

Nicodemus Wilderness Project	37186	7	/users/profile/37921	gustavo-fujiwara	Former staff	5	04/27/2010	The Nicodemus Wilderness Project is an amazing organization many ways. When it comes to environmental issues, they achieve a spectacular goal of educating the coming generations by promoting contests among young students from highschool and college to take an initiative to positively impact Earth's environments. This is not only a efficient way to stimulate younger generations be proactive and care about our world, but also an inspiring experience to others. I had my first contact with NWP when submitted my essay about my experience with recycling project in Pantanal's community, in Brazil. Through their website I could inspire and be inspired by other students' projects, and this year I helped choosing this year's winner of the award.

I am a professor in Maryland and someday hope to hike those same trails with my granddaughters, dragging out own bags of collected debris.WHAT A MARVELOUS CONCEPT...THE NEXT GENERATION AND CITY KIDS EMBRACING WILDLIFE AND RIVERS.

HEAL, as well as it's dedicated and motivated staff, have made great strides throughout the years to become a safe place for DV survivors and their children to live. HEAL offers life changing skills and guidance to residents to help them overcome the past and move into a great new future. In the short time I have been a resident of Ruidoso, NM, I have gained a new found awareness and respect for the HEAL program.  I have seen and heard first hand the stories of survivors and the incredible positive impact it has on the lives of all who are involved. May God Bless You All!!!
Help End Abuse for Life Inc	172856		/users/profile/228850	Diane82	Board Member	5	10/02/2013	HEAL is a wonderful non-profit organization! After hearing so many wonderful things about this great organization from numerous people and previous board members, my husband and I knew we just had to become a part of it. All of the staff are wonderful and they have always been extremely helpful. I love knowing that everyone on that staff, including the Executive Director, Coleen Widdell, are actually there to really make a difference and help make the shelter the safest place to be for both women & children!! It's wonderful knowing that the residents are involved in so many programs which will help them to become productive citizens as well as gain new skills required to become more independent. I've also been fortunate to be able to work with the women and children as well. They are a part of my life now and they are like my family. I'm also amazed with the energy driven media team who strive to spread awareness to help end violence. My husband and I are proud supporters of the Nest!! 
Help End Abuse for Life Inc	172776		/users/profile/228764	Mustangman	Board Member	5	10/02/2013	I credit my wife of 19 yrs. with giving me a clearer understanding of the scope and effects of domestic violence.  As a DV survivor from her first marriage, she has a unique understanding and perspective of DV.  Were it not for her, I would not have become involved with the fine people and services provided by HEAL/the NEST.  For 2 years, my wife worked as an Advocate/Outreach Coordinator with HEAL/the NEST.  During that time, I became associated with the staff and I came to know the dedication, devotion, and compassion given to each and every client served by HEAL/the NEST.  In May 2012, I became a member of the HEAL board of directors and in July 2013, my fellow board members honored me with the privilege of serving as president of the board for the next year.  HEAL/the NEST is blessed to have a fine staff, who are committed to assisting our clients in starting new lives free of violence and oppression.  I am blessed to work with board members who are no less committed.    
Help End Abuse for Life Inc	166111	1	/users/profile/220686	sfrancis.nest	General Member of the Public	5	08/25/2013	HEAL is widely recognized as the Number 1 program in the state. This title did not come easy. With a wonderful director at the helm and a great team consisting of trained advocates, a supportive board, employees and community volunteers, this domestic violence program is thriving. Never one to be in the back of the pack, HEAL is always one step ahead of the curve and constantly strives to be the leader in innovative programming.

This is but one very small organization in our small town.

Help End Abuse for Life Inc	160029		/users/profile/212252	Letitia S.	General Member of the Public	5	06/07/2013	I would like to say that The Nest  is a great program.  It has served many women from the Mescalero reservation; empowering and getting women back on their feet.  The staff have also come into the Mescalero community to share their knowledge of domestic violence prevention at health fairs and also in our Head Start program, having Domestic Violence Training for the parents and guardians.  As a former employee, The Nest will always have an impact on my life, especially in understanding what Domestic Violence is really all about. 
Help End Abuse for Life Inc	159909	1	/users/profile/212102	Sylvia Lynn M.	Board Member	5	06/06/2013	Both my husband and I got involved with The Nest (HEAL) because its goals and philosophy are what we strive to maintained. Domestic Violence has touched our lives in a very personal way, and because of this we have supported The Nest in any way we possibly could.  Even though I no longer sit on the Board I volunteer any way I can.  Whether it is on a committee or traveling to Santa Fe to Lobby for more funding, I will be there for themMany do not realize that Grants are aimed at specific projects and are great in their own right), or that the funding received from the State is distributed through a single agency and must cover the entire state, and all organizations dealing with Domestic Violence and Child Abuse.When the Grants run out or are not available and the state funding is cut, the expenses of running the The Nest still remain.  Over the past several years the funding from all areas has begun to dry up.  This means that programs like, Education and Outreach must take a back-seat so that the basic needs of the women and children of The Nest can be met in the best way possible.Domestic Violence is a fact in the United States.  Only we as citizens can change how Domestic Violence is perceived.  Until that time the need for Women's shelters is growing at and alarming rate and that means that we as citizens must support them in any way we can.  From personal donations, and volunteering to communication with our State and Federal Representatives to advise them of the needs of these women and their children.It is my opinion The Nest (HEAL) is the best run and provides the safest environment of ANY shelter in the United States and should become the proto-type for all shelters.It is further my wish the the need for shelters become non existent, but that can only happen with the ending of Domestic Violence and Child Abuse.
Help End Abuse for Life Inc	159738	1	/users/profile/211912	Michael173	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/06/2013	I've worked with Help End Abuse for Life for the better part of a year now. It has a great team driving it forward and a strong community supporting its endeavors. I have seen the advocates serving many women and helping them to create entirely new lives for themselves, the board members developing plans to make our services more accessible, available, broader, and better, and the administrative and managing staff acting as a shining example of how non-profits should be run. HEAL has acted as a catalyst of hope and change for hundreds of women setting out to make some of the most difficult decisions of their lives and it has excelled in doing so.

Help End Abuse for Life Inc	159258	1	/users/profile/211390	Dr. Harrison	Volunteer	5	06/02/2013	As the only original Board member of Help End Abuse for Life (H.E.A.L.) who served as Vice-President twice, President once and Immediate Past President on the Executive Committee and who also worked for a short time as an employee of The Nest as the resident manager, I can attest to the fulfillment of a dream in Lincoln County.  With various contiguous counties having DV shelters as long as 20 to 25 years when we began our quest to build, Lincoln County closed its eyes in recognizing that a need existed-until a great group of concerned community members began a very real discussion of DV incidents.  In a period of two years, we had a piece of property and a goal.  Today with the professional and superior leadership of Ms. Coleen Widell as the Director, the DV shelter known as The Nest is one of the most respected shelters in New Mexico.  It embraced a progressive concept that the shelter is located on Highway 70 in clear and transparent view of all people passing by, instead of trying to hide the location from perpetrators.  Training is a critical and vital part of The Nest as the staff give residents the skills necessary to go to court, file Temporary Restraining Orders, develop interview and job skills, and become productive citizens without fear of retaliation.  This organization has survived the downturn of our economy and remains strong in its concept to reach out to the victims of Domestive Violence.
Help End Abuse for Life Inc	159228	1	/users/profile/211355	Icee	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/01/2013	Hello my name is Terry Thompson, for the last 41/2 years I served at the NEST as a supervisor.  What an honor and privilege to be able to find the resources for each individual family.  One day one of our little boys had returned to the shelter with his mother, wiped the tears from his eyes, ran over to the other children, squared his little shoulders and asked how long have you been here?  The answer was given to him and his response to the children was" I'm never going to leave again."  As a advocate this reassured me that we as staff was doing a good job, and maybe just maybe as he grew older the shelter part of his experience of DV would be a bright spot.  Safety for Mothers and Children is number 1. 
Help End Abuse for Life Inc	159217	1	/users/profile/211343	Danny7	Board Member	5	06/01/2013	I got involved with this organization three years ago with an invite from Joe Gomez.  I knew little about the NEST, but after volunteering for a short time, I had been baptized into Domestic Violence.  Shauna and I knew that it existed, but Holy Cow it does really exist.  The most rewarding thing for me is the kids and seeing those happy faces in a safe place and then seeing them at Walmart and them running up to you and giving a big hug.  The women have been a blessing to me, to see them be able to make a turn around and to go back out into the world is just an owe some experience.  None of this could be done though without the dedicated staff.  They work hard and have a passion!  If you want to make a difference in a life, call me and I will get you enlisted today, 575-808-1075.

Not that they aren't constantly busy offering some fun and worthwhile fundraiser, but what they do with the proceeds amazes me.

With the highest rate of domestic violence in NM, HEAL has created the NEST as a perfect shelter for battered women and their children.  HEAL has a great staff, trained to be advocates for victims of domestic violence.  Victims are able to start their survival process, with numerous opportunities to learn more about themselves and how to be strong. There are many programs in place to assist the victims to educate them and increase their resolve to survive domestic violence.HEAL has a devoted board of directors that works diligently to support and keep the work of the NEST financially strong.  Sweet Charity, the upscale resale shop, opened two years ago to raise money and give victims a chance to start over with clothes and other items. Most women have lost everything they have when they have to leave a violent relationship. Donations of furniture, clothes and household items from the public are gratefully received, sorted and displayed for victims to "shop".  Sweet Charity is known in Lincoln County for having the best selction of resale items in a wonderful environment.

Not only did I learn a lot about public policy but the people who work there are all very friendly and passionate about the work they do. It creates a great environment to work in and I learned how to do research on current issues around the state. The policy papers Think produces are very informative and helpful to the general public.

From my experience with TNM in working with them, there has always been an emphasis on having Quantitative Research to support any type of policy that TNM advocates for. Besides that, the core group of individuals at TNM are hard-working and dedicated in fighting for causes, and that really does inspire others, like myself, to fight for my own causes as well.

TNM has been addressing very important issues in the state with an unbiased perspective. The work conducted at the organization is very solution-oriented and research-based. Cognizant of the results attained so far, TNM seems to be an effective advocate for the citizens of New Mexico.For example, I was recently assisting the staff in conducting research regarding the NM Lottery. We not only studied the Lottery and its revenues/payouts in New Mexico, but we also researched the inner-workings of lotteries in other states so that we had the full picture before reaching any conclusions. I thought that was an excellent initial approach to developing proposals.With a month left to complete the internship, Im really looking forward to learning a lot more about state government and also about what a well-functioning government should look like. It is very encouraging to be in an environment where change is initiated.

As someone who is currently in graduate school for public policy, I found TNM to be an exceptionally well run organization with strong values. The Director, Fred Nathan, works as hard as he did when he first began the organization. Everyone is friendly and dedicated to serving the citizens of New Mexico. And most importantly, TNM maintains the highest degree of professionalism when interacting with legislators, state agencies, non profits, journalists or members of the public.

Think NM tackles important issues with an eye towards actually implementing solutions, and has been very successful in doing so. The topics Think NM chooses to focus on each year are not always particularly "sexy" or exciting, but they are always issues that have a significant impact on the lives of many New Mexicans. I'm extremely proud (and lucky) to intern here, and I plan to stay connected and keep up with their work even after my internship is over. 
Think New Mexico	264669		/users/profile/353393	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	10/16/2015	As a former recipient of the New Mexico Lottery Scholarship, I am grateful for Think New Mexico's success in getting a law passed that requires 30% of state lottery revenues go to student scholarships for college education. Having the lottery scholarship allowed me to focus on school and not have to worry about massive student load debt.  With the news of the lottery scholarship struggling to fully fund the rising cost of tuition, Think New Mexico's ongoing fight to keep the 30% mandate in place is extremely important, especially in the interest of the lottery's intended statutory purpose; to maximize dollars for scholarships!

Think New Mexico	262482		/users/profile/351162	Writer	Donor	5	10/08/2015	A few years ago my frustration with local volunteer efforts (specifically, safety culture in rural volunteer fire departments, and enforcement practices at the state level) impelled me to learn more about the underlying politics of the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission (PRC)...which led me to Think New Mexico's efforts at PRC reform. Many may quip "you can't legislate common sense", but Think New Mexico's varied and diverse efforts just may be an exception to that old saying.  Thank you!
Think New Mexico	261378	2	/users/profile/349979	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	10/03/2015	A close friend, a Washington lawyer/power broker and a part-time Santa Fe  resident, once told me he believed Think New Mexico should be a "blueprint" for good government think-tanks in every state in the union. I agree. Strictly and doggedly non-partisan, TNM researches and tackles issues that are in the interests of the citizens of New Mexico, not our elected officials. The ethics of this organization are beyond reproach, which is refreshing, commendable, and rare. Without TNM and it's founder-director Fred Nation, things would be much different in the Land of Enchantment: - We would have no full-day kindergarten- We would have a food tax- We would not have the strategic water reserve- The PRC would still be running amok and cheating the residents of the state at every level- There would be no Lottery Reform movement- There would be no Title Insurance reform Currently they are working on: - Smaller Schools- Health Care Affordability- Protecting New Mexico's Lottery Scholarships - Addressing the Jobs Crisis in New Mexico - Ending Pay-To-Play Corruption And so much more. As a resident of this state for 23 years, I love New Mexico, but I loathe the politics. Both Democrats and Republicans seem to be hunkered down and entrenched in their own personal agendas, i.e.getting themselves (or their relatives) elected to preserve their stranglehold on The Roundhouse. Think New Mexico (and particularly Fred Nathan) holds their feet to the fire and forces them to work for the public good. I urge you to support this organization any way you can.   
Think New Mexico	258920		/users/profile/347449	herveyj	Donor	5	09/22/2015	Think New Mexico selects issues that benefit NM citizens politically and economically and then  forges  the bipartisan coalition to enact enabling legislation.  New Mexicans are much better off because Think New Mexico 's staff and board are so attuned to what needs to happen to improve the quality of life in the State and is so effective.
Think New Mexico	258726	1	/users/profile/347254	egfisher	Donor	5	09/21/2015	Think New Mexico is one of the most effective non-profit organizations I have encountered that is committed to improving the way that state government serves all its people. The think tanks success in achieving the concrete legislative results it seeks is thanks to its particularly thorough, principled, big-picture, non-ideological approach to issues of urgent public interest. A diverse, cross-partisan board and dynamic organizational structureemploying a small, talented staff and rotating cast of accomplished interns and volunteersensure the consistently high quality of the policy proposals Think New Mexico produces. And, importantly, the organization ensures that these well-researched proposals are not resigned to the desk-drawer graveyards of the political class, but earn their due attention, regularly contributing key perspectives toward productive solutions in such complex areas as education, poverty, natural resources, and bureaucratic corruption and reform. I am honored to have contributed modestly to help keep this organization doing its important work, and I raise a grateful voice on behalf of fellow New Mexicans for the ways it continues to positively affect our lives.
Think New Mexico	257275		/users/profile/345682	Writer	Board Member	5	09/15/2015	The Board and Staff of Think New Mexico are intelligent, motivated, and diligent in their aim to improve the lives of New Mexicans by addressing the difficult issues impacting our people.

Think New Mexico	250757		/users/profile/338646	lloera	Professional with expertise in this field	4	07/31/2015	Think New Mexico has been an effective partner to work with particularly with all health-related legislation. They have the ability to organize and disseminate information in a timely manner because of their large network in the entire state.  Because of Think New Mexico and its collaboration with other partners, we now have a transparent health care website where people can shop for health care plans based on pricing and quality. Thank you! 
Think New Mexico	247284		/users/profile/334796	Elizabeth184	General Member of the Public	5	07/02/2015	Think New Mexico does excellent research (which they clearly explain in lay terms in their detailed newsletters), works on a broad range of issues that affect all New Mexicans, and is uniquely effective in winning bipartisan support in the legislature.  They have accomplished so much and never rest between sessions, always gearing up for the next problem to tackle and solve!
Think New Mexico	87226		/users/profile/97856	Dorothy D.	General Member of the Public	5	04/26/2011	Think New Mexico takes on issues that both sides of the political spectrum would like to ignore. They make sure the questions that need to be answered continue to be asked.
Think New Mexico	54949		/users/profile/56914	Sydney W.	Volunteer	5	10/20/2010	I was an intern with Think New Mexico during the summer of 2010.  More than anything, the internship introduced me to the intricate political environment of New Mexico. Through researching potential initiatives and being involved in everything from helping to compose letters to the editor to sitting in on relevant Legislative Committee meetings, I learned about the government process in a very realistic setting that could never be emulated in a classroom.  Before the internship, I had very little knowledge of politics in NM, however, afterwards I felt on even footing (well, at least one step closer) to my parents who have been involved in state politics for twenty five years.  TNM's internship actually made interns feel needed by fostering an inclusive and positive office environment.  I would highly recommend TNM's internship to others interested in non-profit and political work in NM!
Think New Mexico	54860		/users/profile/56798	Karen Phillips	Donor	5	10/19/2010	As a New Mexican living in New York City, I have found in Think New Mexico the best investment of my charitable dollars in terms of having a lasting impact on the residents and environment of my home state. Each time Think New Mexico takes on a new issue - lottery reform, water rights, school reform - I marvel at their ability to garner support across the political spectrum. I appreciate Think New Mexico's focus as an organization, sticking to the issues they have committed to, even when it means forgoing new, perhaps sexier, campaigns. The fact that they have managed so many policy successes with a shoe-string staff further attests to the efficiency of their organizational model. 
Think New Mexico	54761		/users/profile/56547	Emma H.	Volunteer	5	10/14/2010	I've had an amazing experience interning at Think New Mexico for the past two summers, during which Ive witnessed firsthand the impact that a dedicated non-profit can have on improving life for New Mexicans. It was very encouraging to work alongside a staff that truly and passionately cares about the well being of New Mexicans, and is willing to work so hard though research and advocacy to actually see results. In addition to the good work Ive witnessed at Think New Mexico, I also gained substantial of experience as a student intern learning about how non-profits work and also getting a chance to do my own research and contribute my own ideas to initiatives and reports. Think New Mexico creates an atmosphere for interns and volunteers that promotes learning and gives New Mexicans a chance to see how we can make a difference.
Think New Mexico	54650		/users/profile/56255	Arik B.	Volunteer	5	10/08/2010	I interned at Think New Mexico during the summer of 2010. As an intern, I did research on issues that the organization is currently focusing on as well as potential future topics. I also helped Think New Mexico with their fund raising and sat in on meetings with various political leaders in New Mexico.During my time at Think New Mexico, I was able to see and experience the impact that the organization has on the state. A goal-oriented think tank that doesn't get involved in partisan politics, Think New Mexico always has a bold approach to get their issues heard and accepted.Fred Nathan, Kristina Fisher, and the rest of the Think New Mexico staff are pragmatic, open-minded, and willing to do what it takes to get the job done. From its campaign against the passage of the food tax to its defense of small schools for all children in New Mexico,  the organization fights every day for the well-being of New Mexicans.
Offcenter Community Arts Project	319556		/users/profile/107775	Margaret L.	Board Member	5	11/28/2016	As a volunteer for OFFCenter during 8 years (as an event volunteer, Board member, interim Exec. Dir, floor sweeper and toilet cleaner) I appreciate OFFCenter as a valuable place where every person is welcomed and encouraged to participate creatively to the fullness of their ability, free of  charge and without prejudice.  I also love finding great treasures for gifts in the retail shop and knowing 80% of the purchase price directly supports the artist.
Offcenter Community Arts Project	143142		/users/profile/107775	Margaret L.	Volunteer	5	11/27/2012	I am lucky enough to be a regular volunteer at different OFFCenter events or in the open studio .  There is no other place where I see the mix of people interacting together in one place as I do in OFFCenter.  The urge to create and to appreciate creativity draws people to OFFCenter. It is a comfortable place for anyone who goes there that makes you want to return and meet more people or explore some new kind of creative expression.  It's also a wonderful place to find beautiful and one of a kind treasures that are affordable, and sometimes you can meet  the person who made it too! 
Offcenter Community Arts Project	93599		/users/profile/107775	Margaret L.	Volunteer	4	07/08/2011	I've been a volunteer for different events at OFFCenter for several years.  Particularly one of their biggest and most fun annual events is the We Art The People Folk Fest in Robinson Park in September.  I volunteer all day, starting with getting people ready for the giant puppet parade.  It's great because anyone from the community can come to participate and wear or carry a puppet and people who do have lots of fun.  Other people just enjoy watching the parade in the park.  During the day I have volunteered in the 'kids' art tent (sometimes old people are kids too) where there are several projects that kids can do and take away during the day long art festival.  Some years I have volunteered in the Board tent telling people about all the other great art making, learning and sharing opportunities available at OFFCenter (which is located just across the street from where the festival is) and selling items to benefit OFFCenter.  During the festival there are different local music and entertainment acts and about 100 local art vendors all selling their own handmade work. The idea of OFFCenter is to make art very accessible, both from the artist side - so the fee for vendors to participate in this event are a fraction of the cost for most festivals like this one - and also the participant side, so there are things sold for a whole range of prices.  I have also volunteered in the food booths and also as general set up for the whole park prior to the festival (which is much more work than one would expect).  This is a great annual event in Albuquerque and it's lots of fun to see so many (about 3,000) people come and enjoy it and for lots of them to learn about OFFCenter and then come back to the center at another time.  Volunteering at OFFCenter can take some patience because there are so many things happening, but it has helped me to be more tolerant of a little chaos, and the results are worth it.

Offcenter Community Arts Project	163020		/users/profile/183896	Georgia5	Client Served	4	07/18/2013	Off Center is still my favorite NP. I've made life long friends there and like an old friend it is there for all who need it!!  Volunteered there for several years and was also a client served. Both were wonderfully enriching experiences.
Offcenter Community Arts Project	146773		/users/profile/183896	Georgia5	General Member of the Public	4	12/15/2012	Off Center is fantastic. They do so much to help those less fortunate. I think the fact that people of all ages and economic backgrounds come together and share in their knowledge is rare. I like that!! I have meet some of the most wonderful artisans there.Learned to knit from a woman in the hands on workshop and now make scarves for people as gifts ( family and the homeless). Also was able to sell a few paintings which was a real boost. Everyone gives of themselves to help other people and this is a real service to the whole community. I volunteered there for several years doing things like cleaning, setting out snacks & sorting. it made me feel like an important part of something bigger than myself. I like to buy things from the shop to support the center and the artists .Now days I see a new group of people growing. 
Offcenter Community Arts Project	145806		/users/profile/192379	victorious	General Member of the Public	5	12/03/2012	I love Off Center! The staff is always around to help me out and support others in finding materials and guiding them towards new and fun classses and workshops. I always feel at home whenever I walk in the door and so uplifted for coming and reuniting with my creative self. Definitely a 'you must go to Off Center' if you haven't already- one of the best places ABQ has to offer!!
Offcenter Community Arts Project	145050		/users/profile/183281	Barbara91	Board Member	5	11/30/2012	OFFCenter is a great place.  Walking in for the first time I was welcomed immediately by staff and volunteers.  Everyone was busy making art, all kinds.  The level of activity was staggering and the art on display all over the studio took me by surprise.  Friends had recommended the OFFCenter classes on jewelry making and bead making but nothing could prepare me for the range of activities.  This is truly a place where anyone, regardless of their age or income status can come make art for free.  In addition it offers artists a place to display and sell their art.  You can be a first time artist or struggling artist, no one cares and no one judges.  OFFCenter is all about serving the community.  
Offcenter Community Arts Project	144897		/users/profile/191447	Chamizal M.	Client Served	5	11/30/2012	OffCenter has given me the confidence to allow myself to be creatively expressive.  I have found such encouragement and support for my art work.  I credit OffCenter for many new friendships, opportunities for volunteering and connecting me to our community in a unique way.  I remember the first time I came to OffCenter, Marcia asked me if I wanted  to create something.  I remember feeling shy - but surprised at how being asked really opened me up.  
Offcenter Community Arts Project	144781		/users/profile/191325	Barbara99	Donor	5	11/30/2012	This non-profit offers a creative home to people of all strata.  The classes are excellent.  This non-profit offers the kind of healing community so much needed in this particular time.
Offcenter Community Arts Project	143908		/users/profile/190401	clancyfrances	Volunteer	5	11/28/2012	My initial interaction with OFF Center was hearing great things about it from friends.  When my artist friend Teddy decided to donate her extensive art supplies, I suggested that she donate them to OFF Center.  We packed my car to the ceiling and for the first time, I saw OFF Center.  I was quite impressed but for some undefined reason waited another three or so years before I decided to volunteer there.  Mostly what I have done since that day is talk to people.  I love chatting, but more so I enjoy seeing individuals grow.  The environment for producing all types of artwork, the freedom for individuals to direct their work and interacting with artists of all ages to create casual camaraderie is like magic.  I love it all and know I receive far more than I give.
Offcenter Community Arts Project	143587		/users/profile/190049	David Gick	Board Member	5	11/27/2012	I first discovered OFFCenter in 2004, shortly after I moved to Albuquerque.  My first five years here were very rough;  I was assaulted shortly after moving here and could'nt find steady employment.  OFFCenter gave me a job as a maintenance person and a place to sell my jewelry creations.  I've met many fine people there who have become like family to me.  OFFCenter gave me hope during hard times and kept me going.  I know there are many others with similar stories.  There are many disadvantaged people with true artistic talent and great character.  OFFCenter provides these individuals with an outlet for expression and the opportunity to sell their creations.  In addition, the organization is a true community where people can learn, teach, collaborate, network, and just plain make friends.  There's even a little food for those who are hungry.  I am now employed full-time as a veterinary technician and make a little money selling my jewelry on the side.  I am an OFFCenter success story, and I know there are many others.  I believe in OFFCenter so much that I joined the Board of Directors!  OFFCenter is truly one of Albuquerque's bright spots! 
Offcenter Community Arts Project	143470		/users/profile/189928	Susan Tische	Client Served	5	11/27/2012	I first discovered OffCenter 8 years ago when I met several people who worked there as employees and others as clients. I quickly became a client myself as I found a very warm and welcoming staff and visitors. I was mentored by several people and it helped me through some tough times. Sharing our different views and techniques of art and what it means to us individually was, and is,  the most enlightening experience I have had.  I continue to this day to be encouraged by the visitors who come by to get lost for a few moments in their personal art making.  I have participated in many open juried shows that are always fun and colorful offering all who participate a new experience of exhibiting and the possibility of selling that work.  There is also a gallery shop where artist may offer their works for sale creating another level of opportunity. Between the shop and the shows there is such a variety of art to examine, encourage and inspire any visitor, budding or seasoned artist.  There are also workshops offered--low-cost or no-cost!--with many different mediums and techniques including sewing, printmaking (my favorite), painting, puppet/mask making, found object sculpture making including metal, bottles, wire, bottle tops, etc....          I volunteer often offering my time to assist others who would like to learn a new form of art making which has opened up the opportunity to actually teach  organized workshops (and get paid a small stipend--greatly appreciated).  The organization is run with a small, yet dedicated staff, but there is always tasks to be done to help the day-to-day operation. Setting up shows, openings, neatening the materials is something I assist with as well.  There are some student/service individuals who get credit, pay or both for their work at the center and this always adds additional liveliness with their smiles, infinite energy and helpfulness that is so essential to the atmosphere.   The center is open to all who want to make art--families, individuals, all abilities, socioeconomic status and several social workers bring their clients--all are welcome to make art, interact, participate in shows enriching everyone's experience at the center.    Almost all materials, equipment and supplies--even furniture-- is donated to the center.  This type of service oriented center is one of several that dot the map of the States and Canada and I am so thankful that such a place as OffCenter is in my community.
Offcenter Community Arts Project	143447		/users/profile/189903	gloriag	Volunteer	5	11/27/2012	OFFCenter provides an open studio for all to come and explore their creativity.   Although I don't have a creative bone in my body, everytime I have been to OFFCenter or participated in any of their events, everyone is very friendly and welcoming.   This type of atmosphere makes you want to keep coming back.
Offcenter Community Arts Project	143287		/users/profile/189730	Venae W.	Board Member	5	11/27/2012	When I first moved to Albuquerque, I needed to meet and be around fellow artists. I never anticipated finding a studio where I be part of the community. This community is made up of handicapped, elderly, children, homeless, along side of career artists. There is a networking amongst everyone that encourages and supports new artists. This is a unique situation for people who do not have the means to purchase art supplies or a place to work.  Something constructive for some people who want to improve their lives in a positive way. 
Offcenter Community Arts Project	143226	1	/users/profile/189665	Karen143	Volunteer	5	11/27/2012	An amazing open art studio, OFFCenter Community Arts Project  welcomes all comers who want to make art in a welcoming, safe and creative atmosphere!  Free art materials, work space and peer mentors as we learn from one another in various art media:  drawing and painting, print-making, knitting/crocheting, jewelry and metal creating- a special theme throughout the 11 year history is "recycled" art - an art piece from odds and ends!  Now this widespread theme is called "re-purposing", but I feel certain OFFCenter in a small way has led the way for many artists, new and experienced, to create from "just stuff".  For myself, I am grateful for the many friendships enjoyed over the years with folks from all parts of our community and all levels of economic position, including homeless and near-homeless.  The only boundaries in this hospitable community are those of respect for others.  As a volunteer and participant, I know OFFCenter keeps going on a very tight budget with only 3 parttime staff - almost miraculous!

I was taken to OFFCenter  by a friend to explore the open studio space.  She thought the studio with its  varied materials and people making art would help my creative process.  She also pushed/encouraged me to put a piece in one of the OFFCenter shows.  I did.  It sold.   For me, it offered a save place to begin showing my work to others and offered me resources and information helpful to new artists and those looking to sell more of their work.  The open studio is a wonderful welcoming space for everyone in the community.  It is a truly inclusive community space and that is its magic.  Making art together truly builds bridges.   
Offcenter Community Arts Project	140924		/users/profile/187141	made.annie	Client Served	4	11/17/2012	I love coming to OFf Center when I can find the time. I usually curl up on a cozy armchair with my embroidery and listen to all the little conversations going on around me or the shuffling of other people's work or the keys of the piano being tinkered by anyone generous enough to share their talent. I've met lovely people here and this community center has served exactly the purpose I hoped it would. It provides a creative and social environment where I can work on my art in the company of others. Working in my home studio can get quite lonely at times. Much of the time I struggle with my mental well-being and having a place to be life OFF Center is very helpful to me. I am also grateful for the wealth of donated supplies and tools that OFF Center provides access to. It really allows for creative freedom and growth.

Starting first in a small storefront, it is now housed in a large storefront that includes exhibits of art made by participants which are for sale and an art space for exhibits created by all and any of us who wish to participate.  It's a lift of spirit to be there whatever your choice and level of skill.    
Offcenter Community Arts Project	138012		/users/profile/184051	Wendy Fabian	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/13/2012	 For the past year or so I have contributed my time and skills toward making the frame shop at the center more user friendly.  During that time I have taught the rudiments of matting and frame building to many artists who frequent the center.  I have also participated in several workshops, art shows and activities that opened up new possibilities to me as an artist.  In all these activities I was supported with wonderful help, encouragement and appreciation from the staff and other clients.  The best part of my experience there is that I met and worked alongside many people I would not otherwise have crossed paths with.  The fact that the center is open to everyone is a most beautiful thing.  It enriches us all.  I have dreamed of creating a place like this,  and I am grateful to be a part of this symbiosis.

I found the space and the staff to be very inviting and inclusive of artists of all ranges of age, ability, and economic status.  Some years later, I began to take the drawing class, and have found a new community of people that I probably would not have met under other circumstances.  OffCenter is a place where people mix, talk, and share common experience despite the widely varying circumstances of their personal lives.  It is a very supportive atmosphere that encourages creative expression in everyone who drops by.

It was a wonderful setting to talk about Art and Science education surrounded by all kinds of art explorations in different colors and materials, from crayons to yarn to computers.

The Center is open to the public and provides a workspace for individual artists, groups of artists as well as for long term projects. One can participate in workshops in music, drawing, writing and various media whether you are a professional or a beginner. One of the projects I have participated in are the fantastic We Art The People Folk Arts Festival which is held once a year and includes weeks of preparation with people coming together to work on puppets and other art projects, music, and art in the park. I have offered workshops at OffCenter including one called EAK which was the Experimental Art Klub. People came together once a month to learn about and emulate various artists. This workshop was intended to offer artists an opportunity to get away from their usual media and methods and to experiment in another artists' consciousness. A big hit! OffCenter is a place that I know I can drop in anytime and find friends working on projects and trying out new things. It's great.

When we started looking we kept hearing about Harvest Ministries which was doing so much good for our community and the surrounding counties.  We asked if they could use additional support and were informed that they had far more need than they had the resources for.  They feed over 20,000 people a month over a three county area and partner about 18 other agencies to help them!  We held a food drive five years ago donating over 2,000 pounds of food and have done one every year since with the drives getting bigger every year to help them out.

Harvest Ministries of Roswell	126956		/users/profile/171989	EMPenewit	Volunteer	5	10/18/2012	Harvest Ministries is a Christ lead help for many spiritially and physically hungery people.  I enjoy volunteering here.  The staff and the other volunteers are warm servants of God.  Many more hands and hearts are needed to serve the people of Roswell with needed food,   helping with job searches, and praying with them.  I find that I benefit with more blessings from our clients each time I come to help.
Harvest Ministries of Roswell	126931		/users/profile/171959	Manfred	Board Member	5	10/18/2012	As a Board member of Harvest Ministries these past 6 years I have witnessed first hand the difference this faith based non profit organization is making in Chaves, Eddy and Lincoln counties.  Eighteen agencies received almost 500,000 lbs. of food in 2011.  Over 7,000 person were served at the Ministry Center last year and were fed both physically and spiritually.  The homeless are able to receive food, take a shower and have their clothes washed all in a caring and professional manner and environment.  Pastor Rubie's vision of helping those in need by reaching out to the less fortunate in our community is being realized at Harvest Ministries on a daily basis.

Harvest Ministries of Roswell	126570		/users/profile/171581	brkc816	General Member of the Public	5	10/17/2012	Harvest Ministries of Roswell is a well-run organization that helps other organizations in our area.  They help their clients with food assistance; job skills training; and financial, personal, and Biblical counseling.  They also distribute food that they receive (either from donations or from a larger food bank) to smaller food pantries in nearby towns and cities.  Harvest Ministries is well-known in our community as a place where people can get help.  When our local church closed its doors, we gave Harvest Ministries most of the money in our bank account because of how much they help the entire community.
Harvest Ministries of Roswell	126551		/users/profile/171563	Karen102	Volunteer	5	10/17/2012	I'm an interviewer at Harvest, so get to chat w/the people who come for help, whether it be food, bus passes, counseling or prayer--sometimes a combination of these!  So many ppl are hurting financially and emotionally and leave happier and more encouraged than when they walked in the door.  Over and over I hear how "blessed" they feel knowing that such a caring ministry is there for them when there is more month at the end of the money!

Harvest Ministries of Roswell	126088		/users/profile/171178	rmji	Volunteer	5	10/16/2012	Harvest Ministries is such a vital ministry in our community.  The needs being met here are not just physical hunger, but spiritual hunger and emotional hunger as well.  I want to express that I have not just been a volunteer with Harvest before, but I have been blessed by this ministry in a time of need for my own family.  We have all experienced times of struggle in our lives when we just needed someone to come along side of us to lend their arms of love to help and encourage us onward.  I thank God for this ministry and its volunteers who strive to show the love of Jesus to all who walk through their doors!
Harvest Ministries of Roswell	125952		/users/profile/171089	4everinhim	Donor	5	10/16/2012	Harvest Ministries is one of those ministries where there is more than meets the eye.  Although it is primarily concerned with meeting people's phyiscal needs by providing food, it also serves to meet people's emotional and spiritual needs as well.  Harvest volunteers seek to ministry the love the Jesus to its client's above all things.  They desire not only to meet people's physical needs with food, but their emotional need that all people have to be loved.  They try to show each and every client that no matter their need, Jesus loves and cares for them, and so do the people of Harvest Ministries.   Harvest also tries to meet the spiritual needs of people by ministering the message of forgiveness of sin by the sacrifice and blood of Jesus Christ on their behalf.  The volunteers seek to help people find forgiveness and healing in Jesus and a relationship with the Creator that made and gave His Son to redeem them.   The Harvest Center is amazingly designed to meet the needs of its clients and the staff and volunteers are trained well to support its individual clients needs.  
Harvest Ministries of Roswell	125532		/users/profile/170743	shells	Volunteer	5	10/15/2012	For those families and individuals in our area who are suffering from devastating setbacks or are just struggling to survive, Harvest Ministries has provided wise counsel, nutritious food assistance, and an opportunity to plug into the life-changing healing and hope to be found in the Gospel of Jesus Christ.  I started volunteering at Harvest Ministries about 7 years ago and have had many enriching and encouraging encounters with the precious people Harvest ministers to on a daily basis.  I have had the privilege of sorting coats and doing laundry for our homeless population and I helped with the interior planning and design of our new Ministry Center in 2010.  I have worked with the Pantry Ladies filling grocery bags for our clients who walk in the front door, and I've worked with the freight staff to process donated food and dispense it to the 18 Partner Agencies who make it possible for more of our struggling families, children, youth, homeless, senior citizens, and veterans to be reached with nutritious food choices.  Harvest is makiing a huge difference!
Harvest Ministries of Roswell	125526		/users/profile/170735	janejj	Volunteer	5	10/15/2012	My experience at Harvest Ministry has been very rewarding.  I feel we're meeting a real and vital need of our less fortunate neighbors.  I also find the folks I work with are good humored, very kind and a joy to share time with.  God bless this community outreach.
Harvest Ministries of Roswell	125003		/users/profile/170112	rlirmen	Volunteer	5	10/10/2012	As a local pastor in Roswell, NM I have seen first hand the impact that Harvest Ministries makes to people each and every day.  Not only to those who enter the doors of Harvest Ministries each week, but have seen the impact to local ministries in Roswell who are supported by and partner with Harvest Ministries to meet the needs of hungry, desperate, and hurting people.  Also each time I am able to volunteer or be a part of a volunteer opportunity, I am always blessed and impressed with how organized each department of the ministry is conducted.  Harvest Ministries is a true reflection of Matthew 25: 37 - 40
Harvest Ministries of Roswell	124929		/users/profile/170004	lkdirks	Volunteer	5	10/09/2012	I have volunteered for Harvest Ministries for 3 years and have found this ministry to one of great importance in Roswell and surrounding communities!  Pastor Rubie has instilled in his volunteers and each person who enters the doors the importance of meeting people's physical needs with food, their emotional needs with encouragement, and their spiritual needs with prayers and scripture.  Pastor Rubie goes the extra mile in each contact he has, developing Harvest to be a well oiled ministry. 
Harvest Ministries of Roswell	124915		/users/profile/169992	Chris2200	Donor	5	10/09/2012	They helped more people than I ever imagined. When I toured the facility I was impressed with how organized everything was from the freezers to the details that are taken during client interviews. I personally saw the real care the receptionist and interviewer and director took with each client. All treated with respect and as unique individuals in unique predicaments. They do not see this as a cookie cutter operation where a client is a number, but as a way to come alongside families each in unique situations and give them the hand up that they need to press on.

Harvest Ministries of Roswell	124898		/users/profile/169966	Pat D.	Volunteer	4	10/09/2012	Harvest Ministries of Roswell, NM       I have been a volunteer at Harvest Ministries for the last two years.  Even though food goes out the front door for hurting families, it is much more.  Individuals are prayed for and encouraged in every day needs.  One of my favorite memories is finding a cake that would work for a wedding cake after a young couple had been counciled, loved on, prayed for and given food.  It felt good to be a part of the happy moments of life.  Many come in feeling defeated and alone.  Sometimes they need a kind word and a hug as much as they need food.
Harvest Ministries of Roswell	124710		/users/profile/169682	Fish11	Board Member	5	10/06/2012	Harvest Ministries is a crucial faith based organization for the town of Roswell, New Mexico and surrounding communities. The ministry provides food, clothing, counseling and spiritual guidance for people in need. Without Harvest Ministries there would be a serious hole in the safety net for families in distress. Many people have been given hope and encouragement by the efforts of Harvest Ministries as well as a helping hand in order to have a brighter future.
Harvest Ministries of Roswell	124709		/users/profile/169681	Hector Torres	Client Served	5	10/06/2012	These people are outstanding! As a client, we are all so greatful for their heart to help us. Whenever they have food available they call us so we can distribute it to our neighborhood. Last week we were able to help 55 families thanks to their support. They have helped us be more active in our community.

Peach's Neet Feet	217615	2	/users/profile/281153	DeeKelemen	Volunteer	5	09/26/2014	I'll be a volunteer painter for PeachsNeetFeet. I'll just paint shoes for sick children. At least that's what I thought. It's more than that; it's not just "shoes". Recently, I've heard PNFs called "mighty and magical" and I believe that now. They're special, one of a kind, hand painted to the children's requests shoes. They have proven to empower these children facing all kinds of tests & treatments. They help these children who are so often ostracized, shy or scared be strong, continue fighting & develop friendships with other kids either in the hospital or when they return to school.  PNF is more than shoes, too. Peachs Neet Feet has Peach Parties around the country bringing families together creating a web of kindness that is far reaching. PNF sends care packages and holiday gifts. They have created Pen Pals so children can have a friend with similar experiences. All in all, Peachs Neet Feet is awesome. They're about spreading kindness & showing the world what "acceptance" of all types should be.  ~dee, PNF Artist

Peach's Neet Feet	240003		/users/profile/326017	Cheryl132	Volunteer	5	03/27/2015	I'm a volunteer Artist for Peachs Neet Feet, for 2 years now. When I started I thought I would just paint some shoes to help some kids. Boy was I wrong, it's so much more than that! Madison (aka Peach) is an amazing young lady that decided she had a mission to help these kids with all the challenges they go through on a daily basis by giving them something fun and exciting to escape even if only for a moment the reality of their life. It has also changed my life to connect with the parents of the kids while working on the art work for their shoes. I see pictures of them, I follow them online and they have touched my heart in so many ways. So when people say what good could come from a silly pair of shoes...well maybe they should check it out. Peachs Neet Feet is amazing! Go on I dare you, your life will never be the same it will change for the better.www.peachsneetfeet.com
Peach's Neet Feet	239955		/users/profile/281490	Laura210	Volunteer	5	03/26/2015	As an artist for Peach's Neet Feet, I can truly testify to how much good this nonprofit does. So many take your money and go, you never know what impact they are having or what is really being done. PNF is not about that. There is a real, actual impact on so many kids that badly just need a reason to smile. It isn't about the shoes (which are incredible by the way), it is about the love that is poured into each pair. It is about the kindness, the heart, the reason. It is about the incredible, warrior, truly amazing children that deserve a moment to shine, and to think about something besides the battles they face on the daily. I LOVE PEACHS NEET FEET!!!!!!
Peach's Neet Feet	217940		/users/profile/281490	Laura210	Volunteer	5	09/27/2014	Peachs Neet Feet is one of the few nonprofits that give a real, tangible and immediate change to a child's life. They provide them with unconditional love, acknowledgment and joy. It's not just a pair of custom shoes. It's bravery, love, support and a much needed smile. It isn't random dollars going to who knows where. It's heartfelt donations that go to supporting individual children on a heart to heart and face to face basis when they need it most. Stumbling on this nonprofit has brought more joy to my life then I ever thought possible, it doesn't just benefit the children, it benefits all of us who get to participate on a soul basis. 
Peach's Neet Feet	239935		/users/profile/284974	DeeK	Volunteer	5	03/26/2015	Peach's Neet Feet creates not only magical shoes to help children face medical challenges but also creates a community of families, other non-profits & volunteers.

Peach's Neet Feet	239934		/users/profile/325929	Kelly167	Volunteer	5	03/26/2015	I'm a volunteer artist for Peach's Neet Feet. I can't tell you how rewarding this is to participate with this organization in even the smallest of ways. It is a daily reminder that small gestures can make huge ripples and changes in a life, a community and the world. It has brightened my life to know that I am creating something that will serve as a touchstone for the children receive them and the parents as well. My own children are also embracing the concept and it is reinforcing in them the values I have striven to share with them. Helping others makes a difference. It is good to be kind. Strength and grace are qualities to admire. Life is not always easy, but it is beautiful and there is more to a person that what you see. I am honored to be an artist for Peach's. 
Peach's Neet Feet	236714	2	/users/profile/320773	Janet12345	General Member of the Public	1	01/12/2015	While receiving my chemotherapy treatments, I filled out the application and made my design. I never received the shoes, but what's more troubling is that my emails have been ignored multiple times, both during my hospitalization and afterward. This resorted to myself civilly posting onto their Facebook page inquiring about why I have not been responded to. To my surprise, my post was deleted and I was BANNED from PNF's Facebook page. I found this insulting. I was able to finally reach out to the founder, who explained how my application was probably lost in the mail. Even if my application was lost in the mail, my emails STILL should have been acknowledged and been responded to. This was so discouraging to be fighting for your life in the hospital while being ignored by an organization you were waiting to hear from. This makes me sad for any child or growing adult who could have had their applications lost in the mail that are looking forward to receiving their shoes. Overall, the most suspicious thing is that my emails have been ignored and I was banned from their Facebook page, when I should have been immediately helped and apologized to. Talk about censorship, will this review somehow get deleted too? Very horrible experience.
Peach's Neet Feet	234506		/users/profile/299804	Kevin114	Client Served	5	11/26/2014	My son was diagnosed with Osteosarcoma three months ago. Since his diagnosis, life has been stressful to say the least. One of the highlights of this period were the custom shoes sent by PNF. This is such a great organization helping so many in their most difficult times. 
Peach's Neet Feet	234485		/users/profile/299493	Tracy79	Client Served	5	11/25/2014	It started out with a pair of shoes.  My son had a very difficult year with a major surgery, and we found Peachs Neet Feet and applied for a pair for him.  He received a very magical pair of shoes, handpainted with obvious love for him.  He loved them and they became his only pair of shoes.  We then attended a Peach party, and met Madison, the founder of Peachs Neet Feet, as well as some of her crew.  We met other families, other warrior children battling many different kinds of battles.  We created a life changing bond with every one there.  We learned a new way to look at others, a new way to give back, a new way to love.  With these shoes, our whole perception of life changed.  This is a very special organization that is near and dear to our heart.

Peach's Neet Feet	217663	1	/users/profile/281200	djhmt5	Volunteer	5	09/26/2014	I started painting for Peach's Neet Feet a few months ago and it has really changed me as a person. I was raised to be compassionate, but joining Peach's crew I feel has made my heart grow three sizes bigger! My awareness and knowledge of all the illnesses that the PNF fighters face daily has increased ten fold. Personally, when I saw the little girl who was sporting the shoes that I had designed and painted for, I was moved to tears. In a world with so many evils, Peach's Neet Feet has without a doubt has helped me to see the good. It is a wonderful cause and I am truly honored to be a part of it!
Peach's Neet Feet	217657	1	/users/profile/281195	Maryrose S.	Volunteer	5	09/26/2014	Peach's Neet Feet  is a wonderful organization.  My daughter received her Neet Feet kicks over the summer and wears them almost every day.  They were personialized with things she loves, and they even have her name.  She loves to tell people all about the shoes and PNF.  They make her feel good!  We are truly grateful for programs like this that bring a little sunshine to a bad situation.

These beautiful children with these beautiful souls, they have so much to say in such little time to say it. Being able to express what they love through artwork , we as artists poor a little bit of our soul into each pair of shoes we paint!  The smiles these shoes bring to the children's faces is all worth it!  This is an amazing organization!

It  is amazing to see her's and others art specified to each child's request!   But it doesn't just end there...these volunteers do much more for these kids and their families.  They are raising awareness of childhood cancer, awareness of children with diseases that make them different - they aren't really and deserve love and compassion as well...a wonderful charity.

It is so much more than a pair of shoes. The shoes are just a small gift that starts the weaving of people that need to be celebrated and given hope, and the simple gift of a smile. PNF laces these people together to build stronger micro and and macro communities that are ready to create change by paying it forward and simply caring for each other!

A Room of Her Own Foundation	172593		/users/profile/228551	stefanielipsey	Client Served	5	09/30/2013	AROHO is a fantastic organization that is dedicated to serving writers at all stages of development. I recently attended their retreat at Ghost Ranch in New Mexico and it more than met my expectations.  I had the privilege to work with some of the most talented and supportive people I have ever met.   I walked away not only inspired, but with practical tools that I will continue to use.  I give AROHO the highest recommendation possible. 
A Room of Her Own Foundation	170211		/users/profile/225533	Ramona R	Volunteer	5	09/17/2013	I learned about AROHO in 2005 when I was first "coming out" as a writer. What a supportive and amazing organization. They put the "unity" in "community" for me. I can't say enough about what this organization has meant to me and countless other women artists. This is why I volunteered with them to begin a small version of their biennial conference in Texas--to spread the word.
A Room of Her Own Foundation	169470		/users/profile/224558	Monica39	Client Served	5	09/12/2013	New Mexico lives up to its name, the Land of Enchantment, and AROHO exceeded all expectations. The unknown poet in me surfaced, my pages filled with notes, ideas, words. My purse grew heavy with rocks, leaves, and books. Without the fellowship that I received I wouldn't have been able to attend. In a supportive and nurturing environment all women were encouraged to listen, share, and write. I am blessed to have shared space, time, and words with many amazing women. 
A Room of Her Own Foundation	168981		/users/profile/223953	Teri C	Client Served	5	09/10/2013	My first face-to-face with AROHO began at Ghost Ranch in 2011.  I brought intention and question and left with purpose and answer.  I had found a community of writers, who shared and challenged and accepted me.  I returned home determined and enriched.  Over the next two years I kept in touch with some in the community and often reflected on the impact of this organization and my connection to it on my writing life.  My second face-to-face with AROHO was at Ghost Ranch in 2013.  I brought focus and hope and left with gratitude and commitment.  The women I interacted with, and those who I sat with under the stars, in the places where we ate and read and listened to others read, are individually and collectively my AROHO sisters.  It is this support, this shared dream, this enriching and accepting that makes this organization a unique group for women writers.  AROHO continuously offers guidance, help, support, and acceptance for our writing life.  It is truly a great nonprofit.
A Room of Her Own Foundation	168968		/users/profile/223938	thisbhanu	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/10/2013	I came to AROHO as a writer invited to hold the space for a small group of women writers.  What happened in my first retreat in 2011 was that -- by about the end of the second day -- I realized a space was being held for me too.  This year, 2013, I took another invitation: to evolve what the space could be and to meet others in a space we made together.  I still have very few words (ironically) to describe what happened on the last day of our small group: we went to a river in the Chama wilderness.  And we let something dissolve.  We let go of something: debris, glitter, clay.  There was a verge.  There was magic.  I had a room of my own -- a gift that was immeasurable for many reasons.  Beyond my immediate small group experience, I was very moved by the grace and fierceness of the AROHO community as a whole -- whether at lunch, or in the hot springs, or in the library or during a talk or other offering.  I returned to my life at home feeling braver and more resilient than I had in a long time.  AROHO is about surrender.  It's about not feeling ashamed of your life any more.  It's about healing as much as writing; at least, that's what happened for me.  On the last night, there was dancing.  Normally, I love to dance, but I was exhausted -- in a good way.  In the way that I am after a long travel to India.  This was New Mexico.  I went back to bed and lay there, my heart bursting with gratitude for the day and the week and the journey there and back.  AROHO was magic and chance and connection and love and community and joy.  I recommend it to anyone who wants to connect to what a writing life could truly be.  There is a labyrinth at AROHO.  There is a red thread at its entrance.  See: Ellen McLaughlin's keynote talk, 2013.  There are beautiful, vibrant and immensely compassionate friends.

I'm still struggling to put into words how the week itself affected me - being nurtured with strong women writers, teachers, friends, and all sorts of  superlatives that are simply too weak to explain how I began to take myself seriously as a writer, as a meaning maker, and to innately value my truths. I work 65+ hours a week at my day job, and find myself waking up in the middle of the night, compelled to write. It's been so powerful to uncover what's been there all along.

I'd read about the "creating community" aspect, but thought, "that won't happen for me -- I've never felt part of a community in my life". Well, I do now. Everyone I met was interesting and engaging. I learned more about myself, about my connections to place, and about how I've changed over the years than I thought would be possible in 1 short week. I met so many amazing people there!  I'm counting the weeks until the 2015 Retreat.

And so such gifts often arrive when we most need them - surprising, magical. Like AROHO... which I first came to know while attending their 2011 retreat for women writers: "A Dream of Our Own: Women Writing New, Women Writing True." I have recently returned from their 2013 Retreat for Women Writers which somehow was even more amazing than the retreat in 2013.  And I have thought a lot about how that "somehow" happened to be and this is what I believe: this magic is not accidental. Yes, some of the beauty of AROHO is beyond anyone's control and happens by virtue of the magic of bringing a bunch of creative, smart, generous women together. But AROHO also works because its talented founders, directors, board members and advisors have vision, tenacity, and a deep commitment to their mission AND they are smart about running a non-profit. Some non-profits have great vision but lack great leadership - AROHO is blessed to have both vision and leadership. And we who benefit from this - hundreds of women writers - are blessed in turn.

Immediately following the 1st retreat I attended in 2011, i was convinced nothing could ever surpass my AROHO / GHOST RANCH  experience. Truly it was life altering in so many ways! But I was wrong on it's impact. This year's retreat did surpass my prior experience largely because I was more receptive to all that I cld gain and everything being offered at th e retreat.  Like so many experiences, the retreat seems to improve with each doing and those who attend it are the luckiest beneficiaries. 
A Room of Her Own Foundation	168291		/users/profile/223177	tpryput	Client Served	5	09/07/2013	I was first attracted to AROHO when I read the description for their 2011 retreat which put out a call for women across the writing spectrum to gather and share their strengths, inspirations, and challenges with one another in what felt like a unique structure: everyone would give, everyone would receive. I loved the challenge of putting together ten minutes of something worthy for a Mind Stretch to inspire the group and loved being trusted to teach a small workshop, and loved having the opportunity to do a little poetry consulting.  AROHO opens its arms to wherever a woman writer is on her public trajectory of writing and creates a week long venue where she can literally try out new ways of being and thus emerge redefined. The friendships I fell full heart for are deeply rooted in that bedrock of self-discovery, change and joyful fulfillment--relationships that sustained me the two years until the next retreat and relationships I will have for the rest of my life. I love AROHO's sincere focus on the collaborative beauty of women writers pursuing their dreams, shoulder to shoulder.

Finally this year I was able to attend the amazing retreat. Retreat may be a misleading word in this case; there is more connection than retreat among the women writers. In addition to providing time and support for a very diverse group of women, the organization--in the way that it conducts its business--is a model of generosity and professionalism. And when I say the group is diverse, I mean that in the truest sense of diversity: age, economic background, beginners & professional writers, etc. The economic diversity among the women is one of the things that makes this group unique, in my experience. It is not a retreat for only those who can afford it. AROHO will do everything it can to see that a woman who might be able to afford the conference fee or the travel to a rather out of the way location can be part of AROHO. It is a model of the spirit of generosity.

How does someone cope with that? We only had one car. I would literally be at home with a babystranded. Thankfully, four months after my graduation, a stranger reached out online, encouraging me to come to an AROHO day conference in Austin. I came to the conference with a pad filled with questions, notes, and scribbles, but after hearing Mary Johnson ask us to embrace vulnerability, something pulled my hand into the air, and I asked the question at the heart of all my darkness: I love my daughter and husband, but they tie me here. I cant leave for a residency or a retreat. Heck, we could barely afford this place. I feel stuck. What I do? I want both. Cant I have both? I felt stupid crying in front of an ex-nun. She likely doesnt even have children. I thought. She probably doesnt even get it. I dont remember Marys answer. But I remember the surge of AROHO women who crowded around me. They held my hands, my shoulders. They kissed my face, wrapped their arms around me. They shoved bits of paper in my hands, business cards, bookmarks: This is a virtual residency, one said. This is a writing mother blog. This is my email. Weeping, I held to their scraps of paper like scripture. I had found home again. Since that day, I have found the fortitude to continue with my writing endeavors and be a mother. I have attended the AROHO writing retreat on a much-needed fellowship and made life-long connections.  AROHO has not changed who I am as much as it has awakened me to myself. I never knew how much I missed myself until I came to AROHO.

Before attending their 2011 summer retreat, I was a writer who was too timid to tell people I write.  At that retreat, I encountered wonderful, caring people who encouraged me to feel confident in my words.  I made lasting friendships with women from around the country.  Before this year's retreat, I was nervous. Could it come close to the last one?  To my surprise, it was even more inspirational.  I came away feeling empowered, ready to proudly say I am a writer.  I have completely changed my writing routine. I now get up at 5:45 a.m. to write before going to my middle school teacher job, something I never thought i could do.  AROHO says they are out to transform the lives of creative women -- they are doing just that.

Elisabeth, the director of the Admirable Mother Orphanage in DRC,  took in our son and cared for him until we were able to travel and complete his adoption. The first day she cared for him she noticed that something was wrong. She had blood work drawn and quickly found that he had a parasite in his eye, called an African Eye Worm. We believe that the quick defection of the parasite saved our son his eye sight and possibly his life. Elizabeth also worked tirelessly on our behalf in helping to complete the adoption of our son. During our 9 week stay in DRC we were able to visit the Admirable Mother Orphanage and we were extremely impressed. The children were all well cared for, but what impressed us the most was that fact that we felt as if we were walking into a home, not an institution. We thank God that for the ministry that the EPH Foundation has in the lives of children in DRC and to families who are helped by the foundation during their adoption process.

In addition, leaders of the orphanage and myself began a grant-writing process to find further funding for the project.  The orphanage itself is a safe and healthy community in which vulnerable children in the DRC can find a safe-haven in the bustling metropolis of Kinshasa. All of the individuals involved with the orphanage are dedicated to the cause and left me feeling that these children will grow up to represent a new generation of educated and determined individuals. Elisabeth is an amazing woman who is working hard to ensure the lives of these children are in the best care and that they receive the attention and care needed.  My experience with the orphanage has been nothing but positive and I feel that this project is something that should and could be replicated throughout the DRC to help vulnerable and displaced children.

The unique sense of community that has developed within the orphanage is something that I think will benefit the children for the rest of their lives. As a visitor to the orphanage, I was welcomed into their community and learned how dedicated the members of the orphanage are to the well-being and future of the children. School is the top priority for most of the children, and they spend most of their day either in school or working on homework. The small size of the orphanage and the love provided by the care takers makes the Admirable Mother Orphanage a truly special place where each child receives the attention they need to help them grow both intellectually and emotionally.The orphanage provides a safe-haven for street children in Kinshasa, where the number of vulnerable children is growing due to AIDS and the ongoing conflict in the east of the DRC.

I moved up to Volunteer Coordinator and it was a very fulfilling experience, giving me more hands on knowledge of what the LGBTQ community wants to help with and where we are needed the most.  Again, I made more friends and I also became more confident with myself and was in a position to lead.  it was such a good feeling and through remarks from my volunteers, I learned that I was giving back the same good feeling.  I grew into a Co-Operations Manager position which put me in more authority making decisions for the center.  It has been exciting to see where we can go and it has been fulfilling knowing that I'm helping people out there that were just like me.  I have met so many positive people, both in the LGBTQ community and with allies.  Knowing that I'm helping make a difference in just one person's life can move me to tears.

New Mexico GLBTQ Centers	116250		/users/profile/158266	thespoon	General Member of the Public	5	06/22/2012	I love this place! I don't get to come to the center or to events as often as I'd like to because I'm busy with school and work, but when I do, everyone is so welcoming it doesn't matter if it's my first time or first time in a while. The center provides great information and resources, as well as a safe place to be yourself and meet new people--which is what I really needed when I first moved here not too long ago. It's great to have a community there for you in a variety of ways...Thanks everyone :)
New Mexico GLBTQ Centers	116246		/users/profile/158260	limonista	Volunteer	4	06/22/2012	Working with the volunteers has been a great experience by far.

As a person living with AIDS I am glad to be embraced by the LGBTQ Center and appreciate all of the volunteers for their unsung efforts.

Joy Junction	286988		/users/profile/377060	Kristy_G	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	I donate and like to give even if I have not much. I believe no matter what we are all human and deserve to be treated like one, it hurts my heart for people who have nothing, we don't know their story but that doesn't mean they don't feel. Nobody should go hungry, or cold or homeless.i know what it's like to be without and I have had people do the same for me, we are all equal on this earth we all bleed the same, so I give from my heart because everybody deserves the basics on life and it might not mean much to some but to those it does. I give because that's how it should be togetherness.
Joy Junction	286987	2	/users/profile/377059	Beverly_P	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	In 2009 my world came crashing down. The recession hit and I lost my job, my home and I was living in New Mexico with no family (I'm originally from Ohio) and had barely any friends. My Pastor taught a sermon about giving even when you need the most help. So i intentionally thought what did I have to give in order to be a blessing to someone else. I originally called them because I had a peach tree and before I surrendered my home I want to give all the fruit but unfortunately one day i came home asnd allmy peaches were stolen. At that point of frustration I came up with another plan. I wasn't getting nearly as much unemployment compared to what I was making working but I decided every week out of my unemployment check I would take $20 and bought groceries and dropped them off at Joy Junction. I didn't get generic stuff but i did shop sales so that I could get more. I believe that just because you are in need doesn't mean you cant have the best stuff. I learned that God has still blessed me even though I too was in need so i am blessed enough to help others during this time. When we all fall its our responsibility to lift each other up. I continued to give not asking for a receipt and being anonymous until I moved out of the county. I chose Joy Junction because they weren't just trying to give people food but they care about people's lively They are very active about making sure families aren't on the streets. I love the fact they are Christian based and believe in showing love like Jesus showed for the homeless in His time. I have volunteered at a few places but I love the story behind Joy Junction and this is how I gave back and supported this non-profit agency in away that was meaningful to me. Thank You
Joy Junction	285461		/users/profile/375449	Haydon-Vigas	Client Served	4	04/10/2016	I have stayed at Joy Junction probably around twenty times over the course of several months. I have aleays found Carol and Sophie who assign beds very sensitive and competent; Sandi helpful; Charlitte and Kim and many others there (including the make security guards) to be constantly working (no slouches) and always getting stuff done to make things better for the rest of us. For the most part, I gave found the food to be pretty good - some made with organic ingredients. I have found the sleeping mats, sheets and blankets to be very clean (I have never seen one cockroach anywhere!). My only complaint is that the mats are placed too close together for comfort and even hygiene purposes. The bathrooms are spotless; the area is always patrolled by security so it seems ultra safe. Thank you Jeremy Raynalds for your immense contribution to society!

The mat they gave me was very thin...I am a diabetic and had a low glucose crisis and they couldn't give me any juice..They did drive me to the hospital the next morning. Also, Jeramy Reynalds is prejudice. The news reported that a gay and lesbian organization collected 5000 dollars to donate but Reynalds refused to take it because it was from a G & L organization...I will never donate there...
Joy Junction	123929	2	/users/profile/168692	dschuyler	Volunteer	3	09/30/2012	I volunteer at the shelter weekly, helping serve lunch.   My contacts with staff, i.e. Diana, Blythe, and Barbara in the office have been so warm and positive.   They truly care about the homeless under their care and guidance and treat everyone with kindness.  Helping the less fortunate than myself has truly opened my eyes to the struggles the homeless face daily.   Joy Junction gives them a roof over their heads, a place to clean up, food in their stomachs and a hope for the future. 
Joy Junction	121847	1	/users/profile/165810	mcnally	Volunteer	1	09/03/2012	I did volunteer work at Joy Junction, and had an unpleasant experience. The lady supervising me, Joy, was extremely rude and critical. I stayed busy the whole time, and yet she still criticized the order I was doing things-why does it matter what order I do the tasks in, as long as I am staying busy? There was also paint in the sinks that would simply not come all the way off, and she attacked me for not being able to get the sinks spotless. I was also given a rude look because I declined to lead the prayer when asked, but I am shy and it was my first time there, so I simply did not feel comfortable. I am appalled that a place like a homeless shelter, which is supposed to be compassionate, would treat its VOLUNTEERS this way. People who are freely giving their time, keeping its doors open. The front office was also not warm or friendly. Joy was also rude to the homeless people. I am shocked. I give my time freely and I am attacked by this woman multiple times in a 3 hour period.

When I referred these people to Joy Junction, I knew they would be taken care of.  Winter in Albuquerque is very harsh, the homeless are cared for and given the respect and aid they need.

Joy Junction	101734	3	/users/profile/131123	4remodeling	Client Served	1	12/05/2011	Joy Junction is a very disgusting place, My wife and I stayed there last week and we were given 2 mats to sleep on and 1 blanket, no pillows or towels!     We were assigned mats 22 and 23 right next to the coffee machine table and under the tray return window, this is the most disgusting place to be in any restaurant and we had to sleep there!    As soon as the lights went off the cockroaches came out by the hundreds!    The back of the coffee machine was covered with roaches, the walls were crawling and we were pushing ourselves away from the wall as far as possible!   We didn't get much sleep either between the constant coughing and snoring we were watching the wall for roaches and just feeling creeped out, did I mention how disgusting this place is?    I was wide awake at 4am and wanted a shower, in part 'cause I was feeling kind of crawly and I just plain needed a shower, the attendant told me they didn't have any towels and I should come back at 6am when the next shift came in "they have the towels" ok I sit patiently till 6am and go back up and asked the new shift for a towel "their all dirty, we wont have any till after 9 or 10am". So I cant even take a shower, No sleep, No diner, No shower and I was ready to go at 7am when breakfast was served, 1 packet of flavored oatmeal and a strawberry, I had to wait in line to get milk for my oatmeal and a carton of OJ, I have to admit I drank the coffee and all I could think of was how many roach legs and arms and bodies my coffee had been filtered threw. While I was having breakfast I told the people at the table about our experience and everyone had already known about the coffee machine they told us that the woman sitting beside the machine is paid $25 per week to guard it, they charge $1.00 per cup for roach infested coffee. Thank God the cup I was drinking didn't come out of that machine!
Joy Junction	101716	1	/users/profile/131076	Erica S.	Donor	5	12/05/2011	I recently donated some baby formula after I saw a request on Facebook. I'm glad that they accept material donations instead of just monetary because I have two kids so I always have things to give away. I would rather put my items to good use instead of just throwing them out. Not long after I sent my donation there was another request for baby formula, so I know that my donation was used for someone who needed it. I've got boxes of clothes and I will be using this organization again to put them to good use.

Joy Junction is one of the best organizations I have ever come into contact with. God bless them and their work in our community!

I have seen the children that call this place a home, where they can stay with their family and not worry about being separated.  This year, we brought our church's teens to serve dinner and I was glad the teens were impacted by what they saw at Joy Junction. I can tell you that my own children have learned to appreciate what they have just by seeing first hand what homeless people suffer.  Thank you  Joy Junction!

Joy Junction	56580		/users/profile/59173	Chuck	Donor	5	11/09/2010	Joy Junction serves men, women and families with shelter, food and training when they are in desperate need.  Its van picks up people throughout the Albuquerque area, especially downtown.  Others come on their own -- sometimes in beat-up cars and some with no car at all -- because they have lost their jobs, lost their apartment lease, one adult has moved out, etc.  Joy Junction also has a large clothing store where people in need can receive necessary clothing items, while others can pay to buy and thus support the work.VERY reputable organization admired throughout central New Mexico.  EXCELLENT reputation in every way.  Well known in Albuquerque.

Cancer Awareness Prevalence Prevention and Early Detection	178623		/users/profile/235251	Patricia_Torn	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/17/2013	I have provided training for many of the volunteers at CAPPED to provide support for those with cancer and their loved ones. Never have I encounter more devoted volunteers in the field of cancer support. The same can be said of the executive director who commits the majority of her waking hours to make sure CAPPED is providing the very best services possible to fulfill its mission.  
Cancer Awareness Prevalence Prevention and Early Detection	177744		/users/profile/234324	cricri	Board Member	5	10/15/2013	Being a Board Member of CAPPED has awarded me the opportunity to see, first hand, the tremendous work that is being done to support and help those in the community with cancer and other diseases.

Cancer Awareness Prevalence Prevention and Early Detection	177630	1	/users/profile/234199	AnnieL	Client Served	5	10/14/2013	In July 2012 I was diagnosed with Ovarian 3c cancer. I was stunned but headed off for treatment in Texas.  I live in NM so when I came home I was a long distance from my doctors.  My husband started checking for support groups in my local area and found CAPPED.  He was told I could get wigs, ionic foot baths, massages, and emotional support if I would just visit.  During my first visit Tresa VanWinkle shared stories, helped me find two wigs, supplied me with hats, but mostly made me realize there was help and people who cared about my outcome. These caring people wanted to inform me of ways I could make life more comfortable and healthy.  It has been at least a year since I first visited CAPPED.  The people there are very caring and supportive and go out of their way to assist me.  I am currently getting ionic foot baths at least once a week.  My feet got so bad that I could hardly walk and the foot baths have made a huge difference.  CAPPED offers as much or as little assistance as you need.  Every service I have used there has been no charge.  They are making a huge difference to cancer patients in Otero county.  I would encourage anyone with cancer or other types of illness to go there and benefit from their many services.

Cancer Awareness Prevalence Prevention and Early Detection	174017	1	/users/profile/230234	lfritze	Board Member	5	10/05/2013	It has been such an honor to be associated with CAPPED.  My respect for Tresa and her vision grows with each year I work with her.  CAPPED will continue to gain my respect and financial support for years to come.  It is community based and every dollar stays in Alamogordo and does not go to executives' big salaries and large city agendas.  CAPPED is well-known in Alamogordo and has lots of community support.  Most children remember the Sun Safe Program from school and local parades, health fairs and community-sponsored events.  Many have benefited from free mammograms and treatment if needed.  From nutrition and cooking classes to the development of a Center for Integrative Health CAPPED has lead the way in Alamogordo for cancer prevention and early detection.  
Cancer Awareness Prevalence Prevention and Early Detection	172866	1	/users/profile/228861	Millie4	Volunteer	5	10/02/2013	I began volunteering for CAPPED, Inc., September, 2012.  I traveled 180 miles one way, at my own expense, to be here three days every month to do whatever Tresa needed because I believe so passionately in this cause.  I found, at CAPPED, that every staff member and volunteer is there to help and support anyone that walks through the doors.  You walk through the doors of CAPPED and something magical happens.  I can't explain it, but I know in my heart, this is where I want to be, this is where I need to be.  Going through cancer with my husband and several other family members and friends, I wanted to help people learn how to cope and get through the tragic effects of this terrible disease.  CAPPED and Tresa has helped me to d o this.  I began working at CAPPED as a full time employee in June, 2013.  In addition to my paid hours, I continue to work as volunteer staff several hours a week because being a part of this organization allows me to have the satisfying feeling that maybe I make a difference in other people's lives.  The wonderful feeling I receive when someone says, "Thank you, you have helped me," is one of the most rewarding feelings I could ever want.

My relationship with CAPPED has been to help with donations since June 2011 through my Carolyn Rose Grant Fund in memory of my late wife.   As a registered nurse who has kept her RN status current, I have continued to be impressed with her knowledge not only in health matters but her ability to manage a   non-profit organization consisting of a board of directors and also daily volunteers from the local community who come in to help.  Tresa is a very capable natural counselor with clients who have been diagnosed with cancer, and she has organized an extensive library of alternative solutions.  She has been a big help to me in various matters. My monetary contributions for just this past 12 months has been:  $24,455.  My contributions have funded for the past 2 years the Bucket Hats and sun glasses for the CAPPED Sun Safe Program created for the local grade schools..  They also allowed  purchase of a new color printer to create the Sun Safe pamphlets and also obtain projection equipment to ensure trouble free presentations at the schools. My contributions have further provided the refrigeration units for each new office in Phase II remodeling of the CAPPED Center for Integrative Health Care.  In addition, they include my Sustaining Angel Fund amount of $100/month for this year. As a self-employed electronic engineer, health journalist and counselor, my personal  in-kind contribution is my continuing encouragement, collaboration and technical advice.  T.

Cancer Awareness Prevalence Prevention and Early Detection	172839	1	/users/profile/228834	pvandergriff	Board Member	5	10/02/2013	I became involved some years ago through the work of our Executive Director.  The work performed by this small organization is far reaching and deals with more than just those who have cancer.  We put strong emphasis on eliminating the causes of cancer.  There are so many things that people can do to lesson the prevalence of cancer and the best place to start to learn of these things is right at CAPPED. I promise you that my five star rating for CAPPED has nothing to do with my position on the board.  It is the mission of the organization and the dedication of the volunteers that makes it successful.

The people there were extremely kind and very supportive.My wife, Betsy, passed away in the month of May 2013.  Losing her devastated me.  I had nowhere to turn.  In my own opinion and belief, there should be more organizations like this throughout the country.Everyone at some time in their life faces difficult times and situations.

I've never seen anyone turned away for any reason even at our center for integrative health center where there are paid for services such as foot baths and massages and hypnotherapy. Everyone here are truly driven to support the members of our community who have Cancer or are Caregivers. This place and organization is truly blessed and should be supported by everyone in our community.
Children's Grief Center of New Mexico Inc	129202		/users/profile/152541	jfike	Volunteer	5	10/25/2012	I serve at the Children's Grief Center as a Facilitator and It gives me great satisfaction each time I go, knowing that we make a difference in the lives of grieving children, teens and their parents/guardians.  We are trained as group facilitators by the Center to clear and center ourselves, so that we may be fully present when we meet with the group and then we have a post-group meeting which allows us to take care of ourselves.  Sometimes our own personal losses can be awakened, so we have that opportunity to acknowledge the impact of that on ourselves.  One of the needs of grieving people is to be able to tell the story of the loss and its impact on them and sometimes they need to repeat the story and externalize the emotional pain of the loss.  Each evening, the group unfolds, sometimes with humor and lightness and more often with emotional pain and suffering.   However it rolls out, it has been a chance for participants to face their loss of their loved one with the support of others who know exactly how they are feeling.  Without the group sessions, these folks and the little ones would not have addressed their loss on this day.
Children's Grief Center of New Mexico Inc	112101	1	/users/profile/152541	jfike	Volunteer	5	05/15/2012	I have volunteered with Children's Grief Center for 10 years as a group facilitator.  It has been deeply rewarding because my experience there confirms that families and children are able to address their normal grief needs fully when they make a commitment to participate and come regularly.  Adults and particularly children and teens in grief  feel isolated and separate from their peers.  Coming to the Grief Center facilitates contact, play and sharing with peers who understand exactly where a participant is.  Though they often come for help for their children, adults also find empathy and social support during such a difficult life transition.   Working with CGC makes a real difference in the lives of people in our community. 
Children's Grief Center of New Mexico Inc	125913		/users/profile/152646	pkroken	Volunteer	5	10/16/2012	I meet with the adult family members during orientation.  Their emotions are raw at this point in the grief journey and they tear at my heart, reminding me of the early days of my own grief at the loss of my husband.  However, I know they are entering an incredible program that will give them (and their families) the support they need at this challenging time.  I share their pain and try to give them hope for a "new normal" life that can still be rewarding.  The staff and programs offered deserve strong support because they make a profound difference in many lives.  
Children's Grief Center of New Mexico Inc	112183		/users/profile/152646	pkroken	Volunteer	5	05/16/2012	I work as a volunteer with the Children's Grief Center and feel it is an exceptionally valuable organization.  The people involved are incredibly committed to serving a community of people in emotional pain and helping them through the grief journey.  I know the entire family benefits, although the primary emphasis is on the children who have lost a caregiver.  Since there are also adult support groups it helps everyone understand how differently children grieve and ensures they get the support they need.  Grief is a journey that can be made much less lonely and painful when you have the Children's Grief Center.    
Children's Grief Center of New Mexico Inc	112575		/users/profile/153229	LoniH	Volunteer	5	05/22/2012	I am a mom of 3 small boys and felt the need to step away from the home and volunteer in a place that was just time for me. My heart for kids led me to CGC and I instantly jumped in and became a support group facilitator. Volunteering for the grief center has been, by far, one of the most rewarding experiences of my life. So much so, in fact, that my career goals have changed to encompass grieving children. Watching kids come into orientation feeling scared and overwhelmed... Then watching as they help one another through the grief of losing someone is both beautiful and moving. Nothing compares to the feeling of knowing that I have a small part in such a healing place. 
Children's Grief Center of New Mexico Inc	112529		/users/profile/153166	pattismi	Board Member	5	05/21/2012	I met Jade Bock, the ED of the Children's Grief Center, approximately 4 1/2 years ago.  I was taking a class on bereavement and needed to interview someone in the field.  By the end of our meeting, I was hooked.  After hearing about the great work CGC was doing, I wanted to be involved.  I joined the board shortly thereafter.  Since then, I have had the privaledge to work with the extraordinary staff at CGC and have witnessed their incredible commitment to this agency.  I have also had an opportunity to talk with families who have been served by CGC; their stories and their bravery is remarkable.   I am honored to be a part of such a wonderful organization that is filling a need in our community - giving families a place to grieve their loss with others who are going through the same experience.

Volunteer	5	05/21/2012	Working as a volunteer at the Children's Grief Center of NM continues to be extraordinarily rewarding for many reasons:  supporting families through loss and healing, and working with or learning from fantastic staff and volunteers.  Many people assume this is very heavy work, and in fact there is much that goes on that is uplifting and very positive.  Saddened, disrupted lives find hope and security in this caring community. New Mexico is very fortunate to have such a well-run organization to support children - young adults, and their family members and caregivers. 
Children's Grief Center of New Mexico Inc	112506		/users/profile/153134	Dotts	Volunteer	5	05/21/2012	CRACK!  SPIN!  SMOTHER!  That's how I felt when the police came to my door to tell me my son was dead.  The reality didn't sink in until long after the initial shock.  I had been a volunteer at the Children's Grief Center for years--listening to the stories of many others with this traumatic event looming in their hearts, but now it was ME.  Now the value and worth of the CGC was mine to experience, mine to own. It was my time to talk, cry, scream.  Thanks to this organization of beautiful, faithful, devoted souls, I did crawl through the abyss of the greatest sorrow ever known.  I will always support these precious souls and be ever grateful that they are there for all of us who face the unimaginable happening.  Thanks CGC.
Children's Grief Center of New Mexico Inc	112386		/users/profile/152947	Natalie24	Volunteer	5	05/18/2012	I was dealing with grief in a context other than bereavement in my life when a friend suggested to me that volunteering might be a way to help move through my own pain and loss.  So I started researching volunteer opportunities on the Internet and found the CGC back in late 2008.  The idea of being around people who were also hurting was very appealing to me.  I had just missed the facilitator training, so I began volunteering in the office, coming in on my alternating Fridays off and helping out with everything from solving IT problems to working on mass mailings to updating documentation.  I eventually became a bereavement facilitator as well and can only say that central NM is blessed to have to have the CGC.  Not only do they help adults and children move through one of the worst experiences they can have, but they also care about their volunteers.  Facilitators participate in post-group meetings to help them address any issues that may have been stirred up for them around something a child or adult attendee said during a group.  There are also regular appreciation events and the staff is always looking for ways to address frustrations and issues experienced by volunteers.   I believe that working with or around the bereaved is not something that everyone is cut out for, but for those who are, it is highly rewarding to see people realize they are not alone, forge bonds with one another, and gain the strength to move through their grief.
Children's Grief Center of New Mexico Inc	112322		/users/profile/152852	glenn h	Volunteer	5	05/17/2012	When my wife and I first came in contact with the Children's Grief Center of New Mexico, we heard a startling statistic; 85% of prisoners on death row had a parent die before they turned 18. And when we heard the testimony from one of their former patients on how the CGC had helped him turn his life around after the death of a loved one, we immediately became supporters of this organization. We saw first-hand how effective it is in working with young people facing that prospect. With a combination of therapy and peer groups, the CGC helps their patients overcome the shock, deal with the grief, anger, and confusion, and get their own lives back on track.  
Children's Grief Center of New Mexico Inc	112228		/users/profile/152692	Arlene7	Volunteer	5	05/16/2012	My experience as a bereavement facilitator has enriched my life in so many ways.  Sharing this experience helps me put my personal problems in prospective, allows me to meet wonderful people who are struggling to understand their pain and hopefully I can help make their journey a little bit easier.  The other volunteers and staff are absolutely wonderful to be around, their encouragement, support and dedication is limitless.

CGC not only helped my daughter tremendously but myself as well!!!  Livi realized she is not alone.  Shes not the only third grader who has lost someone very close to her.   This had a huge impact on her!!  She felt safe, accepted and loved by total strangers!!  She never wanted to miss a session and she made some lasting friends there!!!  It was a healing place for me as well as I was able to talk about my loss in a safe environment.   We attended until April 19th, 2011.  Livi decided she was better and no longer needed the grief center.  What a great day that was to know that Livi felt ok and was ready to move forward!!! Thank you CGC, Tammy
Children's Grief Center of New Mexico Inc	112194		/users/profile/152657	ValYou	Client Served	5	05/16/2012	Our youngest son died very suddenly, at the age of 21 months, in April of 2005.  I didn't know how to care for myself, much less help my 5 and 10 year old sons, who were devastated by their brother's death.  I was told about the Children's Grief Center and called immediately, only to be told that their sessions had ended and they would start up again in September (they run on the same schedule as the schools).  It was a rough summer for our family and I wasn't sure CGC would be of any value when we did start attending.  After the first meeting, my son said he didn't "know why they call it the Grief Center because all we did was have fun."  He didn't realize how much he was being helped but he refused to miss a single meeting.  We attended CGC for almost two years and I can't tell you how much it helped our family.  It was a lifeline where we could all express our feelings in a safe and understanding environment.  We received so much help that I am now volunteering as a Bereavement Facilitator and trying to give back a little of what CGC gave to me and my family.  If the children in your life have lost a loved one, the very best place to bring them is CGC.  The support they will receive from the staff and from the other participants is life saving and life changing.

Working with Jessica and Jade I have been very lucky  to see first hand how to promote this very important non-profit and their success has been due to their passion for the children and families they help each year. I will continue to help the Children's Grief Center anyway I can because I believe in this non-profit and the people who created a wonderful place where children can go to not be alone in their time of grief.

You see my mother died when I was just 13 so I know how difficult it is for a kid to lose a parent-- or any family member.  The CGC offers support groups for kids (and their parents) so that they can learn to live with the loss, and just as important, get to know others who are going through or have been through similar experiences.  I wish there had been a Children's Grief Center for me... 
Cody Unser First Step Foundation	47563	6	/users/profile/48277	iroquois	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/01/2010	Cody & Shelley Unser of The Cody Unser First Step Foundation spends every waking hour helping others around the world.  The Cody Unser First Step Foundation is thinking of creative ideas to help bring life back to disabled veterans and others with disabilities through Operation Deep Down and other projects.  She inspires others with disabilities to move beyond their disability and give them the hope and dreams they thought they have lost due to that disability.
Cody Unser First Step Foundation	45620	9	/users/profile/46506	alanna	Volunteer	5	06/25/2010	I met Cody in high school and still to this day look up to her as a role model. She is goal oriented and truly cares about helping others that are paralyzed and affected with TM. I went with her on a couple of trips around the country a few years ago where she spoke to, quite intimidating audiences I must say, about the importance of her organization in giving people with paralysis a chance to grow and learn. She is very well known in the State of New Mexico having spoken to the Governor about her wishes for the Foundation. She has also talked with President Bush as an advocate and a voice for disabled individuals. Wow! Everyone she has spoken to was touched by her story and wanted to help in any way possible. Amazing! She is a truly inspirational woman and has a passion to provide everyone with the opportunities they may be without if it wasn't for her Foundation such as scuba diving!

This a wonderful organization to be a part of.  The first time I had the pleasure of working with them was during one of their 'Discover Scuba' events.  To see the smiles and sense of self each participant was getting back, regardless of their disability, is a feeling that will stay with me forever.This organization, the people involved and the people it serves are simply amazing!

Cody Unser First Step Foundation	44867	12	/users/profile/45779	dogood	General Member of the Public	5	06/22/2010	Cody Unser is one of the most caring and brave women I have been blessed to know. I spent 4 years of college with Cody and I consider her one of my closest friends. Cody does not only impact the lives of other paralyzed individuals, but inspires and enlightens all those who meet her. Her charismatic personality allows her story to be not just heard, but understood by all who listen. Her story does not focus on what has happened to her, but what great things she has been able to do in spite of it. Paralysis is a difficult transition that most of the pubic have never taken a moment to try to understand. The Cody Unser First Step Foundation helps inform the pubic of their neighbors in chairs and helps those who are paralyzed find a new world behind their chair.
Cody Unser First Step Foundation	43766	10	/users/profile/44646	akaplin	Board Member	5	06/12/2010	For Cody the personal is political: she has taken her personal tragedy of being completely paralyzed from the waist down at the age of 12 by TM and become a tireless national advocate for not only stem cell research but the improvement of quality life through the organization she founded in her name, the Cody Unser First Step Foundation. She is as forceful in her advocacy of government officials and legislatures through education and public discourse as she is compassionate in her tireless support of other individuals who have been personally stricken by similar disabling illnesses. Cody has the ability to create opportunities to advance her aims, such as weaving together a college major that combined public advocacy with scientific education, giving her the ability to serve as both an instructor and translator for politicians, scientists, and fellow patients. She is not only a gifted writer, but also a charismatic and compelling public speaker, two abilities that will serve her well in her pursuit of a public health degree. As if by design, following a master plan conceived of while she was a pre-teenager, Cody has followed a carefully crafted journey that has taken her to the front steps of public health school in order to equip her with the necessary tools to effect change in the policies and legislation that have bearing on the lives of the millions worldwide whose lives have been altered by physical challenges. Armed with the ability to communicate, persuade and educate, which will be made more powerful with a knowledge of the public health industry, I am certain that Cody will change the world in ways that even she, despite her audacious hope, cannot yet fully appreciate. Cody will prove that you can reach for the sky from a seated position as well as from a standing one, and bring back stars to illuminate the darkest despair and show the way to a brighter future.
Cody Unser First Step Foundation	43466	13	/users/profile/44332	mgmtrobin	Board Member	5	06/09/2010	I first met Cody at the University of Redlands where she was a student of mine. When she was hit with TM at the age of 13, many would have given up. Her determination to make a difference in the lives of other disabled individuals is what most stands out in my mind. Through the dedication of many individuals, the foundation has touched the lives of numerous disabled persons through research, increased awareness, and the scuba program which allows participants to experience the freedom of movement often lacking in their everyday lives. This pushes participants to reach beyond their disabilities and to consider what is possible. To witness this transformation is something everyone should see. This non-profit is destined to have an even more tremendous impact in the future and I am thrilled to be part of it.

Cody Unser First Step Foundation	43350	9	/users/profile/44180	spineywhite	Client Served	5	06/09/2010	One year ago, CUFSF opened my eyes to many rewarding lessons.  First, they introduced me to an exciting sport that does not see limitations.  Cody inspired me to push myself beyond my own expectations, by scuba diving.  The feelings of being "free" from the wheelchair were incredible.    Now I take this experience of overcoming obstacles into my classroom in hopes that my message will inspire my students to push beyond their limitations. The results from this experience have touched more lives that just me, the scuba diver.  It is a service that touches lives and spreads the message of hope and overcoming injuries, TOGETHER, one dive at a time.  We're behind you Cody Unser!

They created a dive team, trained two course directors, their programs are for the disabled person and a dive buddy of choice (family member, friend, caregiver), and they provide dive trips. Other adaptive programs focus just on the disabled person and once they're trained they don't have the support system to continue scuba diving. I volunteer weekly for  CUFSF and I love the people I work with - they are truly heros for communities they help nationwide!

This has meant I can continue with my studies, as my husband works many long hours away from home.  It is gratifying to have them spending time with a focus on fitness and enrichment.  Their prices are extremely reasonable, especially for what they offer!  Between Parents' Nights Out and Spring Break camps, they've thought of everything parents and kids need by way of support.  They treat us like family.  We are so fortunate to have them!

They also provide workshops for adults GED classes, ESL, yoga and more. I know my donations are well used by the low income community. 
Assistance League Of Albuquerque Inc	277236		/users/profile/367021	jmm2402	Volunteer	5	01/19/2016	One of the best programs is the Operation School Bell which provides school uniforms for elementary and middle school students who can't afford them.  The program provided over 3700 students with uniforms and shoes and partnered with a local TV station to provide  an additional  2200 pairs of new shoes to students.  
Assistance League Of Albuquerque Inc	276392		/users/profile/366157	haojile	Volunteer	5	01/12/2016	A group of more than 300 women (and a few men) that reach out into the margins of the Albuquerque community.  Operation School Bell serves the Title 1 schools in the Albuquerque area providing new shoes, socks, a backpack and a book of their choosing.  Caps are knit for chemo and premies.  A philanthropic store is run in Old Town Albuquerque that provides gallery space (at no charge)for Senior New Mexicans to sell their art - 100% of the proceeds go to the artist.  Victims of assault are with privacy and care given assistance after the trauma.  A large Thrift Shop, now with furniture, receives donations and resells them to support our philanthropic programs.  It was selected Best In City for 2015 by ABQthe Magazine.

Assistance League Of Albuquerque Inc	273477		/users/profile/362712	MaryWilsonKenney	Volunteer	5	12/01/2015	The Assistance League of Albuquerque is thriving and growing.  With this growth comes the opportunity to enhance the philanthropic programs offered to children in need, senior artisans and people suffering from violence or abuse.   Growth also is accompanied by greater need for funding.  The volunteers of Assistance League are incredibly dedicated and hard working, donating time in the Thrift Shop, shopping for essential items for CYFD, or putting shoes on over 3,400 little feet.   Last year, the return to the community was 80%!   This year will likely mirror that return.  I am proud to be a small part of this organization.
Assistance League Of Albuquerque Inc	251959		/users/profile/339969	JKight	Volunteer	5	08/06/2015	Through Assistance League, we purchased shoes for all the kids enrolled at Cuidando Los Ninos as well as for their siblings.  One of those boys is ten, lives in his car because he is homeless, and is on the Honor Roll at school.  He arrived at Cuidando after school as the shoes from Payless Shoes were being unloaded.  Payless had marked the shoe boxes with the recipients names.  He offered to help unpack the shoes.  When he saw the box marked with his name - Philip - he asked if the shoes were for him.  When he was told that they were, he started crying and couldnt believe that he had been given a new pair of shoes to replace his held together with tape. Sherri Wells who is the Development Director for Cuidando asked the parents and children that they serve what constitutes security for them.  The parents wanted enough gas in the car to get to work.  The kids wanted new shoes.  Apparently, lack of decent shoes is a major cause for bullying. Who knew a pair of new shoes is a treasure?
Assistance League Of Albuquerque Inc	247737		/users/profile/335351	ibu7505	Board Member	5	07/08/2015	I have been a member of Assistance League of Albuquerque since 2009, and I am constantly impressed with the energy, professionalism, and care our members put forth when serving those in need.  We have eight programs that reach thousands of disadvantaged children and adults in Albuquerque. Our most recent project, a shoe drive for children in Title 1 schools, is representative of how our members come together, eager to be part of a project that assists the children in our community.  The involvement with the school children, the amount of hours of volunteerism, keen organizational skills, and members enthusiasm are what made our shoe drive a success.  Involvement, volunteerism, excellent organization, and enthusiasm are the reasons that Assistance League of Albuquerque is a success. I feel very fortunate to be a part of this outstanding organization.

The organization has impacred the lives of many children in  Title 1 schools in the city by providing school uniforms. This year we partnered with a local television station, KRQE, to provide over 2000 new tennis shoes to children in six schools.  This process involved mamy volunteers and many hours sorting and distributing shoes.  It is one of the most personally rewarding experiences I've had with this group.  Each child was given a book along with new shoes and the smiles on their faces were priceless.  It was a win- win for everyone involved!

Assistance League of Albuquerque was the answer. Not only are the philanthropic programs truly helping people in need, the organization is run like a well-oiled machine. Considering everyone is a volunteer, the level of professionalism is amazing.  Members bring their skills in financial oversight, fundraising, board development, public relations, facilities management, and much more. Every member gives of their time, talents and treasure to support the critical work of Assistance League. I am so fortunate to have found such an amazing organization.
Assistance League Of Albuquerque Inc	205605		/users/profile/267825	mruud	Volunteer	5	07/10/2014	Assistance League of Albuquerque touched over 12,000 lives in the community last year through its programs and partnerships.  Most interactions will remain anonymous, but I would like to recount one.  My husband, an engineer, worked with interns each year.  A year ago, he repeatedly told me of one young intern who was exceptional:  smart, curious, and sure to be outstanding in his field .  On the intern's last day working, my husband took him to lunch, where they enjoyed sharing personal stories.  It came out that I volunteer for Assistance League, whose signature program is to provide new clothing to kids in Title 1 schools.  Hearing this, the young man paused and then said, "Yes.  They helped me get an education.  Without the clothing they provided, I could not have gone to school." Assistance League makes a difference, and it does it every day.
Assistance League Of Albuquerque Inc	203660	1	/users/profile/265677	MWKenney	Board Member	5	06/25/2014	The Assistance League of Albuquerque, an all volunteer organization, is well organized and financially stable.  Dedicated volunteers return well over the expected percentages to the underserved community, especially to children and women.  While my tenure with the organization is coming up to the year mark, I have been impressed with the Assistance League's focus on raising awareness and strengthening their role within the Albuquerque community to increase funding opportunities.  This, in turn, is used judiciously to support several philanthropic programs that are not offered by others.  I truly believe that this focused effort has brought benefit to those most in need.  I plan to continue volunteering my time and energy to this worthy organization.
Assistance League Of Albuquerque Inc	202880		/users/profile/264627	zoemom	Board Member	5	06/13/2014	Assistance League of Albuquerque is a great organization for volunteers and clients.  As a volunteer for the past five years on many committees, on the board, and in the Thrift Shop I have had rewarding experiences, made many friends and felt as if I was making a difference. We do make a big difference in the community whether providing items for rape victims, school uniforms for needy children or premie caps for newborns at UNM.  CYFD is able to better help the children and families they serve because of the items (diapers, formula, clothes) that we provide.  Women returning to the work force come into the shop and are able to find professional clothes through the program, Our Sister's Closet.  Many of these women have expressed thanks to us for this service.  Firemen and Police carry Buddy Bears to hand out to children in crisis situations.  Assistance League enables everyone to work with any or all of these programs.  Then there is Blue Portal in Old Town where artisans are able to sell their wares with no charge to them.  There are no paid employees...we are all volunteers.

Starting in high school I had the opportunity to learn first hand the joys of giving and helping others.  Assistance League is a great organization focused on philanthropic programs and addressing needs right in our own backyard.  All you have to do is talk to an elementary or middle school teacher, student, or parent who has received clothing from us and they will tell you...Assistance League allowed my child to stay in school, make friends, be excepted by his.her peers, build self confidence, etc.  We are Assistance League and we do make a difference1
Assistance League Of Albuquerque Inc	160132		/users/profile/212373	volunteer1998	Volunteer	5	06/10/2013	Assistance League of Albuquerque is constantly evolving for the better.  With only volunteers to do its work, it's astounding what has been accomplished in just the fifteen years I have been a member. We run two shop: the thrift store (our fundraiser) and our senior consignment shop (strictly a program).  Besides the staffing for these two shops, there is a huge corps of behind-the-scenes workers making sure we have due diligence in our financial transactions.  The benefits for me, as a  volunteer, are in the satisfaction of helping others and doing a good job, and in the interaction and camaraderie we enjoy.
Justice Great Dane Rescue	241162	1	/users/profile/327642	catron2011	Board Member	5	04/15/2015	We first heard about JGDR when we started looking for another Great Dane to adopt. While we were interested in an adult, we ended up with a puppy, and we couldn't be happier. We began going to JGDR events, and eventually started volunteering. Volunteering was so fulfilling that I wanted to become even more involved with the organization, and eventually became a Board Member and foster.  I've worked with a lot of nonprofits, and JGDR is one of the most transparent, well-run organizations I've had the chance to work with. The well-being and health of the dogs is a top priority, and the application process ensures that dogs stay in the homes they are adopted to. My husband and I will continue to work with and help out JGDR in any capacity that we can. 
Justice Great Dane Rescue	234536	2	/users/profile/300129	Mike131	Volunteer	5	11/26/2014	After losing 3 dogs in 3 years my wife and I could not think we could take the heartache of loving and losing another dog. So i decided we would become Fosters. We have had all sizes of dogs but loved the big guys. After researching several rescue operations I decided to contact Justice Great Dane Rescue. It has been the most rewarding 4 months ever. We applied as fosters and they came to our house and /'checked us out/' Very professional organization. Obviously we were passed and never looked back. We have our 4th and 5th dogs in 4 months and could not be happier. If there is a medical issue with the dogs. Ronnie, The 2nd in command of the organization comes right over to check them out at any time. If they are deemed to need to see a vet an appointment is set up the next day. I could go on. But suffice to say as opinionated as I am. I don't believe Nicole and Ronnie could possibly do a better job. 
Justice Great Dane Rescue	202042	1	/users/profile/263674	debsilverback	Client Served	5	06/07/2014	We first heard about Justice Great Dane Rescue from our son who adopted a one year old female Dane.  We feel in love with her and decided to adopt our own senior Dane.  JGDR required us to fill out an adoption application, did a home visit and checked our references before we were able to adopt.  They discussed which Dane would be a good match for our family.  We adopted Taos, a five year old, last November.  He has become a great member of our family.  I have recommended JDGR to my friends who want to adopt.  Justice Great Dane Rescue care about their foster dogs!!
Justice Great Dane Rescue	201980	1	/users/profile/263587	Lance4	Volunteer	5	06/06/2014	I had only slightly considered adopting or fostering a Great Dane until I encountered JGDR. I spoken with several other rescues regarding different breeds but once meeting Nicole and this organization, I really felt how involved and caring all the volunteers are about their work. So far the rescue has made it very easy to foster and I'm sure equally as easy for anyone to adopt. Fostering with JGDR has been a great experience and they have been very helpful. 
Justice Great Dane Rescue	201885	1	/users/profile/263462	cchorn	Volunteer	5	06/04/2014	I have adopted rescue dogs from several other organizations, but I appreciate the thoroughness and professionalism with which Justice screens their potential adopters. Ronnie from Justice actually came out to do a home check (the other rescue groups never did) and my references received calls; again this was not done by the other groups. I have now become a volunteer for Justice because of this, and I am impressed with the other volunteers as I get to know them. Everyone has full time jobs, but they are truly dedicated to doing everything in their power to save these wonderful dogs. 
Justice Great Dane Rescue	200982	1	/users/profile/262410	Jamie63	Volunteer	5	05/27/2014	I am both a volunteer and client.  My Brenna came from Justice.  She is just the most wonderful addition to our family.  Before coming to Justice, she had been used as a breeder and had heartworms.  They got her healthy and I adopted her.  She is a lovely dog and I am so thankful that they saved her.   Since adopting Brenna, I have driven several Danes as a transport volunteer.  I have seen the horrible condition these dogs are in when they are pulled from kill shelters.  Some are totally emaciated and covered in ticks and/or fleas.  The after pictures of these dogs always amaze me.  It is almost unbelievable that these are the same dogs that I transported ss they were first coming into Justice Rescue.
Justice Great Dane Rescue	200909	2	/users/profile/262325	David225	Client Served	5	05/27/2014	We have adopted two Great Danes from Justice Great Dane Rescue. Our first adoption came to JGDR from a situation that found him malnourished and covered with ticks. He was treated professionally and placed with a foster family to await adoption into a forever home. We provided that for him. Today Paco is a healthy, happy Great Dane. Our second adoption was a female Dane whose military family was unable to take her overseas. Diva provides a spirited, playful companion for Paco. In both cases, Justice provided careful professional assistance to ensure that the dogs were placed in an environment suited to their long-term health and happiness. 
Justice Great Dane Rescue	197177	2	/users/profile/257735	Kelly118	Client Served	5	04/06/2014	I adopted my sweet pup from Justice Great Dane Rescue on the recommendation of a previous client who we ran into walking his Dane.  Nicole and Ronnie's expertise and care in helping us to find the best Dane for our family was invaluable!!!  Not only did they pair us with the sweetest dog I'd ever met, who became an instant and integral part of our family, but Nicole continued to check in on me and Gracie as we got her used to her new home.  Every time we had a question or concern, we knew that JGDR was there to support us.  In return, we are now enthusiastic supporters of them.  We take our Gracie to nearly every event that they hold, and encourage admirers of our Dane to look into this organization.  Gracie is the first, and certainly not the last Dane that we have owned and we're so glad that JGDR is there to match these "cuddle bugs" with great families that they can love.  Additionally, there is no pressure to adopt any particular Dane...the dog's best fit is their main concern.  We had wanted to adopt another dog from JGDR, and when our chosen new Dane was not a good fit for Gracie, JGDR was there, yet again, to support us as we had to conclude our test drive with him early and consider a different Dane or a one-Dane-household for the time.  Justice Great Dane Rescue is an exceptional organization, and we are so thankful that we stumbled upon them!

I cannot even begin to describe how passionately I feel about this organization and the people in it. There are so many incredible people working so very hard every day to help Great Danes in need. They give up their free time, their weekends and often sacrifice their time with their families all to give these dogs a second chance. My hat is off to all of them and I thank them all from the bottom of my heart for the time and effort that they put in for these animals.

Since that time I have made numerous road trips for this great organization, driving Danes in need from my area to Albuquerque to the capable & dedicated folks with Justice.  The people at the helm of the organization are amazing & are always ready to step up to help.  Undertaking the rescue & care of such large dogs is no simple task & most of the dogs I have transported for the organization have had significant health problems, some have also had behavioral issues to be addressed.  Justice Great Dane Rescue is always up to the challenge & from the moment they get the call for help, through the vetting & fostering processes, until the dogs in their charge are adopted following their extensive adoption screening process, they do everything & anything necessary to see that these beauties go on to live happy, healthy lives.   I am in the midst of preparing for a drive tomorrow to get yet another Dane in need to the loving, caring folks with Justice Great Dane Rescue.  I want to say that it is a privilege to be associated with the organization & to contribute just the smallest bit to their mission.

We had never been involved in a rescue before and didn't know what to expect. From the first meeting it was a very professional and a relaxed atmosphere. We fostered for about a year and then became a foster failure, that is when you adopt the foster dog you are caring for. We are still involved with the rescue, if you can't foster the rescue can always use donations either with money or dog items. I highly recommend being involved it is such a rewarding experience!

(He apparently died in his sleep.) A friend suggested I contact an organization called Truckers Final Mile about bringing him back home. On Saturday, 2/6/16 at 5:30 am, I went to the website and sent an email explaining the situation and asking if there was anything they could do to help. Within 10 minutes Robert responded to my email asking for my phone number so he could call me. He called at 10:30 am--he's a trucker himself, so he called when he had a break. For the next two weeks, he kept me informed of the progress. He kept in touch with the funeral home, the trucking company Moe drove for, the medical examiner in Georgia, and me. He was able to get funding to pay for the cremation in Georgia and arrange for a trucker to transport Moe's ashes from there to the Finger Lakes in New York. Truckers Final Mile, and Robert specifically, made a terribly difficult time less stressful for all of us.

A close friend of mine who is also a trucker gave me the phone number to this organization Truckersfinalmile.org I was at my wits end, having received the run around from Veterans Affairs and every funeral home my family had called. No one would talk to us without at least $2500.00 in hand, until I spoke with Robert from the organization.Two hours after my initial conversation with Robert, he called me back and already had the ball rolling, absorbing an immense amount of the pressure my family was experiencing. Having already made the proper phone calls, Truckersfinalmile.org had made the arrangements for my fathers cremation after receiving a generous donation from my fathers employer. Their generosity doesn't stop here, refusing to have a Viet Nam  war veteran shipped in the US mail, Robert's wonderful wife Janine and two son's drove to my front door and hand delivered my Father's remains. His son wore his Air Force uniform, and presented me the remains and memorial army flag, I can see my father saluting him for such a kind act.My gratitude for this non-profit, can't be put into words. They are wonderful people, I just hope one day I will find someway to repay their kindness.Walter Jay Greggs IV

They blessed me by helping me through this difficult time. I cannot say enough positive things about this group. If anyone is in need in the Trucking community, this organization will stand up and fight for your rights. I am thankful that they are out there for us. God bless you Robert. What you did for us is truly a selfless thing.

WildEarth Guardians	176978		/users/profile/233437	marionhourdequin,	Board Member	5	10/11/2013	I have long admired the work of WildEarth Guardians from afar, for their sustained efforts to protect wildlife and wild places throughout the West.  More recently, I've had the privilege to get more involved with Guardians, and I have been deeply impressed by the quality and dedication of their staff.  Guardians is an organization packed with talented and visionary individuals who have the skills, intelligence and capacity to get things done on the ground.  WildEarth Guardians' four key programs -- wildlife, wild places, wild rivers, and climate and energy -- address crucial issues while keeping in view the linkages among them.  In a world where we are constantly confronted by images of environmental decline, WildEarth Guardians' vision for the future is hopeful and inspiring.
WildEarth Guardians	177840		/users/profile/234431	vanessa.scurci	Volunteer	5	10/15/2013	I have been involved with WildEaerth Guardians for many years now, and am continuously impressed by the quality of this organization and the dedication and passion of its staff and members.  Guardians has always been a leader in the conservation movement.  I am especially impressed by the Guardians' role in protecting carnivores and advocating for critical bioregions such as the Gila.  I encourage everyone I know to become involved with the Guardians!
WildEarth Guardians	177523		/users/profile/234086	Meredith T.	Volunteer	5	10/14/2013	I have long been a fan of Wildearth Guardians, but I became even more so last year. When the gray wolf was delisted, MT, ID and WY allowed hundreds of wolves to be killed, many around Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks. As a natural history outfitter in Yellowstone, I saw the effects of this slaughter personally. While I had been guiding guests and teaching about the conservation success story of wolf recovery since 1995 when the wolves were reintroduced, in 2013 I could hardly find wolves to see in Yellowstone after the first wolf hunt. Wildearth Guardians spoke out against the delisting under such unmanaged conditions. It is truly a group who helps the conservation conscience of our country.

Needless to say, I have witnessed many evolutions of the organization as it persistently addresses the ever-increasing challenges of wildlife and wildlands issues both in the field and in the courtroom. I continue to be impressed by the staff's stamina, competence and effectiveness as they strive to protect and restore the environment in the West. Guardians is tenacious and has many successes to be proud of. I am honored to be associated with this group of amazing people.

WildEarth Guardians	176587		/users/profile/233008	Bman1	Donor	5	10/10/2013	I belong to a number of wildlife not for profits.  What I've noticed over the last decade is that WEG gets things done.   WEG is often the facilitator for other orgs to make improvements that can be felt and seen locally. When WEG makes an impact which often allow smaller state and regional orgs are able to achieve their goals and help increase our enjoyment of nature.
WildEarth Guardians	156786		/users/profile/207961	Ranger Robin	Board Member	5	04/30/2013	When I moved to Colorado several years ago I wanted to become actively involved in a wildlife/wildlands conservation organization. So, I looked closely at all the organizations that work in the Rocky Mountain region and WildEarth Guardians stood out from the bunch as the most effective group. Guardians is bold, visionary, and most importantly, they are not afraid to stand up for their values. The staff is a hard-working bunch that is always pushing the envelope of what can be achieved. To me, donating to a non-profit organization is like investing in the stock market--I want to get the highest rate of return that I can find while taking on little risk. I think WildEarth Guardians is this kind of investment. If you are going to invest/donate to a wildlife group, Guardians provides the highest rate of return because they achieve the most success per dollar spent.

WildEarth Guardians	155982		/users/profile/177389	Janet46	Donor	5	04/24/2013	WildEarth Guardians helps protect wildlife and wild places in the west-and then some.  They even put up the enclosure cameras at the Wolf Conservation Center in NY, giving all of us a chance to watch gray, Mexican gray, and red wolves live.  They represent all of us in court battles with those who would seek to harm our wildlife.  I am pleased to be a supporter of WildEarth Guardians and I know they are putting my money to good use.  Thank you, WildEarth Guardians, for all you do!
WildEarth Guardians	147816		/users/profile/174791	Skye Danser	Volunteer	5	01/08/2013	This is a great organization with compassionate, devoted advocates.  They were very responsive when I needed their input on a local issue that arose in 2012.  Larger groups with more name recognition (i.e. The Sierra Club) didn't even respond to correspondence.   WEG responded within 24 hours, and their assistance was crucial to protecting an endangered species and wetlands.  They have accomplished numerous legal battles, and they continue to advocate for wolves and many other at risk species.  From my experience, WildEarth Guardians gets the job done and money donated to them is money well-spent.     This organization is on the top of my list for environmental and animal advocates.   I just wish I had more time and money to give them.

This woman has passion and love for people dealing with cancer. And only someone who has gone through this challenge can truly talk about it. Lexie is a forward thinker, taking her experience and growing from it. We at Herbs, Etc. support her in her journey. She makes something happen out of very little, and does it with complete focus and love. 
Breast Wishes Fund	269141	1	/users/profile/357869	JeffSchwartz	General Member of the Public	5	10/29/2015	There really isn't another non-profit breast cancer outreach like Breast Wishes.  As a member of a family with a long history of breast cancer and having lost my aunt at 42, this cause is close to my heart.  I am a father of a young teenage daughter, and am grateful for the education and information that Breast Wishes provides.
Breast Wishes Fund	267345	1	/users/profile/356075	Writer	Board Member	5	10/26/2015	I write as the mother of a daughter who was diagnosed with breast cancer at the early age of thirty-eight.  I couldn't wait to get my daughter hooked up to chemo.  Now that I understand the mutually beneficial relationship that pharmaceuticals have with the AMA, I live with regret that my daughter ever endured chemo.  The cancer returned after one year and she has been managing her cancer with vaccines, etc. for the last nine years.  I want others to benefit from the knowledge that cancer can be beaten, but not by chemo and radiation.  Boosting the immune system and thereby annihilating the cancer is the way of the future.

It has been the forerunner in shifting the paradigm that dominates the big business of breast cancer by empowering the patient to chose progressive and wholistic options in their approach to disease-- and to do so with dignity and the power of knowledge.  BWF's community outreach provides much needed education and support to the cancer community, and Lexie Shabel is a pioneer, an inspiration, a wealth of knowledge, and one of the most caring and brave people I've had the privilege to know.

It can be very overwhelming to find information on line that isn't persuasive and informational.  I highly recommend Breast Wishes Fund once a week!  Find something new, and apply it. 
Breast Wishes Fund	264301	1	/users/profile/353013	Writer	Donor	5	10/15/2015	Breast Wishes provides amazing information and support for women and families dealing with cancer.

Breast Wishes Fund	263328	1	/users/profile/352033	Writer	Client Served	5	10/12/2015	Breast Wishes Fund is the first organization that I found in my search for alternatives to traditional allopathic treatment. I was even the first recipient of a scholarship that unable me to travel for an immune therapy that I could not have received in the US and would not have been able to afford on my own. Breast Wishes offers so much information about prevention, general health, alternative treatment, nutrition and just a place to vent. A cancer journey can be scary, especially if you choose to walk outside of convention. All of the information I have received from Lexie at BWF was delivered with care, I felt supported and validated in my choices rather than feeling isolated and alone. 
Breast Wishes Fund	248316	3	/users/profile/336028	Honeycat	Volunteer	5	07/13/2015	I am in need of changing my eating habits and I asked for a recommendation from Margo Covington, a lymph decongestion specialist in Santa Fe.  Margo gave me Lexie's Breast Fund Wishes card and I contacted her about meeting to talk about better food choices. In a 1:1 meeting that lasted several hours, I learned about needing to eat more of a Kapha-pacifying diet.  Lexie highlighted several foods to have on hand and to use.  There are bean misos, other than  soy miso, are available at the Co-op.  Soy promotes estrogen and that is not good for some like me who has had estrogen positive breast cancer. I learned that eggs cause inflammation.  I also learned about  seasonal spices to use in my cooking to keep inflammation down.  The Albuquerque Ayurvedic Banyon Herbs website outlines food choices for Kapha-pacifying. Lexie reminded me of the importance of Probiotics and I found  As a cancer survivor, I am being trying to get back to a plant based diet.  I have to re-learn how to cook better for myself to reduce my chances of reoccurrence.  Lexie told me about a Gaia herb product called Tumeric Supreme to reduce inflammation.  I have a ways to go to relearn  and practice which foods are better for my constitution, Kapha.  I will continue to look at ways  to cleanse such as through fasting, not eating after 7 at night, reducing my weight and doing internal cleansing with enemas to draw toxins out.  Lexie has helped me get on a path to making better choices.  She asked me  where  I see myself in 3 years.  I am trying to take time and take a focused look at that.  What I am aware of is that I need to change a number of things in my present life beyond just what I eat.It is amazing to know that a 'vaccine' can now be made from the protein of the cancer and given back to that person to fight the cancer in their own body.  This new development offers great hope to people fighting cancer.  I forgot to mention that Lexie invited me for lunch and involved me in preparing the lunch.  I urge Lexie, who has a background in cooking for large groups of people, to perhaps set up a workshop or set of workshops through Sara Noss, the Executive Director of the Santa Fe Farmers Market, to teach about food preparation for surviving cancer.

Animal Protection Of New Mexico Inc	147744		/users/profile/195481	alysha4	Client Served	5	01/07/2013	I would like to thank Animal Protection of New Mexico, the Equine Protection Fund, and Phil for helping me geld my donkey. He is just over 2 years old and was getting to the point where he was more than I could handle. We also have mares and he is the age where he thinks he should be with them. I have a 6 month old baby and I am currently a stay at home mother. I would not have been able to have this procedure done with out the help of APNM. This procedure prevented unplanned breeding from Buckshot, and will allow me to responsibly rehome him if needed with out worry that he will be used for breeding. So a huge thank you from me and my family goes out to APNM, for helping us make our donkey a better pet, and keeping our horses safe from having babies!    I would like to thank Animal Protection of New Mexico for the generous donation of horse blankets to my family. This is an invaluable program and has provided my family with items that we were unable to purchase ourselves due to financial difficulties. The amount of care and compassion from everyone is beyond anything I imagined. My horses will appreciate the warm blankets during these cold winter months. This will help me provide them with more comfort and give them some shelter so they can stay warmer! Although it seems like we have had nice weather the past few days I am sure snow will return. Thank you so much to everyone who made donations to APNM and to everyone who is helping distribute these goods our community in times of need.

APNM stands up to the incredible and far reaching scope of the job this mission necessitates.  From informing the public on the plight of our Alamogordo chimps and leading the fight for their freedom, to educating us on public trapping and its horrific consequences, and responding to the tough situation with our states equine and domestic animal abuse situation, APNM is there in the forefront, always professional, educated, and sincere.

As a donor, I scrutinize any organization, not only for programs which I wish to support, but I look at sustainability, effectiveness, and ethicsAPNM is alert to being a stalwart organization. They cooperate with other programs and organizations in the community and State, understanding to be effective they must not duplicate efforts but work together to assure for the safety and wellbeing of our animals, domestic and wild.

Animal Protection Of New Mexico Inc	119848		/users/profile/162920	thetaosbark	Board Member	5	08/01/2012	It has been my greatest honor and privilege to serve on the board of directors for Animal Protection Voters, the legislative arm of Animal Protection of New Mexico. We work closely, hand-in-hand together on the animal issues and challenges that confront us on a daily basis. Throughout the years and before I was a board member I called on APNM for help in the Taos, NM area where I reside. One in particular was a case involving dog hoarding where our local law enforcement and animal control were totally at a loss as to how to handle the situation. Sixty plus dogs were needing intervention and APNM got busy and organized our local law enforcement and the Santa Fe Shelter Vans to transport the dogs to the Santa Fe Shelter. Recently another extreme hoarding case involving cats in our area was helped by APNM who worked with our animal shelter and law enforcement offering help and expertise on how to handle the situation, I personally have had a conversation with our District Attorney, Donald Gallegos, where he praised APNM and Executive Director, Lisa Jennings for imparting their expertise in his office's animal cases.  My history with animal welfare goes back many years and I am familiar with all of our resources in Northern New Mexico. APNM is the most valuable resource of all. Their core programs have made changes in the lives of our animals and animal welfare bills would not be passed through the legislature without the committed and dedicated work of this most valuable organization. I cannot even imagine where we would be without APNM. The staff is passionate about their work and put in the hours necessary to do the job. The legislators listen to APNM and there is a reason for that! Your donations could not go to a more worthy non-profit working for animal welfare.

Before I even landed, i was able to communicate with APNM about their broad range of programs. So many of my concerns were already being covered by their staff and volunteers. No matter what efforts I wanted to contribute time and focus on, there was always a ready program to join / assist. I have complete trust in their social savvy skills, knowing they will collaborate broadly to achieve results. I'm so confident knowing that they will always be there. It's not a "one issue" organization that will get thwarted one day and disappear - Whenever I can help them as a volunteer -they will be there - the foundation of pretty much all animal issues in the state! They are tireless, and a force in NM that most people in the know here recognize as formidable!

The volunteers provide a friendly visit and are very caring. Meals on Wheels does not receive any State or Federal funding.

Until a few years ago, I was familiar with the name only, never the mission; scope of work and quite honestly the level of commitment demonstrated by the staff, volunteers, donors and recipients of Meals On Wheels. I am in awe of how many people and now animals Meals on Wheels helps on a daily basis! If it weren't for them, I feel we would have a real problem in our community with our elderly and home bound not getting the nutrition they need to live out their days. Not only that, the volunteers seem to provide solice and build a friendship with the people they deliver to. In some cases, the Meals on Wheels volunteers are the only social interaction the recipients of those meals have on any given day. They not only deliver meals, they deliver nutrition, friendship and hope. A great organization!

I have been blessed to have met and cared for many wonderful people during this time. As a regular volunteer, you get the opportunity to meet and build relationships with some great people who are often in desperate need for not only the food you bring, but the friendship and time you have to offer them. I can honestly say that I am a much better person for having met and interacted with each and every person I've delivered to over the years. I thank Meals on Wheels of Albuquerque for being there to help all of the new friends I have made over the years. Without MOW and their tireless volunteers, I know many of these friends wouldn't be here today!
Meals on Wheels of Albuquerque	266610	1	/users/profile/355371	tllyle	Donor	5	10/22/2015	40 years ago as a teenager I delivered meals with my Mom and Grandmother in the summers and remember the impact those short visits had for the recipients.  While the purpose is to serve a nutritious meal, the friendships that are developed are just as important, and long lasting.  Today, there are so many folks who cannot afford a nutritious meal and often have to choose between eating and medication.  Meals on Wheels has a program to help this group of folks in our Community.  Meals on Wheels is a GREAT organization.  We need to make sure they continue serving our Community.
Meals on Wheels of Albuquerque	266342	2	/users/profile/355115	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/22/2015	I have been delivering meals on a regular route as a volunteer for the past two years with my wife and two small children.  It has been great to see how the clients benefit from a regular warm meal, and for many of them, their faces light up when they get to see our kids.  For us, an added benefit is the opportunity to expose our kids to the joys of volunteering and being around people they may not otherwise interact with.  Some of our kids' favorite people are the regular clients on our MOW route.  MOW of Albuquerque provides a great service to these folks.
Meals on Wheels of Albuquerque	266320	2	/users/profile/355091	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	10/22/2015	I am a strong supporter of Meals on Wheels of Albuquerque.  Not only do they help ALL persons that can't get out of their homes, but they also provide food for their pets.  All this is done without any cost to the recipient.  Most, if not all the deliveries are done by volunteers and they operate entirely on donations.  
Meals on Wheels of Albuquerque	265682	2	/users/profile/354422	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/20/2015	I have worked for many years for a nonprofit who provided housing for low-income elderly.  Retired now, it is my pleasure to volunteer for Meals on Wheels of Albuquerque; I have been doing so for the past three years.  My husband and I deliver meals on a regular Wednesday route.  It is the best feeling in the world to be greated by a smiling face, so grateful not only for the delicious meal but for the friendly visit.  Along with over 200+ volunteers we deliver over 500 meals a day Monday through Friday.  Besides this duty, I also serve on the Board of Directors as well as on various committees.  We have a fabulous, engaged Board supporting a fantastic Executive Director.  Mow of ABQ continues to grow and with the help of generous donors, private grants and fundraising  efforts, we look forward to being able to serve more and more of the area's needy... because unfortunately there are too many, and many are on our waiting list.

The Rock at NoonDay	319579		/users/profile/411239	19Icdat58	Donor	5	11/29/2016	I love The Rock at NoonDay ministry!  They truly live their mission and take care of those in the most need and often those who are not being served anywhere else.  In all things I have shown you that by working hard in this way we must help the weak and remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he himself said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.   Acts 20:35 (ESV): 
The Rock at NoonDay	288236		/users/profile/378446	Writer	Volunteer	5	05/04/2016	I was not sure what to expect when I first walked in the door but I quickly felt the Love of Christ from the staff and volunteers! They have a genuine heart for those in need. The staff go out of their way to make those being served feel loved and are treated like a family. They know the names of many of the homeless and are quick to greet them and brighten their day. When you have volunteers who love to come in and give of their time speaks not only of their giving hearts but also of how the ministry is run. The current staff is amazing. The meals are nutritious and delicious and the messages are Spirit filled. The Rock @ NoonDay is such a blessing to the city of Albuquerque.

The Rock at NoonDay	287566		/users/profile/377678	Writer	Volunteer	5	04/28/2016	Initially volunteering at the Rock at NoonDay (RAN) took a step of faith.  I did not know what to expect, because up until then, the only interaction with the homeless , was in a parking lot being asked for spare change.  That was always a scary.  What if i said no, what if they acted unpredictably, then what?  My first day volunteering to serve lunch at the RAN changed me forever.  I went from apprehensive interactions to seeing the homeless as brothers and sisters in Christ.  Not only did the staff warmly welcomed me, but I found it a safe place to place food in their hands, look them in the eye and say "God Bless you brother, I hope you enjoy the meal.  Now when I meet a homeless person I can share God's love and invite them to share a meal with the other volunteers and staff members.  My life was changed, so can yours.
The Rock at NoonDay	287549		/users/profile/377659	Writer	Volunteer	5	04/28/2016	 I started volunteering at the rock at noon day in December 2015 and I was humbled by the amount of volunteers willing to help out people in need since then I have brought my family to help out and they have been very humbled by the Experience. The RAN is always close to my heart and I volunteer as much as I can I'm so glad that my city and the volunteers I work with reach out and do what they can and I feel blessed by this
The Rock at NoonDay	272864		/users/profile/361998	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/24/2015	The Rock at Noonday is a wonderful partner to the other organizations that are providing housing to those experiencing homelessness.  I have provided outreach at Noonday for a number of years and they graciously provided me with the office space and other resources.  The staff and volunteers there are the best and I cannot describe my gratitude for their support and for all they do for our homeless brothers and sisters.

African Christian College	168839		/users/profile/223808	LeeT	Board Member	5	09/10/2013	I have been involved with African Christian College for 20+ years and have personally witnessed its transformation from a small school that trained ministers in Africa to a degree-granting institution training both men and women in multiple African nations to become active Christian leaders in their home communities. A significant source of support for the school comes from a high quality macadamia orchard planted and farmed on the school property. I would encourage anyone who believes in the importance Christian leaders in Africa nations and homes to join us in this effort. Lee Thompson
African Christian College	168561	1	/users/profile/223490	hhuffard	Board Member	5	09/09/2013	In 1997 I bought a few macadamia plants in the name of Nigerian Christian Bible College (where I was serving at the time) to add to the orchard at ACC.  Three years later, I visited the campus for the first time and was highly impressed. After becoming a board member, I taught in Swaziland a semester in 2007.  The school has upgraded considerably since I was there and is moving more toward sustainability with its bountiful macadamia harvests each year.  But the real story is the change the school makes in the lives of its students. Whole families move to the campus when accepted, and husbands and wives learn together and grow together. Ample opportunities for service are provided for students to help those in need living near the school. The faculty and staff are totally committed to giving students what they will need to be productive members of their communities after they graduate. As one who knows ACC from the bottom up, I affirm that it is a great nonprofit, carrying out its mission with excellence! 
African Christian College	167160		/users/profile/222005	lharms	Board Member	5	09/04/2013	I have been an active supporter of Afircan Christian College  (ACC) for over 15 years and have had the pleasure of visiting there twice. I was drawn to its mission to equip students for excellent service in God's Kingdom and the great people that are part of the faculty, staff and student body. When I see the real difference being made by and leadership roles being taken by our alumni throughout southern Africa I am proud to be able to be associated with ACC. I am truly excited that year after year things just keep getting better.
African Christian College	167073		/users/profile/221923	debprowell	Board Member	5	09/04/2013	I have been involved with the  school for twenty years. The growth in the school has been remarkable.not so much growth in numbers but growth in delivering the instruction that is most needed in Africa. Teaching the people to be self supporting and helping each other and not relying on outside sources. Truly "Africans helping Africans"
African Christian College	165184		/users/profile/219576	Joe Page	Board Member	4	08/16/2013	I've been on the oversight committee and a Board member for the past 15 years.  African Christian College as it is known today, and formerly Manzini Bible School, has endured challenges that if God had not been overseeing this work, the school would almost certainly not exist.  My association with this work has not only been satisfying, but has tremendously increased my  faith.    My first hand experience with observing how God has sustained and nurtured this school is my personal witness of God at work in this World today!  Joe Page, Albuquerque, NM
African Christian College	165152		/users/profile/219526	nut1276	Volunteer	5	08/16/2013	My husband and I have been volunteering at African Christian College for 6 years and have spent as much as 9 months a year on the campus in Swaziland. We are intimately acquainted with how the donors money is spent and we testify that none is wasted. This college teaches the students the importance of personal and business integrity and models that for them. Our students return to their homes prepared to support their families with their own hands and to be ethical community leaders. 
African Christian College	165041		/users/profile/219373	Larry8608	Board Member	5	08/14/2013	My wife and i have had the priviledge to serve at African Christian College for more than 10 years.  They have been the most rewarding years in our lives.  The students at ACC come from many southern and eastern African countries often selling everything they have and sometimes travelling weeks just to gain the opportunity to study and gain a degree at ACC.  The spiritual strength and desire to serve the Lord displayed by these young people is awesome. The college currently offers Theology degrees with majors in Ministry, Leadership and Counseling.  Throughout Africa there is consesus that what every country needs is honest, caring leaders.  African Christian College is preparing these type of graduates and sending them back to their home countries where they are becoming leaders in their churches, communities and countries. Please go to www.africanchristiancollege.org where you can learn more about the college and find ways you can get involved and be part of this outstanding kingdom work.
African Christian College	165001		/users/profile/219320	davidhstewart87020	Board Member	5	08/14/2013	African Christian College is an institution of higher education dedicated to spreading God's word throughout southern Africa. Our students are all given full ride scholarships and work on campus in our gardens, farm and macadamia orchard to earn spending money. Everyone attending is provided with a healthy diet at our central cafeteria. In addition to their formal education they are given training in skills such as barbering, farming, orchard management and raising of small livestock to help them make a living when they return home.  It is a great mission effort with a long history of success. Please join us by contributing today. You can get current updates about what is happening  on campus by going to http://www.africanchristiancollege.org 
African Christian College	164921		/users/profile/219223	Mswane	Volunteer	5	08/14/2013	My name is Luke Mswane. I am currently one of the Board Members. I have known The African Christian College for more than 20 years ( formerly known as the Manzini Bible School). The College has had positive impact on many people's lives directly and indirectly through the many number of students who have been trained on Theology by the Institution. Today the Institution continues to reach out to the people of the Southern African region, East Africa, etc to equip them with leadership skills,  theology, counseling. They are definitely making a positive contribution to the lives of many people. 
African Christian College	164909		/users/profile/219203	jlynnrhodes	Volunteer	5	08/14/2013	I first came to African Christian College in January, 2012 to teach in the areas of theology and counseling. I can easily say this has been some of my life's most rewarding work. By working with students from 9 different African countries I can help make a difference all over southern Africa. It has been a thrill to see graduates from African Christian College returning home and immediately beginning to do things that are having a great impact for the Kingdom of God.  That is why I spend nine months a year here on the campus.  Here at ACC I have the privilege of working with some great people.  The faculty and staff  are dedicated Christians.  In addition, I have met and worked with people who come here to teach college classes for either 2 weeks or nine weeks at a time. Others have come for special projects such as building our new library.  Some of the best professors from Abilene Christian University, Oklahoma Christianity University and Harding School of Theology have been here to teach classes.  It has also been a joy to see people who are not able to come teach, but who give their time and money to help make things possible that are facilitating our growth.  Right now housing for married students is being built thanks to a generous donor of money and others who are giving their time to supervise the construction.  At the start of this year we were able to give each of our students a laptop computer. Now we are installing a campus wide Wi-Fi system to enable them to study and do research on the internet. The computers and internet access have been made possible by people who love the Lord and let their money to show it.  
African Christian College	164895		/users/profile/219173	susan225	Volunteer	5	08/13/2013	My husband and I have been volunteers at African Christian College for 10 years. We believe in the mission of training students from all over central and southern Africa to return to their countries with the education and skills needed to impact their own culture and their own communities. No one else could go in the midst of culture and community and jump the hurdles it would take to reach people for Christ, to reach people where they are hurting, to lead communities to solutions of their problems.ACC tries to do that.
Deming Animal Guardians	234456		/users/profile/299363	Debbie154	Volunteer	5	11/25/2014	Deming Animal Guardians is committed to helping the animals of Luna County. There current efforts to help a paralyzed Dachsund is  amazing. As a recent volunteer, I am very impressed with the tireless efforts to raise money to help pay for the endless needs of an organization that provides education and spay/ neuter programs. Keep up the good work!
Deming Animal Guardians	145652		/users/profile/192180	alsmith52	General Member of the Public	5	12/03/2012	Having lived in San Antonio Texas before moving to Deming, I have been impressed with DAG efforts to reduce the stray population in Luna County. DAG is dedicated to improving the lives of animals and their owners. DAG provides low cost  and sometime free spay / neuter services to the community, emergency services to pets and their owners, and the general improvement of  the lives of animals in Luna County. DAG does a tremendous job considering all are volunteers and there are no paid employees. My hat is off to Pat and the Deming Animal Guardians.

Deming Animal Guardians	144627		/users/profile/191164	Susan House	Donor	5	11/29/2012	One of the most caring, helpful, heartfelt and active organizations in the Southwest. Volunteers work tirelessly to solve an epidemic of un-neutered/spayed domestic animals. They work to elevate pain and suffering of the abused and provide food to those that need help to keep their pets in their homes. They are active on every front for the abused, the loved and the wild.
Deming Animal Guardians	144602		/users/profile/191140	Deming Animal Guardians	Board Member	5	11/29/2012	Deming Animal Guardians is an amazing, all-volunteer charity that has been assisting companion animals and their people for over 21 years.   With volunteers working from their homes, more animals can be assisted.  DAG has sponsored the spaying/neutering of 9,500 dogs and cats in Luna County, New Mexico!  I am proud to be a part of this dynamic and energetic group!  Deming Animal Guardians folks are relentless!
Deming Animal Guardians	138301		/users/profile/184358	fdwill	Donor	5	11/13/2012	This organization is one of the best organized group that I have encountered. Their mission is worthy; they are effective at fundraising to support their efforts without being pushy or resorting to pitiful pictures to pull at heartstrings; and best of all, they have excellent leadership. The emphasis on spay/neuter efforts is well thought out, preventing many adoption problems later. Truly a worthy non-profit for your recognition.
Deming Animal Guardians	135490		/users/profile/181353	gadlight	Donor	5	11/08/2012	Wow, the work that this group does in incredible.  They do an amazing job on so many levels and help so many people and animals.  Their board is totally dedicated to helping animals, even when it isn't part of their purview.  Animal Control officers call them instead of the humane society shelter some times to help problem solve.  My biggest concern is that one day they'll all burn out and give up the fight, but so far they're still going strong.
Deming Animal Guardians	132953		/users/profile/178640	suepy66	General Member of the Public	5	11/02/2012	I have known of the Animal Guardians for a number of years and have been amazed at the work they do. The help they provide to the many people who have come to them in need of help for their pets is and has been life saving to many. They get a spay/neuter van in about twice a year to help low income pet owners spay or neuter their pets. I personally have helped on one of those vans and the work the ladies do is amazing and all for the love of animals. Amazing group of ladies. I feel this non-profit organization should be recognized for all the help they have given to so many.
Deming Animal Guardians	131378		/users/profile/176935	rcallo	Volunteer	5	10/30/2012	Deming Animal Guardians helps low income people with the cost of spaying or neutering their pets. People who call regularly receive 50% to 100% toward the Vet bill. Coupons are issued to the pet owner and they're given lots of info on how to arrange the Vet appointment and given info on shots and other pertinent questions. A food bank is also available to help people in an emergency situation feed their animals. Almost 9500 animals have been spayed or neutered using this organization. One phone call is all it takes to get help. The constant onslaught of puppies or kittens from just one female pet can strain a low income budget to its limits. People are greatly relieved to get relief from the unrelenting problem of what to do with all these unwanted animals. Deming Animal Guardians is a great non-profit to have!
Deming Animal Guardians	128770		/users/profile/174003	gadbell	Board Member	5	10/25/2012	I've been on 3 or 4 non-profit boards in my life and there are several reasons why I think Deming Animal Guardians deserves a 5 star review.   They're an all-volunteer charity which means that their overhead is incredibly low, consistently

Boys and Girls Club of Sierra Blanca	180301		/users/profile/236959	james96	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/20/2013	This place has literally changed our community!  There was a time when the children had no where to go, and the parents of those children had no where to work because they had to care for the Children. Well I am happy to say that has changed. The boys and girls club provides a place for the children to congregate, learn, and enjoy a healthy meal while parents of those children can now work because they know their children are in a safe place.  I congratulate Sierra Blanca Boys and Girls Club. Thank you for all you do

I am on the Board of Directors of the Little Bear Forest Reform Coalition and we had an incredible interactive presentation between our organization, American Wildfire, the Ruidoso board of Realtors and private citizens that blew me away.  These kids are hungry for information and eager to  learn. I will always support this organization.

There had been a shortage of qualified child care facilities and safe "kid friendly" activities for far too long.  Now, we are blessed to have an amazing staff of dedicated, caring individuals who truly have our children's best interests at heart.  It's nice to know our children are being well cared for, learning & enjoying themselves when we can not be with them....Many thanks to the staff, Board & volunteers who graciously provide their time to the "club".  I always refer friends, co-workers and clients to the Boys and Girls Club of Sierra Blanca!  :)  
Boys and Girls Club of Sierra Blanca	179899		/users/profile/236547	cindylynch	Donor	5	10/19/2013	Ruidoso is a small mountain community whose economic engine is fueled by tourism.   It costs  more to live here; consequently,  most households have a working Mom and Dad.  The need for a Boys and Girls Club was tremendous.  Since it's inception, all have been astounded at the overwhelming success.  The dedication of the volunteer Board of Directors and staff are to be highly commended for a stupendous job well done!
Boys and Girls Club of Sierra Blanca	179678		/users/profile/236324	Glen Cheng	Board Member	5	10/18/2013	I was selected as a board member in August 2013, and in my time there I have found that my fellow board members, the Director, and staff are absolutely committed to the success of the organization, but more importantly, the kids.  The programs that have been put into place are a positive influence and change the lives of the children whether they are at-risk or not.  The truth is that all kids are at-risk, and the Club has provided a safe, positive, and constructive environment that they can grow and just have fun.  The staff takes great pride in their jobs, and it's clear that they are very much invested in the success and well-being of the kids that go to the Club.  I spoke to one of the staff today, and she told me about how they resolved a bullying situation.  I've also heard from multiple staff members and kids that they come to the club because their home lives aren't that great, and they feel more comfortable at the Club than they do at home.  I can say that I am proud to serve as a board member and will do anything to help ensure the success of the Club and the continuation and growth of their programs.

The organization is well run by committed professionals, staff and volunteers.  The Executive Director does a fantastic job and is well respected in our area.  This program meets the needs of children who would otherwise "fall through the cracks."

I feel that the study and practice of the Eternal Divine Path can lead one to freedom from egoistic desires, lower natures and therefore allow the earth to heal.  It is indeed geared for the social justice of all men.
Eternal Divine Path the Mission of Maitreya	94461		/users/profile/109248	Elvira Abraham	Volunteer	5	07/27/2011	First time I read this book is in the beginning of 2010. The first book I read was The Revelation Of The Revelation and the second was The Plan. After that, I never realized how my life change, I got everything that I long for lifetime, my soul-mate; and a better way of thinking.And this brought changes to my soul-mate too. His life really change.  I don't really know what is the connection between this book and us ( me and my soul-mate ). Once, I lost connection to the link, so I cannot read more. I tried to find it outside, the only thing I can find only one page and one group under The Greatest Sign Avatar.  But, meanwhile, I learn many things about the world from internet. About how man could be God, Alien Disclosure, Crop Circles, I found so many Maitreya in facebook, twitter, etc. I had learn about them, following and know what they are teaching to humanity, I could easily to understand, I can even say "Oh, I'm more clever then they are." Because when you have the psychic ability without teacher, you will become an arrogant person. Strangely, not even one Maitreya I can meet and talk and ask about everything. And I keep searching searching and searching. Meanwhile, me and my soul-mate became separate again with quarrel and rush.  So, short story, I met Dottie and Sharon, thanks to God. They make me believe that this Maitreya is the real One, the only One who could interpret about Satrio Piningit. Then, I met Him, talk to Him, ask Him questions, He always has time to do that for me, and others. ( Hei ! I have Teacher now )My respect for Him. Suddenly, me and my soul mate together again, and I got everything I want because he is with me now, home ( not house ), love, ( could you explain "everything? I don't think so, because it is not worldly ). So, that is all from me, still the big question in my mind, why I met my soul mate after I found this book ( THOTH ) ? ATTG
Eternal Divine Path the Mission of Maitreya	94135	1	/users/profile/100710	deb mills	Volunteer	5	07/20/2011	The Mission of Maitreya is able to address the need for justice for all humanity because it is based on the true teachings of God, as shared by His Prophet, who opened the Seven Seals as prophesied.  There are sections in the Scripture The Holiest of the Holies, The Last Testament that explain how the human can bring a True Godly society (with The Communities of Light as the base) and eventually leading to His Kingdom being on earth as it is in Heaven. Eventually it will lead to the reduction of suffering and the oppurtunity for True Godly happiness for all.
Eternal Divine Path the Mission of Maitreya	88983	1	/users/profile/100710	deb mills	Volunteer	5	05/20/2011	The Eternal Divine Path, Mission of Maitreya shows the unity of all people no matter their religion, race or backround.  It is my pleasure to be able to share with others this Path, and the goal of the Life which is to become Divine.  Many incerdible people are trying to do the same.  Maitreya, the world teacher is the founder of the teachings and has also brought the scripture The Holiest of the Holies, The Last Testament to humanity.  The web site is located at www.maitreya.org  All Thanks to God for the opputunity to serve Him in this Great work.
Eternal Divine Path the Mission of Maitreya	94023	2	/users/profile/108568	Unus	Advisor	5	07/19/2011	I am a psychologist and a yoga teacher. and Mission of Maitreya has given me everything that I need to know, do etc. to help my self fully first. I find answers to all my questions about the past, present and the future as well as the nature of the universe and man. Everything suggested in the Teachings this organization presents is a cure for humanity individually and collectively. So besides helping myself ,Mission of Maitreya enabled me to even help others in their self-realization endeavours.  Therefore I suggest everyone study the Teachings they present and test it yourself. The motto is "Go to the Highest Directly!" 
Eternal Divine Path the Mission of Maitreya	94019	1	/users/profile/108554	Dolores Vogelsang	Volunteer	5	07/19/2011	The Mission of Maitreya represents universal social justice (social justice for all).  The teachings tell us that everyone should have their physiological and safety needs met.  This will come about when we begin to come together to create Communities of Light (communities where the Eternal Divine Path and Gods Laws are followed).  
Eternal Divine Path the Mission of Maitreya	93965	2	/users/profile/108437	Noor E.	Board Member	5	07/17/2011	Nothing could contribute more to social justice than the Revelation of the truth behind this universe, why we are here, what the Goal of Life is, etc., and an explanation of how to live life in harmony with God's Way and Laws (Nature).  In Revelation in the Bible, it is prophesied that God would remain a mystery until the Seventh Angel comes.  Maitreya of the Mission of Maitreya (not related to other Maitreya groups) is the Seventh Angel, and has brought the seventh and final Revelation of God.  His teachings show how the religions of the world are not contradictory and opposed, but complementary and indeed all from the same One God.   Maitreya also shows the way to bring the Highest form of social justice to the world, through the way each individual should live their life, to the development of strong family units and communities, and eventually to a world governmental system based on God.  His teachings encompass all parts of human life, and are complete in a way no other religion has been (as was prophesied and Planned by God).   The Goal is: Peace on earth and a world unified and strong under truth, the minimum needs provided for all humans, going back to the natural way without pollution and destruction of our environment (still using technology, but without pollution or negative side-effects), reaching to space for unlimited resources and room for growth, and much more.  Overall, it is the establishment of the Kingdom of Heaven on earth, as it is in Heaven!  We do not ask anyone to accept and believe these claims blindly, but ask that they study Maitreya's teachings for themselves and prove to themselves that it is the Truth and from God.  All of Maitreya's writings and discourses, the prophecies he has fulfilled, etc. are freely available for anyone to study for themselves on the Mission of Maitreya website: www.maitreya.org .  Do not take anyone's word for it, but go to the Source and find the truth for yourself!
Eternal Divine Path the Mission of Maitreya	88958	1	/users/profile/100680	Ananda Ma	Volunteer	5	05/20/2011	This Path just makes so much sense.  It shows that God does not consider any one religion superior or inferior to the others.  Each is equal and each has a unique message.  When these messages are put together, as they are in The Greatest Sign (a yantra for the Eternal Divine Path), they show the Way that when walked, takes each of us Home, to the Promised Land, to Pure Consciousness.

Eternal Divine Path the Mission of Maitreya	88402		/users/profile/99465	Tahirah	Volunteer	5	05/05/2011	These teachings clarify the confusion among humanity.  They show how each religion, indeed, has an important part of the whole truth! When they are understood and realized how each step has been God's plan and each religion has been his plan and how perfectly it has been given, it just fills the heart with love.  God is so pure and generous in His Light. I have been studying the teachings of Maitreya for over 20 years and have not found anything like it in this world.  It is so simply and truthfully presented that when your heart and soul knows the truth of it, you smile inside and say, yes! Every person should at least hear and know the teachings once in their lifetime.  They will never be the same.  The Holy Spirit moves in and through Maitreya's teachings. I say, read THOTH (The Holiest of the Holies) study it often, and then listen and read His Discourses and Satsangs.  It is a continuous flow of Divine Energy .

The skills these women are learning helps build confidence, and helps the women learn a skill that will allow them to have a flexible schedule.

Birthing Project USA	187793		/users/profile/102396	Toni H.	Volunteer	5	11/04/2013	Birthing Project USA is an awesome organization which began over twenty-five years ago as a grassroots organization by ten women and one man who truly wanted to make a difference in the lives of families from African decent.  The Birthing Project is a true example of the power a few dedicated volunteers can have.  Under the direction of founder Kathryn Hall-Trujillo, affectionately known as Mama Katt to those involved with the program, this once small group has come to support and empower families on a global scale.  The beauty of the birthing project is that each individual involved truly wants to improve upon our future starting one baby at a time.  I always look forward to the yearly conference/meeting.  It is an amazing time to be able to spend with women and men from everywhere with one common goal in mind.  Lastly I love the concept of Safe Birth Kits, which are only $5.
Birthing Project USA	187394		/users/profile/244406	arogers-johnson	Volunteer	5	11/01/2013	Birthing Project USA is the perfert example of grass roots organizations.  We provide cost effective  practical social care  and caring to pregnant women, families and communities both locally and globally.  No other organization I know will come to the house and see "how you're doing".  Birthing Project  is the perferct fit for African American culture.  A big thank you to Kathryn Hall-Trujillo for the vision that has open my eyes to the possibilities of volunteering.   Alice Rogers-JohnsonSoutheast Arkansas

Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/01/2013	The Birthing Project USA which is a volunteer effort that utilizes the strengths of the community to encourage better birth outcomes.   We are trying to keep more babies alive and healthy here in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis/St. Paul. This is our strategy!  We are gonna support our moms & babies and be there when they need us!  Minnesota's pre-term birth rate has grown worse. The change isn't drastic; the rate climbed just three-tenths of a percent last year, from 9.9 percent in 2011 to 10.2 percent in 2012. Among Minnesota's American Indians, 13 percent of babies are born prematurely, and 12.7 percent of black infants are, compared to 9.4 percent for whites. Our work is to change this with using the Birthing Project USA model!!
Birthing Project USA	187319		/users/profile/244314	doulababy	Volunteer	4	11/01/2013	My history with BPUSA began in 2007 as a volunteer community-based doula. I had the opportunity to serve women in my community who exhibited great risks for infant mortality due to their environment, lack of support during their prenatal period, & limited access to navigate resources in the community. After assisting more than 40 families toward healthy birth outcomes, I was saddened by the prospect of giving it all up when our local program lost its funding & we had to close our doors. As I continued to serve the community, requests for the birthing project services were continually being presented to me; so I inquired about continuing the program in my local community. I wanted to continue to volunteer my services to expand the legacy that was established by BPUSA. To date, my local community has been honored with 2 distinct projects, served over 300 families toward healthy birth outcomes & continue to provide programming in a unique way that garners proven results. It is my pleasure to volunteer my time & effort to serve in the capacity that I love: empowering & educating families to make healthy, evidence-based consent to birth with dignity, pride & respect. Thank you BPUSA for establishing the template to foster my calling.

Birthing Project USA	182721		/users/profile/239595	Children of the Sun Birthing Project	Volunteer	5	10/26/2013	I am Project Manager for an affiliate project of BPusa in Sacramento, California. This national and international effort has supported no less than 13,000 at risk babies. The support from the umbrella organization and leadership is phenomenal. We are encouraged to find high caliber volunteers to meet needs of babies at highest risk of infant mortality and morbidity in a way that makes sense for the individual community. In Sacramento we have a goal of lowering rates and preventing the children of pregnant teens in foster care from ending up in the system. BPusa has given us the tools to find little sisters, match them with sister-friend volunteers. As a result we have healthy, full term babies born into our project. Without our parent organization we would have a difficult time meeting our goals. But our success doesn't end at US borders. BPusa supports babies in 9 countries who face health care inequities to the tune of maternal deaths being an expected outcome. Thanks to the projects, safe birth kits are distributed preventing maternal and infant deaths in rural communities around the world.
Birthing Project USA	145044		/users/profile/191603	Christina43	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/30/2012	This organization is truly revolutionary. By building on the assets of the African-American community, and providing the kind of personalized, caring connections that at-risk moms and babies need to overcome the personal and social barriers to healthy pregnancies, safe births, and secure and stable families, they are truly making a difference where many social and medical services cannot despite their best efforts and intentions.  By providing a trained, caring volunteer "Sister-friend" who can support the new mama with whatever she needs, help her make the best use of the services available to her, and to believe in herself and her right to a healthy life and family, the Birthing Project is bringing longstanding African values to a modern American problem that we have not been able to fix otherwise- the disproportionate prematurity and deaths of moms and babies of African descent. The founder Kathryn Hall-Trujillo is recognized nationally and globally for her pioneering work.  You can help her found a Birthing Project resource center so that this project can be replicated more broadly. Now in over 100 communities worldwide and counting 13,000 babies born into the arms of empowered mamas, its success is unquestioned.  Help spread the love to more at risk babies and mamas today, you can make a real difference. Donations made before 12/27 will help qualify us reach a crucial fundraising goal for 2012 that will qualify us for further foundation funding in 2013.

As a first time homebuyer, I was unfamiliar with what I needed to do and how to ask the right questions.

Santa Fe Animal Shelter Inc	147813	5	/users/profile/174791	Skye Danser	Donor	1	01/08/2013	The Director reportedly lives in a home owned by the Shelter and receives other perks that are not reported in her $142K salary. The Shelter is having budget problems and has reduced staff in such a way as to negatively impact animal care, including an increase in the number of animals being put to sleep; and reducing adoption fees which has resulted in puppies being "re-sold" on Craigslist. I am always concerned about any manager that surrounds herself with highly paid friends as the Director has done. The most highly paid positions at the Shelter are filled with the Director's friends and that reduces the likelihood that a "whistle blower" will report malfeasance. This practice should be a red flag for the Board but not if they are also carefully chosen friends . The Shelter has many wonderful qualities, and it has the capacity to truly be one of the best animal shelters in the country, but to achieve its full potential, the Board needs to clean house. Current management is a liability.

The sessions provided to partners was outstanding.  I learned so much and was pleased with the experience based teaching methods used to describe how our clients would perceive learning a new skill.  I would most definitely advise others in the adult learning service to become involved with NMCL.

This organization provides us with expert trainings, leadership and support on all levels. I am proud to operate an organization under NMCL's umbrella.

New Mexico Coalition For Literacy	151378	1	/users/profile/202088	Thelma Sordyl	Volunteer	5	03/20/2013	I am a teacher and will always believe that the only way any one can be successful and independent will be by having the ability to read.  NMCL is a very important part of our society in addition to schools.  This organization helps provide the help that many people were not able to find or be successful while at school.  I am very proud of the young ladies that run NMCL, they are very professional and conscientious about the need of literacy in the State of New Mexico.  They take their job seriously and have compassion for the needs of our adults that were failed by the school systems, society and others.  
Girls Inc. of Santa Fe	278843		/users/profile/368840	Writer	Former staff	5	02/02/2016	I worked for Girls Inc. of Santa Fe several years ago and I still think about what an amazing experience it was. The carefully chosen staff is extremely dedicated, enthusiastic, and intentional. It is because of this that the girls have such a rich experience. This community is so very lucky to have such a safe and enriching space to grow and learn.

It is safe, convenient, enriching and affordable and I can't thank them enough for "being there" for the community. They pick my girl up from school, feed her a snack and keep her entertained with lots of fun and educational games until I can get her after work. She also gets help with her homework and valuable life-skills guidance. I love the strong focus on teamwork, compassion and acceptance. Here are just a few things that my daughter loves: "Art projects, science, and playing outside!"

I volunteered again over the summer to help out with their art show on the plaza.  It's a great place to volunteer your time.

Girls Inc. of Santa Fe	84238	1	/users/profile/93408	Pamela M.	Volunteer	5	03/30/2011	In 1998, I had the privilege of being the lead artist on a mural project at Girl's Inc., working  all summer with the girls and staff. Enthusiasm, creativity, leadership, support, care and community awareness best describe this incredible agency and the girls served. The mural project was supported by the CIty of Santa Fe and private funders. Thirteen years later, the mural is as beautiful as ever, proudly demonstrating the group's care to their property and respect for the work of their clients... the fabulous girls. The services provided by GIrl's Inc. are many and often go unsung.

Girls Inc. of Santa Fe	83476	1	/users/profile/92487	befreckled	Professional with expertise in this field	5	03/28/2011	I was a program facilitator/program specialist at Girls Inc of Santa Fe for about four years.  From the day I started, I've been thrilled to see how this organization has grown in that span of years.  Everyone works hard to provide for the girls and their families, even in this recession where money was scarce.  Girls Inc of Santa Fe taught me what a community looks like, what it can accomplish and what it does for the larger, surrounding communities.  Not only was I able to teach girls how to be strong, smart and bold; I learned what those words meant as well.  The groups that I was fortunate to facilitate changed me for the better.  I became a stronger person.  I became a better person.  Girls Inc of Santa Fe takes great strides towards being inclusive, embracing families of all shapes and sizes and supporting every girl who is looking for a safe space.  They've never turned anyone away for lack of ability to pay.  They understand that all girls are at risk in some fashion and each day, the staff works to make the two locations a beacon for girls and their families.  While I am no longer an employee, I'm still involved in small ways and the friendships I've made during my time at the Santa Fe Girls Inc will last me my whole life.  If I had been introduced to a space like Girls Inc when I was growing up, it would have given me a lot more agency earlier in life.  I'm proud that I've been able to provide that for my girls.  I'm proud to have been a part of this amazing local non-profit.

As soon as he was placed on their waiting list, I saw a positive change in his outlook on life.  THANK YOU Paws and Stripes for helping our veterans live a full life!

The Paws and Stripes team, employees and volunteers, work tirelessly to fulfill the organization's mission.  Its an honor to be serve such an ethical, genuine and committed organization.  
Paws and Stripes	233520	2	/users/profile/297362	pamarianetti	Donor	5	11/12/2014	We met this organization at a function that recognize some of the work they do for our disabled veterans. We would have to say that the presentation, interaction of the trainers, the use of rescued animals, and the ability to help our veterans was unbelievable. The evening we spent with them was like no other that we have spent at other charitable events. The atmosphere of our original meeting and the people involved was like a very large family gathering. We were welcomed just like a normal family member and the training that goes on between the dogs and the veterans is just mind-boggling and has an aura of one large family.We live not walked in their footsteps would never imagine the trauma, and joy that is involved in this process. I would highly, highly recommend people to get involved with this organization. 
Paws and Stripes	233506	5	/users/profile/297342	ngsale	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/12/2014	I found this charity one year ago, and have been working to support them even since.  The work that they do is unique in the US, for at least two reasons. They obtain their dogs from shelters, which means that there is little or no cost to procure the animal.  Secondly, they provide more extensive and intimate mental health services to their veteran clients and their families than other similar programs, so the result is a healthy outcome for both the dogs and the vets.  There is no cost to the veteran for this service.  All of their funds come from donations.   Nell Graham Sale

I said yes and chose the last dog to be my service dog and the director of training (main dog trainer) told me no I cannot have him. I filed a complaint with the CEO and she did not show any empathy about my concerns. I paid $2500.00 to get a dog and they refuse to refund me the money. I would not recommend this company to any veterans at all.  I have gone to another company out of state and they are ten times BETTER.
Tewa Women United	122684	1	/users/profile/167102	LivingStrong	Client Served	5	09/20/2012	There are many resources out there but very few if you do not know they exist. I know Tewa Women United is there.  I feel I have come along way in my own life's journey. through the trainings I have experienced at Tewa Women United, one that has helped me see the bigger picture of what I want for my people is the healing we must go through to be able to move forward. For me the healing was for me and just wanting to be a better parent than I was being, was what I wanted. The trama rock presentation was an eye  opening experience for me to know that I did not want to continue to add weight to my children  but to start removing it and not continue to add my trama to their shoulders. I want my children to have a positive environment to grow up. I would like them to have the confidence to make better choices in life than I did. I truly know they are grasping that through their participation in TWU. With my teenager coming to ask  me, her auntie and her grandmother questions I would never had thought to ask as a teenager.
Tewa Women United	122503	1	/users/profile/166842	valverde	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/18/2012	I've had the privilege of working alongside Tewa Women United in a professional capacity for nearly a year, and have found them to bring extraordinary passion, clarity, and expertise to their work. They are passionate about serving the Pueblo people in their region; they are clear about the inner resources and outside pressures they and their constituents face; they are expert at crafting effective programs to meet the needs they identify as most pressing. Every person who works at TWU is there because they believe their effort will help make a change for the better, and the stories I've heard confirm that they are right. Tewa Women United fills a crucial role in northern New Mexico, working on multiple fronts to put an end to the rampant violence against women and to support the rights of indigenous people in the region. Their work is invested with a deep spirituality even as it takes a pragmatic approach to the world as it is. For TWU (or any small nonprofit working for social justice) to have survived as an organization for as long as it has is something of a miracle; for it to thrive, to face new challenges and find positive solutions from diverse arenas, is a testament to the hard work and dedication of the extraordinary people who comprise the organization.
Tewa Women United	122472	1	/users/profile/166791	esperoquesi	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/17/2012	As a professional in the field of social justice, I have seen how Tewa Women United provides extraordinary support to the community through its hard working staff and events that promote the strength and resiliency of the pueblo people and traditions.  The separate program areas are coordinated  to address root causes of violence and injustice in a holistic way.  The organization is committed to continuous quality improvement, and has recently completed a series of activities to strengthen its capacity for effectively promoting social change.   Staff have benefited from many opportunities for professional development and leadership.  
Tewa Women United	122447		/users/profile/166763	Slowandsteady	Professional with expertise in this field	4	09/17/2012	Tewa Women United is a unique, dynamic and responsive community-based organization that has, for more than two decades, built a solid, effective intersectional analysis and action based in Native values. If this organization did not exist, there would be a gaping hole in the community. As a non-tribally affiliated organization, TWU works across pueblos on issues of tremendous importance in a way other entities, mired in bureaucracy, often can't. They have current audits on file and have solid, long-term relationships with many competent, well-informed funders within the state of NM and across the country. They are a long-standing and respected member of local, state, national and international communities working for health, safety and environmental justice.
Tewa Women United	122431		/users/profile/166747	GonzalezP	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/17/2012	Tewa Women United has been a pathbreaking organization since its inception. TWU has courageously taken on the work of ending violence against Native women and girls. With vision, commitment and profound integrity, TWU has made lasting change not just in the immediate community but nationally and internationally where its work has been consistently held up as a model. TWU's successes in its main focus areas of sexual violence, environmental justice, health, and economic freedom, combined with the healing of mind, body and spirit, demonstrates that if such holistic approaches were more mainstream, we would stand a chance at effectively ending violence in our lives. As a women's rights advocate, it has been a true gift and honor to come across TWU. It fills me with such hope, and I am grateful that TWU is doing the importatn work that it's doing and that it can share with many others so we too can learn from their wisdom.
Tewa Women United	84588	5	/users/profile/93839	guacamole	Volunteer	1	03/31/2011	I was active with this organization for more than a couple of years and was glad to leave. I saw multiple volunteers have their time wasted on projects that benefited no one but the family running the organization and other employees and their families (ex: they had development projects done on their personal property.) The managers were wasteful of donations and grants as well. Expensive trips were made with no tangible benefit all over the country and even to other countries on a rare occasion by various employees multiple times a year. Sometimes employees took their family along on the company (or donor) dollar as well. The board was hand-picked by management (which was a mother-daughter team) and rarely attended board meetings or were involved in decision making. There was one active board member during my time there and she was eventually "frozen out" for asking questions and critiquing management. Management abused company property (the director's daughter lives in a trailer that was donated to the organization without paying a cent. and the mother and daughter set their own salaries without board involvement or concern for organizational needs. Overall, I feel that this organization had some good programs, but the self-centered management wasted opportunity after opportunity and dollar after dollar. I will never donate time or money to them again after seeing so much on the inside. I saw so many things that were unethical and I was worried that they were even borderline unlawful.

With funding supplied in part through The Kohn Foundation, the Humane Society of Grand Bahama sponsors free spay and neuter clinics in order to educate local residents and curb the potcake population.  As the owner/guardian of two rescued potcakes -- who would not be here but for these efforts -- I strongly urge others to work with and support The Kohn Foundation.
Kohn Foundation	63501		/users/profile/69428	jmensendic	Board Member	4	02/04/2011	I am extremely proud to be associated with The Kohn Foundation.  The work being done in the Bahamas creates a bridge of friendship and compassion between two neighbors.   One remarkable accomplishment by the foundation is the number of "potcake puppy lifts" that have been conducted.  These rescue operations bring dogs that would surely be euthanized in the Bahamas to the United States where they are adopted by American families.  These lifts are successful because they employ a broad partnership of compassionate families, dedicated veterinarians and generous corporations.   Additionally, The Kohn Foundation gives a hand up to worthy Bahamian students who are committed to improving their lives through continuing education.  The scholarship program has received the support of international donors who recognize the impact that education makes in the lives of the student and their extended family.

Not only are they the states largest no kill shelter, they take animals from high kill shelters throughout the state so they are not euthanized.  One of my most rewarding days volunteering at the ranch was when I was able to go to the Rio Rancho animal shelter and get four cats to bring to the ranch.The ranch also helps people!  Those requiring court ordered community service are welcome to volunteer to work off those hours. If people come and tell them that they can't afford to feed their pets, Watermelon will give them food!I could go on and on about how great this place is and how it falls my heart with joy whenever I volunteer.  
Watermelon Mountain Ranch Inc	280369		/users/profile/370227	Writer	Volunteer	5	02/16/2016	Watermelon Mountain Ranch is a great place to volunteer--and a wonderful cause.  They do not have a lot of money--but what they do have is used in a fantastic way, and the sweat equity of the full-time staff and volunteers closes the gap.  I have been volunteering almost every Sunday since April 2013 and have never had a bad experience.  The dogs love the interaction they get from the volunteers and staff--and the only sad days--actually mixed emotions--is when a dog I become close to gets adopted out to a permanent loving home.  If you want a rewarding experience--this is a great place to volunteer.

WEFTA works directly with communities in an atmosphere of mutual respect and fraternity and this is resulting in miracles.  We in Latin America need WEFTA and we trust them! Enrique Lozano CamposHonduras
Water Engineers for the Americas	194752		/users/profile/254514	blancasurgeon	Board Member	5	02/23/2014	The reason I support WEFTA is because you can see the difference it makes in people's lives in a very physical way, water running through a faucet, the smile of children seeing water in their school, the happiness of women having water in front or back of their homes, it is amazingly rewarding. As a volunteer or donor you are welcomed to go visit one of the projects or the project you funded plus talk to the people who benefited, and if you don't speak Spanish, no problem, WEFTA will pair you up with someone who does. WEFTA can bring water to an entire village with a small amount of funding but projects are well built because WEFTA engineers design and oversee projects. 
Water Engineers for the Americas	194717		/users/profile/254474	JasonGehrig	Volunteer	5	02/22/2014	WEFTA is an effective, nimble non-profit dedicated to linking up water supply and treatment specialists between the northern and southern hemispheres of the Americas.  From training Bolivian partners in North Texas with local water well drillers to partnering experienced wastewater treatment engineers with municipal leaders committed to restoring the waters of the Peruvian sacred valley leading to Machu Pichu, WEFTA promotes relationships of mutual respect and lasting impact.   With its minimal overhead, this volunteer-driven NGO channels donations from people of good will in the U.S. to grassroots water supply and sanitation projects in a multitude of Latin American countries, leveraging local municipal and benefiting community funds and resources to achieve successful water projects.  In doing so, historically marginalized communities are strengthened and improved access to safe water in families' homes are seen as an achievement involving shared sacrifice and not a dependency-creating handout.  The biggest challenge facing WEFTA and its local partners is the overwhelming number of requests from materially impoverished communities in light of limited funding.
Water Engineers for the Americas	194504		/users/profile/254184	JeffAbbott	Advisor	5	02/19/2014	This is a very effective nonprofit with extremely low overhead.  Volunteer engineers use their own vacation time to provide expertise and follow up for simple water systems for communities in Latin America.  It is one of the few water organizations that concentrates on this part of the world (only 10% of funding for water projects is designated for Latin America).  The communities themselves raise a portion of the money for system materials; they also gather material (such as gravel) and perform the non-skilled labor.  WEFTA only works where it is invited, and it has a growing number of requests for assistance due to word of mouth.  A great nonprofit to support because the WEFTA's follow-up visits to check on the systems mean they will provide potable water and/or basic sanitation for generations to come.  
Water Engineers for the Americas	194425		/users/profile/254072	WebVolunteer	Volunteer	5	02/17/2014	WEFTA donates time and expertise of its engineers from the US and Latin America so that families can design and maintain affordable water systems.  As a volunteer there, I was struck by the dedication and compassion of the engineers.   WEFTA distinguishes itself from other water nonprofits because it guarantees its work for the lifetime of the project.  Members return again and again to check on the system and make repairs and adjustments.  I know of no other water organization that does this consistently.  
Water Engineers for the Americas	194410		/users/profile/254055	JMDonor	Donor	5	02/17/2014	My favorite memory from Bolivia takes place in front of a small adobe hut in the Alti Plano, surrounded by villagers celebrating their new community well and waterlines. A simple concrete stand has been lavishly decorated with a traditional shawl, hat and skirts to resemble a local Aymara woman. Its pretty clever.  As I move closer for a better look, someone lifts the colorful skirts and turns on the tapdousing me with clean, very cold, water! I still have one of the hand woven alpaca shawls that were wrapped around me and a small group of WEFTA engineers as the evening chill set in. I knew these dedicated volunteers had worked closely with this community to design a simple, functional system that included a cold-water tap in front of every home.  Now that I think about itI was probably the only one who didnt know what was hidden beneath that womans skirts!More recently, I was lucky enough to combine a trip to Macchu Picchu with a visit to the string of towns along the Valle Sagrada with two WEFTA engineers.  No cold wet surprises there, rather a sobering education in the realities of booming tourism and a desperate need for adequate sanitation.  This time, I was more aware of the lengthy preparation that goes into such a projectWEFTA engineers do not offer advice or expertise that has not been requested.  Macchu Picchu is stunningbut it is the days I spent in the string of communities along the polluted, garbage strewn Urubamba River that remain in my heart.  As a donor, my job was basically to stay out of the way and let the WEFTA engineers and the local officials do their workbut I was encouraged to come along and see for myself both the need and the proposed solutions, and share in the celebrations.  How many trekkers can boast of looking down every(I swear!) sewer in the valley, and eating  roasted guinea pig(heads and cute little feet intact) at a community feast? I have gladly increased my financial support to WEFTA every year, and hope I can continue to do so.  WEFTA is a non-profit like no other Ive encountered and I encourage anyone interested in the human right to clean water and sanitation to support them as well.

The number of homes they've completed in the last couple of years has been phenomenal.  Every volunteer or staff member I have interacted with has been very professional and warm.  I wish all non-profits were this well-run.
Mesilla Valley Habitat for Humanity International Inc	118880		/users/profile/161650	mcpt4	Board Member	5	07/19/2012	I have been involved with Habitat for Humanity for several years.  I started out as an RV Caravanner and have built homes around the Country.  My wife and I came to Las Cruces three years in a row to build homes for the community.  During this time, I have seen the Mesilla Valley Habitat for Humanity grow into a top notch Affiliate.  I am proud to be involved with Habitat in this community and look forward to many years of volunteering with this worthwhile organization.
Mesilla Valley Habitat for Humanity International Inc	118807		/users/profile/161538	macfell	Volunteer	5	07/18/2012	For me, working with Habitat has been the most exciting part of my retirement.  You work WITH families you're helpeing, meet the kids whose lives you are strengthening.   And the building work is so rewarding, as every nail. every shingle is another step towards a complete 'home', and you can say, I helped BUILD that.  (LAnd my city can say, 'here's another tax payer.')
Mesilla Valley Habitat for Humanity International Inc	118796		/users/profile/161524	AFO22	General Member of the Public	5	07/18/2012	Mesilla Valley Habitat for Humanity is changing many lives in Southern New Mexico. From the people who work for them, community members who are involved with the organization, to the actual recipients of the homes - numerous citizens are positively impacted by the important work of this organization. Recently what struck me the most was that this non-profit was not only building homes, but also just received a grant to provide homeowners with computers. Great job Mesilla Valley Habitat. Keep it up! You make me proud to be a resident of this area.
Mesilla Valley Habitat for Humanity International Inc	118535		/users/profile/161208	Sartin	Volunteer	5	07/16/2012	My experience was a positive one as a volunteer with Mesilla Valley Habitat ReStore. The team(employees and volunteers) all work great together. They made me feel like another member of their family. Oh and  the amount of donors are just wonderful! Most of them come in eager and happy to donate to such a grat cause. "My neighbors all donate to Habitat" one said!!! It is such a wonderful feeling knowing not only is the ReStore helping the builds, but also the families that come in and shop such wonderful treasures at low costs!!!
United By Friendship Inc	151502	1	/users/profile/202271	WalterT	Volunteer	5	03/22/2013	   I was looking for an international charity to donate my time and money to  poor communities in 3th world countries. My goal was to find organization which not just funnel the money, but directly work with impoverished communities and gives them incentives to improves basic life standard.   United by Friendship works directly with the  local municipality, Uspantan closely connected to local villages. Local communities must identify projects related to water, sanitation, health and education, make commitment to supply all labor and submit petition to local government to provide skilled labor.If the project meet United by Friendship mission criteria, the organization funds only building  materials.  Each project is executed by local communities under the local municipality oversight. Execution of every project is fully transparent, original invoices are given to the charity. Once a year 6-8 volunteers travel to the region to inspect what was accomplished and gather solicitations for next ones. Volunteers pay they airfare and cost of living. The president and board members are all non paid staff, there is no overhead.
United By Friendship Inc	122560		/users/profile/56598	Margie	Board Member	5	09/19/2012	Since I first wrote a review in 2010 I have been intimately involved with the function of United by Friendship as a board member. I have helped develop the annual teams which travel to Guatemala to evaluate completed projects for auto-sustainability, accept and evaluate new project proposals from the villagers and visit work sites in progress. There have been several successful projects including more clean water sytems, construction of classrooms, repair and furnishing supplies to medical clinics and a budding weaving program where villagers are learning to create textiles that will sell successfully. The resulting health, economic and education improvement is very evident. I will travel again to Guatemala in 2013 and can report further at that time. Meanwhile, support is gratefully accepted and funds are used carefully. Every dollar is accounted for. and 
United By Friendship Inc	54780		/users/profile/56598	Margie	Board Member	5	10/17/2010	United by Friendship is an amazingly effective organization that is led by a small group of people who believe that a real difference can be made by impacting clean water delivery, education, and medical services in Latin America. Since the organization's founding in 2004 the concentration has been on the small, remote villages in the Guatemalan central highlands where desperate poverty results in dismal living conditions. Projects that are requested by the villagers themselves. A United by Friendship group visits annually to assess the many requests for help. Projects are chosen based on maximum effect, likelihood of success and ability of the villagers to organize themselves and complete the labor portion of the project. Funding is usually for materials. Local elected officials guide the projects with frequent contact from UbF. This method has been very successful as  can  be seen in the list of accomplishments in the UbF information. The scope of success is truly remarkable. 
United By Friendship Inc	89087		/users/profile/101013	Tricia C.	Volunteer	5	05/24/2011	I was introduced to UbF three years ago and continue to be impressed by their efficiency and effectiveness as an organization.  UbF has and continues to help rural communities in Guatemala that have desperate needs for clean water, updated education facilities, and improved medical equipment and services.  The organization is run through the volunteer hours of very caring individuals with almost no overhead.  One of the most important aspects of this organization is their continued contact with local groups to keep tabs on the progress of newly-funded projects and the success and effectiveness of historically-funded projects.  UbF partners with local municipalities to teach community leaders to draft thorough and concise project proposals and identify projects worthy of funds.  The UbF volunteers visit the projects annually to ensure that the funds were utilized to build and serve as they were directed and that the projects continue to provide a value to the communities served.  UbFs representatives also take the time to identify the adverse issues in a community and teach the communities to help themselves.  Through education, outreach, and supply of resources, UbF continues to improve the living conditions of many individuals in the rural areas of Guatemala.

Volunteer tutors devote 2-3 hours each week working one-on-one with their student. All tutoring is "learner-centered". Tutors work with their students to achieve goals each student sets for themselves. I have served as an English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) tutor and as a Board Member and President of the Board of Directors of this fine organization.  Volunteers are always welcome and needed.

Readwest Inc	123689		/users/profile/168393	ReadWest	Board Member	5	09/28/2012	ReadWest is a Literacy organizatiion in Rio Rancho, NM whose volunteers help adults learn to read,  write and speak English. More than 1 in 5 Adults read at or below a 5th grade level. They can't fill out a job application, or read a perscription label or help their children with homework.  The cycle of illiteracy puts a tremendous strain on our community resources and keeps families in poverty. Recently one of our students was denied a dishwashing job because she didn't have a GED. Another student who came to us after graduating HIgh School told us he could not even read his Diploma. Our volunteers change lives. The ripple effect within the family and the community of Adults learning to read and write English is profound. We help Adults get better jobs, and become contributing members of the community.  Come join us. Your rewards will be immense.
Readwest Inc	177315		/users/profile/233851	ReadWest Tutor - Johnson	Volunteer	5	10/14/2013	ReadWest is an extraordinary organization with a powerful mission.  I serve as a basic literacy tutor and have seen my student grow in leaps and bounds in our short time together.  ReadWest is able to accomplish so much in part because of their incredibly responsible use of resources.  Every donated dollar is stretched as far as possible to ensure that the students continue to receive free one-to-one tutoring services.  Students of ReadWest have gone on to become employed, receive promotions, get their GED, and even write books!   It takes so little to be a tutor; reading and writing skills, patience, and a bit of compassion can transform the life of someone struggling with illiteracy.  This organization's high ethical standards, integrity, and exemplary dedication to the well-being of New Mexicans makes them my most highly recommended non-profit.   Please consider supporting your community by donating your time or money to this fine group.

Monero Mustangs	248185		/users/profile/335878	terrym49	Volunteer	5	07/12/2015	I have known Sandi Claypool now for 6 years. I have worked with her for over 4 of those years. In that time, I have been convinced of her honesty, integrity, and love of her horses. She is very well liked in our town of Chama, and all know of her dedication to the 130 wild mustangs in her care. Having spent 4 years working with her on the ranch, I was taught a great deal about these animals, their social structure, their complete openness with each other. I adopted one of these horses, and am raising her foal, a 2  year old stallion named Musashi. He is a very quick learner, and seems to love the interaction between us. I am indebted to Ms Claypool for presenting a new world to me.
Monero Mustangs	247469		/users/profile/335012	Mar W.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/04/2015	Since meeting Sandi Claypool in December, 2012, we have shared many experiences and Roger Webb and I have volunteered to help do necessary work, and we also donate funds and raise funds and hay by selling original handmade jewelry. We do all this because Sandi Claypool and her mustangs became a part of our lives as friends and colleagues and because we love her and the beautiful horses she has saved and nurtured for decades. We consider Sandi an expert on wild horses from the New Mexico region where her heritage Spanish Mustangs originally came from.  She has had a successful Eco Tour for several years that brought in premier painters and photographers of wild horses. The number of photos and paintings of Monero Mustangs is very impressive. The beauty of the horses and their special bloodlines will surprise any longtime horseman or someone who has never seen a wild horse before. Sandi Claypool is knowledgeable and experienced and soft spoken. We are looking forward to seeing her again soon.
Monero Mustangs	99017		/users/profile/88296	lketterman	Donor	5	10/05/2011	I have been working with Sandy Claypool, Monero Mustang's founder since she acquired her first wild horse stallion back in 1998.  Sandy has continually put her horses (she now has nearly 100) ahead of her own interests...her horses eat before she does.  Sandy has worked very hard to find a ranch where she could take the horses and allow them to remain wild free-roaming.  The ranch is at a very high altitude so she does have to supplement the horses natural diet with hay in the deep winter as the horses would not be able to get adequate nutrition from what was available peeking out of the snow.   Sandi is constantly fund raising in order to afford the hay, facilities maintenance/upgrades, and veterinary care.  Sandi lives in a tiny camp trailer on the ranch to ensure the hores needs are met.  This is an extreme hardship for her but she does it because she loves her horses and believes in trying to save the bloodline - Colonial Spanish mustangs brough to the Americaqs by the Conquistadores in the 1600's.  She is primarily trying to save the horses from the Jarita Mesa Wildhorse Territory on the Carson National Forest in northern New Mexico.  These horses are rounded up and adopted on a regualr basis.  The Environmental Analysis for the Territory calls for reaching a horse population that is far below what is believed to keep a viable herd - so Sandi is trying to save the blood before inbreeding takes away the quality of horse that is in the Territory right now.  The area where the ranch is located is very remote and it makes fund-raising that much harder becasue of the lack of a major population within a two-hour drive.  If you're looking for a place where your hard-earned money can really make a difference - think of Sandi and her "wild ones". 
Monero Mustangs	98985		/users/profile/117932	Sherry Kysely	General Member of the Public	5	10/05/2011	This has been my second visit to Monero Mustangs.   Sandi Claypool has done an amazing job with the Mustangs.  I am a Equine photographer that always had a dream of seeing and experiencing the majesty and beauty of these true monuments to our history up close.  Sandi knows all the horses by name and the story behind each and every one.   The existense of this American Heritage lives on through Sandi's unselfish will.  This is a true moving experience that shouldn't be missed.
Las Campanas Compadres Inc	191037		/users/profile/249383	emtnm	Client Served	5	12/17/2013	I am a 61-year-old female,  new to LCC, and one of the few adults that I know of in the swimming program.  I found out about the program because I have known the instructor, Dave, for many years, and I knew of his strong work ethic. I had heard him talk before about the loving care of the program's founders and its volunteers.  I am a survivor of two traumatic brain injuries.  I appreciate therapies/modalities in a quiet environment that can offer me assistance with a broad range of effects: physical, cognitive, and spiritual.  I have found that environment and range with LCC's swim program.  My neurologist says that strengthening the legs strengthens the brain.  When I have to remember to put my left arm out at the same time to put my right leg out, I am helping my brain, too.  The positive attitude and eagerness of Dave and volunteer, Mimi, lift my spirits and help me to laugh each week.  I leave every week a better person with a better brain and stronger body.  Thank you, LCC, for accepting me into the program and making it accessible to adult persons with disabilities.

Teambuilders Counseling Services, Inc.	277136		/users/profile/366924	Writer	Former staff	1	01/19/2016	As a former employee of approximately 3 years,  I can state from personal experience that the owners were in it for the money.  They routinely and constantly "encouraged" over-billing of services, from increasing travel times to "rounding-up" counseling hours.  As kids in care reached their funding limits, they suddenly would find themselves "substantially improved."   Their pay structure was horrible, staff support nearly non-existent, and they actually expected workers to provide their own office furniture and to clean their own offices.  This on top of exceedingly poor training of staff, foster parents, and so forth.  Many of the people hired did not meet the minimum requirements of their positions, but were able to get in, stay in, and receive advancements, according to their personal relationships to the owners--including their ability to "look the other way".   In my opinion, the owners were very high-functioning criminals who found easy money in the form of privatized, (supposedly) non-profit human services.  Any relief or benefits clients received was due to the exceedingly long hours, true concern, and extraordinary efforts of a handful of truly qualified staff.  
Teambuilders Counseling Services, Inc.	181385	3	/users/profile/238107	km10	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/23/2013	 I am a former employee of TeamBuilders Counseling Services.  I spent 6 years in operations oversight of multiple behavioral health programs in rural communities of NM.  TeamBuilders is a very unique agency for several key reasons.  First, the clinical model and clinical leadership that drives the agency is certainly a standout, to say the least, across the New Mexico landscape and across the country.  The Chief Clinical Officer at the helm is among the most decorated behavioral health clinicians on the North American continent.  Under this clinical leadership, the agency was able to achieve exemplary standing on performance audits, conducted by the state of NM, across multiple programs for several years running.  An astonishing fete, and not one that has been matched to the same degree by any other agency in the state.   The second key separator of TeamBuilders from other agencies like it is the unity, loyalty and comradery found among the staff across the state.  The employees would describe themselves as family and the overall reported job satisfaction stats on the inside of the agency are an unusual find in the behavioral health industry, an industry with the reputation of being very hard on service staff which results in exceptionally high turnover. The culture is born of the founders themselves, the CEO and his wife the Chief Clinical Officer; together they put the TEAM in TeamBuilders and cultivated a following of immensely dedicated and driven individuals carrying out the mission and vision established at the original incorporation 18 years ago.    The third hallmark of TeamBuilders Counseling Services is ongoing training and staff development.  My background is business and I came to the agency right out of Corporate America from Fortune 500 companies that could not touch the quality of supervision, training and leadership development I received here.    Community outreach and unconditional client care are the final key features that set TeamBuilders apart from everyone else.  The agency is well known in all youth serving circles in more than 22 counties of New Mexico as champions for the communities they servegiving back to each community by supporting other youth serving agencies, heading up food and supply drives and ensuring that families are linked to all available support resources in their communities in order to promote resilience, recovery and hope for families impacted by poverty, substance abuse and mental illness.      TeamBuilders was forced to close its doors in August 2013 by the state of New Mexico amid allegations of fraud that remain under investigation by the attorney generals office.  Latest update on the investigation from this office was that they were not finding  credible allegations of fraud.  That being said, what a loss for New Mexico.  What a loss for the children and their families and for the staffa family all their own.  Overall, an outstanding place to work.  Beautiful memories, immense personal and professional growth.  I take it all with me and will pay it forward in all my future endeavors.        
Teambuilders Counseling Services, Inc.	176319	2	/users/profile/232728	William36	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/10/2013	I started working in the behavioral health and substance abuse prevention field in 1974 when I was 17 years old.  Since then I have worked for many wonderful agencies in Colorado and New Mexico.  Over the past 6 years I was the Behavior Management Program Coordinator the the Espanola/Los Alamos communities.  Any great organization starts with the leadership at the top.  I must say that Shannon and Lorraine Freedle in my 38 years of service are the best in this business.  Their commitment to children and families and their compassion for those hurting or in trouble is unmatched.  I would still be there if the state of New Mexico hadn't come in to willfully destroy this sacred place. William High Eagle Sandoval
Teambuilders Counseling Services, Inc.	142749	2	/users/profile/189196	techagnostic	General Member of the Public	5	11/26/2012	I have close friends with a troubled teen. He was adopted as a young teen from a succession of foster homes, some of them probably abusive, and he's just had the toughest time -- and as a consequence, so have my friends. He's been arrested (for petty vandalism, public drunkenness...so far), he's run away (made it to a neighboring state, and lived briefly with other homeless types), acts up at school and at home. The only outfit that has made any difference is TeamBuilders. I believe it has a lot to do with their "ecological" approach -- where they address every factor that can influence a child's behavior. The parents joined the therapy, which helped them as well, and at least he's back attending school consistently. I very much admire the flexibility of TeamBuilders in applying whatever specific therapeutic modality that works -- from a very wide range -- and their dedication to even very difficult cases, when state and even private resources have essentially given up.
Wild Spirit Wolf Sanctuary	237506	1	/users/profile/322178	David_and_Shirl	Donor	5	02/01/2015	We have supported the Wild Spirit Wolf Sanctuary for several years. We highly recommend this Sanctuary to others who wish to support an animal sanctuary. Here are some fairly detailed comments from us about this Sanctuary that we think may be beneficial to others who want to read a review with more than just a few sentences. These are our personal comments solely. We think it is very important that if a person is thinking about supporting an organization that the person learns about the organization so they will be convinced that it is an organization worth supporting and won't just waste your money. We also recommend visiting any animal sanctuary that you are thinking of supporting so you can see for yourself if the sanctuary really does what it says it does. Concerning WildEyes_80's August 2012 GuideStar review we strongly challenge the comment about the Sanctuary animals, that the Sanctuary has a "very poor lack of ethics and handling skills" and that the "people who donate ... are being extremely misled and lied to about the animals that live there". We have visited the Wild Spirit Wolf Sanctuary numerous times and have directly seen all aspects of the Sanctuary's operations. They are located in Candy Kitchen New Mexico which is just one hour south of Gallup or Grants New Mexico. These operations include how the Sanctuary provides for the housing, feeding and medical needs of their wolves and wolf-dog hybrids. The Sanctuary also provides a forever home for several Coyotes, Australian Dingoes, New Guinea Singing Dogs and a fox. Animals are provided with large, well-kept enclosures with the majority having companions, both canine and human. The Sanctuary has around a 100 acres of land. We support the Sanctuary since we have directly seen how the Sanctuary people go to great efforts (money, resources, time, energy) to accomplish their mission which is best stated by the Sanctuary's own mission statement (www.wildspiritwolfsanctuary.org/mission.php): o   RescueRescue displaced, unwanted, and un-releasable captive-bred wolves, wolf-dogs, and other related species. o   SanctuaryProvide permanent, lifetime safe sanctuary for those that we rescue and provide the highest level of care, enrichment and habitat. o   EducationEducate the public about wolves, wolf-dogs, and other related species, our eco system and how we all play a part in it, and the excellent, ethical care and treatment of all animals domestic and wild. This Sanctuary has been around since 1993 and currently provides homes for around 70 animals, the majority being wolves and wolf-dog hybrids. They also have a really cute fox named Romeo (www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4xfGnNwGdA). This is definitely not a fly-by-night operation. We think will be around for several more decades. The Sanctuary is actively involved in the rescue of animals. In 2014 the Sanctuary rescued 4 wolves and 3 coyotes in numerous long distant trips to North Carolina, two to Missouri, Arizona, and Indiana. These trips are quite expensive in terms of time, money and energy for the Sanctuary people who conduct these. The Sanctuary is currently preparing to rescue a wolf in California (an approximately 20 hour 1,000+ mile one-way trip) that otherwise would soon be euthanized.  From directly talking to the people involved in these trips, these trips are definitely a labor of love since most people that we know would not be able or willing to expend such effort. Also, in 2013 the Sanctuary rescued 11 wolves from Iowa that were living in deplorable conditions within extremely small enclosures and with very poor sanitation and food. Today, these Iowa wolves are known as the Westeros Pack which are now housed in two large enclosures (see the following web site for more information about these Iowa rescues: www.wildspiritwolfsanctuary.org/iowa11.php). The Sanctuary is also compliant with USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) regulations for animal Sanctuaries. Specifically, the Sanctuary is certified as a Class C animal facility with certification number 85-C-0014 under the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). We agree with KIT1's comment from May 2014 that the Sanctuary is "constantly improving and moving forward in the excellent care of the canines in their care". For example, a few years ago the Sanctuary installed at great expense and with lots of labor a 10 foot high perimeter fence around its entire animal enclosure area to better safeguard their canine guests. The Sanctuary goes to great lengths to provide all their animals with the best possible food. This includes feeding native raw game such as Elk and providing supplements to help the wolves be as healthy as possible. For example, this includes Duralactin, Dasequin and Joint Discovery for older animal with joint and inflammation problems. The Sanctuary has even formulated over the years a special supplement blend called "nutritional powder" that is designed to maximize animal health. Concerning finances, the Sanctuary in 2012 had a yearly budget of around $400,000. You may think this is a large amount of money for a non-profit animal rescue. But when you closely review what it costs to run such an organization such as the Wild Spirit Wolf Sanctuary, you will find that they spend every penny of this budget to provide the best for their rescues. The staff and volunteers are paid, but the pay is extremely low. It seems to us that if you want a high paying job, then don't work for an animal rescue. The Sanctuary's people (they call themselves "Team Wild Spirit") currently consists of an executive director, assistant director, 6 staff, and 12 on-site volunteers. The Sanctuary provides extensive information about itself on both a web site and a FaceBook page: Website -- www.wildspiritwolfsanctuary.orgFaceBook -- www.facebook.com/pages/Wild-Spirit-Wolf-Sanctuary/495230525220 The Sanctuary and its visitors have an extensive number of videos on YouTube. One video we recommend discusses the Sanctuary mission (www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_AoR_yHMfw). Another video shows how the Sanctuary has large vet bills for their animals and always needs help from donors to defray this high cost (www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzSeXLTX2Tw). Even if the Sanctuary does not have money for a vet visit, the Sanctuary always makes sure their animals' physical well-being is taken care of. They later pay for these vet bills with generous financial help from its donors. To see more about the Wild Spirit Wolf Sanctuary, we highly recommend the 2013 independent documentary FURTHEST FROM THE WILD (trailer: www.youtube.com/watch?v=livVRYbjH3g). The Sanctuary's and other animal rescue operations are discussed extensively in this documentary whose purpose is to describe "the many struggles that non-profit Animal Sanctuaries go through". The Sanctuary also publishes a quarterly newsletter via the internet and by a paper mailing to Sanctuary members which highlights their recent activities. This newsletter may be found on the Sanctuary's web site (www.wildspiritwolfsanctuary.org/wild_spirit_wolf_sanctuary_howling_reporter.php). We hope these comments are useful to others. - David Craig and Shirl Casner  (February 1, 2015)
Wild Spirit Wolf Sanctuary	200418		/users/profile/261615	klt1	Donor	5	05/15/2014	I have been a supporter of Wild Spirit Wolf Sanctuary since 2002 and they are constantly improving and moving forward in the excellent care of the canines in their care...I look forward to visiting as much as i  can...the volunteers and staff spend countless hours of care devotion and expertise with the animals under their care and it really shows...as to the first review, he has never been there and the controversy he speaks of is basically the director speaking out against the poor care wolf dogs get especially when gotten for ego..guess the first reviewer took it personally ahem...I have been and will continue to support this organization for many years to come..
Wild Spirit Wolf Sanctuary	191865		/users/profile/250435	KPML143	Donor	5	12/31/2013	There is one other review for the Wolf Ranch and to be honest, I have no idea what this person is referring to, and no real substantive details were provided. I have been a donor of the Wolf Ranch for years and have seen firsthand the sacrifices the volunteers makes to keep these dogs healthy and happy.  It takes an incredible amount of time, energy and resources to care for 75+ wolves and wolf-dogs.  I have seen such compassion and dedication from everyone who works there and from those who donate money and services. What a wonderful organization!
Wild Spirit Wolf Sanctuary	120878		/users/profile/164475	wildeyes_80	General Member of the Public	1	08/17/2012	I have never been to this sanctuary, but have followed them online for a while. I have seen videos displaying a VERY poor lack of ethics and handling skills on the part of the man who runs this sanctuary. I wonder if the people who donate to this sanctuary, who are being EXTREMELY misled and lied to about the animals that live there, know they are paying for the man who runs it to eat at Denny's every day?  I, personally would NOT donate to this place and contribute to the lies and contraversy that surrounds it.
David Fellers Healing Art Foundation	190383	1	/users/profile/49408	sallyfellersgmailcom	Volunteer	5	12/11/2013	This year we met Amy, a darling 7 year old. Amy is blind and sick, she weighs only 18 pounds. Children like Amy have no hope for a future without the support of caring people like you! In the past 5 years The David Fellers Healing Art Foundation has helped over 200 hundred disabled people in Nicaragua. There are hundreds more waiting to receive wheelchairs, prosthetics and life saving medicine. Please help us improve our world one person at a time. Donate now to the David Fellers Healing Art Foundation: http://healingartfoundation.org/page8/donate.html. 99% of the funds we raise go directly to disabled people desperately in need of help! 
David Fellers Healing Art Foundation	48390	3	/users/profile/49408	sallyfellersgmailcom	Volunteer	5	07/18/2010	David Fellers was born with Cerebral Palsy but being severely disabled never stopped him from enjoying life. His enthusiasm knew no bounds and he was an inspiration to all who knew him. When he passed away two years ago at the age of 30, a non profit in his name was created. In the past year The David Fellers Healing Art Foundation has donated 22 wheelchairs and 5 prosthetic legs to people who would other-wise  not have them. The foundation is currently working in Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua, the second poorest country in the Western Hemisphere next to Haiti. In this area we discovered children with disabilities similar to David who had no wheelchairs or any other equipment. David was deaf and his only physical ability was smiling. In poverty stricken areas of the world, such as Puerto Cabezas with an 80% unemployment rate, people like David are left to lie in the same place day after day with nothing to do. It was the most amazing experience ever to be able to bring wheelchairs to these special children. We also equiped older people who were stuck in bed having survived debilitating strokes or accidents. Puerto Cabezas has a high number of young men paralized from diving too deep for lobsters. When they get the bends they don't get to a decompression chamber in time which results in permanent nerve damage.

There is no school available for the special needs children in this area. Due to the poverty and health conditions in this region there are many children with disabilities caused by high fevers that went untreated, resulting in deafness, blindness and a variety of mobility disorders. Another big  area of concern is there are over 400 disabled lobster divers who were paralyzed as a result of decompression sickness. The lobster industry hired them, gave them diving equipment and failed to teach them safe diving techniques. Many of them are dying because of untreated pressure sores.

Creativity For Peace Inc	162245	1	/users/profile/215363	Rob Elliott	Donor	5	07/09/2013	I have been following Creativity for Peace's development for several years and it seems to get stronger and stronger. I have spoken with the Executive Director, board members, and even some of the young Israeli and Palestinian leaders whose lives have been forever transformed by CFP. I am certain that some of these young women will lead their people in the years ahead from a place of deep compassion and understanding of the other side. I especially appreciate CFP's focus on providing resources and continued growth opportunities for these young leaders both when they return to Israel and Palestine and through conducting pilot training programs for young people right here in the United States. I am confident that my contributions are being well spent in advancing the cause of peace!
Creativity For Peace Inc	161972		/users/profile/214861	merna	Board Member	5	07/02/2013	Creativity For Peace (CFP) utilizes a unique and powerful process to help educate young Israeli and Palestinian women in the art of conflict resolution. During an intensive summer camp experience, the participants develop extensive communication skills built around healthy dialogue, the use of art therapy etc.. These young women develop leadership skills to assist them in their peacemaking efforts when they return to their homes.  The summer experience is enhanced by continued opportunities for interaction and dialogue in both Israel and Palestine as well as in the United States. CFP, a ten year old organization, is blessed with a passionate staff, a committed Board of Directors and effective community support. It maximizes available resources, both financial and personnel,  and would have the ability to reach many more young women, and thus their families, friends and neighbors in their home countries, as more financial resources become available.
Creativity For Peace Inc	161901		/users/profile/214749	Beverley	Board Member	5	07/01/2013	Creativity for Peace (CFP) focuses on the development of leadership and  peacemaking skills for youngwomen from Israel and Palestine. The reason I support this organization is to raise the emphasis on conflict resolution via communication for Ihealthy dialogue and art therapy for a minimal of 14 young women in an Intensive workshop experience each summer on the outskirts of Santa Fe. These young women are changed by their experiences with the "other" which enables them to move forward with leadership in peacemaking in their lives and in their home countries. It is my personal privilege to serve these young women with opportunities in leadership and peacemaking in their home countries. They subsequently have the opportunity to join into Young Leader Programs in I/P and make a difference in their personal and collective lives and effect change as Young Leaders for Creativity for Peace. 
Creativity For Peace Inc	161867		/users/profile/214692	JHepp	Donor	5	07/01/2013	I have donated to this organization for about 3 or 4 years, having met many of the US and international staff, along with the young peacemakers and Young Leaders.  This organization goes a long way to make every penny count, while dramatically improving the prospects for peace in our lifetime, in the Middle East.  I am grateful that they do work year-round with over 100 young women in the Israel and Palestine, working to support the courageous efforts these young women are making to improve their world, when their world would prefer the status quo of war and bias. In the US, this organization does public outreach in other cities, including Dallas, Philadelphia, New York and Portland OR.
New Mexico Wilderness Alliance	84668		/users/profile/93958	James Hickerson	Board Member	5	04/01/2011	I joined the NM Wilderness Alliance because it is the most active conservation group in New Mexico, with about 5000 members state-wide, and has the most focused effort at protecting wild lands.  It is the only local organization that consistently works to promote legislative implementation of the Wilderness Act to add Wilderness to our federal lands inventory.  They also sponsor great service projects that introduce members and the public to important places like Otero Mesa and the forested lands of the Gila and northern New Mexico.  I find the Wilderness Alliance to be the best voice in support of the conservation values I find important.
New Mexico Wilderness Alliance	81917		/users/profile/89836	Wild New Mexico	Board Member	5	03/11/2011	After several decades of doing volunteer environmental work with many groups I became involved with New Mexico Wilderness Alliance from its beginning.  It has the finest publications (brochures, newsletter, wild guide) you find anywhere.  It does an excellent job of grassroots organizing and participation (ie. regular local field trips, work projects, social gatherings).  It galvanized this diverse community around wilderness in a way I have never seen (600 wilderness supporters at a public hearing on wilderness).  It reaches out to the less populated areas of the state in a way I have not seen in the many decades with 4 paid employees in three locations in the southern part of the state.

Taos Feral Feline Friends	125054	2	/users/profile/170173	wintr	Client Served	5	10/10/2012	I would like to thank Leanne Mitchell and TFFF for all her hard work and dedication. When I first heard about Leanne and TFFF I was very apprehensive about contacting her. Because I didn't know what  would happen to all these cats. Would they be put to sleep? I didn't know.  All I knew was that was not good. But when I met Leanne and she explained how the trap and release program worked I was so happy and grateful . I couldn't believe it ! Leanne loaned me a trap and carrier then showed me how to set the trap,  all I had to do was take them in to be spayed or neutered . The best thing was I was able to bring all the cats back and release them into the same area. Now I have a  healthy and happy colony. No more fighting or unwanted kittens. I really like that TFFF has a NO KILL policy, that was very important to me.  Again Thank you Leanne and TFFF I appreciate everything you have done for all the cats in Taos  county. Keep up all the good work!          Pat Iko                                                              
Taos Feral Feline Friends	124883	1	/users/profile/169947	jean6197	Volunteer	5	10/09/2012	My love for cats-any type-began when I learned from my Great-Grandmother to "love her best friends"! Ever since I came to live in Taos-many years ago-I was amazed at the huge number of feral cats.Most of them at one time had a home-or were loved pets.Somehow they were either lost -abandoned or just thrown away! Sooner or later they became a colony-needed help with food or shelter.I have always tried to help with that on my own.As time went on I learned about the "Trap,Neuter &Release Program" by TFFF. The more I learned the more I realized the humane possibility of reducing the number of feral cats,which will benefit all cats by having more food and shelter to share-and perhaps find appropriate homes for them-such as farms or barns. The most important thing for me is the fact that TFFF does not kill any animal-I shall always help, donate and assist TFFF in every way I can. We help the Kitty's -and they in turn help us-by taking care of critters that are detrimental to our homes many times. No question or arguments-only appreciation comes from the animals!I shall always support and assist TFFF-the best organization I have ever known!            JEAN
Taos Feral Feline Friends	95012	1	/users/profile/109963	nancy lay	Client Served	5	08/04/2011	Leanne Mitchell and TFFF are a wonderful solution to the inflated population of Feral Felines in the Taos, NM area.  Human Hav-a-Heart traps capture them, they are neutered by a Vet, and returned to the property from which they came.  For my part, I provide them food, water and shelter under my shed.  Meanwhile, I have a team of excellent rodent hunters and the joy of seeing scruffy, thin cats turn into sleek, healthy animals.  I admire Leanne's dedication and I am thankful I connected with TFFF.
Taos Feral Feline Friends	94374	3	/users/profile/109113	Emmeline S.	Client Served	5	07/26/2011	Having volunteered at numerous shelters in my life, I can say without reservation, that TFFF is by far, the most stellar of them all. As an all-volunteer, no-kill shelter (and the only one in New Mexico dedicated to feral cats) Taos Feral Feline Friends is not only humane, but also very cost-efficient. The founder, Leanne Mitchell, houses on average, over 70 cats at any given time, and operates on a budget garnered from fundraising donations and grants. None of it goes to waste, and none of it feeds into any sort of paycheck. Whether the cats are feral, stray, tame, abandoned, sick, healthy, lame or newborn, Leanne is excellent in taking care of all their individual needs. She also offers a free trap, neuter and release program for the county.  Having taken a tour of the shelter, (and adopted two awesome cats from Leanne) I can only give my highest regards to TFFF. Leanne works really hard (think 15 hour work days) to make this shelter operate so well, and if you are considering adopting a cat, you must go with her- She will be sure to give you an accurate personal/medical history of the cat you choose. I'm also really impressed with how Leanne manages to balance all aspects of the shelter. From decreasing the feral population in Taos, to providing care for sick animals that will never be adopted, to picking out the perfect cat for you to take home, she just does it all. Over the past 7 years, Leanne has established herself, and her organization, as an integral part of the community. It really shows in the positive community response, and the strong board leadership. More than anything, there is so much care for the animals at TFFF. To adopt or donate to this organization is something you can do totally guilt-free. You can be sure that your future cat and/or donation is in good paws.
Bridges For Women Program Inc	39183	4	/users/profile/40129	4directions	Client Served	5	05/17/2010	After 4 years of 24/7 childhood-trauma memory work I found myself at Bridges door step with little awareness of the shift I required and not knowing if they could help me move forward. When they told me "this is the program for you!", I thought they were crazy! I thought I would never fit anywhere ever again. Then my first day in class I had a breakdown in the bathroom because I realized how far from Society I was after 4 years of healing work. I worked very hard in the 6 month program to bridge gaps in my memory and brain function, relate to people, articulate myself again. I graduated because I had non-judgemental support from people who accepted me in the moment - where I was - and where I wanted to be next - and it was all on my own terms! After graduation I did 7 days of "0 Trace" living Mountaineering with Outward Bound, then was asked to volunteer as the Bridges IT Technician. 5 years later I am still there ... developed BridgesIT Support Services to raise IT standards every year which support clients, volunteers and staff who participate in the many facets of Bridges ... including the visionary aspects at work to help even more people move forward! Why? Because I know that Bridges has a transformative Recipe that works, and can be applied to many areas of transition in our community. I know it works! I am a graduate!
Bridges For Women Program Inc	39047	4	/users/profile/39982	rondababe	Client Served	5	05/15/2010	I started out at Bridge's with very low self esteem.  I still have to remember to tune out the negative voices when they show themselves; fortunately, Bridge's played a very important role in helping me build the toolbox of skills I needed to do that.  Another aspect I really appreciate is that Bridge's opened up opportunities for me to learn how to communicate better. Even though I have already graduated I have been invited back to continue to improve my communication through a course that has been added.  It is perfect timing too.  Bridge's has helped me get a positive focus and continues to encourage me to reach my personal and career goals. Bridge's offers many valuable courses.  I think it would have been even better if the program was funded to be a little bit longer.  The challenges that came up were handled in a way that I could learn to deal with a variety of situations that could very well come up at any job.  I wish some of my friends who do not live in the area could take the online program by Bridge's.  Apparently after the three year pilot project was successful then they no longer had the funding for that part of Bridge's.  I really hope this changes.  They could be helping so many women in remote communities to be contributing so much more when they do their jobs in the community after building up their strengths.

Bridges is formed of a strong community of women from all walks of life, and together as mentors and mentess, we share our experiences and learn together hand in hand. The two facilitators of the program (Lola & Yvette)bring such a warm, loving, nurturing energy to the program, and I truly feel priviledged to be a part of it. I plan on continuing to be involved with Bridges for many years to come.

Those people are trying to destroy the doctors' reputation in order to avoid the duty and integrity of legitimately analyzing that Doctor's life-saving message and his great mission.

Hey Mozart New Mexico	166584		/users/profile/221311	Coleman Travelstead	Board Member	5	08/30/2013	I have known of and been involved in Hey Mozart! New Mexico since its inception. What most impresses me is the statewide outreach of the organization. New Mexico is one of our nation's poorest states and Hey Mozart! receives applications and has had winners from some of the most rural and poorest parts of the state. It is very emotional to see children from tiny towns come to the concert where they perform with 20 or 30 family members, some of whom have traveled more than 300 miles from Chihuahua Mexico. Teachers of some of the students have said that winning has been a life changing event for some students who have never been successful in the past and have risen vastly in the eyes of peers. At the concerts past winners have become mentors to first time winners, some as young as six. The interplay among the child composers, the adult arrangers and orchestra, band and choral musicians is amazing to watch.
Hey Mozart New Mexico	90532		/users/profile/103282	Kenneth K.	Board Member	5	06/12/2011	My name is Jeanie McLerie, and I have been involved with Hey Mozart New Mexico since 2008, and a board member since 2010. I teach children fiddle in Silver City, New Mexico. In 2009 I had 3 students submit compositions to the project, and two of them, Ella Jaz Kirk and Ella Myers came in the top sixteen winners. You can see Ella Jaz's song called " The Hand" on youtube by typing in  Ellajaz/Hey Mozart. This was filmed at the concert on Nov 6, 2009 at the National Hispanic Cultural Center in Albuquerque, New Mexico. All the winners played their compositions, and then they heard the arrangement (done by one of the Hey Mozart arrangers) that had been done of their composition. It was a wonderful concert, and it is obvious the see what a boost this is to a young composer. Many of my students continue to write tunes and songs and it was Hey Mozart that really inspired them to do it on a regular basis. This year I had some great compositions by some of the younger ones (between 5- 7 years) but they were not confident to enter the contest yet. And some of my 12 and older students have written some wonderful tunes, but are too old for the project. It doesn't matter because they are tuned into creating and composing now, and will probably always want to do that. I think this is a fantastic non-profit organization and of course it needs financial help. I want to see Hey Mozart continue for the many creative children in New Mexico. I am a believer in giving children a boost in the world of music.
Hey Mozart New Mexico	88700		/users/profile/100061	Pamela Michaelis	General Member of the Public	4	05/13/2011	 Hey, Mozart! New Mexico is a splendid example of dedication on parade!  Dedication on the parts of volunteers who make it run, teachers who have faith and pride in their students, parents who support inspired kids, and, most of all, the dedication of hundreds of youngsters who bravely present their musical creations to a big world.  The fact that children who are fine musicians together with children who can't play an instrument are all in this project together is astounding.  And some of the winners are, indeed, children who have heard some music in their heads, don't play a musical instrument but they courageously hum their compositions.   And a musician then transposes it.  It is a miracle for these children.  What a great, positive, exciting, transformative organization. Pamela Michaelis, Albuquerque, New Mexico

Faith Comes By Hearing	98883		/users/profile/117659	David Reaves	Donor	4	10/02/2011	I originally contacted this charity several years ago.  I knew some missionaries that were helping to coordinate translation of Scripture into a people-group's "heart tongue on cassette tapes.  Faith Comes by Hearing had a hand-cranked cassette player that was designed for use in low-technology areas.  I was able to purchase and provide a few of the players for the project.  After learning more about Hosanna/Faith Comes by Hearing my family decided to make routine contributions. Though my contributions were relatively small (maybe $500 in a really good year) the organization provided excellent communication and ensured we were up-to-date on the activities and outreach.  When my health failed and my family was unable to continue our small contributions, we were still provided full communication. Further, I have received several personal notes from staff members over the past years.  In every case, I was encouraged and reminded that members of the Hosanna staff were continuing to pray for me. My family's financial circumstances have changed as a result of a new job for my wife and this is the first organization that came to our minds as a deserving charity.

I have been working for the pantry for 6 years and the pantry has grown considerably in that time. We feed around 400 families per mo. now and were doing about 30 when I firxt started working at the pantry. We are funded by donation by the community only. There are no paid people working for the pantry. I am very proud of the volunteers we have and the growth we have made since I started working there. The board has great ideas about growing and I hope to be there when they come to fruition.

GALLUP PUBLIC RADIO	261796		/users/profile/350431	Writer	Board Member	5	10/06/2015	Great local and national programming reflecting the uniqueness of the community and urgency of national and international events. Kudos to the hard working station manager for her role in keeping this small operation going with a high quality product.
GALLUP PUBLIC RADIO	256958	1	/users/profile/345361	Writer	Donor	5	09/13/2015	Working on a shoe string budget with only one full time staff person, several energetic interns, an on call engineer and a dedicated board, KGLP is able to bring local and national programming to a rural area around the clock with little dead air and with the appreciation of a core of dedicated listeners. The local PSA's and weekly local programs keep listeners informed of concerns and events of the area. The music programming is eclectic, providing as source of variety unlike any other station. The NPR news team sounds like home to many who move into the area from afar. 
GALLUP PUBLIC RADIO	58228		/users/profile/61886	gohara	Volunteer	4	11/30/2010	Unlike Public Radio in other markets that are either all Jazz, all classical music or all news; KGLP 91.7 FM is as eclectic as you could imagin. No one likes it all but everyone likes some of what they broadcast.
Santa Fe Watershed Association	110981		/users/profile/151053	Rebecca35	Board Member	5	04/27/2012	The Santa Fe Watershed Association (SFWA) is active in three major areas: education, advocacy, and restoration around Santa Fe's river and watershed. SFWA is a clearinghouse in Santa Fe and NM for watershed issues and serves as an umbrella for Santa Fe's community in engaging our watershed. Most recently, SFWA played a key role in winning passage of a Living River Ordinance, which has made Santa Fe the first city in New Mexico to set aside water to keep the river flowing through our community. For the first time in my lifetime, the Santa Fe river is flowing. Thanks to SFWA for bringing together the community and helping to bring watershed management efforts to a higher level in NM. 
Santa Fe Watershed Association	110302		/users/profile/150176	cramos	General Member of the Public	5	04/19/2012	In New Mexico, water is life, el agua es la vida. The Santa Fe Watershed Association works to return the Santa Fe River to a living river bringing life to the earth, plants, animals and people of New Mexico. This is essential to the continued survival of our interconnected habitats & communities. Santa Fe Watershed Association is ensuring continued sustainability in NM through advocacy, outreach, education and hands-on approaches. 
Santa Fe Watershed Association	109645		/users/profile/149383	Kristina G. Fisher	Board Member	5	04/11/2012	The Santa Fe Watershed Association is a remarkable organization that is active in three major areas: education, advocacy, and restoration. Among other things, they lead hikes into the protected upper watershed area, teach students in Santa Fe's schools, lead workshops about adapting to climate change, organize tree plantings along the river, and run the successful Adopt-the-River program. Most recently, the Santa Fe Watershed Association played a key role in winning passage of a Living River Ordinance, which has made Santa Fe the first city in New Mexico to set aside water to keep the river flowing through our community.

This is a grand building that has a big impact on all who visit from around the world. Our Mission statement says it all we are "Restoring the Building and Rebuilding Lives". Structured as an on-the-job training program we are giving young adults a second chance to live a life of sobriety and gain valuable job skills.
St Joseph Apache Mission	26267	3	/users/profile/27304	Carol	Donor	5	01/26/2010	As a child our family attended church and I help with the instruction classes. I now live in the NW and visit each time we go home I admire the folks working on the project as it was in need of lots of work. It has been amazing how much work has been done and the enormous improvement which have gone on. I donate to the annual raffles, my whole family has purchased a tile from the roof of the church. My nephew was involved with the art work on the tiles and when I do have exta money to donate I send my donation for the restoration project.My cousin is the nun who works with our people so,yes I do support this important project. Please consider donating.
Tickled Pink Weimaraner Rescue Inc	291017		/users/profile/381363	GreyGhost	Former staff	1	05/25/2016	This place is a complete scam!  They have lied about several rescues, they attempt to bully, intimdate, and harass people.  There are current allegations that there was fraud and lies, all of which are true!  Do not donate or help this rescue. 
Tickled Pink Weimaraner Rescue Inc	290105		/users/profile/380382	weimlover	Volunteer	5	05/16/2016	Tickled Pink does more for abused and neglected dogs than any rescue I have ever seen or worked with. Pocket money has been used when donations are not enough. They take in the elderly dogs dumped in high kill shelters and dogs that are running stray and end up being run over, resulting in ridiculous medical bills. The disgruntled person in the other review clearly does not have the experience or true insight into what this organization actually accomplishes....Rock on, Tickled Pink! Your thousands of fans and many volunteers are behind you!
Tickled Pink Weimaraner Rescue Inc	212455	13	/users/profile/275467	ShirleyNuevo	General Member of the Public	1	08/27/2014	Where do I start, let's see I was interested in being a volunteer within this organization. I reached out to several people and talked specifically with one of their foster families. After hearing a lengthy story about a fundraiser for an animal that was already deceased I was mortified to say the least. Thank goodness I found this out before dedicating my time. I was very upset at this act that some can even construe as fraud. There are several other notable honest rescues I would suggest donating your time and money to. This rescue is not one of them. Also another red flag was on their page and I noticed them negatively bashing another rescue, we are all in it for the same end result and I feel it's in bad taste to say ill things about other NON-PROFIT organizations.  I mean seriously?!?!? Who in their right mind would feel compelled to do that, I guess it would lead one to believe that this is a matter of competition and maybe even a little profitable.  kindest wishes, Shirley Nuevo Los Lunas, NM

K-9 And Feline Assistance Program Of Tularosa Inc	252575		/users/profile/340656	k9lovers	Volunteer	1	08/11/2015	I do not recommend this organization.  Animals are not cared for by a veterinarian and this organization should not use the shelters amenities for their organization.
Youth Development Inc	192459	1	/users/profile/251288	Gustavo75	Volunteer	5	01/12/2014	Over 17,000 youth are served by this program annually.  It has a wide array of services meeting many community  needs.  I know of no other such program.  Their commitment to bettering lives is matched by very few other social service providers.
Youth Development Inc	156100	2	/users/profile/207109	Jetty	Donor	5	04/24/2013	I am a long time supporter of this program because it has a long track record, consistent leadership, outstanding record of accomplishments.  It has helped hundreds of thousands children over their 42 year history.
Goodwill Industries of New Mexico	26062	1	/users/profile/27093	Kim	Donor	4	01/22/2010	I love shopping at Goodwill for children's clothing, and it's my choice spot for donating stuff we no longer need.  Great prices and I feel like I'm helping out my community when I shop there.
Goodwill Industries of New Mexico	26018	3	/users/profile/27043	kay92116	General Member of the Public	5	01/22/2010	I've always been impressed with Goodwill's philanthropic mission. It has been gratifying to help others with my purchases through Goodwill.  The stores are well-appointed, logically organized, and obviously the prices are beyond compare.
Dreamtree Project Inc	248020		/users/profile/335686	joyful-in-taos	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/10/2015	Once while on a day trip to Santa Fe, I stopped at a roadside food cart for a bite and began chatting with the proprietress. She was a young lady, maybe in her mid 20s. When I told her I was from Taos, her face lit up and she said "I used to live in Taos at Dreamtree!" She went on to say that her experience there turned her life around.  She proudly (and repeatedly) boasted "It's because of Dreamtree, that I own my own home." She said she was the only one of her peer group who could say that. She told me that Dreamtree takes in messed up young adults, at no cost, and helps them get their lives together. If they need a GED, that's where the focus is; if they need to get into college, they help with that. Residents are required to work and give a portion of their earnings to the staff for safe keeping. (I think she said they hand over 1/3 of their pay but I'm not sure). The woman went on to say that when she "graduated" from Dreamtree and was ready to head out on her own, they gave her $20,000--the money they had banked for her from her pay for all that time. That is the money the woman used to purchase her own mobile home. This conversation happened about 3 years ago.  About 2 years ago, I met another young woman, a friend of my daughter's, who was also an alumnus of Dreamtree. This young lady had been a homeless, heroin addict with a history of criminal offenses that still embarrass her. Out of desperation, she left Albuquerque to get help from Dreamtree in Taos. Currently, this woman is in her final year of college, about to be a social worker. She is also vital part of her community as a frequent, reliable volunteer for projects and events.  As a social worker myself who has worked with young people for most of my career, I know that any program or opportunity can only be as good as the participants want to make it.  Apparently, as gauged by the previous review, not every adult who joins the program, makes the most of what it has to offer. Since it is a VOLUNTARY program for ADULTS only, the residents make their own choices. But clearly, the program offers a formula for success if that's what the individual truly wants.  
Dreamtree Project Inc	245135		/users/profile/332240	Dream_Tree_is_a_Nightmare	Client Served	1	06/12/2015	This is a horribly dysfunctional, toxic organization.  The staff had allowed every child in their care to become intoxicated.  Another to run away.  And did nothing!  On another occasion they didn't even know the whereabouts of my daughter.  I have heard several complaints since then (including that one teen became pregnant by another teen- both in their care), and wish I knew then, what I know now.  I would advise anyone considering placement of their teen to run for the hills.  My daughter would have been better off on the streets than in the care of this facility.    "But, again, anything a resident does at DreamTree is by his or her own choice."In New Mexico, the law says at age 14, you can make your own decisions, Hummel [Executive Director] said. You are treated as an adult, and we follow that.  http://www.taosnews.com/news/success_stories/article_6a06b416-4e40-11e4-b719-9b355cdb7532.html Please if you are considering donating to this facility, DO NOT.  DO NOT ENABLE THESE PEOPLE TO ENDANGER CHILDREN!!!
Roadrunner Food Bank Inc	153551	1	/users/profile/204349	Denise48	Volunteer	5	04/08/2013	I have volunteered my time to help the Roadrunner foodbank of NM on several occassions.  I have thourougly enjoyed my time and feel it was time well spent.  My favorite event was the boxing Olympics.  This event is very competitive.  Several organizations and corporations bring teams of 6 to compete against other organizations and corporations.  We have to fill boxes as fast as we can.  Each box has to have a specific amount in each.  As the boxes are filled and taped, they are now ready to ship out to Senior Citizens.  This helps Roadrunner food bank fill the boxes with volunteers while having a wonderful time!  My group has won the Silever and Bronze medal for the event.  What a wonderful organization this is.
Roadrunner Food Bank Inc	93511	2	/users/profile/107635	Lissa Heineman	Donor	5	07/06/2011	Roadrunner Food Bank in Albuquerque, New Mexico plays a unique role in food distribution throughout New Mexico. They are not a faith-based organization but they often work with churches, etc. They are really cooperative and gather food from every imaginable source. They supply smaller groups and also give to people in need directly. I am impressed by their communication with the public and their openness to listen to new ideas and needs. RRFB also works with school groups and other groups to pack boxes with food. It is a very educational experience, especially when the participants realize the great need in New Mexico. 
Atrisco Land Rights Council	189641		/users/profile/247551	AtriscoHeir	General Member of the Public	5	12/01/2013	Thank you for assisting to keep key leadership involved in the land grants right protection.you assistance was key in helping the Town of Atrisco Board of Trustees petition the legislature to create a new entity to protect the rights of the Heirs of the Town of Atrisco Grant a unit of government, political subdivision under chapter 49 of the new mexico statutes

The property was taken by the Government and Jaime Chavez was appointment to Represent the Atrisco Heirs.   The westland dev corp.  did little to stop the sale.  The Atrisco Land Rights council has helped the community for many years.  After the Sale of our land base to Suncal the non profit was needed to help protect and promote the Heirs rights.
New Mexico Wildlife Federation	188574		/users/profile/246092	MichelleNMWF	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/14/2013	For nearly 100 years, NMWF has been working with New Mexico sportsmen and women to protect our lands and our hunting and fishing heritage. I am disappointed but not surprised to see a disingenuous negative review of what we have accomplished. Resident sportsmen and women know all too well our hunting and public land access right are threatened by a variety of commercial and outside interests. Instead of being divisive, though, NMWF partners with landowners, organizations and management agencies to make positive changes that benefit sportsmen now and for the future. New Mexico sportsmen and women care about responsible use of and public access to our lands, and we work hard to protect our rights to hunt and fish in our state. Please do visit our website www.nmwildlife.org and learn more about what we have accomplished and the work we are doing today to make sure we can pass on our outdoor passions to the next generation -- then get involved.
New Mexico Wildlife Federation	149038	1	/users/profile/198559	Scubaswenson	Professional with expertise in this field	1	02/07/2013	A careful review of this organization's communications and website will reveal that it is a front organization for a liberal environmental agenda. They are not pro sportsman. They are pro wolf and anti OHV access. I strongly recommend you don't support this organization.  
Santa Fe Animal Shelter Inc Trust	275843	1	/users/profile/365515	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	1	01/06/2016	I recently became aware of the incredibly high salaries of some of the staff and their expense accounts. They should be much more transparent about the salaries and how they seem to hire friends of friends. A volunteer recently told me how they routinely give donations of goods to certain staff and friends of some of the supervisors. Some donations have just been thrown in dumpsters. Organizations like these highlight the need for more oversight of nonprofits.

PUPPY DOG RANCH	193587		/users/profile/252850	woof_smith	Board Member	5	01/31/2014	January 2014:  Puppy Dog Ranch Rescue and Sanctuary was established in 2009 and is the first and only NO KILL, NO CAGE refuge in Grant County,  New Mexico. Puppy Dog Ranch is a non-funded, all-volunteer, 501(c)(3) nonprofit charity and supports residents throughout 125 miles in rural southwest New Mexico.  Puppy Dog Ranch works out of the founder/president and vice president's 7 acre home ranch.  Through stringent adoption guidelines and matching the energy and personality of a dog to the lifestyle of the adopter, Puppy Dog Ranch maintains a 99% adoption success rate.  PDR networks with Rescues and Shelters throughout the United States -- with an emphasis on rescuing dogs from the Shelters who choose to work with No Kill Rescues rather than take a dogs' life -- and those Shelters knowing that non profit Rescue Groups cannot afford to pay an adoption fee to save a dogs' life.  PDR's dogs live on our sanctuary for, sometimes years, before we find the proper furever home for them.  PDR's rescued dogs live in appropriate 'packs', are socialized with other dogs and especially children, do not have food aggression/protection issues, are house trained, ride well in cars, some are leash trained, all are taught voice commands and appropriate, balanced behavior.   We are very proud of our hard work, working 24/7, and our successful results rescuing, rehabilitating and rehoming unwanted, neglected, and abused dogs.  As of January 2014, we have rescued over 180 dogs, have found furever homes for over 135 dogs, and care for an average of 30-40 dogs a day on our home ranch, 15 of whom are dogs who will live their lives in our sanctuary.  We survive strictly on donations and non-paid volunteers.  We apply to and receive funding for S.P.O.T., (Stopping Pet Overpopulation Together), our Spay/Neuter Assistance Program, which has financed the spays and neuters of 300+ dogs and cats in 2 years, in Grant County, New Mexico.

Brighten A Life Inc	192643		/users/profile/251555	lastsamurai7	General Member of the Public	1	01/15/2014	This is not an organization that believes in transparency. As mentioned, their bookkeeping is not  kept separate from   the green schoolhouse.  They do not operate under the guidelines of a non profit. It's a family affair, meaning founders and board members are related.  No independent auditors. 
Brighten A Life Inc	177848	2	/users/profile/234440	Andy by Dandy	General Member of the Public	1	10/15/2013	This organization is not on the up and up.  They co-mingle money with their sister business called The Green Schoolhouse Series, (greenschoolhouseseries.org) who has on-going cases with the Department of Labor in San Diego, (cases are listed in court records for anyone to see) for non payment of employees payroll.  Employees who were let go without their pay were also not able to collect unemployment because the State of California did not have any record of the business filing reports or paying payroll taxes for several years.  Noticed this business (brightenalife.org) has been in business since 1996 and taken in 2/4 million and no tax returns?  Isn't that illegal?

BATTERED FAMILIES SERVICES INC	115323	2	/users/profile/157072	franpal	Volunteer	5	06/14/2012	I was a child witness to Domestic Violence brought on by my father to my mother.   In those days there was no domestic violence shelter.  Even when the police were called my mother was told "It's a family problem." After my mother was severly beaten by my father, my mother took us to stay at hotel on highway 66.  We were cold, hungry and had nothing but the clothes on our back.  I can still remember "I don't care, at least I'm safe."  Today, I honor Battered Families Services, Inc.  as they provide shelter and safety to survivor's of violence.  They also provide counseling for women and children; and even to perpetrators to realize what they are doing isn't right.  I'm proud to live in a community that has such an organizaiton.  Your sup;port of Battered Families Services is appreciated.  God Bless You.
Walkin N Cirlces Ranch Inc	261334		/users/profile/349930	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/03/2015	New Mexico Horse Rescue at Walkin N Circles Ranch, Inc., is home to about 70 horses.  The ranch is run by two paid staff and over 100 volunteer ranch hands.   The experience of volunteering at this ranch is very fulfilling.  Volunteers learn to care for the horses, handle them, and have access to trainers to help the horses become adoptable.  It is a wonderfully peaceful place.
Walkin N Cirlces Ranch Inc	142805		/users/profile/152646	pkroken	Donor	5	11/26/2012	As hay prices soared, the crisis of abused and neglected horses reached a critical level.  Walkin N Circles Ranch (New Mexico Horse Rescue) somehow expanded their facilities to meet new demands and Executive Director, Charles Graham, reached out to other horse rescue organizations around the state to coordinate efforts.  After the death of my two ancient horses, I donated a couple of truckloads of feed, tack and other equipment to the ranch.  They also have a thrift store which takes donations.  This is a wonderful organization with many committed volunteers.  Their website contains a message of hope and lists all of the horses they have saved, trained and made adoptable.  This is a truly great cause.

Altrusa International Foundation Inc	159740		/users/profile/211912	Michael173	Volunteer	5	06/06/2013	The Ruidoso chapter of Altrusa serves several important groups within our community. It has historically been known by its annual mammogram program, which helps women who couldn't otherwise afford it to fight against breast cancer. It has also contributed monthly donations to a local battered women's shelter in a community that is severely affected by violence and abuse, the local food bank, and many other programs, as well as supporting literacy (true to Altrusa's mission).

PAJARITO ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION CENTER	150256		/users/profile/200382	MM24	Volunteer	5	02/28/2013	Pajarito Environmental Education Center is an amazing place.  I volunteered in the office doing administrative odd jobs for a few months last year and got an opportunity to see how this organization works and to witness first hand the hard work and genuine dedication that goes into it.  The people that run the programs are real and have an amazing love of what they teach, to people of all ages.  They aren't in it for the money but rather the chance to convey true respect of our environment  to others and help them learn to know more about their surroundings.
PAJARITO ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION CENTER	150143		/users/profile/200187	jpmacke	Board Member	5	02/26/2013	I first visited PEEC in 2007, and joined the board of directors later that year. I currently help care for the live exhibit animals. I love to see how people of all ages learn new things at the nature center and then take that new information back out into the world. For example, I've seen many people touch a snake for the first time, and as a result, learn why snakes are an important part of the local ecosystem. I believe that these encounters will help them better understand and appreciate the animals they see outdoors. PEEC serves the community, both through the nature canter and through its many outdoor programs. PEEC provides interesting ways of getting outdoors and inspires people to seek the benefits of being outdoors. PEEC is also a good neighbor to the community by supporting local schools and by partnering with many other organizations. Since its inception, PEEC has grown steadily, and is preparing to operate a new nature center that will showcase the amazing natural treasures of the Pajarito Plateau.  I highly recommend PEEC because it is a good steward: a steward for people, for the community, and for nature.
New Mexico Vecinos United Community Development Corporation	169575	1	/users/profile/224749	Vecinos United	Volunteer	5	09/13/2013	The Organization is one of the few that has fought hard for issues others are afraid to touch, such as police brutality. It is one of the few that truly represents the interests of the underpriviliged. It has excellent recognition by people. It got rid of three corrupt Police Chiefs, Joseph Polisar (Albuquerque), Gilbert Gallegos (Albuquerque), Robert Lucero (Santa Fe). Vecinos United fought hard to get Civilian Oversight of Police. Due to the level of corruption in Albuqueruqe city Government, City Councils and Mayors continue to support Human & Civil rights violations by APD. Vecinos United single handed created the Public Regulation Commission. These are just a couple of manysuccesses accomplished. The bad report given was by an opertunist who sought to use the organization for his own benefit and was not allowed.

Everything that happens to you, that you're feeling or is a part of your daily experience is thought to be because of "misunderstood words"....it's completely ridiculous.  To top everything off, AS's students are supposed to be "head and shoulders above other students" and are supposed to be well-behaved because of their lovely "technology"...so, why did the sr. vp of administration at the St. Louis location send her son to reform school because he was a terror and he's behind in his studies?  Yet she was able to teach this garbage in Cali to other people's children!  But for some unknown reason, she couldn't teach her own son...Looks like a scam, sounds like a scam, IT'S A SCAM BABY!  Stay away from this cult at all costs!
Applied Scholastics International	48581	1	/users/profile/49688	john-basilone	General Member of the Public	1	07/22/2010	This organization is a front group for Scientology, a dangerous cult.

St Martins Hospitality Center	267427	1	/users/profile/356160	Writer	Client Served	1	10/26/2015	I had the same bad experience as the reviewer below! Just a greedy organization that doesn't care about anything but getting money to line their pockets. I went there about two years ago when I was homeless. I also have Autism. I was sneered at and laughed at by the staff. After about 20 minutes or so of being there I was yelled at and removed for feeding a pigeon an old cereal bar I had. Never got any food or anything.

A Peaceful Habitation & Aftercareministry	41002	8	/users/profile/41899	justine1	Volunteer	5	05/27/2010	I have been involved with mentoring the ladies at APH (A Peaceful Habitation) for over two years. I have gotten to know many of the X-prisoners quite well, and I am impressed with how well they have done as a result of living at this facility. Weekly Bible studies, Daily Devotions, and Life Skills are just a few of the things they learn there. Each lady must live at APH for a minimum of six months. Many ladies who have completed their time at APH are finding ways to legally make it on their own, without drugs!!  Most have been able to reestablish relationships with their families, and many of them are going to school so that they can get better paying jobs. For every lady who doesn't end up going back to prison, APH saves the state and federal government a lot of money, and the success rate at APH is quite impressive. APH works very hard at being a "hand-up" and not a "hand-out" organization. It is a joy to be a volunteer at such a well-run nonprofit organization.
A Peaceful Habitation & Aftercareministry	38260	5	/users/profile/39153	raejae73	Volunteer	5	05/07/2010	My experience with A Peaceful Habitation (APH) has been a blessing from God. I am currently a mentor for APH and have found more joy and have learned more from these women then I ever thought I would. It's an amazing gift to give a woman recently released from prison/jail, a home to go to, a roof over their head, a meal in their stomach, electricity, hot water and not even need to worry how they will get it. These women have a stepping stone back into society and will be empowered and more likely to succeed with the help from APH! I Thank God everyday for finding APH!
St Bonaventure Indian Missions & School	198431	21	/users/profile/259152	rjtyc	Donor	4	04/21/2014	I have contributed to St. Bonaventure for several years. I like their simple approach to serving the Indian population in western N. Mexico. In particular, I am EXTREMELY impressed with Mr. Halter's low salary. He's there to serve, not to earn the big bucks, and he personally responds to donors. Very refreshing. It must be frustrating for him knowing about all the revenue various Indian groups acquire from gambling, seemingly very little of which is used to help their own people in need. I feel my dollars are well spent. One downside, their numerous solicitations have become annoying.
St Bonaventure Indian Missions & School	104199	44	/users/profile/139708	OpaOmi	Donor	5	01/23/2012	My wife and I spent two days this fall at St. Bonaventure Mission and School--a charity we have contributed to for many years.  We spent most of our time in the school.  We are both professional educators and can attest to the high quality of education provided in the school.  All of the children are provided with free breakfast and lunch as well as school supplies and transportation door-to-door from their homes.  Door-to-door transportation is very important to assuring that these children are able to attend school regularly.  We rode the school bus to take students home and we can personally attest to the level of need in the region.  However, we also observed that this is a close-knit community.  A number of the staff at the school are members of this community, so the school also provides much-needed employment opportunities (e.g. teachers, aides, fund raising staff, drivers, cooks) in an area of high unemployment.  Thanks to donors, the school is generally well equipped, however many things considered as givens in schools in more prosperous areas are considered to be luxuries at St. Bonaventure.  For example, we found that the middle school science classroom was well equipped with microscopes, but many were in need of repair and no funds were available.  Science texts had to be shared and could not be taken home for study because of a shortage of books which are only funded by the state every few years.  Supplies and equipment for special needs children are also in short supply.  The school is very efficient getting the most benefit from every dollar contributed.  We believe our donations are put to very good use at St. Benaventure.
Faith And Justice Center Inc	118130	1	/users/profile/160661	Bluskywomn	General Member of the Public	5	07/11/2012	St. Mary Rest Home provides a valuable service to the elderly in Albuquerque NM.  Those fortunate residents fortunate who live there have the most quality care available to assist them in every aspect of their well being.  I was able to witness the compassionate care given to them when I was part of a group of JustFaith members who volunteered to help serve a meal at St. Mary.   It was a heartwarming and joyful experience to be part of the warmth and love that permeated the dining room on that day, and which, I am sure, carries over into each and every other room, and into the hearts of each resident in this very professional and caring organization that is St. Mary Rest Home.

The staff, administration and board of directors are very committed to the mission and making every dollar donated go to the best and greatest possible good.
SPANISH COLONIAL ARTS SOCIETY INC	126450		/users/profile/171472	Janella	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/17/2012	I have worked on the staff of the Society for almost three years, and I am continually inspired by the commitment of Spanish Market artists and their families to continue the most honored tradition of mentoring young artists from generation to generation.  This tradition is a cultural model worth replicating in our country.  It is one of the few places in the United States where the time-honored tradition of apprenticeship still flourishes, with far-reaching benefits to the individual, family and greater society.

And, without the resources of the Spanish Colonial Arts Society I am certain that I and hundreds of other generational artist would not have picked up the torch to learn and practice the traditional materials and methods or learned the amazing historical tales of our region and our families.  In embracing this part of my heritage,  I have connected in my soul with all those that came before me that built a foundation for the culture and life in this region.  This is the only organization whose sole mission is to preserve and promote the endangered Spanish Colonial Arts.  Please support them!

FAMILY LIFELINE INC	115756		/users/profile/157644	Danielle Hidalgo	Volunteer	5	06/19/2012	I asked if I could volunteer at The Family Lifeline, and ended up staying since I am so impressed with the changes happening in the lives of the clientle we serve. People come in hurting emotionally and leave all bandaged up. Others come perplexed with questions about their relationships and leave with answers. Still more come to "tune up" the relationship they are currently enjoying. There are couples who come to get "premarital training." They leave with a "tool box" they can draw from when obstacles present themselves. When my husband and I had been married 25 years we really hit the wall in our relationship. There had been one thing after another happening in our lives from job loss to kids and drugs, to school problems, to losing our home etc....All that to say our relationship with each other was shelved. We didn't know one another any more. As a volunteer, I saw  the obvious impact of relationship education on other couples at The Family Lifeline and we decided to enter the mentoring program ourselves! We are making changes, and coming back to each other while we learn to use our tools. I'm so grateful!    Danielle  
Big Brothers Big Sisters Of Central New Mexico Donation Center Inc	146015		/users/profile/192644	aimless	Donor	1	12/05/2012	I am a Big in the program and a financial donor and I am disappointed with the programs that they bring to the kids. For example they will announce a exciting event like a job fair to the kids and hype it up. Then they will either cancel the event less than 24 hours before and or they will bring in one company to talk to the kids about jobs. The company they bring in to talk about jobs will not even have a presentation ready in advance and one that is for the population of children this program is supposedly helping. I don't really like to take my little to their planned events anymore because it is always a disappointment. Either it doesn't happen or done so poorly it doesn't matter and make the kids feel like they are unimportant. I have talked to the people in charge and some of them have recently changed but as of yet there is absolutely no improvement! SAD!
LOVING THUNDER THERAPEUTIC RIDING INC	195709	1	/users/profile/255915	TMMR	Client Served	5	03/17/2014	My daughter has been learning how to ride a horse at Loving Thunder Therapeutic Riding for several years.  Although she is autistic and very delayed she has blossomed over the past years.  The wonderful volunteers help her to do all the activities of grooming and getting the horses ready to ride.  She is improving her fine motor skills and building essential muscles every day.  Don't get me wrong, they don't do it for her, they make her do the work, but help by doing the things she is not able to accomplish.  She is now learning how to turn her horse thru the patterns, stopping and backing up.  The horses are so patient and calmly stand while she finishes her duties.  She will probably never be able to ride with out the assistance of someone, but the joy on her face when she rides will forever be etched in my brain.  Thank you Loving Thunder for making my daughter feel like a rodeo queen each time she rides.

RONALD MCDONALD HOUSE CHARITIES OF NEW MEXICO	201632		/users/profile/262921	montielfam07	General Member of the Public	5	06/02/2014	About 7 years ago, I almost went to this house when my first daughter was almost born premature. Thank goodness that the doctors at U.N.M were able to prevent that from happening and saved my daughter. But while there, the doctors told us about the Ronald McDonald house and so we looked it up. Based on what we read, we have gained a new respect and admiration for organizations like this. Kids and their families are being helped with premature births with specialists and housing to those who aren't from there. We are proud to say that we donate to this and any other organization that helps children since then. Thank you Ronald McDonald house for all the work you guys do to help families in situations that I was almost in. 
Talking Talons Youth Leadership	192885		/users/profile/251894	gnrgreatnonprofits	Volunteer	5	01/21/2014	Three years ago we moved into the mountains east of Albuquerque, New Mexico.  The first year we were here my 4th and 2nd grade daughters were fortunate enough to experience the Talking Talons Youth Leadership (TTYL) curriculum at San Antonito Elementary School in Sandia Park, NM.  My 4th grader got to experience hands-on wildlife and environmental education and then teach what she and her classmates had learned to the second grade class in their school!  Both daughters learned a wealth of information from the very experienced TTYL educators.   The next year my then 7th grade son got to experience TTYL's environmental monitoring field trip, another big hit!  Since then, my oldest daughter has also experienced the monitoring field trip and my youngest daughter became the 4th grader teaching her second grade schoolmates. I cannot express my happiness enough that an organization such as TTYL exists.  My children have been exposed not only to fantastic non-releasable wildlife education, but also to the details of environmental monitoring and now they feel empowered to actually address issues involved in the future of their environment. Because of my enthusiasm, I was recruited for the TTYL Board of Directors.  Since last April I have become more and more involved with the organization.  I have attended ecological monitoring sessions with their educators, student field trips, and volunteer at least 8 hours/week for their grant writing team.   Each week that passes has me more and more impressed with the professionalism and dedication of this organization.  Their fiscal house is in perfect order, their program director is absolutely outstanding, and the educators they hire are a perfect fit in delivering their mission.  Because of this, I am actively searching for additional board members and community volunteers for the organization. In short, the students and community served by this organization truly have a diamond in their midst. Sincerley, Genevieve BarrettSan Antonito, NM

JOURNEYS IN FILM	37806	5	/users/profile/38510	journeysinfilm	Board Member	5	05/01/2010	Journeys in Film advances global learning through the powerful combination of age-appropriate films from around the world, interdisciplinary classroom materials, and professional development workshops.  Designed to develop 21st century skills, this comprehensive curriculum model promotes widespread use of film as a window to the world to help secondary students to mitigate existing attitudes of cultural bias and racism, cultivate human empathy and compassion, develop a richer understanding of global issues, and prepare for effective participation in the world economy  as active global citizens. Journeys methodology uses the visual storytelling of films as a tool for engaging and inspiring studentsconnecting them with their peers and locations around the world while building core academic skills.  Journeys inter-disciplinary curriculum guides include lesson plans and extension activities in science, math, language arts, social studies, visual arts, media literacy, critical-thinking, problem-solving and inter-cultural communication. The comprehensive interdisciplinary model allows for a team teaching and cross-curricular implementation, in order to foster deeper learning with real-life connections at the individual, familial, community, national and international levels. The result is an imersive, high-impact experience for students in any educational setting. Selected films showcase stories that have universal appeal and portray shared values. The overall message is simple:  cultures of the world share more commonalities than differences.

The idea from the beginning was to educate so called third world peoples to do small scale farming much like Victory Gardening during WWII here in the States.  Self sustaining gardening through harvesting, seed saving and replanting is an art long lost in most parts of the world which SLI strives to "re-teach." SLI also researches opportunities to improve conditions under which gardening and daily life exists via alternate technologies.  Please see the web site at www.seedandlightinternational.org for more. Every time SLI receives photos of gardens in progress from our "Hero's on the ground," it is a nice feeling to know that our efforts are a success.

I have not been able to locate this foundation on my online search for philanthropy reviewers and thus feel this may be a place to start.

I met with my Circle Leader most every week, and we have now become good friends.  I had to confront the assumptions that I had around poverty and it changed my life.  I now look at everyone I meet with new respect and as an equal.  I am not better only my circumstances are different. Circles is capable of transforming ourselves and our communities to make them a better place for all.

Tri-County Family Justice Center Ofnortheast New Mexico Inc	195158		/users/profile/255088	teachersuvivor	Professional with expertise in this field	2	03/03/2014	High Turnover Rate, Poor Management.  Unfortunately, there are a few caring people there at TCFJC of Northeastern NM, but overall I would not recommended this organization to any victim.  They have a poor reputation when it comes to helping  people in the community.  The staff consists of mostly students and some staff have never been a victim of abuse.  I would highly recommend finding other means of support such as, a Licensed Therapist or check out Other Organizations available for all types of Violence and Abuse.  In Santa Fe, The New Mexico Coalition Against Domestic Violence, Esperanza Shelter for Battered Families, Inc, Judith Kaplan, MSW, ACSW, LISW, 35 years experience.  These are just a few examples of other options.   Do your research and it will be in your best interest.  Just because an organization exists doesn't mean it is reputable.  When it comes to being a victim of any kind of violence it's best to find people who are supportive of your individual situation and who will continue to support you on our journey towards healing.  In any kind of an abusive situation you need the best support system you can get and sorry to say this may not be the best place.  Good Luck To You And Remember You Are Not Alone.  :-)

Holistic Management International (HMI)	165663	2	/users/profile/220172	RonChapman	Board Member	4	08/21/2013	More than a decade ago I had the opportunity for exposure to HMI. What I saw impressed me in terms of impact and passion. But what really got my attention was a phrase I heard a number of times, "Saved our ranch, saved our land, saved our family." I remember telling a friend, "I'm not sure i completely understand what they do, but it is obviously very meaningful." Twelve years later, and after three terms as a Director including three years as the Chair, I have to say that time (and the funding support I've provided) has been an exceptional investment. l can see a programmatic path that is clearer than ever, a very good governance structure and very competent and devoted staff. That translates into more vital and vibrant ranches and farms, increasing land restoration and a great deal of benefit to families and communities who depend heavily on the land and its production.

They knew where I had been, but more importantly they knew what I could be. Thanks you guys so much and God bless you! ~ Kyle, 26

Interfaith Community Shelter Group Inc	288218		/users/profile/378432	Worriedsick	Former staff	1	05/04/2016	I do not understands how this place is still open.Rapes, drug deals, human trafficking, prostitution, death by over dose, ex- staff members cutting guest's throats open, etc. This is just a few of the things I experienced working there. Ask the administration to show you how they do business and you will hear a script. In reality head people have no clue about human services or outreach work. They are money driven to the extent of not even providing training to their staff on how to handle people whom belong in prison. They don't even care about checking on them after they get exposed to guests deaths, threats, or any other traumatic event for staff. Sadly, I am not the only person who sees this. ANY GUEST WILL TELL YOU THEMSELVES.

Sonoma Springs Covenant Church Inc	188508		/users/profile/245990	Sksully	General Member of the Public	1	11/13/2013	The church leaders banded together with Pastor Timothy and squashed my son, who had been going there for 4 years. After a severe depressive episode, and a week treating his depression, the church and youth turned their backs on him! What the heck? Since he is autistic like and emotional delayed he was devastated at this loss. He sent a text expressing his hurt to the church and they filed a police report. Pastor Timothy said he was 'unstable'. He just got a high school diploma, rides up to 40 miles/ 3 times a week on his bike with his exercise psychologist, and is working with joining job corps. These people lowered him to a new depression level and then spat on him.

Baca Horse Conservancy	149133	2	/users/profile/198691	BellB	Volunteer	1	02/08/2013	I volunteered and I was shocked at the condition of their horses. Many were very thin, others were wearing halters that did not fit, and had them hanging off one ear. All the horses had very long hooves that showed no regular hoof care. To add to the dismal conditions, some mares had foals and some appeared to be in-foal. I was treated well, but had to listen to long winded tales about how great these horses were, and it was really sad to see that while there were many obviously expensive projects going on---like a HUGE metal gazebo and a large metal horse sculpture--no real funding was going to the animals in the form of basic, necessary care--like feed, de-worming and hoof care. As far as continued efforts to volunteer, I was rudely dismissed by one of the female family members. It is clear this is a 'relative only' club, even though none of them appear to really help out.WARNING: DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS GROUP!   :(

Ffaa Inc	196625		/users/profile/256999	DogWoman	Volunteer	5	03/28/2014	The care and individualized treatment of each animal is very special. There is ample room for all the dogs and cats to run around and interact with others. Even tho they generally house a minimum of 75 resident dogs, each one has their own program for exercise, feeding and attention. The cat population which exceeds 100 at any given time also enjoys a full life at Fur and Feather. All animals are spayed/neutered so the population only grows with incoming animals. A wonderful place to visit and volunteer if you can.

Prosperity Works	225567		/users/profile/289333	KileyMoran	Donor	5	10/23/2014	As a donor over many years, I always felt great about giving to Prosperity Works because I'd heard all the success stories of New Mexicans moving from poverty to prosperity, sometimes in short amounts of time. I knew that my money went far because it was automatically at least doubled by other funds PW had raised. Prosperity Works, with valued community partners, helps people build assets through Individual Development Accounts: 4 to 1 matched savings accounts to buy a house, go to college, start or grow a business and now, also, through Child Savings Accounts, 1:1 matched savings over 11 years that not helps kids to go to college but from a young age to invest in themselves, set new goals and intentions for their lives.  Now as a new employee, coming from the for-profit, corporate world, I am excited to make not only my money, but my time count. I am glad to  learn of and to support Prosperity Works' efforts to end poverty at a policy level as well, for example, to cap the interest rates of payday loan type companies that viciously prey on the most vulnerable New Mexicans with 200-2000% annual interest rates.

We are also involved in educating the general public about epilepsy and it's effects on the lives of those living with it.  Our goal is to "facilitate the acceptance of epilepsy" because we realize a cure is a long way off, and those of us living with epilepsy need the opportunity to live our lives as fully as possible in the meantime.  All the board members are individuals living with epilepsy, and know it's impact on life from first hand experience.  We are trying to work closely with our local physicians to provide services to people who are diagnosed with epilepsy.  We have had our first walk and are already planning on the second walk for 2013 to continue to raise awareness of epilepsy in the community.

Carlsbad Literacy Program	219614	1	/users/profile/283236	Carlsbad_Literacy_Coordinator	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/03/2014	I am the new Coordinator for this program. I applied for this position because in the past I was a tutor for Carlsbad Literacy. I was about 19, (now 29)and decided I needed to do more for our community. The coordinator at the time was a close friend of my mothers and member of my families church.  She told me about the volunteer opportunity to tutor an illiterate adult.  I was very nervous and it wasn't really my area of interest at the time. I started with a Russian girl. She said she just moved here because she married an American doctor. She was tired of having someone drive her around while her husband worked all day and asked me to help her get her drivers license. She was already a ESL student at CLP and spoke very very little English. I tutored her for a 6 months and in that six months she was also working with an esl instructor and I noticed how she picked up English so fast within months, it amazed me.  Her confidence level and attitude started to change.  She was happy and smiled more.  One day after tutoring her for her drivers license she said she was ready to take the test. The day she walked in the room for our next session she had a huge smile on her face and teared up. She gave me a huge hug and some roses and said she couldn't thank me enough for helping her get her drivers license. It was then I knew that I could make a difference in peoples lives. That was the first and last time I volunteered to be a tutor, As I went on to college Carlsbad Literacy was always in the back of my mind and that good feeling I got when I seen how excited she was to have her drivers license.  I was a woman of very little self confidence and motivation untill then. I think we both changed eachothers lives for the better.  After marrying and having 3 beautiful children. I noticed an ad in the paper for the Coordinator position, I got that feeling again and I knew that this was meant to be for me.  Carlsbad Literacy program changes lives in ways we cant even imagine. The simplest petty things like learning to read, getting a drivers license, and reading to our children mean a lot, but there are people out there who have no idea what its like. Im happy to be apart of this program today and to reach out to those who need our help in our community. Programs like Carlsbad Literacy make a difference and change lives for the better.
St Vincent Hospital	236631	1	/users/profile/320631	Marin Z.	General Member of the Public	1	01/10/2015	It is extremely unfortunate that a town like Santa Fe, NM that has worldwide visitor, resident and retirement appeal, has such a woefully inadequate level of hospital patient care. Just one example - Christus St Vincent outsources their emergency room service at the hospital, they then filed a law suit against their Provider seeking indemnification for the wrongful death actions filed against the provider for ER patient deaths. THIS IS PATIENT CARE? The leading cause of death in Santa Fe County is cancer... The oncologists are in a partnership with the hospital pursuant to an agreement that the hospital will not make public, yet they accept millions of dollars per year from the community without offering any governance or transparency to the community. The oncology group is not well trained, well managed or experienced. Additionally, vital patient rights are ignored, in particular informed consent as to life or death treatment plans and other vital medical information that patients have an absolute legal right to know. 
Assistance Dogs Of The West	117822	2	/users/profile/160209	Randy P.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/06/2012	My first contact with ADW was while attending an ADW sponsored workshop focused on training Diabetic Alert Dogs. Since that time, our  growing mid-west organization has looked on ADW as a leader in the assistance dog world and a mentor. I saw the professionalism, passion, and dedication the staff, trainers, and volunteers all have for the life changing effects an Assistance dog can have on the life of the person it is partnered with. I sat in on a client training session and spoke with the mother of the client - an adult son with a TBI - and witnessed first hand the excitment and hope they had for the the future with the ADW dog that was going to be placed with them. I can speak first hand of the care and respect the team at ADW show for the dogs in their care and the high standards of training they have. I have no qualms at all about recommending Assistance Dogs of the West for your support!

They have gone to speak to us at Dona Ana Community College and even at my daughter's center. The services they provide are not only limited to sexual assaults but also bullying and educating children and providing them with the tools necessary to fight back and speak up. This is something that we, as parents are very happy to teach our children but understand that they need to hear this from someone else outside of the family that is within that organization to better educate them and let them know that they are not alone. Thank you guys for being very well educated on what you teach the community about their options and giving kids strength when they feel the most vulnerable.

Sierra County Humane Society Inc	192992	1	/users/profile/252064	Frickinducky	Volunteer	1	01/23/2014	Before going further, I do not want to discourage anyone from volunteering at or donating to the Sierra County Humane Society (SCHS).  I am an ardent believer in the no-kill movement and animal welfare.  For the time being, Desert Haven it is the only no kill animal refuge and SCHS the only humane society directly available to the Truth or Consequences area.  Even if I have severe reservations about its management and oversight, it truly is better than nothing and with public accountability, it has the basic assets to further its mission and earn it the privilege of havering not for profit status.  And I love the animals I have cared for there for the past three plus months as a workcamper. I found the work camper positions at Desert Haven while looking for volunteer opportunities in this area.  It felt like complete serendipity.  We had decided to explore this region as a possible home-base and wanted to find good work to do while here.  Working with SCHS seemed perfect.  The perks of the RV space were nice but not necessary.  All we wanted was a good place to do good work.  We would have followed the volunteer vacationer mode if that was on offer.  Unfortunately, despite my partner's and my love for the animals, our enjoyment of the work, deep like for our co-workers, it turns out were were getting involved in a situation mired in mediocrity and minimal standards overseen by a person who has no leadership abilities.  I truly wish mediocrity was the worst of our experience. That being said, I have a decade of experience in the not for profit sector.  I am deeply concerned about accountability and transparency because they are the foundation of public trust.  After three months of association, I know the President and Board could and should be doing so much better and feel it is time for a complete change in leadership.  What good does the basic infrastructure do if the SCHS isn't meeting its mission, only provides a project of appearances and a look at facts on the ground and public records erodes the confidence of volunteers and donors alike?   The heart of any organization is its human resources.  From my experiences, observations and conversations, SCHS, or more specifically Eliana Aubin, burns people out hard and fast. This is especially true for the workcampers.  In our three plus months here, we will be the third rv to drive off well before our commitment ends.  A tremendous part of the problem is the caustic culture of communication Eliana Aubin fosters.  Honestly, I should have left the day she screamed in my face about something that had nothing to do with me.  I have never volunteered or worked at a place where leadership screams at, belittles, insults and abuses people in the way we have experienced and observed.  Dealing with the president of SCHS is very much akin to being in an abusive relationship if you are a workcamper.  She even committed physical assault on me just prior to our departure and I know she has grabbed and shoved others as well.  Admittedly, treatment is different if you are a local volunteer - they have the ability to avoid Eliana and are given wide latitude in their performance, to the point where hitting a dog with a spinning leash is okay.  I am not surprised after briefly encountering a Board member who's dog had a shock collar and whom she struck with a metal chain.  Evidently, standards are low. Being able to retain human resources, employ their skill sets appropriately and create a work environment where people can maintain enthusiasm and work to best of their abilities should be part of Eliana's job.  She isn't doing it and the Board is not providing the oversight to make sure she does.   Her job is also about maintaining and furthering the mission statement.  As stated on the Desert Haven website and SCHS tax returns, the mission of SCHS is "The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals[,] Relief of Animal Suffering[,] Extension of Humane Education.  Towards these ends, SCHS does little.  For the sake of brevity, I won't address each failing but will provide some insights. How is the extension of humane education achieved when according to the Schedule O of SCHS's 990 tax return of 2012, a grand total of $20.00 was spent towards that end?  Financial responsibility is one thing, this is a failure to maintain mission.  When I would inquire about various ways we could do outreach and expand humane education, I was constantly met with indifference or the statement that there aren't enough volunteers.  Eliana has a point about the volunteers, but that situation rests squarely on her shoulders.  The Desert Haven website claims to do educational outreach to local schools.  Institutional memory of at least the past year and the totes of humane education coloring books dry rotting on site shows otherwise.  As to relief of animal suffering, while there are basic standards of care and the staff, workcampers and volunteers do amazing with the minimal time and care guidance provided, the lack education on animal wellbeing on the part of leadership of SCHS actually can promote such suffering.   My husband and I realized one of the dogs at the refuge was at least semi-feral.  As such, dealing with this dog and ensuring her wellbeing is much different than for the others.  When I presented an article of well done protocols for feral dogs to Eliana with the hopes of having them implemented for Lucy and any other feral dogs brought to the refuge, I was told I was allowed to share them, but others don't have the time or interest.  It is a true shame as shortly there after, another feral dog came into care.  Because this dog is cute and little, it is easy to want to treat her as domestic, but she isn't and treating her as domesticated has a negative impact on her well being and rehabilitation.  There isn't even provision of basic training for the dogs to make them more adoptable or time given to provide grooming, which for the long haired animals does create a health concern.  Also, it should not be a struggle for the Animal Care Coordinator to get approval for appropriate treatment of the animals.  Additionally, Eliana should be far more thoughtful before stating such things as volunteers should stop pain management medications for a 14 year old dog with body wide arthritis and painfully bad teeth.  Food and shelter are great, but if animal welfare was so important, meaningful protocols aimed at rehabilitation, wellbeing and promoting adoptability would exist. Additionally, the President and Board are fiduciaries and have responsibility to maintain transparency and accountability.  This may be the greatest failing.  I will admit, it was a tremendous red flag for me when Eliana declared in a meeting that none of us were to concern ourselves with actual operations.  She then hung up a graphic displaying the chain of command.  The issue is that the tax privilege of a 501(c) 3, the not for profit status, means there should be absolutely no room for doubts about operations.  From my observations and public records research, the cracks in the financial facade are wide enough to drive a garbage truck through.  For starters, the Desert Haven website claims Paws & Claws Thrift Shoppe is owned and operated by SCHS.  That gnawed on me while looking at SCHS's tax returns.  Paws & Claws appears nowhere on the 990.  I could not find an independent not for profit status for Paws & Claws.  When I went through public records, the actual property owner is Eliana Aubin.  Does that mean the rent we constantly hear about making for Paws & Claws actually goes to her?  Why wouldn't she seek to extend the 501(c) 3 to the store?  Do all proceeds past rent and utilities actually make it to SCHS?  Does any of this present a potential conflict of interests and if so, are any such conflicts addressed and appropriately noted in Board records?  This is especially hard to clarify as no meaningful accounting or inventory system exists for Paws & Claws.  It is a cash only operation where the minimal tracing of transactions is limited to a notebook.  No receipts are given for purchases.  How are people who donate to or purchase from Paws & Claws provided meaningful assurance that proceeds go where they are suppose to?  This doesn't even go into the lack of sensible practices at the store itself.  Her refusal to engage in such things as sales events and her inability to maintain volunteers/workcampers has created a situation where donations literally molder in the adjacent lot. That is incompetent management of assets and resources provided by the community, and in conjunction with so much more is a breach of fiduciary duty (a good brief can be found at http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/fiduciary_duty).  I won't bother to go into the health and safty hazards I encountered at the store.   In trying to clarify things for myself, I made a public records request for a copy of the business license as I could not find one displayed at the store.  I was completely surprised when the Clerk initially told me she could find no license at all.  I am waiting for an official response to my request so there is a chance one may turn up.  I have yet to look into the full public record for Desert Haven's RV camp ground.  Additionally, I am perplexed as to why Eliana Aubin would provide 1099 (independent contractor) tax forms to people who by every appearance are common law employees?  If even just one person filed IRS form ss-8, she is inviting a lack of confidence in her legitimacy as leadership.  If she is unclear of their actual tax status, why hasn't she filed the ss-8 herself? There are a plethora of other issues, but in short, it is time for public accountability, transparency and positive change for the Sierra County Humane Society.  Sincerely, Kelly FactoConcerned former workcamper
HOMEWISE INC	190920		/users/profile/249246	Rachel Silva	General Member of the Public	5	12/16/2013	Homewise is one of the best-run, most effective organizations I've come across.  The problem they seek to solve is getting moderate-income families into homeownership, which is proven to stabilize both the family and the community.  They do this in several sensible steps: individual counseling, classes in financial literacy, credit repair, saving, and then navigating the homebuying and mortgage processes. They have highly qualified real estate brokers on staff, who do not work on commission! And in Santa Fe, where housing has become very expensive, Homewise decided to build affordable houses. But they didn't build them cheaply -- they built them for low TOTAL cost of ownership: quality materials and building techniques that require less maintenance, low-energy use appliances, extra insulation, etc.  I know personally one of the counselors and several of the staff, and they all exhibit the same high level of empathy and professionalism. 
Friends Of The Cumbres & Toltec	132167		/users/profile/177779	rboerger	Donor	5	11/01/2012	The Friends of the C&TS is vitally important to the continued existance of the country's longest and highest remaining narrow-guage railway, the Cumbres and Toltec Scenic Railway.   The Friends provide both financial resources and volunteer manpower to keep the trains running, and their support of what may be the world's most historically authentic narrow guage railway has kept the line in existance since the line was abandoned by the Denver and Rio Grande in the 1970s.   The Friends do all this with very low overhead - a shared passion for preserving this National Historic Landmark is what drives the organization to success.

Las Cruces Bantam Weight Sports Assoc Inc	100009	2	/users/profile/121454	David234567	Client Served	2	10/30/2011	This organization has for the year of 2011 been below expectations! The registration fee of $65.00 is basically for helmet and shoulder pad rental. The jersey , practice and game pants are on the team and parents. I double checked with New Mexico PRC website on the status of this nonprofit and it said they were in a negative standing. The teams are lopsided with  14 kids on one team and another having 35-40 kids.  The leadership said in the beginning of the season that there were only so many kids for 7 teams! So for a $65.00 registration fee and another $80.00 for jerseys, pants etc you get a promised "4" games. I wish Pop Warner or the NM Athletics Association would either take this over or govern it.

Many species reside here including horses, llamas, goats, cats, dogs, puppies, doves, rabbits, ducks, hens, geese and guinea pigs. The adoptable ones find a forever home and  the others are afforded a lifetime to live out their lives at the free-range sanctuary. There are NO cages for these creatures, just species-specific enclosed habitats where they can function like nature intended them to. You must see it to understand the dedication and hard work that goes into caring for all these animals.

The founder of this environmental organization, Carlos E. Fierro is a phoney!  He purports to love nature.  But -  he had been cutting down bit by bit  the branches of a gorgeous ficus tree that was the home of about 20 large iguanas in Same, Ecuador.  Several days ago, he illegally entered into the property of the owners of this tree when they were not at home, cut down the rest of this tree which was the largest tree in the area.  He even cut the roots of the tree with a chain saw so that it would die.  Does this sound like an environmentalist?  Amada Encarnacion Int'l is under vestigation by Correa's government.  Do not give any of your precious hard earned money to this fraud!

SFTE INC	60862		/users/profile/66328	fjessop514	Client Served	5	01/24/2011	Santa Fe Talent Education is an amazing organization dedicated to music education for children. My child has been learning violin since age three (yes they start that young!) and the patience and kindness with which SFTE teachers guide young children (and older ones too) into a pure love of music is truly amazing.  Suzuki Music Education is a process - with each song there is something new to learn and children are taught all the nuances of beautiful violin posture, how to hold the violin and the bow, and how to make beautiful sounds. It is taught with a strong emphasis - and some training - on parental involvement. As a parent, I practice everyday with my child, while the teacher meets with him once a week to help him learn new aspects of playing the violin.  There is also a focus on performing. The kids at SFTE regularly play together at play-ins or recitals.  I love SFTE. What they have given my son and me, is a gift that will last forever in our life.

Asombro Institute For Science Education	94091	1	/users/profile/108663	EmBee	Board Member	5	07/20/2011	I am a science educator, so I have a deep appreciation of any organization that provides high quality science instruction, be it a school district, a for-profit or a non-profit organization.  The Asombro Insititute for Science Education provides the best hands-on, minds-on science education based on local environment that I have encountered in my 30 years in education.  Activities developed by the staff at AISE are based on real world science data, and often have data incorporated into them.  The use of data gives students an opportunity to think about the numbers and what they mean, provide their own interpretations of the data and ask questions about what else the data can teach them.  Instead of the rote memorization of science facts, students (both children and adults) learn how science works and what can be done with the information science provides.  There are many opportunities for students to collect data in the field over a long period of time, and see how one data point does not make a trend, but 20 might.  The field in this area is the Chihuahuan Desert, not the most inviting or sexy  environment in which to learn.  However, AISE staff and volunteers appreciate the stark beauty, environmental complexity, and intricate relationships that are found in the desert biome as much as those found in grasslands or forests, and everyone they teach is invited to share their appreciation.  This makes those who participate in AISE educational programs more aware, knowledgeable and thoughtful citizens who really "get" why science is critical to our communities and our planet.  That this small organization with three staff members reaches over 14,000 children and adults a year with their science lessons and activities is quite a testament to their commitment to quality science education in the Southwest, which includes the entire state of New Mexico and far West Texas.

Imus Ranch Inc	25548	7	/users/profile/26557	patkeepsie391	Volunteer	3	01/14/2010	This non profit has been called "Don Imus' Retirement home" but it serves the purpose of giving children with cancer, SIDS victim siblings a true working ranch experience. Doctors and life coasches are on hand to make sure the kids are staying with their medication regimens. It should however look more like a ranch and not something featured in "architecture monthly". The little ranchers farm fresh vegetables, learn to rope, and ride horses. The Imus family is very involved with the kids and take only a small salary if any. Those who went to the I-Ranch, are positively changed and some even return again and again. The child limit is small, as the Imus family makes sure that each child is involved and not being cared for Assembly Line style. I have been a supporter of the I-Ranch from day one, and I see it as a good use of my donations.

All Ears Basset Sanctuary Inc	162113	1	/users/profile/215134	bassettmom	Client Served	1	07/06/2013	This rescue is a sham. This rescue does not follow the laws , such as obtaining a federally required Veterinary exam , so that only well dogs, or dogs determined to be disease free are transported , across the state lines, to a new home or location. Laws are meant to protect the  rescue animals , and guarantee that unsuspecting and potential adopters do not receive sick and diseased dogs such as I received. Under the freedom of Information Act is available a negative report issued against this rescue organization by the State of Colorado State Veterinarian Office. Colorado is a "rescue" location for this New Mexico based "rescue" and where some dogs may be transported without the proper required inspection documents.

Action Programs For Animals	201698		/users/profile/263201	Amanda134	Board Member	5	06/02/2014	About Us Our mission is to help Dona Ana County reach our No Kill goal to eliminate the unnecessary killing of companion animals via progressive & friendly animal-welfare programs and services.  Our vision is that our efforts will help transform our community to improve the quality of life for companion animals and greatly reduce the number of abandoned and homeless animals impounded and killed at our municipal shelter. We provide services and support to existing pet guardians who are suffering financial hardship via our pet food bank program and holding many low-cost vaccination clinics throughout the year.  We also assist our clients with spay/neuter and veterinary care when funding allows. We run a Second Chance Dogs & Cats program, which takes in former abuse-case animals, many of which are pit bull-type dogs, and helps find these dogs homes vs. the alternativegoing to the municipal shelter to be automatically put down.  APA recognizes many of these dogs need extra support to acclimate to life in a new home, so post-adoption training and support is provided to families willing to give these special dogs a home where they will never have to suffer neglect or abuse again. Lastly, in 2012, we started our DAPA! Campaign, which is an effort to pull as many at-risk dogs and cats from the municipal shelter, put them into foster homes, and then find them new homes.  This program started in May of this year, and to date, we have rescued hundreds of shelter animals and hope to grow that number significantly in 2013 until the day our community can reach a No Kill status (where we save more than 90% of all the animals that end up at our municipal shelter). We are located in Las Cruces, NM, but our services are offered to all those in Dona Ana County.

After a severe depressive episode, and a week treating his depression, the church and youth turned their backs on him! What the heck? Since he is autistic like and emotional delayed he was devastated at this loss. He sent a text expressing his hurt to the church and they filed a police report. Pastor Timothy said he was 'unstable'. He just got a high school diploma, rides up to 40 miles/ 3 times a week on his bike with his exercise psychologist, and is working with joining job corps. These people lowered him to a new depression level and then spat on him.

Society Of The Muse Of The Southwest	197255		/users/profile/257857	taosalan	Board Member	5	04/08/2014	SOMOS has been a mainstay in the artistic community of Taos for thirty plus years. Their focus is on mentoring young writers, providing a venue for local and regional writers to read and perform, storytelling as a way of passing on an aural tradition, and providing a venue for all these events including workshops. This month (April, 2014) SOMOS is celebrating National Poetry Month with reading of 37 poets over 12 days. All readings are free and held in the SOMOS performance space. The poets are all previously published and include our Native American, Hispanic, Asian and Anglo community of writers. SOMOS puts on a storytelling festival every year and two six week reading events featuring students,  local writers and a nationally known writer or writers. Being a member of the board it has allowed me to become friends with and support young writers and famous ones alike all in a little town in the back of beyond.  
United Way Of Otero County Inc	286985		/users/profile/377057	Michelle_B2	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	Together we forever change our community, with every dollar and every hour donated. The United Way of Otero County (www.uwoterocounty.org) has been bringing the people, businesses, nonprofits and local government together for the past 50 years in southern New Mexico.  Their mission is to impact the community in the areas of Education, Health and Income Stability.  I first volunteered for the organization in 2011 when I was asked to be on their Funds Allocations Committee.  It is a committee made up of 14-18 community volunteers that help to determine how to divide up the non-designated money that was raised through the campaign.  The reason it was so powerful for me was because I never realized what all our local non-profits did, the gaps that they were filling and the support the United Way was able to give them, monetarily and through advocating and bringing people together.  Over a 3 night period we heard from each of the agencies, their stories and missions were heartwarming and made me smile, but their need brought tears to my eyes and when it came down to it and we didn't have enough money to support each agency the way they needed, it was heartbreaking.  That experience changed me, I knew we needed to raise more money and find more volunteers to help change the future of our county, It was so powerful to me that I now work to raise money and awareness for the United Way of Otero County and advocate for the local nonprofits that work together with us to help our community to grow and thrive.  I know that my efforts in partnership with so many great people is making a huge difference and changing lives forever.  In fact last year we raised enough money to give each agency 100% of what they were requesting for the first time ever in our history.  I love bringing people together and making an impact on county and beyond.  #MyGivingStory grows exponentially every hour, everyday. #LiveUnitedOtero
Southwest Indian Foundation	142841	18	/users/profile/169458	Lisa133	Donor	5	11/26/2012	This organization has helped Native Americans to build themselves a better life.  They have helped them to build houses, supply schools with new stoves, and to help market the clothing, art, jewelry, food, etc. which they make.  Helping this foundation truly does help these people to look forward to a better future.
