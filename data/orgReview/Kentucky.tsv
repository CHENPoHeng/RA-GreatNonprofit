USA Cares Inc	323358		/users/profile/417682	trinismama	Client Served	5	02/17/2017	I was hesitant, initially, when I was told about USA Cares. I'm a disabled vet who had surgery on a service connected disability. Due to the surgery and recovery, I found trying to recover and work to pay my bills, a challenge. To this day, I'm still recovering. My surgery was in August. I contacted USA Cares, someone was assigned my claim and the rest is history. It did take sometime. I had to follow up a couple times. On the flip side to that. I also didn't take into consideration how many other people these wonderful people help. I am beyond grateful. Without their help, I don't know what I'd have done. Thank you SO much, USA Cares!!!
USA Cares Inc	322690		/users/profile/416678	Kia T.	Client Served	5	02/05/2017	USA Cares is the most incredible veterans assistance agency I have encountered. When I needed help they were there and made the process simple and stress free. My caseworker did not judge and was very helpful with any hickups I encountered. I was not afforded the opportunity to finish a valid Medical separation and had no time to plan how to cover bills. I had 10 days to do things most have 6-12 months to do. They expediently assisted with my car and insurance payment and that allowed me to focus more on seeking employment and preparing for an appeal of what happened while I was active duty.  I will surely let anyone I know who may need services and is eligible that there is an organization that keeps to its mission and comes through for this country's veterans. Thank you so much.

I am a recently separated veteran, without a job and needed help with my bills and mortgage. I submitted an application to USA Cares and within 24 hours I was contacted by a case officer -Marlo. She was very polite and genuinely willing to help. She went to work right away and provided prompt feedback along the way. Application was approved within a couple days and they went above and beyond to get us taken care of. We are really thankful to US Cares for their help and support to the veteran community. God Bless.

There needs to be more services that help out military members financially. Getting out of the military can be a smooth transition with proper planning, however life happens and there really are not a lot of places that will financially help you. Thank you.

I had transitioned from the Army with 9 years of honorable to the civilian life as a single dad of two sweet little boys Christian and Chase. I had set a plan prior to transitioning for job security but the area I lived in the area is low in jobs that would offer descent pay and  health insurance coverage. Thankfully I was able to serve my community again and have a career as a correction officer in the county i live in. Well the financial stability was not the same as when I was in the military. I began to make partial payments to keep up with bills but unfortunatetly I have fallen behind. I was in desperate need of help and I was at the end of the road to being Homless and having to figure out what I was going to do about my children. I called the VA Homless veteran hot line and explained to them that I was unfortunately unable to keep up with my rent and utilities due the change if income. I talk to veteran affairs representative who guide me with various organizations that could assist in which I was blessed by the help of Mrs.Marlo and the USA Care organization. My boys and I are blessed to be at ease through the help of this great organization. Thank you again Mrs. Marlo and USA Cares.

That bit of support means the world to us and can make all the difference in weather we make it or we don't. I cant remember the last time I had a hot shower and a home cooked meal from our stove.. And the anxiety of losing our electricity was keeping us both awake at night. Things I never thought we were taking for granted. Thank you so much for all that you do and I hope you are blessed as much as we feel at this moment. Rosetta was a blessing and was patient and very kind always responded quickly and with compassion.

USA Cares Inc	320188		/users/profile/412429	kevin040	Client Served	3	12/16/2016	Three stars is labeled as "meets expectations" which is exactly what USAC did. They helped me in my hour of need as I expected. They gave me clear and concise instructions, and made contact with me one business day after I submitted my request. As a veteran I had undergone a very rough patch after leaving the military. I became homeless, and struggled to find employment and piece my life back together. Right when I had finally begun to do so, a moment of opportunity presented itself and I changed jobs. The only big risk I took was not having a full paycheck for another two weeks after my car payment was due. While I was with my current place of employment, I was barely able to make car payments and had fallen behind on one. My case worker Rosetta took my case from the "Jobs Assistance Program" Department. From that point on, Rosetta made her initial contact with me on December 12 after I was informed of the referral to that department on December 9 (straddling a weekend). After my initial contact with Rosetta a questionnaire had to be filled out. THIS IS WHERE PROBLEMS BEGAN. I had a minor formatting issue to have answered and made numerous attempts to contact Rosetta. The response wouldn't come via phone call or email until the next day near the end of the afternoon. Throughout the process communication was slow and often, non-existent. She had left her phone number on her signature line during our email exchange and yet, during every phone call I made to her, there wasn't a single answer. I counted at least eleven different phone calls made to Rosetta through my phone records. None were answered throughout the entire week. The initial contact made was a failure as well from her to me, but I admit that was my inability to answer the phone at the time. But every return call I made was not answered. Email response was also slow, though it was there. The bottom line is this, they provide help. They provide assistance during a time of immense need. But it if you are in a circumstance that is tighter than mine as far as deadlines go and you've exhausted every other effort to find help elsewhere...this is not the place to go. They are there for you. They will help you if you absolutely need it. But it is abundantly clear that their case-workers lack a sense of urgency. A rough time on your behalf does not constitute an emergency on theirs.

I served in the 82nd Airborne for nine years and deployed to Iraq twice.  For the last eight years, I have had my fair share of struggles since I moved on from military service.  Like a lot of veterans, I had a harder than expected transition to civilian life.  Recently, I found myself in a very difficult situation that has been a big stressor lately.  Without the help of USA Cares and all of those who support their mission, my family would have been in a bad situation.With the help of our caseworker, Susan, we are now able to recover from our crisis and get back on our feet.

I was hospitalized on 05 October 2016 until present and also experiencing extreme financial difficulty. I would very much like to give Ms. Darrika, my Emergency Assistance Manager, KUDOS for her outstanding above-and-beyond service. She bent over backward to throw me a life jacket when I was drowning. Up until recently I've felt invisible and the way Ms Darrika helped me showed me she SAW me even when I was at my lowest. Sometimes a helping hand or small gesture can save a life and not know it so thank you Ms Darrika for all you've done.V/r,Danneise

I requested assistance from them for my power bill due to being unemployed for months and my request was denied. I am disappointed but not angry at the denial. I  am however disappointed in the sham of a reason for denial.  They said I do not qualify because they only offer assistance for veterans within 4 months of discharge.  Not only does it not say that on the application,  do they really believe that combat veterans suffering from PTSD or physical disabilities,  only have issues within 4 months of discharge!

I  completed the degree program in december 2014 ,I was on educational allowance then from my GI Bill,but abruptly after I finished the program and  graduated,all my financial assistance ceased . I was at a financial loss for the past three months as  I wasnt receiving any income. I had to use whatever little I had on my bank account and   tax refund to make up for the bills but it wasn't enough because I still had mortgage to pay. Thats when I decide to call USA CARES. The program  helped me get back in good standing with my utility bills.  I am currently on the hiring list to start a job that I desperately needs. I am very  grateful  and appreciative to    USA CARES INC for all the assistance provided. I would always remember this and would one day myself donate some money to the fund to help veteran families desperately in need.

This organization truly cares about the soldiers and veterans that need a hand-up in this crazy, hard-to-get-by world. They have exceeded my expectations by a long shot, compared to most other veteran friendly agencies. There are so many letters, cards, and photos from families pouring their gratitude out to this company for their hard work and dedication to serving those that served us. I never see a commercial on T.V. like other non-profits, because they reach out personally and make sure their money is used for it's intended purpose and not for advertisement or hiring a celebrity. This company takes care of our brave men and women across the nation. I only wish there were more out there like this.
USA Cares Inc	206952	2	/users/profile/269464	HonestJane	Donor	5	07/22/2014	Upon reading the 2 complaints listed in the comment section,  I understand that USA Cares has denied some families due to their guidelines, however there are no non-profit organizations that do not require specific guidelines in order to assist. I have witnessed where USA Cares have served thousands of veterans, service members, and their families. They are audited every year to "check" what they are doing is accurate and not a scam. On their website, they have their financial statement available to any who want to see it. I think this organization is very transparent on what they do and how they spend their funds. There will always be a few disgruntled clients that did not get what they felt like they deserved, but the organization has to follow what it was designed to do. They have impacted many families and veterans.

USA Cares Inc	128929		/users/profile/169071	lefteye02	General Member of the Public	1	10/25/2012	Their name is really ironic since they claim that they care. Im a vet who is about to get evicted and get put out in the street. They had claim that they had reviewed my case with me, which they didn't do. Basically, it was voicemail. They had left me a message to get in contact with them and I did call a few days later, only to receive a voicemail, which I had left. Then, a few hours later, the rep had left a voicemail stating that my situation doesn't fall under their "guidelines", but their email claimed that they are concerned and they would do their best to meet the needs of every service member or military family. So obviously in my case, they cannot help me. All I know is, I will not donate anything to this charity and will urge others not to do so.

I cannot understand how 2 combat veterans who are struggling due to job lay off and the other dealing with severe PTSD do not qualify. Basically the only way they will help you is if for some reason you didn't get paid by the army due to an error on their part and if you have been reimbursed which military eventually does you still do not qualify. I think someone should look into this charities finances and where the money is going because its a struggle to qualify for any kind of assistance with USA cares.

Colonel Oliver North were in Louisville to speak during the springtime. I asked each of them seperately which organization I should try to get involved with. Both of these men immediately urged me to seek out  USA Cares ,which is just 40 minutes from my home in Louisville.  I solicited a few people I knew on the Board and within a year I was a Board member. I can say from first hand experience the Board and the staff exist to serve military families who are in financial crisis. Every effort is made to raise more and more money which will go to these deserving families. Of all the non-profits I have been involved with USA Cares is the most focused on executing their mission.

It seems as though the Veteran Affairs has no respect for my service to this country. USACares helped me with getting my vehicle fixed. They have sent a credit card payment of 630.00 to Choice Transmissions to fix all four of my brakes and my hydrolics system. I had to call and call, and answer excorable questions about my health issues. I couldn't get the needed immediate assistance, having to get an estimate on what was needed to make my car safe. I had to borrow 60 dollars from a classmate to get the 630.00 allotted to me from the the organization. I am thankful Dennis Williams

Leading up to my admital to the hospital, and during my stay, my wife and I have amassed a sizeable amount of debt because of my inability to work, and this lead to us having to triage our expenses to the bare minimum of rent and food.  Because of this, we were unaible to make payments on our vehicle, and we were at the very brink of having it repossessed.  I sought help at my VA, and I was directed to USA Cares.  Within days, a patient advocate (Mr. Forest), was working on our behalf, and we were able to keep our car.

This assistance means so much to us as we are struggling to make ends meet with both my husband and I unemployed and facing an upcoming deployment of my husband.  We have three children and it is nice knowing there are people out there that care about the helping others.  If we could do the same, we would.  Thank you again :)

My husband suffers from PTSD among other service related injuries and when he was admitted into the VA Hospital, we weren't sure how we would cope without his income. USA Cares came through for us in a major way and with such urgency! They are truly angels from above :)

USA Cares Inc	56328		/users/profile/58756	veteranwhocares	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/03/2010	This is one of if not the best non-profits in the United States; designed to assist post 9-11 veterans in need. There are guidelines set but if you fall within the guidelines the service is prompt, friendly and most caring. There is no non-profit that can assist everyone but USA Cares is very professional and caring for every client. If direct assistance is not available they will attempt to find indirect assistance. Overall USA Cares is a wonderful organization.

USA Cares Inc	25745	7	/users/profile/26746	'splain to me Lucy!	Donor	1	01/16/2010	Before making a contribution I first came to GuideStar to review the USA Cares financials.  Although their website gives sketchy information about their "assistance", like running a call center to take calls from military families - I really don't see how this would differ than programs already found on military installations today. I would prefer an exact listing of the military families who actually recieved assistance with their testimony.
USA Cares Inc	19212	8	/users/profile/20446	rurik70	Professional with expertise in this field	1	10/22/2009	USA Cares is supposed to be empathetic towards military service members and stress causing situations.USA Cares does not understand that a veteran will tough out for prolonged periods of time and stressful situation.USA Cares criteria of time frame regarding financial assistance is not a sound guideline.If they wish to truly take a veterans life stressors in to consideration, they need to realize that life is not shaped by a cookie cutter.

Active Heroes Inc.	304455		/users/profile/395621	shnmrnf	Volunteer	1	09/14/2016	A lot of funds were raised with very little to show for it and a very delayed output.  Those that put the most in to earning were taken advantage of.  The "leadership"  is severely lacking.  After a big board shakeup we haven't heard anything in the form of positive changes and there has been little to no activity.

Active Heroes Inc.	304202	1	/users/profile/395374	serendipity69	General Member of the Public	5	09/13/2016	I have had the pleasure in participating in a few ruck march's with Active Heroes on the marathon route in Boston.  I would have a hard time fully describing the true impact they have had on my life.  They are life changing, bonding experiences. My first year I was lucky enough to be lead by Justin Fitch.  An absolutely phenomenal man with a drive, passion and dedication that few possess.  In the following years and at the ruck in his memory the march continued to surpass my expectations.  I went in not really knowing what to expect but wanting to show my support for those who protect, serve and sacrifice for this great country.  The morning started off with a motivational speech and then I watched 22 people take a knee representing the 22 lives a day that are lost to Veteran suicide.  In the moment of silence that followed the power of what we were about to  take on and the reason for it hit me.  I saw countless yellow ribbons, photographs of loved ones: husbands, wives, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters, friends,  fathers and mothers pinned to the back of rucks and being carried.  American flags were proudly displayed.  I asked people to tell me stories about the people in the photographs.  I wanted to know what they were like.  Hear the tellers favorite memories of the ones they lost.  There were tears, laughs but most importantly there was a sense of camaraderie.The logistics and planning that went into making this day a HUGE success were incredible.  Check in was easy and they kept the group moving along as a comfortable pace.  There were planned stops and a follow camper for anyone needing a break.  We had police escorts most of the way and a planned stop at a VFW for lunch and a small 'service'.  There were always people checking in to see how you were doing or if you needed anything.  If you were ever short of motivation to continue walking all you needed to do was look left or right and you find it right next to you.  We walked down Boylston St towards the marathon finish line as a group. Finishing the same way we started.  The hugs, tears and smiles were overwhelming and I knew without a doubt that I would continue to return to this amazing event every year possible.  Come be a part of a truly remarkable experience!

Through national community based events and fundraisers, the people who work non-stop at Active Heroes have provided a base to raise awareness, a retreat center for veterans AND their families. This group has selflessly made sure that over eighty cents $.80USD of every dollar $1USD goes to directly providing veterans with multiple benefits and stress relief. Speaking from personal experience here, this organization helped to save my life and inspired me to reach out and do the same for other veterans.-Bryan

Over the years I have watched them grown their dream & I'm so proud of them, they bring me to happy tears.

Active Heroes Inc.	213384		/users/profile/276569	Catherine53	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/04/2014	Active Heroes is an amazing organization with the most important mission of working with active military,  veterans, and families. They provide help and support in the areas of integration and coping skills; physical and mental health issues;  as well as promoting awareness of veterans' issues such as suicide. At least 22 veterans commit suicide each day and that must end! Active Heroes plays an active role in trying to reverse this horrific trend by raising awareness and funds to help those veterans and families in need.

Active Heroes Inc.	213356		/users/profile/276540	Jorge8	Advisor	5	09/04/2014	Active Heroes has partnered with Sullivan University to design over a dozen unique seminars for military families at the Active Heroes Retreat. The Seminars are sixty to ninety minute discussions including skill developments such as resume building, conflict management, budgeting and business management. This partnership produced a successful Resilience Training for members of the Kentucky National Guard a few months back and it was the beginning of some great things to come. Without a doubt, this non-profit has a positive impact in our community. Thank you so much for supporting the troops Active Heroes!
Active Heroes Inc.	213348		/users/profile/276523	Martha27	General Member of the Public	5	09/04/2014	This organization has opened my eyes to something I never knew about.  I never knew that 22 veterans commit suicide everyday. I have had the opportunity to volunteer a couple times to help raise money for them. I enjoyed the 2 times I have been able to help give back. Every one needs to know about this organization. I don't trust alot of charities but I truly believe in Active Heroes. I love giving back to those who have given me my freedom.  I've even had daughters and boyfriend volunteer for them and I will continue to volunteer as long as I can. 
Active Heroes Inc.	213347	1	/users/profile/276531	Tankrat	General Member of the Public	5	09/04/2014	The things this organization does to help volunteers is above abd beyond reproach. I've witnessed them go out of their way numerous times to ensure that veterans needs are taking care of. What's more, they include veterans of EVERY campaign or conflict, as well as THE FAMILIES of these veterans. They understand that the family suffers and is affected just as much as the veteran.

I have had the honor of working with this amazing organization. People who selflessly give their time and energy to help families of the military.

Active Heroes is the classiest of class act organizations with amazing volunteers and leadership that epitomizes Selfless-Service.   Definitely worthy of support and financial contributions.   Donate time, money, and/or energy with a peace of mind that you ARE helping to make the world of our Service Members, Veterans and Families a better place to be.

A couple years ago, via my business, I partnered with Active Heroes to provide a product and successfully helped raise funds for them.  This organization has an incredible team and has so many qualities that larger organizations lack.  The founders are personally involved.  They aren't desk jockeys with enormous salaries.  I am proud to have helped Active Heroes and I encourage others to support them as well.

Volunteer	5	11/12/2012	I have been volunteering at the Primate Rescue Center for two years now and hope to be able to continue for years to come. I've fallen in love with the chimps and monkeys and all of their unique personalities. Knowing them personally makes it even more rewarding that I may play at least a small role in improving their lives. It is a honor to work with such a dedicated care staff. They go above and beyond to enrich the lives and health of all those in their care. Their respect and love for the primates can be seen in everything they do for them.
Primate Rescue Center	255212	1	/users/profile/343589	cynson7	Volunteer	5	09/07/2015	I have been a volunteer here for a number of years.   Faithful devotion to the wellbeing of the residents is evident the moment you see the sanctuary.  The staff is a group of professional, caring and dedicated people who truly create a safe haven and home for for these primates. I am proud to be a volunteer. 
Primate Rescue Center	254321	2	/users/profile/342654	Rebecca_banks17	Volunteer	5	08/29/2015	I was introduced to the PRC in June of 2015 when I was accepted for a spot in their summer internship program. I applied for the internship to fulfill a co-op credit that I needed for my undergrad degree in Animal Studies. However, from the start I knew that my experience at the PRC would mean much more to me than a college credit. Not only did the workers fully involve me, along with the other interns, in all of the daily routines--including feeding, cleaning, enrichment and other activities that sporadically came about--they really welcomed and encouraged me.Of course, working with the primates was the best part of it all. With 11 chimpanzees and nearly 50 smaller apes and monkeys on the facility, it was amazing to observe how each resident differed. Having never worked in a facility with exotic animals before, I was completely fascinated. I mostly became familiar with the chimpanzees because they are housed close to where the interns work. During my time there, I observed many primate behaviors such as grooming and hooting, and I also learned about the dominance pattern within the group. Seeing these behaviors first-hand definitely sparked an interest in primates within me, and I plan to continue researching them. My experience at the PRC benefited me in so many ways. Obviously, I got some first-hand experience with primates and learned a lot about them. I also, in turn, learned a lot about myself and what I would like to do with my career after college. When I tell people that I am an animal studies major, their first response is usually, "Really...what jobs can you get with that?" The workers at the PRC made me feel like there is hope for my degree, and reassured me that there are jobs out there for people who have an interest in animals. My internship at the PRC reassured my desire to work at a rehabilitation facility for exotic animals after I graduate. I wouldn't trade my time at the PRC for anything, and I'm so glad that such a wonderful non-profit exists so close to home.

Primate Rescue Center	253321	1	/users/profile/341497	tweber	Volunteer	5	08/18/2015	Ten years ago, I lived and volunteered at the PRC for almost two months. I saw firsthand how well the primates there are treated. Cages are regularly cleaned, chow is always supplemented with fresh fruits and vegetables and enrichment is always provided. Moreover, great care is taken to ensure the safety not only of the primates but of their human caretakers as well. I have been a supporter of the PRC ever since because I know my charitable donations are being well spent!
Primate Rescue Center	253279		/users/profile/225641	LizM	Donor	5	08/18/2015	The PRC is one of the best nonprofit organization I've ever seen.  They are VERY dedicated to the well-being and happiness of  their rescued residents.  They utilize their funds for the primates not high salaries.  They keep employees down to a bare minimum and use volunteers extensively.   The founders even add their own funds as needed to care for the primates.   They are perpetual advocates for the well-being & ethical treatment of  all primates.   Enough words cannot be said about this organization!!!
Primate Rescue Center	170280		/users/profile/225641	LizM	Volunteer	5	09/18/2013	I Do A Lot Of Volunteering For A Lot Of Organizations.  I Have Never Encountered An Executive Staff Before That Eats, Lives & Breathes Their Organization (And The Support Of Others That do Similar Work) Like ThIs One Does.  Total Dedication Is An Understatement!  They Are Even Mindful Of Human Impact On Their Residents So Much That They Only Open Their Doors Once A Year For A Private, Invitation-Only Fundraiser In Order To minimalize Stress On Their Primates.  This Facility, Like No Other That I Have Ever Encountered (Human Or Animal Oriented), Puts The Health, Comfort, Well-Being And Happiness Of Souls Under Their Care Above All Else.  April Is Sooooo Dedicated That She Even Networks With Other Primate Facilities To Find Homes For Abused Or Neglected Primates Across The Nation.  She Is An Advocate For Primates 24/7/365.  She Is Dedicated Not Only To The Animals ThemSelves But To The Education Of The Public That Primates Are Not Domesticated Pets In An Effort To Prevent Future Need For Rescue.  This Facility Is Ever Mindful Of The Safety Of Their PrIMates And Staff.  Preservation Of Quality Of Life Is A Definite Priority Here.  I Can't Say Enough About The Quality Of This Facility!!!

All the staff is knowledgeable and very caring. The primates and monkeys are happy and care free. It is obvious that they are well cared for and respected. The various housing for them are neat and clean. April and her staff are top notch!
Primate Rescue Center	248057		/users/profile/90827	ErikaFleury	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/10/2015	The Primate Rescue Center is a star - they know what they're doing and they do it well. The staff has heart, compassion and the smarts to give rescued primates the very best possible sanctuary life. They change the lives of so many deserving animals. It's a beautiful thing. This sanctuary is a leader due to its' history of making real change in the animal advocacy world. I am honored to be affiliated with the Primate Rescue Center, and I hope to be working with them for many more years to come.
Primate Rescue Center	209658		/users/profile/90827	ErikaFleury	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/08/2014	This organization is one of the best out there. Everything they do is for the benefit of their primate residents. It is heartwarming to see these animals, who have often been through much trauma, live out the rest of their lives in peace, comfort, and while getting the physical and mental stimulation they need. I also admire how the PRC remains involved and active in helping to change the legal and cultural issues that cause sanctuaries to be needed in the first place. The PRC is a prime example of a true animal advocacy organization.
Primate Rescue Center	82411		/users/profile/90827	ErikaFleury	Volunteer	5	03/16/2011	I first became involved with the Primate Rescue Center (PRC) when I wrote the sanctuary a letter, seeking information on how to prepare myself to work in the primatology field. Imagine my surprise when the PRC's director, April Truitt, personally called me and not only spent valuable time answering all my questions, but also invited me to volunteer there for a week! I never dreamed of being offered such an opportunity, so I snatched it up and after continued education and research, I found myself volunteering at the PRC within a few short months. I was amazed at the friendliness of the staff at PRC, their incredibly professional methods for caring for their primates, but most of all,  I was impressed with the true care and empathy the staff had for each individual primate living within their walls. Staff at the PRC understood the varied histories and experiences of the intelligent, sensitive primates who were lucky enough to live out the rest of their lives at the sanctuary. Every system involved in the daily care of the primates had clearly been perfectly engineered for efficiency, cleanliness, and economy so as best to maintain a wonderful quality of life for the primates. The wisdom and experiences of April Truitt and her staff is invaluable, and I will forever be grateful to have had such a memorable foray into the primatology field.  Not living in the Kentucky area, my time volunteering at the PRC was inevitably cut short when I had to fly back to my home in New England. However, my experiences at the PRC changed me, and I know it is their professionalism and love for primates that inspired me to continue making a difference in the primatology field.  I donate to the Primate Rescue Center every chance I can, because I know my dollars go directly towards a good life for primates that have lived through so much, and deserve only the best. I thank the PRC, their staff, and yes, their nonhuman primates as well, for giving me the chance to join them, albeit for a short time. I only wish I lived closer so I could be there in person, not just in spirit, every day to witness their wonderful work with such special animals.
Primate Rescue Center	216539		/users/profile/280036	bethinthesun	Volunteer	5	09/23/2014	Outstanding non-profit for which I proudly volunteer. There is a shared kindred spirit and devotion to the daily care of animals that desperately needed rescued and desperately needed a home. This organization is also eager to educate the community so everyone can make a difference in primate lives.  
Primate Rescue Center	215440		/users/profile/278852	Mary286	Volunteer	5	09/17/2014	When I retired from another nonprofit, the Primate Rescue Center was where I chose to volunteer.  I have been volunteering now  for almost 2 years, once a week. This center is a wonderful place to be ! The folks at the Center have their priorities in order with the care of the primates being the number one duty of everyone, staff and volunteer. They are very caring with the volunteers as well as the animals, training volunteers  for all duties needed. I have always had a love for primates and have learned so much from observing them! I feel fortunate to have this opportunity right in my back yard !

I have been volunteering there once a week foralmost eight years.  The care staff there are exceptional. The Primates get the best of care.  It is a beautiful place for the Primates to live the rest of their life out.  I have learned so much from volunteering there.  The care staff has so much passion for helping the primates. I truly love everything about the PRC and feel I am so fortunate to be a part of it. Thanks so much to the PRC for giving the Primates a good and happy life. Its sad to think of where they would be if not for the PRC.  
Primate Rescue Center	213060		/users/profile/276184	TiaHildebrandt	Volunteer	5	09/02/2014	My experience at the PRC as a summer intern was unforgettable.  Not only did I expand my knowledge of husbandry care activities, but I was also able to get creative and learn how to enrich the animals in new and exciting ways.  I am extremely grateful for the opportunity I received this summer to work with not only great animals but a wonderful staff as well!  The caregivers and volunteers assisted me in the personal growth that I have experienced this summer.  I loved learning how to properly interact with apes versus monkeys as these skills will surely be of use in my future.  The PRC residents receive the utmost care from the staff and are surrounded by a stimulating environment.  I am sincerely glad to say that I interned at the PRC this summer as it is a truly wonderful place! :)
Primate Rescue Center	210987		/users/profile/273810	spencer_mattingly	Volunteer	5	08/17/2014	The PRC is truly a one-of-a-kind place.  I feel very fortunate to have spent the summer here as an intern.  The care for the animals is above and beyond exceptional, and the staff and volunteers are all extremely kind and welcoming.  For me, not only did I feel like I was helping out animals in need, but also I learned a great deal as well.  I got to see first hand the interactions of many chimpanzees with one another in a group dynamic, as well as dominance and display behaviors, lip smacking in monkeys, and even a routine vasectomy performed (by a veterinarian) on one of the newest members.  Overall I consider my time there a blessing, and would rate the Rescue Center and its members as a top-notch organization.     
Primate Rescue Center	193913		/users/profile/253313	Isabella J.	Volunteer	5	02/07/2014	By far one of the best opportunities to volunteer I have ever experienced.

Love PRC!

But the stuffed ones were no comparison with the real, living, beautiful primates that two of them were able to see during the center's open house.  The work the PROC does to save these "babies" is overwhelming, heartwarming, and priceless.
Primate Rescue Center	171002		/users/profile/226488	CaseyLynn143	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/21/2013	I was fortunate enough to be able to visit this primate sanctuary during the recent NAPSA workshop and was absolutely blown away.  The habitats for the monkeys and chimpanzees were so clean and FULL of enrichment items. The staff truly loves and cares for all the primates there and it was evident.  I feel so lucky to have been able to see such a beautiful place, but the faces on the monkeys and chimps were the best- happy, confident, and loved. A big thank you to Primate Rescue Center for stepping in and helping these unwanted exotic pets and used biomedical subjects and to be a place of healing and hope. 
Primate Rescue Center	170828		/users/profile/226272	rebeccaandsophie	Donor	5	09/20/2013	I learned of this organization after voting in a chimp art contest.  Although I'm involved in a number of animal rescue/rights charities (ASPCA, HSUS, etc), this was my first exposure to a sanctuary that focused on Primates.  The literature that I've received has been enlightening and I'm looking forward to learning more about the Primate Rescue Center and improving the welfare of Primates in general.
Primate Rescue Center	170253		/users/profile/225613	jocat3	General Member of the Public	5	09/18/2013	I participated in a chimp art contest to vote which one is the most artistic.  All of the chimps were rescues and in various locations.  The most amazing work is being done by these primate rescue centers by taking in these poor animals who have suffered horribly due to inhumane testing in labs.  It breaks my heart to think these intelligent and talented chimps endured such pain and probable isolation.  The fact that some where taken from their natural habitats or born in the labs and subjected to this testing their entire lives is a crime.  Bless these people who are caring for these magnificant animals who have suffered way too long.  It is probably a hard adjustment for them and with patience and love they can finally live out their lives in freedom.

Anyone who renders aid, comfort, and love to innocent creatures who are helpless, defenseless, and powerless in the face of humans, and is willing to do what it takes to rescue these animals and give them the wonderful, happy life they deserve is worthy of any and all help that can be given.  Please keep up the great work, and know that your efforts are recognized and appreciated. 
Primate Rescue Center	170237		/users/profile/225584	LuckyMonkey	General Member of the Public	5	09/18/2013	This charity is the light at the end of tunnel and for most of these emotional creatures it is a dark tunnel.Until animals are freed from the oppression of laboratories, this is a step in establishing what these animals need and shouldn't ever experience. rather than being disgarded criminally as clinical waste these animals are given a second chance, from whatever their background maybe. This is a worthy and indeed needed charity and I commend the emotional intelligence behind it, Thank-you from me and the wonderful primates that you have saved.

I hate to imagine what would happen to monkeys in need in our region if the Primate Rescue Center was not in existence. 100% of donations are used for the care of the monkeys and chimpanzees, it is nice to know that the funds are being put to such a great cause. You can give with confidence!  
Primate Rescue Center	161613		/users/profile/214366	Nancy102	Donor	5	06/27/2013	I had the privilege to visit the primate center this year and was thoroughly impressed. I love how in the best interest of the animals, they do not allow regular visits to the center, but instead work to allow the animals to have the most natural experience possible. Also, they are creative in finding toys that the primates will enjoy and use that as a way for people to contribute to the center.

I wouldn't take anything for them!  This place is Heaven on earth for our chimps and monkeys, etc.  Thank you, Primate Rescue Center for being you....with your zeal and love for the animals happy life there.  I'll love you forever!

It's so important to spread the word that primates should not be made pets or used in experiments or entertainment. I'm glad the Primate Rescue Center gives these animals a healthy, peaceful home.
Primate Rescue Center	160526		/users/profile/212836	jeffers	General Member of the Public	5	06/13/2013	The Primate Rescue Center is an important and wonderful organization. Its mission is to alleviate the suffering of primates wherever it occurs. The Center currently provides lifetime care for 11 chimpanzees and over 40 monkeys who have found a safe haven there. In addition, the PRC collaborates with a nationwide network of primate sanctuaries to rescue and relocate animals in need. I've visited the facilities at several Open House opportunities and was extremely impressed by the facilities, the grounds, the obvious good health of the animals, and the affinity the animals had for PRC staff. 
Primate Rescue Center	159136		/users/profile/211257	DennisParrishFineArt.com	Donor	5	05/31/2013	Primate Rescue Center does wonderful work by alleviating the suffering of primates purchased as pets and those housed in horrific conditions around the globe.  We've known April and Clay Miller for years (when Gizmo was new to the family).  Anything the Miller's do, they do 110%.   Having been supporters of the Jane Goodall Institute (JGI) for a number of years, it was a simple choice to navigate to, and support, a facility that's in our own local community.  This month we attended the Members Only Spring Gala and were able to see first hand how our and the support of others helps the center and it's residents. To April, Clay, and all the volunteers, keep up the great work!

I spent that summer working with the PRC staff and getting to be a part of their daily efforts to provide a loving, fulfilling home to these rescued primates.  The reality for primates in America right now is that we need more places like the PRC for them to go in peace in a respectful loving environment where they are encouraged to live their days socially and happily. I am thankful that we have places like the PRC to set the standard and give fellow sanctuaries something to strive for. 
Primate Rescue Center	136518	2	/users/profile/182445	Kathy84	General Member of the Public	5	11/09/2012	The Primate Rescue Center Is a wonderful place. Primates rescued from all over the US wind up here. Most have a story. Each are treated with dignity. The enclosures are made to exacting standards, to maximize the comfort, enjoyment, and safety of the residence. The food is balanced to meet the residence's dietary needs. The center also tries to educate the general public about the different residence, and why it is not a good idea to try to make pets out of these creatures. As a child, my Grandmother rescued an abused Chimpanzee named Tammy. She had issues caused by the abuse. Back then, there were no Primate rescue facilities close by. The only offers to take her were research labs, to us, that was not an option. My mother  , who knew about the true nature of Chimpanzees, allowed This chimp to finish out her days in an area that was safe both for her, and humans. It was not an easy task, to keep her well fed, and her enclosure clean. It took a lot of hard work. When she passed away many years later, it was a sad time for us all. I have seen first hand how the Primate center operates it's facility. The enclosures are clean, no easy task to be sure. the different residence run the gambit when it comes to Primates. The personel do a great job researching the needs of individuals in their care.  Someday,  i hope they raise the necessary funds to have a full fledged visitors center for educational purposes. This Center is vital to the rescue and rehabilitaion of these animals. It provides a vital service. The Staff work long hours with little compensation. They have dedicated themselves to the well being of their many charges.
Primate Rescue Center	136430	1	/users/profile/182344	lstrong	Volunteer	5	11/09/2012	I have had both employed and volunteer working experience at the Primate Rescue Center over the past 5 years and I gave absolutely nothing negative to say. I am never surprised when I visit the center year after year for the Open House in May in terms of the friendliness of the staff and most importantly, the care that is given to the residents at the PRC. Each animal is extremely well cared for and given the enrichment he or she deserves. Many of the residents came from horrid living situations before joining the PRC crew and while it is impossible to reserve the damage done to them in their past, it is obvious that the primates know they have a bright future at the PRC. I know without a doubt that the staff at the PRC takes into consideration EVERY detail necessary to maintain such an upstanding and recognized facility and I'm certain that will remain the truth for many, many years to come! Thanks for all you do!

The primates who are fortunate enough to reside in this sanctuary receive the best possible enrichment, diet, veterinary care. The animals, most of whom have been abused or neglected in the past , are able to live out the remainder of their lives in a nurturing and comfortable environment.

A facility and organization of this size requires sound operational practices ranging from care and feeding, maintainance, financial management, project management, fundraising and staff/volunteer management.  The operations and leadership at the Primate Rescue Center are top notch and highly efficient.  What's more impressive still is how these strong practices are just the starting point for the dedication and commitment shown by April Truitt and her staff to the animals in there care and the advocacy of animal rights across the world.

I have witnessed over the years is the worker, Eileen, Melanie, and Nikki pour their heart and soul into each animal.  They know and understand the hardship they have been through.  It is a very amazing place.  Each primate has a story, it is truly a miracle to watch how they act when they first come to Primate Center and a year later. They are much better.

Primate Rescue Center	134068		/users/profile/179837	Diane54	General Member of the Public	5	11/06/2012	I learned of Primate Rescue Center several years ago when, as a journalist, I interviewed the director for a radio story. I was so taken with the commitment and professionalism of the place.  Always, the primates come first. They are not handled by humans, except as necessary for their health. In other words, they are allowed to be as wild as they can be, within safe bounds. To think that we have this amazing sanctuary here in a rural part of Kentucky makes me very proud. No longer a journalist, I now support the center as much as I can.

The staff and volunteers are dedicated to the philosophy that the center was built on which includes their mission statement of caring and providing sanctuary for rescued primates.  This also includes working to educate the public about the laws to end the pet trade in the US and abroad.  My experience as a volunteer has taught me a great deal and I am appreciative to be able to be a part of this agency.

Primate Rescue Center	133920		/users/profile/179682	nrhnascar	General Member of the Public	5	11/05/2012	Great place for all primates. It's a wonderful place where abused and neglected primates go when they have nothing else. I especially like that it isn't open to the public. It isn't about people comming to see cute chimps and other primates, but a place where they can be themselves. 
Primate Rescue Center	133907		/users/profile/79233	lunja	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/05/2012	I had the honor of meeting April Truitt, founder and director of Primate Rescue Center when she contacted me about providing sanctuary for 5 chimpanzees she was instrumental in rescuing.  I reluctantly agreed to meet her at a facility where they were being temporarily housed.  Although, emotionally wrapped up in their heartbreaking story - I did not feel I had the experience or facility to house these very, very strong animals.  I said to her, it only makes sense that since you were the one to give them their freedom from the terrible conditions in which you found them - that YOU should take them.  Long story short, she did just that and did a bang up job with their care.  I went to visit the facility after the chimps were settled into Primate Rescue Center and I was blown away by the professional housing and the equally professional staff and volunteers dedicated to the care of these and other primates.  Ms Truitt also does her part in trying to stem the flow of the exotic pet trade - as if she doesn't have enough to do with the center.  Kudos to all she does for our furry relatives.

Primate Rescue Center	82997		/users/profile/91811	Alyssum P.	Volunteer	5	03/23/2011	The Primate Rescue Center is run with precision and care.   I have seen animals arrive on death's doorstep, then fill out and flourish at PRC, enjoying life as a monkey (or chimp, or gibbon, or baboon) like they had never been able to experience previously. The caretakers are chosen with care by the owner.  Attention to health (mental as well as physical) of the animals is a priority.  The animals are fed with proper diets according to their species, they are offered enrichment activities regularly, and the grounds are kept clean and organized.  Volunteers there pour their soul into helping out.  As someone who went on to study veterinary medicine and environmental policy, I learned a great deal in my time as a volunteer/worker there.  
Primate Rescue Center	82362		/users/profile/90755	Julia Elmer	Volunteer	5	03/16/2011	I was so lucky to volunteer at the Primate Rescue Center in 2009 and 2010 while living in Cincinnati, Ohio. This place is so great that I used to drive two hours and change each way just to spend time there! The caretakers are very committed, and I've seen just how far they can stretch their resources to make sure the monkeys and chimps in their care have all that they need. It's an expensive undertaking to run a center like this, and yet we need more of them across the country. Everyone is firmly committed to educating the public about the fact that monkeys and chimps do not make good pets. That education - and that understanding - are the only ways in which we are ever going to stop the trade in wild animals. For anyone who seeks to understand one of the reasons why a place like Primate Rescue exists, I highly recommend reading _Animal Underworld_ by Alan Green. I live in New England now, but I look forward to visiting the PRC again soon. It's a place that leaves its mark on all who are lucky to be a part of it.
Primate Rescue Center	82061		/users/profile/90048	ellen	Professional with expertise in this field	5	03/12/2011	Ten years ago I began volunteering at the Primate Rescue Center (PRC) while attending college in Lexington, KY. As a volunteer I cleaned enclosures, chopped fruits and vegetable and made toys for the dozens of monkeys and 11 chimpanzees calling the PRC home. Although the animals at the PRC come from different backgrounds, they all have one thing in common -- though in the past they have suffered much at the hands of humans, they now lead happy and healthy lives thanks to the dedicated people at the PRC. Not only has the PRC had such a positive effect on the lives of countless animals, it has also had a huge impact on the people who are fortunate enough to spend time there. My favorite part of volunteering was watching the animals, and my fascination with their behavior quickly turned to a career. I earned a PhD in psychology and my area of research is primate cognition -- how monkeys and apes think and learn. As an expert in primate behavior I can truly say that the care the animals receive at the primate rescue center is second to none. 
Primate Rescue Center	81971		/users/profile/89918	glyons	Volunteer	5	03/11/2011	Donald is a 200 pound chimpanzee that loves pineapple, leeks and frozen yogurt treats. Despite the fact that he is the alpha male of his group he is kind, soft spoken and rules with a gentle hand. He is all this in spite of his horrible past as a household pet kept for years in what became a concrete prison of isolation in Georgia with 3 other chimps who were rescued and now romp happily together at the Primate Rescue Center in Nicholasville Kentucky. Along with the caregivers and the other volunteers like myself I help care for the 11 chimpanzees and 40 monkeys here at the PRC. Being a volunteer at the Primate Rescue Center has become a huge part of who I am. Here at this 30 acre sanctuary these monkeys and apes who have been victims of laboratories and private pet owners have found second chances at happy lives. As a volunteer I am an example to my two children that one person can make a difference in the world and as a teacher I encourage my students through my actions to become active, responsible members of their communities. Through my example I can help foster empathy for my animal friends in which we all share the earth. Since I began volunteering at the Primate Rescue Center I feel I have become part of the solution and joined in a network of thousands of people working to make the world safer and more humane for living creatures. And in my opinion you'll never find a more grateful comrade than an animal. Especially someone like my good friend Donald! 
Primate Rescue Center	81968		/users/profile/89915	valo	Volunteer	5	03/11/2011	I started working at the Primate Rescue Center in Nicholasville, Ky., in March 2010. I work every Saturday, from 9 a.m., until we finish for the day, usually after 5 p.m. The center was founded by a Nicholasville couple back in 1987 as a rescue site for primates who were living in research and entertainment conditions, or for families who purchased the animals when they were young and quickly discovered they were not appropriate as pets. Today, the center is home to over 40 monkeys, 11 chimpanzees, a baboon and a Siamang Gibbon, plus a pygmy goat, a burrow, many peacocks, and Tigger, the dog. As a volunteer, I am not permitted to have any physical contact with the animals, but I am able to enjoy interacting with them from a safe distance. My tasks when there include chopping fruits and vegetables for the primates, making their daily meal, cleaning animal enclosures, seasonal gardening and grounds work, and sorting donated produce from local grocery stores. The PRC employs four full-time caretakers who work directly with the primates. The PRC is not open to the public in order to maintain the sanctuary for the residents. The monkeys are adorable, and fun to watch, but my favorites are the 11 adult chimps, with whom I play hide and seek, run races along the outdoor enclosure fencing, and just enjoy watching play together in their beautiful, peaceful Kentucky home.

Primate Rescue Center	25401	8	/users/profile/26398	Melissa	Volunteer	5	01/10/2010	The Primate Rescue Center is an incredible sanctuary that truly lives up to its name "primate rescue". It houses 11 chimpanzees that were rescued from deplorable conditions and over 40 monkeys that were either former pets or lab animals. The PRC has offered these animals a place to live out their final years in comfort receiving the very best of care from a dedicated and highly skilled staff. I can not speak highly enough about the PRC and all that April and her staff have done to not only  help primates in their care but to also educate the public about the perils of keeping primates as pets. I feel that it is such a wonderful place that I have driven nearly 200 miles round-trip to volunteer there on a monthly basis for the last 7 years.
Primate Rescue Center	25143	10	/users/profile/26157	Carley	Volunteer	5	01/04/2010	The Influence of the PRC:I began volunteering at the PRC in the Spring of 2008 while I was completing my Psychology B.A. at the University of Kentucky.  My research focus (at the university) was on animal behavior and cognition and I was working with a comparative psychologist at the university.  Through my professor and others I learned about the PRC and was immediately interested in becoming involved.  During the Spring I received school credit as an intern at the PRC and my eyes were opened to a whole new world.  With my current interest in animal behavior and cognition I was struggling between what species I wanted to focus on for my future graduate studies- dogs or chimpanzees.  After only a couple of weeks, my mind was set on working with and caring for chimpanzees and other primates.      Before my time at the PRC all I knew about chimpanzees and other primates was what I had studied in books regarding their cognitive abilities and behavior. Now I had these wonderful beings standing in front of me and I could truly see all of what I had studied and imagined take place right before my eyes.  While this previous knowledge grew and expanded I also became aware of the issues that seemed to be brushed over, if not ignored all together, in my college classes. I learned about the existence of the inhumane treatment of primates in zoos and traveling circuses, the unnecessary situations of primates as pets, and I became aware and educated about the bushmeat trade.  I realized that a lot of these tragic situations typically occur due to ignorance of the species at hand and I became inspired to promote awareness for the safety of these animals.   I spent 7 months at the PRC before moving for graduate school.  My time there involved the necessary cleaning of enclosures, preparing food and enrichment activities, and I was even permitted to carry out some observation time focusing on chimpanzee social behavior.  In that time I feel that my love for animals and science were molded in a way that would not have formed had I been deprived of this experience.     Now I am a doctorate student at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette studying chimpanzees with the Cognitive Evolution Group.  When I have completed my degree I hope to take my knowledge of chimpanzees cognition and behavior to a sanctuary, or possibly a zoo, to ensure the well being of these amazing animals in captivity, while standing against the breeding of captive primates.  I have dedicated my time and life to not just studying chimpanzees for the benefit of humans, but studying chimpanzees in order to better understand them so that we can ensure a better life for those forced to live in captivity.  I have been inspired to make a difference for these animals.  I do currently work with chimpanzees in an environment that I do not support and this is an issue that I have raised with my professor.  I still am confident that my studies during my graduate career will facilitate an understanding of these animals and set the stage for additional innovative enrichment techniques to be implemented for captive primates. The PRC has made me aware of how many captive primates need people who know how to care for them properly and it is because of all of the amazing nonhuman primates and people at the PRC that my goals are what they are today. I am looking forward to another internship at this facility during the Summer of 2010.
Primate Rescue Center	25097	10	/users/profile/26095	jfurlong	Board Member	5	12/30/2009	I am a professor of philosophy who teaches courses in bioethics, including animal ethics. My daughter first discovered the PRC in 2000 while doing research in her first year of college. She was so impressed with the clean and inviting atmosphere for the animals and the efficient, vigilant staff, that she began to volunteer and worked there during summers.  She is now a PhD in comparative psychology whose research has been featured in the New York Times, but she often says that she learned animal care and so much more from working at the PRC with April Truitt and her team.Largely because glowing reports of my daughter and discussions with April, I enthusiastically agreed to become a Board Member in 2002 and have enjoyed working in this capacity ever since. I have learned so much about primates by helping the PRC thrive; I've written better and taught better thanks to open discussions with April and the staff as well as engagement in the complex issues of running a sanctuary.As an academic, I come with all the prejudices most of us have, including a wary attitude toward people who claim to know a lot about animals. April has made herself an expert who can to toe-to-to with anybody in the primate community. To take just one example, she helped craft Kentucky's state-of-the-art exotic animal law. I've not often seen the rhetorical dash and cold logic that she displayed when arguing before the state legislature.I'll end by saying how grateful I have been to the PRC for the opportunity to work with such a strong organization. It gets 5 stars from me!
Primate Rescue Center	25077	10	/users/profile/26069	Carly	Volunteer	5	12/29/2009	As a member of the carestaff of a large NIH funded primate facility, I was accustumed to probably the  strictest criteria of any  of the primate centers in the United States. While always passing above and beyond the best of any primate facilities, this also meant  constant and beyond normal pressure to attain a passing grade at all USDA,OHSA,IACUC, etc. inspections. At times this severe scrutinity overwhelmed the staff, and left little time to properly interact with the animals in their care. While the obvious is the lack of interaction with the animals, it took an even larger strain on  the caregiverers.  This constant pressure, turned many a caregiver with great  promise and potential away to a more compassionate setting.The Primate Rescue Ceneter of Kentucky is just such a place.  It is most difficult to strike at least a neutral cord between these two most importantant goals. PRC seems to leave these statistics behind, and excells above and beyond. PRC is the model we as primatologists and animal lovers should strive for.  It is, in my humble opinion, PRC is one of the very  best in their field.For some reason, animal groups (of which I have almost thirty years  as an animal  professional) seem to compete with each other, rather than work together.  I have not experienced this with KPRC, nor do I expect too.  PRC is the future standard all primate centers should be judged by.  I look forward to that day.  Sincerely,Carly Selchow-Burr
My Dog Eats First	322556		/users/profile/416459	Kristine25	General Member of the Public	5	02/02/2017	When I moved from my last home the adults agreed to take care of my sweet girl, Henrietta, along with their two dogs -- her mother and full brother, since I could not take her with me. She was almost two. That was November 2015.  As events crystalized this last year with neighbors complaining about dogs barking, and attitudes escalated to a high alert uproar,  people in the home not having the means to care for three dogs with energy or time,  stress levels, work loads, including conflict over details like where a dog should sleep and dogs jumping electric lines. Without consistent play and exercise, or ongoing training and nurturing for a fairly high energy girl, I knew I had to make every effort find a home for my sweet dog Henrietta. Her situation had become an issue of proper nurturing and healthy care. It was past time for me to find a forever home if I could not be her Mom and provide a safe and nurturing space next to me.  Where I am will not allow me to have a dog. No options. If I did not have COPD, were truly homeless and living at a campsite with others, not this between lease chaos, she would be with me.  My Dog Eats First walked this path with me last Sunday afternoon through the entire process of re-socializing my girl, vetting her skills, getting her shots, check-up, and chipped, and pedi-pawed, along with horrific process of finding a new forever family. All at a miraculous down to the last minute day. Every person working there had Henrietta's best interests at heart when I told them I needed help rehoming her. These folks are here to keep families together not split them apart, yet they stood with me when they understood Henrietta's needs could not be filled in any other way except through rehoming.  Betheny, the director of MDEF, white knuckled the entire afternoon sending out messages and pleas for a good hearted person to step up. Meanwhile everyone else from the greeters at the information and registration desk to the veterinarians and assistants in the portable clinic did their best to comfort and reassure both us, Henrietta and I.  Henrietta's hero arrived in the form of a lanky two legged meat smoking food vender with a gentlemanly southern demeanor.  As an artist I see the potential for a lively illustrated book. Stephen Bowles is a true champ and animal loving guy. Besides,  what dog would not appreciate a sidekick that grills and proudly says, "Sit in the front seat with me." I witnessed compassionate love towards everyone that walked in and out the doors, four and two legs alike, in the only way St. Francis of Assisi would have approved. Unconditional.

Every Wednesday this organization (rain or shine) in Louisville, KY, meets up to help the homeless with their pets. This group tirelessly helps them with food, vaccinations, vet care, & actually anything that the homeless needs for their pets...they help. If they can't keep their pets for awhile, they will try to find foster care for them temporarily.
My Dog Eats First	281477	3	/users/profile/371524	Writer	Volunteer	5	03/02/2016	MDEF is wonderful! I have recently started volunteering with them and love it. They provide the necessities such as pet food and partner with vet services for people who are homeless or otherwise cannot afford it. They also provide so much more - litter, toys, beds, blankets, collars and leashes...plus the opportunity for everyone to come together with a common love: pets! 
My Dog Eats First	281457	3	/users/profile/371505	MaggieWenn	Volunteer	5	03/02/2016	My Dog Eats First are the real deal. I have volunteer with them a few times and they are a very compassionate group of people.
My Dog Eats First	281434	2	/users/profile/371484	Writer	Donor	5	03/02/2016	I read about this organization on facebook and also heard about it through facebook friends involved in rescue in KY.  I started making donations to them after I saw them step up and help a homeless woman who was living in her van in frigid temps with her 2 dogs and 3 cats, some of whom were elderly .  They immediately helped her rent a hotel room and provided food for the animals.  They went above and beyond by asking for donations for the woman and providing her with gas and grocery gift cards.  They also have an event, I think weekly, where they hand out pet food to the homeless of Louisville and provide some vet care through volunteer veterinarians.  Awesome organization!  And I think every city should follow their example and offer this valuable resource to the homeless.
My Dog Eats First	281427	1	/users/profile/371476	Fontana	General Member of the Public	5	03/02/2016	I read about this organization in the online news. In the photo, a homeless man standing in a sleet covered his dog by a jacket donated by a kind driver to keep his friend warm. Commenters wanted to help and one person shared that MDEF has assisted the man and the dog. I found MDEF's website and learned what it does. It touched me that there is an organization as unique as this one - helping those without the place to stay AND their non-human families. I live hundreds of miles away from Louisville, KY, yet I felt honored to donate and let others know about this work of compassion and love.
My Dog Eats First	281380	3	/users/profile/371424	Kay_34	Donor	5	03/01/2016	When I found out about this organization, I was delighted to know that someone really understood how important an animal companion is to person with little in the way of constant in their lives.  The animal/homeless person relationship allows the homeless to love, to have companionship, to have someone to talk to and snuggle with.  I donate food when I can and spread the word, asking others to look them up on Facebook and help to let people know what a marvelous and unselfish organization this is.
My Dog Eats First	281359	3	/users/profile/371401	Writer	Donor	5	03/01/2016	My Dog Eats First is one of the most important non-profits that I know. Through their work, individuals needing help get another chance to have yet another day with their animal companions. Aiding this companionship helps promote good mental and emotional health which in turn can positively affect physical health. My Dog Eats First is truly a healer and life saver.
My Dog Eats First	281356	3	/users/profile/371399	Writer	Volunteer	5	03/01/2016	My Dog Eats First is an organization founded to help homeless and struggling people keep their pets. We provide food and medical assistance. Often our participants have no one else in their lives but their pet. These pets provide unconditional love and acceptance to many people who get far too little encouragement. 
My Dog Eats First	271803	4	/users/profile/360700	Kimi M.	Donor	5	11/11/2015	Love this organization and the love and support they offer the homeless and their "furry family".  
My Dog Eats First	270658	4	/users/profile/359383	Amanda200	Volunteer	5	11/01/2015	My Dog Eats First is doing important work in the Louisville community, and it's led by a passionate founder and board. They spread compassion and acceptance to pets and their humans, and are incredibly well-organized given the lean way they operate. You know when you donate to or volunteer with MDEF, almost EVERYTHING goes to the pets and people they serve. I highly recommend getting involved in any way.
My Dog Eats First	270235	5	/users/profile/358950	Melody10	General Member of the Public	5	10/31/2015	I've seen their work first hand and know how lucky we are they are here.
My Dog Eats First	270234	5	/users/profile/358949	Pam_105	Donor	5	10/31/2015	I learned of this mission a year ago when I saw a video of what they do on Facebook.  I was so impressed with the commitment to the animals and their owners.  It is one thing to SAY that we care about the homeless and underfed people and animals of this community, but Beth and her crew actually DO something about it.  In rain, wind, snow, and sometimes even SUN, MDEF is there.  I am proud of being able to say we have a special organization such as this in our city.  They go above and beyond for these people who need them, even having gone to great lengths to find and return a lost/stolen dog back to his owner, as well as funding a home for a terminally- ill man to live his last weeks comfortably with his dog.  Your money is well-spent donating to My Dog Eats First!!
My Dog Eats First	270168	4	/users/profile/358886	Writer	Donor	5	10/31/2015	I first saw MDEF online and wondered what they were about. As an animal lover, I cannot think of a better group to support. The homeless community has a gem here. 
My Dog Eats First	270094	5	/users/profile/358819	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	10/30/2015	My Dog Eats First is a local organization that provides food for the pets of the city's homeless. It allow those less fortuniate to hold on in most cases to the one thing that is unconditional in their life. This is accomplished weekly by a group of volunteers in the rain, sleet and freezing cold. The last time i was able to volunteer it was in the single digits, standing in the parking lot so cold couldnt feel my face. I couldnt imagine anyone surviving outside but the homeless with pets have no choice as the shelters dont allow their animals. So they stand in line to get their pet food, a bag of treats and maybe a toy then wonder off with their pet in tow until the following week when they gather once more.
My Dog Eats First	270046	5	/users/profile/358769	Writer	Board Member	5	10/30/2015	MDEF is an awesome non profit organization that provides food, water, treats and basic vet needs to the precious pets of the homeless and underserved in the Louisville area. I feel beyond blessed to be apart of this fabulous organization. I look forward to being with the homeless and underserved, they have become my friends! Love the direction MDEF is headed, blessed beyond words!
My Dog Eats First	269999	3	/users/profile/358729	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/30/2015	My Dog Eats First is an amazing organization ran by a fantastic group of ladies! I have had the honor and blessing to be able to volunteer with this group. I have witnessed first hand their love, compassion and caring with providing the homeless and under-privileged with food, supplies and care for their pets. These homeless and under-privileged that MDEF serves absolutely adore and are grateful for MDEF, its board and volunteers. I have nothing but praise and admiration for this organization!!! Well done ladies, VERY well done!!!!
My Dog Eats First	269995	3	/users/profile/358725	Writer	Donor	5	10/30/2015	This is such a wonderful organization that's making a huge difference for the homeless population and their pets. They're helping to take care of a population that's often forgotten and helping make sure these people are able to properly care for their pets. Keep up the good work!!! 
My Dog Eats First	269973	3	/users/profile/358704	Writer	Donor	5	10/30/2015	Such an amazing and truly beautiful experience. My Dog Eats First is doing things that may otherwise go undone all together. This unique effort touches the lives of so many homeless and needy people with pets. Keeping companions safe, healthy and together! You've never seen so much love in one place! 
My Dog Eats First	269965	2	/users/profile/358696	Writer	Advisor	4	10/30/2015	An impressive group with a compassionate and dedicated founder.  Its mission is progressive and its goals are inspiring and much-needed.   The board members and volunteers truly support MDEF's principles through actions and deeds, not just talk.
My Dog Eats First	269948	2	/users/profile/358680	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	10/30/2015	The founder is stellar and an all-around inspiration, to me personally and to her community! The people and animals they help care for and provide services to are impacted greatly! They are fulfilling needs for individuals, who like everyone else, love their pets, but have obstacles inhibiting them from providing all needs, except their love of course! This organization also does what it takes to keep all pets with their humans! This organization is a real example of compassion, and what our society needs most, love!
My Dog Eats First	269938	2	/users/profile/358671	Writer	Donor	5	10/30/2015	Awesome group that provides food & vet care to local homeless people's pets. They help the people, too, with food, clothing, etc.  Such a wonderful organization that really makes a positive difference in the community.

My Dog Eats First	269894	4	/users/profile/358625	Jill83	Donor	5	10/30/2015	This is an amazing organization that is very needed & appreciated by all who donate, volunteer & benefit from. (Especially the pets!) I personally had a devastating family crisis that left me severely depressed and eventually cost me my job, home, & even the desire to live, except for the beautiful pitbull I had recently rescued from a life of severe neglect & cruelty. She is now very healthy, happy, & loved beyond words. If not for the help of a dear friend, I would have been in the same place as the people helped by this group! I have & will continue to volunteer & donate to this cause whenever I am able.
My Dog Eats First	269878	3	/users/profile/358610	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	10/30/2015	This organization is NEEDED and appreciated in our community. If it wasn't for them, I can't even begin to imagine what people would do. Much loved & much blessed. They're the best. 
My Dog Eats First	269768	4	/users/profile/358495	Linda390	Volunteer	4	10/30/2015	I've been volunteering with this group for a year now and it has made a difference in my life.  No matter what the weather is like outside, whether  I'm soaking wet, frozen or melting from the heat, I come home happy!  MDEF is making a difference.
My Dog Eats First	269725	4	/users/profile/358448	Writer	Client Served	5	10/30/2015	I fell on hard times due to an injury and my spouse had been seriously ill we feed the neighborhood feral cats and we have a dog . I went there for pet food. I was shocked by all the items and food that we received for our family plus animal food. The kindness and love of all the volunteers moved me. I am so grateful for this organization. Thank you.
My Dog Eats First	269720	3	/users/profile/358443	Writer	Donor	5	10/30/2015	They are an amazing non-profit that puts their hearts / souls into everything they do. They go above and beyond to offer as much help / support for homeless and their pets. 
My Dog Eats First	269682	3	/users/profile/358404	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	10/30/2015	They are an amazing selfless group that is doing all they can for the least of these!  Praise God for all the good they do in the Louisville community.  
My Dog Eats First	269658	3	/users/profile/358378	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/30/2015	Very well organized group when serving. Beth and her volunteers are very compassionate about their cause and go above and beyond to help those that they serve. 
My Dog Eats First	269655	5	/users/profile/358375	Sharon163	Board Member	5	10/30/2015	My Dog Eats First is a wonderful organization that gives to the homeless and indigent in so many ways in the form of food to their pets that need our help,  love and support to the people that depend on us for that little bit of help each week.  I give to other organizations but this one I can see where my gift is going,  I can see the look of gratitude on the pet owners faces for the help they are receiving.  Their pets are getting fed and are getting veterinarian attention from our volunteer veterinarians.  All our support is through donations from people who understand the need and every Wednesday night there are bright shiny volunteer faces ready to help.  
My Dog Eats First	269543	4	/users/profile/358267	Kelly184	Donor	5	10/29/2015	This organization is doing fantastic  work for pets of homeless folks in our community.   These pets are family to these people.  Homeless folks who can't afford food, supplies and vetting for their beloved pets are getting these things through My Dog Eats First, Beth Green and the incredible vets, volunteers  and donors who make it possible! 
My Dog Eats First	269518	3	/users/profile/358243	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/29/2015	This organization is helping the homeless in our community feed and vaccinate their pets.  Sadly, our homeless population in Louisville continues to grow.  We all love our pets.  And we would all make sure our dogs ate first.  This amazing non profit makes it so no one has to make that choice.  I've seen My Dog Eats First grow and serve so many in our city.  I urge all who read this to learn about this organization, volunteer and please donate (time, pet food, supplies or money) generously.  
My Dog Eats First	269512	4	/users/profile/358237	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	10/29/2015	A person living on the streets feels love, protection and constant companionship having a pet. They love them so much, they often put the animal's needs before their own. MY DOG EATS FIRST gets it! They live out the commission of Christ by loving on "the least of these". When these beautiful pet owners get care and food for their furbabies it takes the stress off of them and makes them feel secure knowing they've given these innocent, unconditionally loving animals the care they deserve but can't afford. I am in awe of this organization. I've truly never seen an group of people more purely loving than this.  I will always support them. 
My Dog Eats First	269496	3	/users/profile/358223	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	10/29/2015	Unbelievable work is being done by this organization! 
My Dog Eats First	269414	4	/users/profile/358142	Veronica32	General Member of the Public	5	10/29/2015	I personally know people who are or were homeless, down on their luck or just don't have the money for dog or cat food, vaccinations, collars, leashes,or what ever the individual  needs may be.  You have helped my godson when he was down on his luck with his dog and if not for you he may not be with us today. This is an amazing group who go above and beyond to help the people in, around and near Louisville KY.  I can't say enough or give enough praise for what you all do out there on the streets.
My Dog Eats First	269405	4	/users/profile/358133	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/29/2015	Words can not convey the compassion this group has. The first time I heard about them I admit, I judged. How dare homeless have pets!  Then I went downtown on a Wednesday and was moved to tears. I was so wrong. I have supported them and donated to them ever since. 
My Dog Eats First	269404	5	/users/profile/358132	Lenore S.	Donor	5	10/29/2015	I live in and walk my own dogs around the Highlands neighborhood of Louisville, an area often frequented by people who live on the streets, aka the homeless. Many have dogs and it makes perfect sense to me. After all, when the whole world has let you down and you feel like you have nothing, who will still love you? Your dog.  Strike up a conversation and you'll usually hear "he's been with me for 3 years" . . .  or five years . . . or 6 months. The key is this is the one constant in their life, the one being they can count on to be there. I approach these people to share the word about the resources available through My Dog Eats First and I've met have some of the recipients of MDEF's services. Picture a man's face light up as he describes how his dog got a checkup and all his shots, maybe a leash and a collar, always a bag of food. I've heard how grateful these folks are that their dog has gotten the care it needs to stay healthy. I see in their eyes how much they love their dogs and I know how much it means to them.   MDEF has changed what I see on our walks. Instead of looking away, I step forward. I have those conversations and meet those dogs who are so loved, and their humans who are so unloved. I am grateful that I can pass along an offer of help if it is needed. I am proud to be a supporter of My Dog Eats First.  
My Dog Eats First	269398	5	/users/profile/358125	Writer	Donor	5	10/29/2015	Excellent organization with a heart. They restore dignity to the needy and full bellies to the furry buddies. Selfless and caring!
Children of the Americas (COTA)	323769		/users/profile/418247	valerielhowlett	Volunteer	5	02/25/2017	I am a nurse and 2017 was my 5th year to travel with COTA. I am amazed at what happens in the short amount of time this group spends in this beautiful country. I also help during the year to prepare for this yearly medical team. It takes a lot to make this happen. Many items are taken to be donated such as walkers and wheelchairs for many that were previously carried everywhere by their families. Supplies are also donated to the hospitals that offer space for our team as well as to local charitable organizations. Every year I have traveled with this group I have been humbled by their generosity as no one, including the president or board members, make any money. Everyone covers their own expenses and everything else happens with donations and fund raisers.  The gratefulness of the those receiving surgeries, examinations, medicines, prosthesis or dental care cannot be put into words. The women and children who receive care are truly deserving. I see lifelong friendships form among team members. I see all of these volunteers leave knowing they have been involved in a group that truly makes a difference. I look forward to continuing to be a part of this organization. 
Children of the Americas (COTA)	323756		/users/profile/418228	hello7	Volunteer	5	02/24/2017	I went on my first medical mission 14 years ago. I had been in Central America before while I was in the Army. This was just gonna be a adventure for me. But I got here and saw the need and I was hooked. Then came me two boys. They are happy and healthy. I'm blessed and have a duty to give back. 
Children of the Americas (COTA)	323699		/users/profile/418167	dmerianos	Volunteer	5	02/23/2017	This was my second year with COTA.  It's just a great group of people with really big hearts, taking care of a very appreciative, very deserving patient population.  It's really a pleasure and a privilege to be a part of it.  And if Mike and Omer are reading this, I just bought 4 brand new sen retractors off amazon to bring down for next year...sweet.
Children of the Americas (COTA)	323670		/users/profile/268851	rhvance1	Board Member	5	02/23/2017	I have been working with Children of the Americas since 1996.  Throughout the years, I have watched it grow and mature into the amazing organization that it is today.  It is a pleasure and honor to be a small part of the big differences we are making in the lives of children and their mothers in Guatemala.  
Children of the Americas (COTA)	225070	2	/users/profile/268851	rhvance1	Board Member	5	10/22/2014	I have had the honor to serve this organization since 1996, as a board member, a host parent, and a volunteer on the teams.  My decision to become involved has been one of the most positive and influential decisions of my life.  It has not only given me a better appreciation of the culture of a beautiful country, but also an understanding of the challenges that face people in all developing countries.  That appreciation has changed not only my life, but the lives of my family and friends, who have seen for themselves the importance of service to others in need.  I am humbled and honored to work alongside the other COTA volunteers in our efforts to improve the lives of the women and children of Guatemala.
Children of the Americas (COTA)	206433	1	/users/profile/268851	rhvance1	Board Member	5	07/17/2014	Children of the Americas is a wonderful group of dedicated volunteers who provide medical and surgical services to indigent mothers and children in Guatemala.  It has been an honor and pleasure to be part of this amazing organization.
Children of the Americas (COTA)	323666		/users/profile/208853	DianaH	Volunteer	5	02/23/2017	Again this year a group of 120 non paid volunteers headed to Guatemala to join with the caring people in Retalhuleu to help those who need medical care.  With members from Guatemala, Ohio, Colorado, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Kentucky and numerous other states, these people joined together to lend a hand.  Many on this team have worked together for years and others were strangers.   That's why it was so amazing when they immediately became such a united group all serving each other and the people of Guatemala.  I have worked with Children of the Americas for twelve years and am always amazed at how this many people can pull it together in one week to set up a medical team that will see nearly 2000 patients requiring consultation with a primary care doctor, surgery, dental care, ultra sounds, prescriptions, and orthotics. We are all blessed to be a part of this endeavor.
Children of the Americas (COTA)	224683	3	/users/profile/208853	DianaH	Volunteer	5	10/21/2014	I have been privileged to work with this all volunteer group since 2006.  We are called upon to serve those who are marginalized by poverty, disease or circumstance.  Working side by side with the wonderful people of Guatemala, I find that we transform not only those whose needs we serve, but ourselves as well, making the world a better place one child at a time.
Children of the Americas (COTA)	157469	2	/users/profile/208853	DianaH	Volunteer	5	05/09/2013	COTA is doing what most would think impossible. With no paid staff and a volunteer board, they are providing essential health care services to some of the world's most desperate and impoverished people. Volunteers donate their time and money to gather, pack supplies and to organize medical trips to Guatemala.  After a year of preparation, volunteers the use vacation time and pay for travel expenses to spend a week providing medical care to those who need it most.  Every dollar collected in fundraising goes directly to patient care.  Money could not be better spent.  I am proud to donate my time and money to this organization. 
Children of the Americas (COTA)	323659		/users/profile/418100	beatty	Volunteer	5	02/23/2017	This is my third year with COTA.   Each year is better than the last.  I love the culture and the people of Guatemala.   I was blessed this year to experience serendipity.    While vacationing at Lake Atitlan prior to the trip through multiple events I was put in touch with a widowed woman and her young son that had never walked.   $125 dollars and 6 days later this child was in surgery and will eventually be able to walk.  The community leader and Canadian volunteers visiting Guatemala hiked the three hours up a mountain to the village to back pack the child down to public transportation.   Six hours later on a local bus got the child, the mam and community leader arriving  at Retalhuleu.   COTA provided housing and food  while "mi familia" awaited surgery.      This same journey happened in reverse after surgery but a village closer to public transportation will care for the family until the child is able to go back to his village.    $125 dollars- something that I spend on a dinner out changed someone's life forever.   I know that my financial support and my time makes a difference with COTA.   I am lucky to be part of this organization and am impressed with the board and my fellow participants 
Children of the Americas (COTA)	323653		/users/profile/418090	SICUROBIN69	Board Member	5	02/23/2017	I have been a volunteer with Children of the America's for the last 11 years. For the last 5 years I have been a board member.  Our actual humanitarian mission is 7 days in duration, but the time and work to prepare for the mission is ongoing all year. Planning, Organizing, fundraising, team development, the list goes on and on.  I am privileged to be involved in such an amazing team. I plan to remain involved as long as I am able. 
Children of the Americas (COTA)	323651		/users/profile/206960	Sandra_Alboum	Volunteer	5	02/23/2017	 I have been to Guatemala five times with this organization as an interpreter. Truly caring people, well-organized, and they do a ton of good work. I plan on volunteering with them for many years to come. 
Children of the Americas (COTA)	155954		/users/profile/206960	Sandra_Alboum	Volunteer	5	04/24/2013	I went to Guatemala this January with COTA as a Spanish interpreter.  It was an excellent experience - well organized, and SO VERY WORTHY.  This year we did something like 2200 consults for women and children, 150 surgeries, extracted maybe 175 teeth, gave out 25k vitamins, ran out of anti-parasite meds... So very necessary.  The poverty down there is so severe, and people have to choose between food and medicine.  It's unfair, and unnecessary. I will be going back in 2014.  Fabulous org, fabulous mission.
Children of the Americas (COTA)	323560		/users/profile/417952	Mary_Ann9	Volunteer	5	02/21/2017	I'm a volunteer with COTA as is everyone involved with the organization. No one is paid so all resources and donations go directly to the people we serve. We spend each year gathering medical and operating room supplies that are shipped to Guatemala for the January trip.I've been going for 15 years. Before that my family hosted a young, Guatemalan boy who needed his surgery done in the States.The defining characteristics for me of this organization are the caring, welcoming, fun loving people  who contribute their time and talents to the group and the people of Guatemala.
Children of the Americas (COTA)	323472		/users/profile/417837	Writer	Volunteer	5	02/20/2017	Amazing organization that truly helps those in need. Very well organized and full of big hearts. 
Children of the Americas (COTA)	295016		/users/profile/385817	childrenoftheamericas	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/09/2016	As an organization COTA gets 5 stars in ALL areas.  Organization is the constant concern of the Board and b/c of that commitment the concern filters down through all areas and allows the individual providers in their contacts with patients to take advantage of many other areas of COTA so that it's not just a stream from the Board down but can be diverted so that the patient can actually be the primary concern and all that filters back up to the Board and it's decision making.
Children of the Americas (COTA)	280888		/users/profile/340865	kmontgo	Volunteer	5	02/25/2016	Every January for the past 10 years or so, I've had the good fortune of spending a week with COTA volunteers doing medical mission work in Guatemala. This past January was no exception as we worked together in Salama where medical, surgical, pharmaceutical and dental care were provided. Over 8000 encounters were achieved in one week through cooperation, communication and a good deal of "elbow grease"!  In providing health care to Guatemalans and working alongside these wonderful COTA volunteers, one gains so much more than one gives!
Children of the Americas (COTA)	252758	1	/users/profile/340865	kmontgo	Volunteer	5	08/12/2015	A remarkable organization doing wonderful things for those in need in Guatemala. I have participated for about 10 years with this group and each year easily reconnect with past volunteers as well as develop new friendships.  Every January when we travel to Guatemala, I eagerly wait to greet our in-country friends and volunteers, many of whom were former patients. The experience is life-changing! 
Children of the Americas (COTA)	280788		/users/profile/217413	Michael181	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/23/2016	Salama was my 12th COTA team!  The committment and love for the women and children of Guatemala is the common bond shared by each COTA volunteer on every team.  Every year I am amazed by the warmth and kindness shown to our team by the gracious people of Guatemala.  I am humbled by the women we serve as they care for their family, seeking knowledge and reassurance from medical professionals and support staff.  I look forward to serving on another team!
Children of the Americas (COTA)	163716		/users/profile/217413	Michael181	Volunteer	5	07/27/2013	Working with COTA has been the most rewarding work my wife and I have ever done.  As volunteer ARNP and pharmacist we have been truly blessed by working with the needy women  and children  of Guatemala.  COTA is  making such a difference in the lives of  "the least of these".  If you go your heart and outlook are changed forever. Can't say enough about all the COTA volunteers  and their dedication. The biggest reward is on the faces and smiles of those we are serving. Hosting a foster child for medical treatment  stole our hearts.  We always look forward to returning each year  with COTA.  Please support COTA to continue this important work. 
Children of the Americas (COTA)	279554		/users/profile/369560	rosamariaCOTA	Volunteer	5	02/09/2016	It has been an honor and privilege to be a volunteer in this wonderful organization.  With very limited financial resources they are doing amazing things, changing the lives of indigent children and their mothers in Guatemala.  It is an all volunteer organization, one that is worthy of your support.
Children of the Americas (COTA)	278546		/users/profile/368509	Leonard4	Volunteer	5	01/31/2016	I have been a COTA volunteer on the pharmacy team for the last 7 trips.  Every year I am amazed at how 125 peiole from different disciplines, backgrounds and regions come together with limited resources in nearly unimaginably difficult  working environments to provide exceptional healthcare for the women and children of Guatemala.  All of this takes place without rehearsal, without meetings, without manuals and with rookie volunteers in critical roles every year.  I have studied organizational theroy for twenty years  and I have never seen anything that approaches this level of productivity.  I work with amazing champions who are motivated by a greater good and who truly touch the lives and whose lives are forever touched by the indigenous population of Guatemala.
Children of the Americas (COTA)	278421		/users/profile/368363	Writer	Volunteer	5	01/30/2016	what a remarkable organization to be a part of.  as a member of the clinic staff, we saw great numbers of women and children waiting patiently for their time to "tell their story".  These families are so resilient and humble they put us to shame.  It was an honor to take time to hear what was important the them and support their goals for better health for themselves and their families.  They were so interested in learning how to be healthier and so happy to receive reassurance and affirmation.  The most important gift we can share is time and compassion...isn't that what everyone needs.  Thanks for the chance to share time with such beautiful people - the people we serve and the great staff we work with.

The efforts of COTA to make a difference in this country should be recognized and supported by anyone who is familiar with this organization.  The volunteers are dedicated to their jobs, share their knowledge and skills with the residents and fellow volunteers.  Thanks to the ones who work so hard to make this a successful pilgrimage.

The week was one of the most rewarding experiences and the help provided by the talented and dedicated team makes a positive impact to the people served.  The medical attention to the women and children in Guatemala is greatly needed and COTA provides this welcomed opportunity.

I have 100% confidence in the sincerity and effectiveness of this non-profit.  It's incredible to see how much good can be done by this group with limited funds.  I have no doubt that every dollar  contributed is used wisely.  The COTA volunteers are truly amazing.  
Children of the Americas (COTA)	218697	2	/users/profile/282279	Sally57	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/01/2014	As a full time volunteer in the Highlands of Guatemala, I went as a translator in Jan-2014 to Solola which is about an hour from where I volunteer.  The way these folks are from the beginning of the huge health campaignthe organization, the details, the love, the shoes, the comrades, the experts in their field, the previous recipients now the givers, the high quality care, the willingness to adapt, the honoring system and respect for the local culture, the generosity of every single person on the team, the kindness, the sacrifices,I can go on and on.  I've worked here 5 years and to date have not found finest volunteers with so much talent and heart!  Kudos to the Board of Directors and everyone that carries such a smooth and fruitful operation.  Special thanks to Jody Greenlee who loves unending and passes on such joy and passion to all that meet her. 
Children of the Americas (COTA)	211156	2	/users/profile/64881	Mike M	Volunteer	5	08/19/2014	Many groups go to Central America and hand out tracts, vitamins, clothing, etc.    But Children of the Americas goes a step further with life-changing surgery.    We take children and women who are basically outcasts in their villages, and help turn them into socially accepted, hard-working individuals.   It truly changes lives for the better.
Children of the Americas (COTA)	211131	1	/users/profile/273996	davehennessey	Volunteer	5	08/19/2014	COTA is an extremely well run mission that provides health care to more than thousand mothers and their children each year including complicated and life saving surgeries in the US. The missions provide services and medicines that these families would never receive otherwise.
Children of the Americas (COTA)	211086	1	/users/profile/273942	nvasto	Volunteer	5	08/18/2014	Children of the Americas is comprised of passionate, dedicated and caring individuals motivated by the mission to offer much needed medical care to women and children in Guatemala. Having volunteered for this group on a medical mission trip, I was moved by the compassionate clinicians and volunteers that helped change the lives of those we served. It was a privilege to serve with this nonprofit and I've recommended the experience to my colleagues and physicians as a wonderful, reliable organization with an outstanding history. 
Children of the Americas (COTA)	211068		/users/profile/199341	LizKnapp	Volunteer	5	08/18/2014	The triple care approach of COTA is one of the non-profit's most remarkable qualities.  The organization has a mission to treat women and children on site in Guatemala, provide ambulatory devices as needed, and then goes above and beyond by selecting a few of the most vulnerable children to travel to the United States for lifesaving surgeries.   All of this is accomplished by volunteers spread out across the United States who have other full time jobs.  I can't think of a more rewarding group to be a part of.  Children of the Americas is walking the walk to make life better for families in underdeveloped nations. 
Children of the Americas (COTA)	149546		/users/profile/199341	LizKnapp	Volunteer	5	02/17/2013	One strength of the COTA mission is in the size and diversity of people that come together to volunteer.  For one week, once a year, over 100 individuals come from across the US with skill sets ranging from world class surgeons, nurses, and anesthesiologists,  to interpreters, logistics personnel, cooks and van drivers.  After being a part of the group for two years now, COTA feels more like a family helping other families.  They are truly interested in a greater good and are quite efficient at reaching hundreds of women and children in that one short week.
Children of the Americas (COTA)	211058		/users/profile/273908	fsheeder	Volunteer	5	08/18/2014	COTA is a wonderful organization.  COTA and its cadre of highly qualified and passionate volunteers provide medical and surgical care to marginalized and under-served women and children.  Having been on a medical mission trip with COTA and having attended its Board meetings, I can attest firsthand to the quality of this organization and the services it provides.  It takes multi-disciplinary efforts from physicians, nurses, other clinicians, translators, logistics personnel, and a bevy of others to accomplish what COTA manages to do well so consistently.  It all works seamlessly because all involved share the singular focus of helping those in need.  I am blessed to know and to participate in the activities of this great organization.
Children of the Americas (COTA)	206465		/users/profile/268894	chiqui	Volunteer	5	07/17/2014	Cota is an organization that has over 20 years helping the poor people in Guatemala. The group of physicians from different specialties, nurses, prosthetists and orthotists and many, many volunteers make a monumental work, helping people from different regions of the country. I was unable to participate and observe the great work they perform donation in all fields. Operations of different types, dentists, special care for children with common disease, etc, etc.. I have no more to say Cota is a simply wonderful and efficient organization.
Children of the Americas (COTA)	206412		/users/profile/268819	Forrest D.	Volunteer	5	07/17/2014	I was impressed with the Children Of The Americas based out of Kentucky  from the day we went to work in Guatemala.  I work for a lean manufacturing  company as my real job and I liked the fact that everyone had a job with specific expectations with minimal overlap so it was structured to make us highly efficient.  It was my first year as with others and the seasoned members of COTA insured that we were safe and briefed as to what we should be doing and shouldn't  be doing.  The rewarding part is that the medical, dental, orthopedics, teams and others gave the women and children life saving and quality of life changing medical care.  If anyone wants to work for or donate to an amazing organization I suggest you devote some time and check COTA out on the web or seek out a member to ask questions to to hear about the great things they do.

Children of the Americas (COTA)	158457		/users/profile/210233	guatemala	Board Member	5	05/21/2013	My experience with Children of the Americas spans thirteen years and a lifetime of personal change. The challenges of volunteering in Guatemala have been instrumental in growing me as a person. Fostering two children with the organization enlarged the focus of our family, and allowed us to consider Central American concerns as important as our own. Adding 100 volunteers to my list of friends every year has grown my circle of concern from New York to Washington state. I continue to be inspired by the amazingly altruistic men and women who hold our organization dear to their hearts. 
Children of the Americas (COTA)	156512		/users/profile/207606	kaysmith	Volunteer	5	04/27/2013	As a surgical nurse, I volunteer with COTA to help serve the children and families of Guatemala.  I am very proud of this organization and all that they accomplish during a week.  Others in the organization work throughout the year to make things run smoothly.  COTA is a worthwhile organization that deserves support.
Children of the Americas (COTA)	156272		/users/profile/207311	jliausy	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/25/2013	As a pediatric plastic surgeon, I have participated in multiple mission trips with various groups.  They have all been excellent trips, but there is a reason I continue with COTA.  The factors which make me go year after year are as follows.  The self hard work philosophy among everyone, the breadth of the patients, and the focus of everyone on the kids and adult patients.  Also our focus on giving to the communities and coexisting with the health providers there is much more appealing than the "gringo group" who goes down to operate, treat, and then leave without true consideration to those whose lives and communities we have entered.  This is a group I'm proud to be a part of and look forward to continuing the work COTA makes possible.
Children of the Americas (COTA)	154973		/users/profile/205834	Keith18	General Member of the Public	5	04/16/2013	This is a wonderful organization of caring people who are skilled medical professionals giving to people in need.  They are well organized and utilize their time and resources more effectively than any non profit I have been associated with.  The organization literally makes life changing surgeries happen for people that would not otherwise have any opportunity to benefit from these resources. Great cause run by a top notch group of managers!
Children of the Americas (COTA)	154700		/users/profile/205548	SHiero	Board Member	5	04/14/2013	My wife and I have volunteered with COTA since 2007 as part of the dental team.  The work although demanding, is rewarding and the need is very great.  We find it inspiring and a privilage to work with such a dedicated group of giving individuals.  COTA works to relieve suffering and improve the lives of individuals that otherwise would have little chance of receiving care.  We are grateful to be a part of the COTA family of volunteers and to have the opportunity to serve with them.         
Children of the Americas (COTA)	154654		/users/profile/205501	rhvance	Volunteer	5	04/14/2013	I have been a volunteer with COTA since 1994.  Though I have volunteered with many non-profits throughout the years, none has captured my heart in quite the same way.  The amazing accomplishments on behalf of the women and children in Guatemala are a testament to the dedication and commitment of its volunteers.  I consider it an honor and privilege to be part of this organization.
Children of the Americas (COTA)	153808		/users/profile/204627	KitM	Board Member	5	04/09/2013	Over 100 people from diverse backgrounds travel annually to Central Amercia for a week long medical/surgical mission. The logistics can be daunting as this is the largest Team that travels to Guatemala. Challenges encountered build camaraderie, resolve and a tremendous sense of accomplishment. Team members return year after year, not only to help the people of Guatemala, but to grow individually and collectively as part of the COTA family. COTA Volunteers prepare year-round for this trip, but also maintain an active Stateside program to connect children in need from developing countries with specialized medical care here in the States. I'm extremely proud and honored to be a part of this wonderful organization.
Children of the Americas (COTA)	153634		/users/profile/204456	WarrenB	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/08/2013	I am very proud to be associated with COTA. This is a group of volunteers who travel  to Guatemala, work under difficult conditions, treat all patients we can and refuse all payment. All money raised for COTA  goes to patient care; we have no paid personell. We come from diverse cultures, diverse religions and all economic levels. We wokk together only to provide the best possible medical care for this needy population. 
Children of the Americas (COTA)	149564		/users/profile/199375	Bonnie38	Volunteer	5	02/18/2013	Having the opportunity to go to Guatemala  as a registered nurse is very rewarding.  Only knowing  6 persons on my first trip to meet approx 100 skilled , talented & giving people to work & make a difference in less fortunate  women & children. To know how organized and hard working people are  and with limited resources is astounding. It is a reminder to me how blessed I am. To much is given much is expected. Bonnie Bennett 
Children of the Americas (COTA)	149544		/users/profile/199340	George Q.	Volunteer	5	02/17/2013	I am an orthopedic surgeon who has done charity work in the U.S. for decades, all the while looking for an organized, dedicated, and efficient organization with whom I could share my expertise abroad.  Children of the Americas is just what I had been looking for and I am honored and gratified to work with such a wonderful team.  My first mission with this team was so well organized, I was able to perform 31 surgeries in four days for people who otherwise would not have had access to such care.  I do believe that we have changed countless lives forever and feel blessed to have had the opportunity.  I am returning to Guatemala in three weeks to provide follow-up care and, no doubt, will return on many more COTA trips in the future.
Children of the Americas (COTA)	149542		/users/profile/68903	Bob and Barbara Buss	Volunteer	5	02/17/2013	I have spent approximately 20 years working as a nurse with COTA in Guatemala. To meet the families who come to be cared for is extremely humbling. Many travel several hours to get to the site, either on a "Chicken Bus" or in the back of a pickup truck, just for a chance to be seen. Every year we see situations which are easily and readily treated in the US, such as hernia repairs, burn scar releases, wound care. We in the US take this care for granted. To many in Guatemala, because of the economics and difficulty traveling, that care is not available.Especially heart wrenching are the malnourished children and elderly we see each year. Many are so malnourished, they are not candidates for anesthesia and surgical repair. We work to get them connected to a nutrition program so they can have surgery either later with our team or with another surgical team who works in their area. Our rewards are the hugs and smiles we receive from the families when they have been given some help and some glimmer of hope.  
Finding Freedom Through Friendship, Inc.	323604	1	/users/profile/417991	Azuralex	Board Member	5	02/22/2017	What hooked me to Finding Freedom through Friendship is that the program addresses the three dimensions of poverty:  Health (nutrition & child mortality), Education and living standard (fuel, sanitation, water, electricity, flooring & assets).  The two to three-year holistic journey transforms a family from poverty to self-sufficiency.   It was significant to witness the transformation across multiple generations  that is the women household heads and their children.  After nine years of operation, many mothers own their home, run a small business and best of all their children attend school, operate businesses and some have even enrolled in obtaining higher degrees such as nursing and law.    From dirt floors, leaking roofs, starvation, disgrace, shame and abuse to self-sufficiency.   A journey of freedom and friendship to hope, security and dignity. Without a doubt, the holistic approach of FFFs program works and any donation becomes part of a journey, a rescue and a liberation.
Finding Freedom Through Friendship, Inc.	322370		/users/profile/270460	amendie23	General Member of the Public	5	01/30/2017	Finding Freedom Through Friendship is so successful because it is run by dedicated, passionate, selfless individuals who genuinely care for Guatemalan women and children who need help. It is heartwarming to read the updates from FFF regarding those in the program: the food, shelter, education and emotional support provided really do change lives. It is easy to get discouraged as we face global crises and change- how can we make a difference? But FFF proves that making a difference doesn't have to be all-encompassing. It's making your small corner a better place.
Finding Freedom Through Friendship, Inc.	207779		/users/profile/270460	amendie23	General Member of the Public	5	07/30/2014	I have watched as FFF has grown over the years and I must say that I'm impressed. Jody Greenlee is compassionate and committed, reminding us all through frequent emails and updates about the importance of assisting those impoverished women and children in Guatemala. Having volunteered with Jody through another organization, I have seen the need for change firsthand and know that FFF is actually DOING something to improve quality of life as opposed to simply raising awareness. I know this organization will go far and continue to change lives for the better.
Finding Freedom Through Friendship, Inc.	298564		/users/profile/357352	Krgreen617	General Member of the Public	5	07/29/2016	Finding Freedom through Friendship is a non-profit organization that has helped many women in need in Guatemala. Their work towards building houses for many single mothers so that they and their children can have a roof over their head is heartwarming. The people involved in this organization put so much time and effort into helping others who don't have the resources to help themselves. Finding Freedom through Friendship is full of compassion!

Finding Freedom Through Friendship, Inc.	282654	1	/users/profile/64881	Mike M	Board Member	5	03/17/2016	More and more we all hear of the huge amount of donations to other charities that are siphoned off by leadership as "Administrative expenses".    Not so with FFF, Inc.!    The amount of money used for administration of funds is miniscule---an extremely high percentage of donations go directly to help the poorest of the poor.     Many kudos to Jody Greenlee, RN, and others in this organization for keeping expenses low, and help to the poor high.     What a wonderful group of caring, giving people!
Finding Freedom Through Friendship, Inc.	150614	2	/users/profile/64881	Mike M	Board Member	5	03/06/2013	Finding Freedom Through Friendship is a good way to help those who can't help themselves(i.e., abandoned women and children in Guatemala).    And your money goes a lot farther than most other charities, because our administrative staff, President, Vice President(me), and Chief Executive are unpaid volunteers!   Talk about a bargain! If you want to see real, positive change in someone's life, visit freedomthroughfriendship.blogspot.com to see it! Mike McNevin

The homes help with stability while the food provides important nutrients for brain development.  This organization is impacting children long term to help them think and grow.  In a country where most people are barely making it, Finding Freedom through Friendship is giving people hope for the future.  Priceless!

Volunteer	5	03/14/2016	In the fall of 2014, I had the opportunity to travel down to Guatemala with Finding Freedom Through Friendship Inc. There I met some of the most kind and generous people I have ever met. These people really have dedicated their lives to serving others. They are on the ground, in the homes of every family they help, learning about who they are and what they've been through. With better understanding, they were able to make the best decisions about how to help most effectively. It was a privilege to serve alongside such caring individuals who are so passionate about improving the lives of the less-fortunate.

It is amazing to see the changes in the lives of these families with whom Jody and others have become involved. 
Finding Freedom Through Friendship, Inc.	270293	1	/users/profile/359008	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/31/2015	Worked closely with this non-profit and experienced their passion and dedication first-hand. Just as important, I witnessed their shrewd use of funds, nothing is wasted and everything goes to the women they are helping (and their families). Their devotion and intelligence in regards to their charity is second to none. Because of their small unit they are able to put as much money as possible to the actual helping of these families, they are not bogged down by red tape and corporate finagling. A great charity well worth the time and money, whether you are looking to volunteer or donate or both!
Finding Freedom Through Friendship, Inc.	270111	1	/users/profile/358836	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/30/2015	I was fortunate enough to go to Guatemala with FFF this year and got to see first hand just how incredible an organization this is! So much good work is being done there! Lives truly are being changed for the better because of this organization!
Finding Freedom Through Friendship, Inc.	269575		/users/profile/358297	Writer	Donor	5	10/30/2015	Finding Freedom through Friendship truly lives up to it's name. 100% of the funds I donated went directly to widows with small children to help these Famlies break the cycle of poverty. Education, food, shelter and friendship for single mothers in need. I was there, in the villages in rural Guatemala and saw families lives being changed, hope and a better future granted by Finding Freedon through Friendship.

My parents are volunteers and board members with FFF.  I know that this organization  is  doing very good works for mothers and their children who have no help from anyone else.   I hope FFF will continue to work in Guatemala doing more wonderful things.R
Finding Freedom Through Friendship, Inc.	269478		/users/profile/358207	Writer	Donor	5	10/29/2015	This nonprofit is run by Jody Greenlee. Her many years of experience has proven results. Many women and children have experienced life saving help through her great gift of caring for those with little or no resources. Her endless work, travel and tireless contributions are simply remarkable.Your contribution will be well served. I know of no one who can help the helpless to help themselves more than Jody
Finding Freedom Through Friendship, Inc.	269377		/users/profile/358103	Writer	Board Member	5	10/29/2015	Having 3 grandsons adopted from Guatemala made my decision an easy one when choosing an organization to donate to.  Four years later, I now volunteer and travel with this team assisting single mothers and their children who have been widowed, abandoned or abused and in need of someone who cares.  FFF continues to care and execute much needed and beneficial work in a country forgotten by many.  FFF follows these women in their growth and the children in their education to see small, but significant progress.   Please take a look at this non-profit and know where your money will be used.Kathy

Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/29/2015	I have the privilege of living and working in rural Guatemala and have seen firsthand the amazing work being done in this country through FFF.   Jody Greenlee and her team of volunteers are quite literally saving the lives of some of the most vulnerable people here--indigenous women and children.  FFF is the real deal.  You can give with confidence, knowing that your donations are handled with integrity and are making an impact.
Finding Freedom Through Friendship, Inc.	205116		/users/profile/267212	LynnAnn M.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/03/2014	The problem of poverty in Guatemala is such a long-standing one with seemingly no end in sight that oftentimes the temptation is to do nothing.  The task is so overwhelming that all of our efforts seem to be a mere drop in the bucket.  But as a person who lives and serves here in Guatemala, I can honestly say that while Finding Freedom Through Friendship is not a huge operation, they have RADICALLY changed the lives of the 86 people they serve.   Because of them, some of the very weakest and most vulnerable among ussingle mothers with childrencan rest a little easier, not having to battle quite so hard every day just to survive.  If ever there was a non-profit that I would love to see be able to grow, its this one.  We are so very desperate here for the kind of hope and help theyre bringing!
Finding Freedom Through Friendship, Inc.	268905		/users/profile/357635	Julie241	Volunteer	5	10/29/2015	This is a wonderful small organization that is making a big impact on rural Guatemalans. I volunteer occasionally throughout the year and have traveled with them 2 times to Guatemala to meet some of the single mothers they sponsor. Truly amazing people, both the volunteers and the recipients of the donations, and the impact of the donated supplies, food, schooling, and occasionally houses goes a very long way for the cost
Finding Freedom Through Friendship, Inc.	208423		/users/profile/271105	Hieromv	Donor	5	08/02/2014	I can't say enough good things about this organization! This is one place where every penny that you donate truly makes an impact on the lives of women and children. It is run with true dedication to improving the lives of those they serve. 
Finding Freedom Through Friendship, Inc.	207454		/users/profile/270119	Grannycakes99	Volunteer	5	07/28/2014	FFF has made a big impact with a  small group of hardworking  volunteers in  the US and several  dedicated facilitators in Guatemala!   The choice of projects to initiate and support has led to lively discussions among the Board.  It is humbling and heartwarming to see photos and hear reports of  the  women now able to feed their families regularly and someday to own their own homes.  FFF asks only that the clients "pass it forward" in some way.  
Finding Freedom Through Friendship, Inc.	207451		/users/profile/270116	cyntaus	Donor	5	07/28/2014	I worked with members of this organization originally on medical mission to Guatemala.  In this day , it is not always easy to know what becomes of any donation you choose to make to an organization. Having volunteered with board members I can tell you that everything you do or donate goes directly to the woman and children this organization assists.  It brings tears to my eyes when I read the stories of the impact , what we would consider a small donation, can make in the lives of a "forgotten" population....woman and children in rural Guatemala. I have met these woman and children and seen what little they have.  I now make a monthly donation that I know goes directly to a family. When I say family, it is a widow in a country that provides no assistance of any kind. This amount, that to me seems small, gives a family of four, a meal and 3 girls the chance to stay in school. As a mother and medical professional , I am grateful for the education and ability I have to provide for my children. That I am safe in my home, that I do not have to worry about the physical safety of my children. I cannot imagine how painful it must be to have NOTHING to feed your children.  to know that they must stop school and work at ages we would not consider letting our kids even go out alone!  I believe that there is a place for the impact of large organizations, but I also know that one person can make a difference. If you want a personal connection to helping woman and children I highly recommend FFF.  I have worked beside the board members in a medical setting , I have volunteered with the organization providing supplies to the families and I now am a donor.  I plan to continue to help in any way I am able.  There are no finer people than those who serve this organization.   
Finding Freedom Through Friendship, Inc.	207409		/users/profile/270070	kheikkinen	General Member of the Public	5	07/28/2014	I became affiliated with FFF during my senior year of college at Lipscomb University in the Mechanical Engineering program.  FFF partnered with my advisor and helped fund our senior design project which included designing a production process for biomass charcoal briquettes.  These bio-briquettes as we called them, would improve the state of health immensely if they could be implemented in the rural areas of Guatemala.  We were successful in designing the bio-briquettes but found that to use them, cook stoves needed to be built in every house first.  Over the past few years, I have been designing and researching about cook stoves in Guatemala.  I hope to continue the relationship I have with FFF toward this project and I have thoroughly enjoyed working with them thus far.  They are a committed and passionate group that brings happiness and hope to those who feel so far away from it.  I'm so happy I could be a part of their work in Guatemala specifically with widows and single mothers.
Finding Freedom Through Friendship, Inc.	207403		/users/profile/213208	katgrammy	Board Member	5	07/28/2014	Serving others is a blessing for all involved.   Some 14 million people live in Guatemala and FFF is able to turn their focus on a group of single Mothers and their children throughout this burdened country.  It is a non-profit that continues to work diligently towards their goals, making life-changing differences in lives of people who love their country and want to be able to survive there!
Finding Freedom Through Friendship, Inc.	160808	1	/users/profile/213208	katgrammy	Donor	5	06/17/2013	The Little Things in most of our lives are HUGE to others.  FFF is a non- profit which provides a service in single  Mothers lives in rural Guatemala.  Rest assured, this non-profit is the 'real thing'.  I encourage people to read about this organization and learn for themselves how we can make a difference in someone's life through a non-profit with a HEART!
Finding Freedom Through Friendship, Inc.	205170		/users/profile/267275	Ministerios V.	Volunteer	5	07/04/2014	It is an honor to be part of this wonderful organization ...

Finding Freedom Through Friendship, Inc.	205120		/users/profile/68903	Bob and Barbara Buss	Volunteer	5	07/03/2014	Having the opportunity to meet many of the families served by Freedom thru Friendship in Guatemala, I have seen the faces of the Mothers begin to relax as they know there is food for the next meal. They are so proud to show you their safe home. The children so proudly bring their report cards to share. To be invited into these homes is such a humbling experience! The need of Guatemala is so great, it would be easy to just throw up your hands and do nothing. This organization has touched so many lives in the only way possible - one life at a time. They also provide hope for the next generation , all because someone cares! 
Finding Freedom Through Friendship, Inc.	203412		/users/profile/265329	Erin67	Board Member	5	06/21/2014	As a twenty something middle class woman in America, I have endless opportunities in front of me. After learning about Finding Freedom through Friendship via a brief information session, I couldn't help but notice the stark contrasts between my life and the lives of the women this organization serves. Here I was stressing about school and these women were worried about the most basic essentials of life. While I fuss over which professor to take my next class with, they worry about feeding their children the next meal. Education is a gift to them, while for me it was a source of stress and worry.  FFF takes this strength and perseverance that never seems to falter and invests it for positive change. Through the food donations, scholarship and community support FFF is able to make major differences in the lives of many women and their children, which will only continue the cycle of independence. It is  a true joy to be a part of this investment. 
Finding Freedom Through Friendship, Inc.	161347	1	/users/profile/213972	violetatx9	Advisor	5	06/24/2013	While neighboring countries have progressed from past woes and developed better communities and living conditions for their citizens, Guatemala's rural inhabitants are still mired in abject poverty and victim to extreme weather. The women and children within this group are often abandoned and/or abused, often showing medical anomalies not seen elsewhere. Initial medical interventions for these anomalies necessarily turned into social interventions in order to properly and holistically address this group's malaise.  FFF provides much needed shelter, food, and essential equipment in exchange for an educational,  job training and entrepreneurial commitment. The items improve living and welfare conditions for the women and children, and the knowledge transfer transitions them from complacency and hopelessness. The vetting process is thorough and the women know in advance they have three years to turn their lives around with assistance at each step along the way. The FFF team does an incredible amount of great work on a shoestring budget - a great feat considering that the group has only been in around for three years! 
Finding Freedom Through Friendship, Inc.	161276	1	/users/profile/213853	Jennifer227	Donor	5	06/23/2013	Finding Freedom through Friendship provides assistance to some of the poorest women and children on the planet - the "forgotten ones" who would otherwise have no help at all.  FFF offers basic necessities like food, housing, medicine, education, and micro loans. Mothers and children are treated with love and dignity. The long term goal is to help each women to become financially self- sufficient. All are impoverished single mothers who have been abandoned or widowed, and are completely on their own. For  them to know that someone actually cares enough to help seems miraculous, and they are exceedingly grateful. A small amount of money can make a huge difference in their quality of life!  95% of all of the money raised thru FFF goes to help the women and children. All the people running it are unpaid volunteers.  It is very difficult to find a charity like this, and hat is why I am such a strong supporter of their work.

Whether it is through the educational scholarship for children or the micro business program for single mothers this group is truly making a difference.  It is exciting to watch board members put in time and energy to make Finding Freedom through Friendship such a powerful group that has ability to impact many lives.
Finding Freedom Through Friendship, Inc.	159213	1	/users/profile/211338	Shieronymus	Donor	5	06/01/2013	This organization provides hope to famlies that struggle daily for their survival.  Their efforts to insure education for the next generation and economic opportunities address the foundational problems that trap these individuals in their present state.

We have shared so special and significant moments with these people in need ...FFF brings life expectancy, new expectations for their future! Children can go to school wearing uniforms, school supplies, shoes and socks ...It is beautiful to see the face of a fearful and anxious mother, transforming  in a face full of peace and hope... that after not having a place to live she and her children, having a place of their own which nobody will take them away!See the faces of children receiving food ... Milk, cereal, eggs, food they had not eaten for a long time, making them among their small arms and embrace these things with such joy!Thanks to FFF and generous donors, for without these funds would be impossible to bring hope, food, shelter, joy and peace to so many people! God bless you abundantly!

Finding Freedom Through Friendship, Inc.	65506	1	/users/profile/71601	joeflush	Donor	5	02/09/2011	A charity that provides important services to those in need.  The people who make up this organization work tirelessly to assure that your contributions are spent wisely. My mother has even begun knitting again and selling toboggans and donating 100% of the money to this charity, including her own costs for materials.  My sister has donated school supplies. This organization, though small, changes lives.
Finding Freedom Through Friendship, Inc.	59774	1	/users/profile/64752	Ellen	Donor	5	01/10/2011	    FFF is a wonderful organization.   On the COTA 2010 team a midwife came to the clinic and told us about doing deliveries with insufficient equipment.   She requested some specific items.  Through FFF many widwifery kits were assembled and delivered to Guatemala.   A single mother caring for 4 children also found her way to our group.  She is now in a new home with running water and electricity donated and built by FFF.  FFF also enables the children to attend school.  Clean water is also provided.   The administrative costs are minimal, making the donations really count to serve the people's needs.
Finding Freedom Through Friendship, Inc.	59057	1	/users/profile/63525	betsrn	Donor	5	12/23/2010	I am so happy to be able to support single mother's and their children in Guatemala.  By purchasing a keychain or coffee, you are able to feed someone for 2 weeks.  I give the keychains away to friends as gifts or thank you's.  People really appreciate being apart of helping others.  Guatemala is very special to me, I travel there yearly with a medical mission.  I think FFF has filled a much needed void and I have the utmost confidence that my donations are going to support those who really need help!!!    
Stray Animal Adoption Program Inc	320515		/users/profile/413157	SharonMcD	Volunteer	5	12/27/2016	I am a new volunteer with the NKY Stray Animal Adoption Program.My orientation was great.I feel I am prepared to help nurture and find forever homes for these abandon and or abused animals.  Currently, fostering a fosters family's puppy while they travel.The support and camaraderie are wonderful. 
Stray Animal Adoption Program Inc	319601	1	/users/profile/411289	a.person	General Member of the Public	1	11/29/2016	Several yrs ago I volunteered to help at an adoption event for this rescue at the Colerain  Petsmart.   I drove to Ky to help load animals and was aghast at the conditions they were kept in.  Dirty outside pens, filthy.  Maybe they didn't have as much money then, but is was awful.  It took 2+ hrs to load the dogs and get them to Colerain.  The dogs were not allowed to have water before we left.  It was at least 80 degrees that day and several dogs were left in crates outside the store in the heat.  I was not allowed to give them water because they would pee in the vans on the way home.   This was torture for those animals.  They were outside in the heat for 3 hrs. (I snuck and gave them water anyhow when I was out there alone with them)  Those dogs would have gone for more than 6 hrs in the heat without water and no one cared.  That's the one and only time I worked for her.   I am an animal rehabber and have had animals all my life.  But she did not deem me  good enough to adopt one of the dogs I felt so sorry for.   She should NOT be in this business.  I am not saying not to adopt from her, because I feel sorry for the dogs.  They desperately need to get away from that place. 
Stray Animal Adoption Program Inc	318188		/users/profile/409326	TammyGerdes	Volunteer	5	11/03/2016	It is truly amazing seeing all that this organization does, pulling these animals from horrible situation some just hours from euthanasia providing a volunteer led freedom ride to SAAP placing them in a foster home with a family who volunteered to take them in make them well love them teach them then the foster families volunteer their time as well to take them to adoption events so they can find a forever family, volunteers at those events show them off take applications and take that first family photo. I am a Foster, Volunteer, and a SAAP adopter. I love this organization.

Stray Animal Adoption Program Inc	318140		/users/profile/409273	Meweiegele	Client Served	5	11/02/2016	I adopted my dog from them about a year ago. She had already left the even for the day but they called the foster back so I could see her again and waited for my kids to get there to meet her. Everyone was so nice and helpful and I just couldn't be happier with the help and info I got from SAAP. 
Stray Animal Adoption Program Inc	318134		/users/profile/409266	Mmyatt22	Volunteer	5	11/02/2016	SAAP is beyond amazing. I entered the program with a dog I was fostering from a local shelter. They provided excellent care and advice to me and my mama dog. I have helped foster around 25+ dogs and now volunteer weekly. I see SAAP make miracles happen daily with the effort of some amazing individuals. This group and the people in it are fantastic. 
Stray Animal Adoption Program Inc	318130		/users/profile/409260	Gauriw	Client Served	5	11/02/2016	SAAP is an amazing organization! I have included a photo of my SAAP dog, Coney, on the day of his adoption in fall 2014. I visited many rescue groups and found I was most comfortable with SAAP. The volunteers were so caring, and took plenty of time to answer my questions about the dogs, as well as how to keep both my SAAP dog and my dog at home comfortable with the transition. I had recently lost our family dog to old age and the SAAP volunteers who helped with my adoption were a kind ear to listen as I was still in the healing process. I also loved that all the dogs were kept in foster homes instead of a physical shelter. After loving my SAAP dog for a year, I wanted to do more than support the organization monetarily so I joined the team in fall 2015 as a volunteer, wanting to join the people who were so caring and helpful to me throughout and after my adoption. I can now say from a volunteer perspective that SAAP is still that organization who made me comfortable in the very beginning, full of people who purely and simply love animals and want the best for each and every one that comes in our path. 
Stray Animal Adoption Program Inc	318081		/users/profile/409224	Rhonda45	Volunteer	5	11/02/2016	My husband and I have been fostering and volunteering with SAAP for over 2 years.  We are dedicated to saving shelter animals and SAAP gives us all the support we need.  Being an all volunteer non profit rescue, everyone pulls their weight and comes together like a family when there's a need.  We also have adopted our 2 cats from SAAP and they are fantastic fur babies 
Stray Animal Adoption Program Inc	318070		/users/profile/409211	Danielle106	Volunteer	5	11/02/2016	SAAP is an amazing organization that has nothing but the well-being of dogs and cats in mind. A pet in the shelter is never turned away from the program because they are too old, too young, sick, injured, frightened, pregnant, or what have you. SAAP prides itself in making good matches between pets and adopters to maintain a return rare well below the national average. SAAP does not, however, turn their back on adopters and pets once a match is made. If for any reason at ANY time an adopter can no longer care for their SAAP pet, the pet is welcomed back into the program without hesitation. All pets are placed in homes on a best match basis. All pets are spayed or neutered, up to date on heartworm preventative and age appropriate vaccinations, and micrchipped before they are made available for adoption. The pets are also in foster homes, which allows their foster parents to learn their personalities and what types of situations help them thrive. I am proud to be a small part of an organization that makes such a big impact.
Stray Animal Adoption Program Inc	318065		/users/profile/409207	Michelle402	Volunteer	5	11/02/2016	As a volunteer and adopter my life has been completely changed my the animals as well as people involved in the organization. There is no animal too sick, too old or too lost for the men and women of SAAP to immediately jump into action. The countless hours spent to getting the structure they have is as amazing as the number of animals saved. And  regardless of when you adopted,  you and your pets will always have the support and help you need. 
Stray Animal Adoption Program Inc	318062		/users/profile/409202	Sharon208	General Member of the Public	5	11/02/2016	I love this rescue!!!! They not only provided information on the dogs they have available, but they helped me determine which breed would be best for my family. They also provide support after you adopt that is amazing. If you have any questions or concerns, you can email or post on their facebook page and you get a response almost immediately. Most of the time you get multiple responses from a very knowledgeable group of people. Saap is the best I have seen so far.

Took me 2 years to even think about another pet. Happened onto SAAP site. Within a week found my forever fur baby.  I loved SAAP updates and emails to be. I became so attached to their site I started to volunteer, foster and do transports. These people are really out for these pets and try to find them the best home possible for them.  I know they really care for their every pet they adopt out

All their animals are in loving foster homes which makes it easy to find a good fit for your family as they can tell you all about their personalities! All animals are fully vetted, spayed/neutered, and up to date on everything! The adoption fee is way less than you would have to pay at the vet for all that care. Love my SAAP dog!

We had searched quite a few places and happened to come across SAAP. Not only did we feel that taking to other adopters on their Facebook page but also the fosters we knew this is where we were going to find our perfect addition! Needless to say, they are an amazing group of people and we have adopted 4 pups now and recently started fostering because we love the passion from everyone about saving these animals! They truly go above and beyond to make sure that these animals get the care they need and find their "furever" loving home. Being a part of something so awesome has been life changing for the good and we couldn't imagine not being involved now. My children love it just add much and have learned many valuable lessons not only from adopting but from fostering also!  If you have ever wanted to make a difference in the world for the better this is a great way to do so. Our pups are family and I know that each and every other person who is involved feels the same! We cannot thank SAAP and those involved enough for what they do and allowing us to be a part of their family!

Stray Animal Adoption Program Inc	301698	1	/users/profile/392674	siriusblack	Client Served	1	08/28/2016	I adopted a puppy from SAAP in March 2015 and was very happy with both the pup and the organization. However, I recently contacted them about a second dog, and was less than pleased with the response I received. After taking the time to write a personal email about how I was a repeat adopter, including pics of my pup who is now a year and a half and is thriving, I got the brush off and was simply told to fill out another application and someone would get back to me. Even though this kind of annoyed me, I filled out the same application from my first adoption, which contained all the same info I had included in my email if they had bothered to read it. Within 10 minutes I got a response denying my application for the sole reason that I leave my dogs outside while I'm at work, even though I have a secure above ground fence, a covered patio for shade and protection from rain, and doghouses for warmth in the winter... This from an organization from whom I adopted a puppy less than 2 years ago under the same circumstances! I have adopted four dogs in my lifetime, not all from the same organization, and have always been approved with enthusiasm. I'm really quite offended by their attitude.
Stray Animal Adoption Program Inc	301162	1	/users/profile/392047	Dog_Not_Spayed	Client Served	1	08/21/2016	After volunteering and adopting at/from shelters in the Cincy area with great success, I found a pup at SAAP and adopted her 8/2015. To make a long story short, her "original" vet records were not accurate and info had been whited out re: her age, vaccinations, and important info, such as a culture for ringworm on her tail, were never disclosed.  The foster mother also told me they believed she was a purebred Chow Chow, which she clearly was not. Now, one year later, I took the dog to my vet for what I believed was her 3rd UTI, which is unusual for a 1-yr. old. As it turned out, my vet discovered she was not spayed, or not completely spayed, and was in heat. After contacting SAAP, they initially insisted there was no way she wasn't spayed. So, at my cost, I ok'd a blood test which showed she definitely was not spayed. Only then did the SAAP president return my call, but stated they had no money to help with the cost of the dogs spay surgery, which will be approx. $500 including estrogen test. After I pointed out that spaying was something that was covered in the adoption agreement, he then said I could take the dog back to Pet Wow in Ky. to have her spayed (absolutely not, plus we live 4-5 hrs. away) or he would return my $160 adoption fee. Not very helpful considering the time, cost and the dog's health risk involved.At no time did anyone from SAAP offer any sort of apology, only doubt and disbelief that the dog was intact. I see they have volunteers posting 5-star reviews, so I wanted to give a little insight from an adopter's point of view in hopes no one else or their pet has to go through this.  I will not ever recommend this organization to others and will go elsewhere in the future.
Stray Animal Adoption Program Inc	235700	4	/users/profile/319372	Roxie_Knight	Client Served	2	12/19/2014	I was a bit leery of adopting from SAAP after an incident my mother had with them. They told her that she was adopting a beagle-mix that was going be about 20-30 pounds when fully grown, they dog ended up being 30 pounds by 6 months old and by the time they had to surrender it when it was a year old, it had hit the 70 pound mark. Then on the website after they had taken the dog back they said that my parents had to bring the dog back because they didn't have time for it when really it was that they couldn't handle 70+ pounds of dog at their age. Well I decided to give them a chance when I was looking for a dog, when I told them we needed a dog that could be alone sometimes but could also be sweet and cuddly. The dog we ended up finding was very sweet and they said it was a snuggle bug but once we got it home, it turns it had severe separation anxiety. The dog will not sleep in it's crate at night with howling all night, I can't even go 10 feet outside my back door to throw trash away or leave the room without it whining. If I would've know this was going to happen I would've just kept looking. Bottom line, take anything the people at the events say with a grain of salt.

On a whim we went into our local petsmart and found Lily! A beautiful 3 year old dachshund.  We were overwhelmed with the kindness and compassion that SAAP offered when we were there and even after the adoption.  So a year later when we decided that Lily needed a playmate we were lucky enough to adopt a black lab puppy from them again!  Sadie has brought so much love into our house.  SAAP stands behind their animals and if the pet doesn't work for you, they ask that you return it to them no questions asked.  They are a wonderful, deserving organization and I am so thrilled to have adopted our Furever friends from them!   
Stray Animal Adoption Program Inc	154580		/users/profile/205424	schultz_kathy	Volunteer	5	04/13/2013	SAAP is an all volunteer organization that is supported by donations and adoption monies from our rescue animals. The animals we rescue are the ones that have been either surrendered by their owners who can't care for them or from shelters,hoarding situations, or puppy mill raids. We take the sick  and the well. We put them into our homes to help them rejoin a normal living atmosphere of a loving setting. Our placement has been doing well for these animals. I am so proud to be a part of such an amazing group of compassionate people. We are ordinary people doing something extraordinary in our community. I also volunteer at a local shelter. Seeing how our animal population is treated in a day to day community gives me hope when the volunteers I work with at SAAP step up and say." Yes I will help".  The pets in our society serve a great service to those who are living alone and want and need companionship. We give these animals a second chance to fulfill the service God put them here for. To give unconditional love and to freely accept it back. I am rewarded every time someone finds the "right" animal they have been looking for. SAAP is a wonderful Rescue with a tremendous following of people coming back years later when the one special pet they adopted from us passes on. That is how we know we are doing a great service for both the community and the animals. Teri Baker has dedicated her life to this. What a great person and inspiration she has been. SAAP has been a great asset to the community for a long time. We are proud to know that they have done a service for animals and the people of our community as long as they have been doing rescue. Thank you

When we were having problems with possible food allergies they were right there to walk us through the change of food and things to watch for.  Their website is always up to date and their facebook page is awesome.  Many previous adopters keep in touch, as have we, with pictures and status checks.

I searched the internet and visited several shelter for a couple of months with no luck.  Every time I filled out an application to adopt/rescue a puppy/dog I wouldn't hear back or if I did  they were already adopted.  Much to my surprise I received a phone call on a Saturday afternoon from SAAP telling me the young dog (Susie Doodle) I filled out an application for was ready for adoption.   I wasn't able to meet Susie a.k.a. Annie until the following day and the wonderful volunteers at SAAP kept in contact with me via phone calls to let me know she would still be available Sunday morning at the Ft. Wright Petco.  The volunteers at the adoption event were VERY helpful and so happy for Annie to have found a forever home.  You can tell each and every volunteer cars so passionately for each and every animal they rescue.  Thank you doesn't begin to cover how grateful I am that our Annie was rescued by SAAP.

Volunteer	5	04/09/2013	SAAP is a animal rescue that makes sure all pups and kittens are spayed and neutered prior to going to their new homes. This is important because quite often people don't bother to have their dog spayed or neutered when given a voucher. In the event that someone cannot keep their SAAP adoptee they can and should return it to SAAP no matter how long it has been since that pet was adopted out. If a pet is lucky enough to  become a SAAP pet it has a home for life as SAAP is a all foster home rescue.

My family found our new family member through SAAP approximately five weeks ago.  My contact with the organization did not end with the adoption.  When I had questions or wanted more information, the volunteer staff were right there answering emails or making contact with me at their adoption locations.  This is one AMAZING team of dedicated volunteers that give tirelessly of their time and attention to the animals.  It is amazing when you see them posting animals they are rescuing on their site and the volunteers stepping up to take that 'just one more foster' or better yet 'that pregnant mama to nurse the mama thru birth and then caring of the 'wee little babies'.  This organization has been amazing to  so many families and it is so rewarding to follow some of the pets in their forever homes thru SAAP's facebook page.

By the end of the night, we had directions to their adoption event, had information from her foster mom, input from several other volunteers who had been around Ursula, and our application was reviewed and approved. Their commitment to finding loving, good homes was obvious. We drove 2 hours the next day to meet Ursula and everyone was just as wonderful in person. We adopted the most wonderful dog that day. Their follow up was also outstanding. SAAP really is a model for all rescues, we had such a great experience.

Stray Animal Adoption Program Inc	153209		/users/profile/204047	Farrellc1	Volunteer	5	04/07/2013	My first experience with SAAP was in 2004, as an adopter.  I knew then, that I someday wanted to be involved in similar work.  I was very impressed with the level of dedication and care shown by the volunteers throughout all of our interactions.  In 2010, I was looking to adopt again. A lot of things had changed at SAAP since 2004. But I still found the same level of care and dedication in the volunteers.  It wasn't until the end of 2011, that I was able to get involved with this community (family) of wonderful people.  I joined SAAPs Facebook group and started fostering puppies. I volunteered to help the communications team by making adoption follow-up calls. And I was soon leaning how to help out at adoption events. Before I knew it, I was coordinating one of the NKY location adoption events. Then life got extra busy and I had to scale back my involvement, but a position that allowed me to volunteer from home on a flexible schedule was soon available for me.  I became a SAAP volunteer because I wanted to make a small difference in the world. What I didnt realize at that time was that SAAP would make a HUGE difference in my world.  SAAP has:	Allowed me to make a difference and be part of something bigger than myself. 	Provided opportunities for me to learn and practice new skills. 	Taught me a lot about myself, community, belonging and family.  	Provided a positive organizational culture where individuals differences, abilities and contributions are valued and appreciated.

The staff treated me with dignity and respect, even though I had very little of these things for my self I had struggled with drugs and alcohol most of my adult life. I learned to trust God at the Mission. The curriculum and fellowship at the Mission was based on the teachings of Jesus Christ . I learned new life skills and how to properly study Gods word. The mentorship provided by Christian men like Steve, Chip and Charles was just what I needed. I stayed at the Poters house for a year. When I left I had a job a car and most importantly a new relationship with Christ. After leaving I would return to a life of drugs and alcohol but it was easy to get back on track because while at the Mision the foundation was laid. I would quickly get back on track. By Gods grace and mercy I celebrate 5 years clean and sober. There are so many things I could say about the Mission. However, it can be best sad that God used the Mission to save my life!

I have also taken many of my friends who aren't religious , but now love to serve cause of th love and help shown and seen at the mission. The staff is awesome. Like a huge family. We see all sorts of people who ask for help and volunteer and it's great how the reactions are when they are treat like humans and not anything less. This is a great place and I would love to see it grow in our community as it's grown on me...

He has a heart for the down and out of the Lexington Community. The Mission does a great service to the community by offering not just a hand out but a hand up. They have a variety of programs that they offer to both men and women. It is not just a hot meal and a place to stay for the night. They really want to help people get on the path to recovery and to be self-sustaining. They offer their services to all in need and do it all on a very tight budget. The Mission is a vital part of the Lexington Community. They have a great staff who work hard to serve those in need. I have visited the mission and you will not find a more friendly staff anywhere else. They are dedicated to the mission and vision of the organization and work hard to see that everyone who shows up at the door is helped in some way. 
Lexington Rescue Mission Inc	209145		/users/profile/271915	thevanzant	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/07/2014	I am a pastor of a church here in Lexington and have had experiences with Lexington Rescue Mission for the past seven years.   I have volunteered as a teacher, helped serve meals, and other activities and always found them to be exemplary in their organization and the attitudes that teach servant ministry.   Some of our people have asked where they could volunteer and they always bring back  positive feedback about the experience and the dedication of the staff.   I also have engaged in ministry and friendship with those who have been served and they have a deep gratitude for the LRM.  They fill a need here that is unique and vital, and it comes from the hearts of Jim and Becky and their sacrifice to God.
Lexington Rescue Mission Inc	128297	1	/users/profile/173452	Christian T.	Board Member	5	10/24/2012	I'm an attorney, a graduate of the United Way's "Get on Board" 14 week board member training program, a board member of a statewide non-profit and am now married to the person who oversees "Get on Board" for central Kentucky so I have had a lot of experience with nonprofit boards and all of their failings. The Lexington Rescue Mission is beyond reproach. Every board meeting is done in order, on time and all of our board members are prepared for the meetings, knowledgable about the subject matter and volunteer their time and talents to the mission outside of their board service. Beyond that, all of the employees of the Lexington Rescue Mission have a heart for the mission and the clients we serve and our founder and executive director, Mr. Jim Connell is exceedingly knowledgeable and hard working. I am so blessed to be a part of the Lexington Rescue Mission and plan to remain involved long after my board service, for the rest of my life. 
Lexington Rescue Mission Inc	123852		/users/profile/168594	jascarr4	Volunteer	5	09/29/2012	I have only recently begun volunteering at LRM, but it has been an amazing experience so far.  The staff and administrators are wonderful to work with and the entire operation has a positive, life-affirming attitude that I find to be infectious.  It genuinely raises my own spirits to be there and I wish I had more time and talents to offer.  The most rewarding aspect is that you can directly see the results of the great work being done there.  This mission is utterly devoted to its work and it shows. 
Lexington Rescue Mission Inc	123764	1	/users/profile/168492	Joanna V.	Volunteer	5	09/28/2012	My children and I volunteered here once. It was a great experience. We were taken on a tour and introduced to other volunteers. We helped cook the meal and serve it. This is a wonderful place and if we lived closer I would volunteer more. 
Lexington Rescue Mission Inc	123763		/users/profile/168491	Cambry	Volunteer	5	09/28/2012	I volunteered here a little bit ago and it was a great and eye opening experience. I went with my youth group and we helped serve a meal to the people who stopped in. I never realized how many people are in need of something as simple as food. It was really eye opening to me and helped me realized how fortunate I have been in my life. The people who run this organization were very kind to us and made us feel like we were a part of it. This organization is saving lives both physically and spiritually. 
Lexington Rescue Mission Inc	123757		/users/profile/168475	Stormangel	Volunteer	5	09/28/2012	Hi, My name is Linda M. and I have volunteered and still do on occasion volunteer for the LRM. I have always known about the LRM being a native of Lexington but never had any idea how fulfilling and grateful this organization can make one feel. I became a "guest" at one of the LRM's Transitional Houses back in June of 2012. Being a guest you are required to meet 20 hours of volunteer work. I chose LRM. And let me tell you it has changed my perspective and outlook on life as well as saved it. I am a recovering addict/alcoholic that without the goodness, kindness and support of this amazing organization I would have ended up only God knows where. Volunteering for LRM taught me gratitude and how to reach out my hand (as they did) and help another human being with a hand up (not a hand out).  I recommend anyone wanting to give back to their community to give till it hurts to LRM,  because you will be helping another not hurt so much and gaining a world of blessings. You have nothing to lose and EVERYTHING to gain by giving what you can. But don't take my word for it......though .experience IS the best teacher. 
Lexington Rescue Mission Inc	123755		/users/profile/168482	jaymee024	Volunteer	5	09/28/2012	I am a youth leader at a church in Kentucky. I was looking for a place for our kids to do a mission project when I discovered Lexington Rescue Mission several years ago. What a wonderful experience. They made the kids feel right at home. Took us on a tour to show us their misitry before our work that day. The kids had a very eye opening experience serving meals to those less fortunate that day. I am so glad we chose to do it at Lexington Rescue Mission. It seemed to be a great organization that really cares for those they serve. We haven't physically been back since but I keep up with them on the Internet. 
Lexington Rescue Mission Inc	123662		/users/profile/168358	Justin13	Volunteer	5	09/28/2012	Volunteering is something that I have always wanted to do but never really knew how to go about getting started.  Then one fateful day in 2009 I recieved a speeding ticket and entered into a deferral program which required me to complete some community service.  The Lexington Rescue Mission happened to be one of the options in the program.  My first time at The Mission I knew it was something special.  The people there were genuine and really seemed to care for the people coming in for assistance and meals.  The more I went the more I felt myself connecting not only with my fellow volunteers but also with the people coming in to The Rescue Mission for help.  Every time I went in to volunteer I learned something new about programs and different ways The Lexington Rescue Mission helps those in need in our community.  By the time my "community service" was completed I knew that this was not the end of my journey with The Lexington Rescue Mission.  I had learned so much about how the work they do here changes peoples lives an and in turn had started changing my life and my heart.  I wanted to do more and be more  involved with such a great organization.  Three years later I am still actively involved with the Lexington Rescue Mission not only as a volunteer but also in fund raising and other community driven activites.  I would highly recommend The Lexington Rescue Mission to anyone wanting to help and get more involved in their community!  
Lexington Rescue Mission Inc	123622		/users/profile/168308	Randy10	Volunteer	5	09/27/2012	The Lexington Rescue Mission didn't even exist in my world 4 months ago. The truth is I may never had known, had it not been for a new friend that I met 4 months ago. He shared his story and the impact that the LRM had on his life. The care, the acceptance, and the love that was provided to him reached so much farther than just his physical needs. LRM (clients and their staff) touched his soul, transformed his mind, and changed his life. God's love in the true form of service and acceptance was so attractive that I had to find out for myself and see LRM in action. My first volunteer experience was one that confirmed my friend's story. People, side-by-side, serving each other's needs, to not only build up and support the body of Christ, but also to introduce others to the healing process. No matter what your story is or where you came from, there were others prepared to stand next you and help you in your story of life. I have been volunteering at the rescue center for the last 3 months and just recently, my family became donors in this great organization that truly rescues those and includes them in this great mission. When I think of the LRM and their impact on the Kingdom, I can't help to be reminded and encouraged by God's words in Matthew 25:40. Thank you LRM for allowing me to be a part of something divine and to improve my story through giving and serving.
Lexington Rescue Mission Inc	122904		/users/profile/167436	Missy Luttrell B.	Donor	5	09/24/2012	My daughter had the opportunity to be a part of the Lexington Rescue Mission staff  as a social worker in their homeless prevention progam.  She came to them through the Mission's partnership with AmeriCorps.  Lindsey was a recent BSW graduate looking for her first job.  Not only does the Lexington Rescue Mission reach out to those in our community who are in need of help, the Mission has a history of reaching out to the young professionals who are eager to put their educational training into action.  Lindsey completed her year of service through AmeriCorps and stayed another year as a paid staff member.  Her professional and personal growth was inspired by the dedicated staff and volunteers of t he Lexington Rescue Mission.  It was a difficult decision for her to leave in order to attend graduate school. The experience she gained working with the homeless and nearly homeless through the Lexington Rescue Mission's outreach programs were invaluable as she pursued a MSW.  Lindsey speaks highly of the level of service that the Mission provides to our city and continues to maintain friendships with the staff.
Lexington Rescue Mission Inc	100529		/users/profile/122974	Bluegrass princess	Volunteer	5	11/11/2011	I am a native Lexantonian and having lived here my entire life, I have witnessed many changes. I too grew up in Fairington Apt a subsidized housing complex. I lived there from 1979 to 1991. I had no idea really how poor we were and we always had something to eat because my mother was a genius with what we had and an excellent cook. However, times and women have changed. In won't go into those obvious details. However, Jim and Becky Connell, along with Laura have answered a calling from God. I have volunteered for Klothes for Kids, Event planning for Fall Banquet and serve @ least once a month in the kitchen with Bob and Garland as well as donating all my household items to their thrift stores. I can say that I love and find fulfillment in my work ONLY because of these people. We all have a ministry as we grow to be more like our Savior and truly he does live. We weren't meant to serve alone and with my volunteering I feel I have also been ministered to by a divine holy spirit. I thank all volunteers who act in obedience to this purpose. We have angry people in this world and when they encounter a love at this mission it will soften their heart. I pray for more ideas to satisfy the great need foreseen in the future, but mostly for God to work in the clients to live life to it's abundance. In Christ Alone
Nazareth House Apostolate	261268	1	/users/profile/349865	Writer,	General Member of the Public	5	10/02/2015	Nazareth House Apostolate is the greatest non profit organization I know of. Fr. Seraphim and Vicki are truly inspirational to everyone who knows them because of the devotion they have to this cause, their love for The Lord, and their love for the people they serve. They are 100% dedicated to serving and they do everything with sincerity, integrity, and love. I would highly recommend donating to this organization as you can be sure the money will go directly towards the work that needs to be done. When so many organizations today are not deserving of trust, Nazareth House Apostolate is a breath of fresh air and truly " the real deal".
Nazareth House Apostolate	261594	2	/users/profile/350205	Tina88	Donor	5	10/05/2015	Much husband and I  were introduced to the work of Nazareth House Apostslate in 2005.  Their work in Sierra Leone is nothing short of miraculous.  Educating the people of the villages there, providing a school for 300 children, nurturing the faithful in their spiritual growth is a huge endeavor and continues to thrive. The Board of Directors guides this organization with integrity and transparency. In addition, the oversight of its parent site in Taylorsville, Kentucky provides support through medical and educational supplies, clothing in the form of school uniforms for every student, communication to local officials for the safety of its people. At St Simeon Skete in Taylorsville, pilgrims refresh their souls in prayer in an atmosphere away from the tumult of the world. The organization and leadership of this charity is above reproach. We are privileged to endorse Nazareth House Apostalate both prayerfully and financially. 
Nazareth House Apostolate	261210	1	/users/profile/349805	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/02/2015	I have been associated with NHA for over 16 years.  NHA is a nonprofit organization that receives my five star rating due to their ability to have achieved what no other nonprofit organization seems to have been able to accomplish.  Their integrity, honesty and personal front line service to the country of Sierra Leone and other communities throughout the world have set them apart from other organizations.  Their personal envolement in the day to day operations assure the success of their direct endeavors. All NHA donations are actually received by those who are being supported through their sincere and profound humanitarian efforts.   A+++

Fr Seraphim and Vicki could not be more genuine and persistent in their efforts to spread love and support to those in need.  We are so glad to have NHA in our lives and proudly consider them to be a wonderful member of our family.  Thank You NHA!!! - The Fields Family
Nazareth House Apostolate	261056	1	/users/profile/349648	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	10/02/2015	NHA is by far the greatest non profit we as a church have worked with. I am a pastor of congregation in Springdale Arkansas. After meeting with Fr Seraphim and his lovely wife Vicki we as a church just had to get involved. I can attest to the great amont of passion and devotion which they put into all thier work. If your looking for a great cause to be a part of look no further. Every cent you send goes directly to mission work!  Canon John Slavin.
Nazareth House Apostolate	260208	2	/users/profile/348764	Melody8	Donor	5	09/29/2015	The most selfless non profit organization I've ever come across. These people genuinely care and do everything in their means to help those in Sierra Leone, while making every dollar donated go a long way.  If you are thinking about feeling good about yourself by giving back, this is the place you should give to knowing all of it goes straight to saving lives.  
Nazareth House Apostolate	260206	4	/users/profile/348762	lucymansaray	Client Served	5	09/29/2015	My name is Lucy, I am a citizen of Sierra Leone, NHA has changed and saved my life.  I was but a toddler when I met Seraphim and Vicki.  NHA has placed me in the best schools in Sierra Leone and saw to my education.  I came to the States to visit them and speak with their Board of Directors about my desire to become a doctor in my country.  Especially after Ebola, Sierra Leone needs medical professionals desperately.  During my stay in America, I became ill and needed heart surgery.  Again NHA was there for me all the way.  Today I am beginning medical professional education sponsored by NHA so that my dream of helping my country can be a reality.   I have witnessed first hand the endless shipments of medical supplies, the growth in enrollment and programs in the school in Kabala that they own and operate, plus I've seen the supplies they get to the villages around Kabala.  I've helped personally deliver rice and medical supplies to Kroo Bay and in the villages.  I see the result of every donation.  I see it get to the poorest of the people.  NHA is the best. 
Nazareth House Apostolate	254209	2	/users/profile/264048	Claudio2	Board Member	5	08/27/2015	I feel that NHA is one of the few nonprofit organizations worth supporting for a few reasons:1. Every cent raised goes toward the goals set (no money is spent on high salaries for officers).2. Even without having any credit for the work being done to fight ebola in Sierra Leone, NHA continues the fight.3. Fully funding a school for children from the area and having such a high standard and achievement is    getting wide recognition and numbers are growing quickly.4. Have started a community garden that is not only feeding locals, but also teaching them to self support themselves.5. Spending money raised in Sierra Leone to estimulate their economy and employ locals.
Nazareth House Apostolate	202378	2	/users/profile/264048	Claudio2	Board Member	5	06/09/2014	I have known Father Seraphim and Vicki for over 10 years.  They have become such an integral part of our lives.  Father Seraphim baptized my children, traveled from Kentucky to our home in Georgia to give my Mother her last rights, and came back a few weeks later to conduct the funeral services.  Without them in my life, I don't know where I would be.  The power of prayer can truly be felt when at St. Simeon Skete.  As influential and devoted they are in my life, they are just as much so in the work they do in Sierra Leone.  Every dollar donated goes towards helping those in need, unlike some other non-profits where only a fraction of every dollar actually goes to those that need it.   You know, with 100% certainty, that any donation you make towards their mission work is changing someone's life.  
Nazareth House Apostolate	247452	2	/users/profile/334989	mstianchie	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/04/2015	I have been involved with NHA since 2008 as we both shared the same mission to help improve lives in Sierra Leone as they were recovering from the brutal civil war.  They, through NHA, me through One Love Foundation and EWB, both working in Sierra Leone.  To help in this area of the world was particularly challenging and we formed a friendship in a very small but powerful way to overcome those challenges to try to reach the poorest of the poor. To be successful in CONTINUING to reach the poorest of the poor, to rise above the challenges despite corruption, theft, greed, lack of funding, etc., that is the true beauty of NHA and that is unique. The  money collected is buying uniforms, food, education, medical supplies, and I can attest that NHA is succeeding. "Small-small"  as they say in Salone, but with so much heart, following through to the very end. Shoes on  children's feet, rice when it's needed the most. James Mansaray is truly trustworthy and that is very hard to find but it makes all of this possible. In the right hands, bigger can be better.  I believe and support the work being done by NHA. I wish they had the millions of dollars of support that many other organizations working in Sierra Leone have but don't use for the mission intended.  I ultimately had to admit defeat in my own mission and had to close the doors, but NHA continues on and pray they receive the support that will reach those that need it the most.  
Nazareth House Apostolate	247279	2	/users/profile/334791	Sarah251	Donor	5	07/02/2015	Last summer I met James Mansaray and his daughter Lucy, both from Nazareth House in Sierra Leone.  Both are so impressive and Lucy is truly inspiring.  She so desperately wants to become a doctor so she can help her countrymen and she exudes her love for Jesus. I had been giving to NHA, but meeting them has inspired me to do more, give more.  Both of them, plus many others, sacrifice so much to help those in need in Kabala, Sierra Leone, and the surrounding area.

I oversee and manage the school here in Kabala and it is my  responsibility  to provide rice supplies and medical to those in need. NHA has impacted so many lives in my poor community and its surrounding villages. Seeing the big smiles everyday on the faces of our school kids reminds me of nothing but the wonderful joy brought in by Nazareth House Apostolate. I feel so honored to be part of this noble course  and would give my life serving Nazareth House Apostolate as their goal is to change more lives in mama Sierra Leone.
Nazareth House Apostolate	204856	2	/users/profile/266922	debrahchance	Donor	5	07/01/2014	I will be honest - I had never heard about Nazareth House until my mother moved to Kentucky.  While there she became very involved with NHA and her enthusiasm is contagious.  I think they do more for the people they are trying to help than other larger organizations because their overhead is so low with most of the administrative work being done by unpaid volunteers.  Their outreach in Sierra Leone is unparalleled and I have now made them a priority in my charitable giving.  
Nazareth House Apostolate	202331	1	/users/profile/263990	lopezradio	Donor	5	06/09/2014	Father Tom and Vicki do such a phenomenal job at Nazareth House Apostolate.  The thing that I love about these two is that you don't have to be around them long to see how passionate and caring they are to everyone they come in contact with.  You also see how eager and excited they are to share their work at NHA with any and everyone.  I love receiving news hearing what they are working on and how NHA is making a difference.  There are very few people that I interact with and say, "those people are changing the world," and they are definitely in that statement.  Thank you guys for all the hard work!
Nazareth House Apostolate	201862	1	/users/profile/263427	Bob_64	Donor	5	06/04/2014	Definitely one of the very best nonprofits around. While many worldwide are worthy, the Nazareth House truly walks and talks the real deal.
Nazareth House Apostolate	201794	3	/users/profile/263329	Peter47	Donor	5	06/03/2014	Nothing in the world is equal to Nazareth House Apostolate. There are many great charities, and service done by others is vital where they apply their heartsong for those in many kinds of need. But Nazareth House is the God-Heart child of a man on a mission, with a life-path so unique, especially among Americans, as to defy description. Father Seraphim, aptly named, has served in Christian ministries of every kind, followed ancient roads to spirituality, and shed any Western-driven norms while staying completely in concert with Jesus Christ, that the outgrowth of this ministry runs pure and clear as a high mountain stream. The NHA work in Sierra Leone, borne out of deep suffering and prayer over a war-torn nation, give life to hundreds of children who live, learn, and survive the world's highest infant and young-child mortality environment, with stories I am not fit to tell. These little ones will change the country, and thus the world. From those distant shores to the St. Simeon's Skete in the rolling Kentucky countryside, an air of deep devotion, steady visions shared without cost, and the chance to walk the spiritual trail with Fr. Seraphim and his wife, Vicki. The experience has changed the many who have stayed there. It's an Anglican-Orthodox-Catholic-Evangelical Christian diving board into the pool of Jesus Himself. Father often says, almost with surprise, "I don't just love God, I like Him!" Would we all could say that with such delight every day. This ministry keeps kids alive, and we who don't struggle with that, may find there the way to keep our souls alive in these days of discouragement. 
Nazareth House Apostolate	201763	1	/users/profile/263291	anglicangeek	Board Member	5	06/03/2014	The work that NHA does in Sierra Leone is life-changing for the people they are able to help. Being a small organization, NHA is able to go where the big groups cannot, and help folks that might otherwise be overlooked. The school in Kabala is especially dear to my heart, providing an invaluable service--education--to so many children that otherwise would not have the opportunity. The Hicks are amazing administrators, doing so much good with the limited resources available. I heartily recommend donating to NHA; you can feel good knowing it will be put to good use.
Nazareth House Apostolate	201269	1	/users/profile/262736	Jeff75	Donor	5	05/29/2014	 St. Simeon Skete/Nazareth House Apostolate is a wonderful charity.  They take a hands on approach and really care about the people, kids and school they founded in Sierra Leone, West Africa. The administrator does all in her power so donations are used wisely. Most of her energy is spent to see that the school, kids and people they help have everything that is needed. That is important.The Board of Directors totally believes in their mission and are very conscientious of  any and allefforts they make. In my past, I helped to incorporate and  administer another non-profit for eight years.
Nazareth House Apostolate	200906		/users/profile/262322	STAAMC	Volunteer	5	05/27/2014	Nazareth House Apostolate continues this day and everyday in the tradition of the Apostolic Fathers to execute the Great Commission of our Lord, "You will make Me known to the whole world," and they do this by "helping the least of these," specifically in the incredibly challenging environ of Sierra Leon, West Africa with a ministry directed at educating children while, at the same time, improving the general health of those children and their adult relatives.  There are, I am sure, many similar efforts being performed by all manner of other organizations.  But I dare say that none have done so much for so long with so very, very little.Reverend Father Michael V. Church+Vicar, St. Thomas Aquinas Anglican Mission ChapelMontgomery, Alabama

I can honestly say that my life, and my spiritual life has truly been enriched by the ministry of NHA. They are a wonderful Religious and humanitarian organization. I have not been able to give as much as I would like to give to them, but what I have given I know has gone to a wonderful cause, helping children in Sierra Leon. I try to donate as much as I can to this organization, be it money or prayers. I am so very thankful of NHA and for their guidance in my life. I have become a better person through their ministry.
Nazareth House Apostolate	200878	1	/users/profile/262272	Paul127	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/26/2014	Nazareth House Apostolate is committed to finding those who fall between the cracks, and showing them Jesus' love regardless of their situation.  NHA operates on a shoestring, but still all the donations intended to support those in need actually do so (rather than supporting administration), either at their school in Kabala, Sierra Leone, or amongst others in that country struggling just to make it through one day.  Additionally, NHA approaches those they serve with the attitude that Jesus is already there in the poor, sick, and cast-out, and simply seeks to meet Him there in them.

We appreciate seeing pictures of the goods arriving in Sierra Leone; we KNOW those who are in need are the ones receiving what is given.  Having met Father Seraphim and Vicki and James, we can vouch for their integrity and their love.  We feel blessed to support their ministry!
Nazareth House Apostolate	200822	1	/users/profile/262194	Cassandra8	Donor	5	05/24/2014	So grateful for the work that NHA does.  And the communication that comes from Sierra Leone after a donation means the world!  It is personal and clearly appreciative.  I also respect the way the organization is run and the desire to make the current project sustainable by the locals so that efforts can be expanded elsewhere.  To know that my money is helping to heal an entire country from the devastation of war, one village at a time, is a source of joy and satisfaction.  And to know I can trust this organization to distribute 100% of the money I give, directly to people I see in the pictures of appreciation brings peace of mind.
Nazareth House Apostolate	200821		/users/profile/262191	Beth98	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/24/2014	Nazareth House Apostolate is one of the best charities I have ever supported.  All of the money brought in goes directly to the people of Sierra Leone.  The Missionaries, Fr. Thom and Vickie, are the salt of the Earth; every ounce of their passion, dedication, and spirituality goes toward helping the poor - both in Sierra Leone and here in the US.  I have no reservations recommended this charity to others; in fact, it is one charity where I am certain that every penny goes to its mission.
Nazareth House Apostolate	179909		/users/profile/205029	emmbee	Donor	5	10/19/2013	This small charity must surely do more for it's recipients than most, regardless of their size--and Vicki is the power behind it, and at NO PAY!  She and her husband, Fr. Seraphim, take care of hundreds of poor people of all ages in Sierra Leone, regardless of religion (or lack thereof).  They fly over there bringing suitcases filled with much needed medical and non-medical supplies, use a rental car, and, with the aid of helpers there, travel miles over substandard and dangerous roads; and on most trips, they walk many more when the roads give out--still hauling food and other goods.  They are among the most loving, caring, and dedicated people I know of, and I wish that I could do more.
Nazareth House Apostolate	154199	1	/users/profile/205029	emmbee	Volunteer	5	04/11/2013	Long before Vicki and her Sierra Leone family arrive, the roads and footpaths out of Freetown are lined with thankful, eager villagers awaiting them. They travel by rented car, and walk miles off the more passable roads to reach groups of sometimes only two or three families, bringing food, medicine, hope, and love.  The school is thriving, the children dressed in uniforms that Vicki and many volunteers make. NHA likely does more for more people than any other charity of its size--and with far less.  I have been a 'helper' for a number of years now, and wish that I had a fortune to give.  
Nazareth House Apostolate	177422	1	/users/profile/217470	lholt dickson 70	Board Member	5	10/14/2013	I first became involved with Nazareth House Apostolate in early 2008 after having retired from a non-profit organization in Charleston, SC and moved to Louisville, KY.  In my quest for a church to attend regularly, I found not only that but NHA, Father Seraphim and Vicki Hicks!  The idea of NHA struck myheart strings....I had retired from a non-profit charged with providing food for the hungry primarily.  Here was my opportunity to help not only help a God driven cause to feed, clothe, provide medical care, housing and education to some of His most needy and abused people...Sierra Leone...  I became absorbed in His Mercy working with so little yet accomplishing so very much.  I moved back to Augusta, GA in 2010 and have not ever stopped supporting NHA with prayers, money and any other assistance I have been instrumental in providing.  To know children are able to obtain educations hence allowing them to make better lives for themselves and others, especially since God charges us all with the care of each other, makes my life a much richer one.  Visit the NHA website for photos of how the money donated is used...you will be AMAZED!!  I am personally awed every  time I see those people and how much NHA does with so very little!!!  Do yourself one of the biggest and most important favors you will ever do for yourself -  BECOME A REGULAR DONOR TO NAZARATH HOUSE APOSTOLATE....REMEMBER..  YOU CAN'T OUT GIVE GOD!!  YOU will be greatly blessed!  I know this to be factual because I AM BLESSED BEYOND MY WILDEST EXPECTATIONS! Your donations are also tax deductible.
Nazareth House Apostolate	155555	1	/users/profile/206472	cmasson	General Member of the Public	5	04/21/2013	NHA is a religious organization that works in Sierra Leone not to prosthelytize but to improve the lives of the people in rural communities. These people benefit from NHA's commitment to education through access to a school run by locals. In addition, NHA is committed to public health by providing medical treatment and supplies as well as preventive medical resources to the community. Although NHA is based out of Kentucky, it truly has a grassroots feel because it involves and empowers the people of Sierra Leone to increase the wellbeing of those around them.
Nazareth House Apostolate	155239		/users/profile/206117	madrake	Board Member	5	04/17/2013	NHA provides a primary education to 300+ students in Sierra Leone, paying local teachers, and providing them with one classroom and education materials and uniforms. NHA provides food and medicine to a number of villages and families in places ranging from Kabala to Freetown. They provide assorted other humanitarian aid as needed. NHA is run by Vicki and Father Seraphim, who are street savvy and practical and want to make a difference in small communities and maintain a personal connection with those they help. They strive to make very smart decisions about how to spend donation money and use it wisely. Two things that initially attracted me to NHA and continue to be true:- This work is the charitable output of a cloistered religious organization based out of rural Kentucky. NHA has essentially zero overhead and all money donated for the work in Africa actually makes it there.- While this is the mission of NHA, it's not "missionary", it's about helping others. This is not a crusade, or even an overt attempt to convert non-Christian folks in Sierra Leone. The organization gets along quite well with the local Muslim communities and receives their support.
Nazareth House Apostolate	154507	1	/users/profile/205338	Fr Tim	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/12/2013	Then shall the King say unto them on His right hand, "Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: For I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in: Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me." Then shall the righteous answer Him, saying "Lord, when saw we Thee an hungered, and fed Thee? or thirsty, and gave Thee drink?  When saw we Thee a stranger, and took Thee in? or naked, and clothed Thee?  Or when saw we Thee sick, or in prison, and came unto Thee? And the King shall answer and say unto them, "Verily I say unto you, inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of my brethren, ye have done it unto Me." Read the above in The Gospel of Saint Matthew 25: 34-40Live the above at Nazareth House Apostolate 365: 24-7 I have personally known Father Seraphim and Vicki for over 10 years.  Their daily goal is to be sheep sitting on the right hand of our Lord.  NHA makes a huge difference in the world one hungry person at a time, one thirsty person at a time, one stranger at a time, one naked person at a time, one sick person at a time, one prisoner at a time -- so donating here makes a difference every time.  They provide for those in need both materially and spiritually.  NHA staff are glorious pioneers among the high passes of the Kingdom of God, who have scaled heights which other charitable organizations have seldom even seen afar off.  Go NHA!!!
Nazareth House Apostolate	153232	1	/users/profile/204067	Joan33	Volunteer	5	04/07/2013	Who would have guessed that in Taylorsville, Ky. one would  find such a worldly and spiritual organization. Manned by a staff of two, Vickie and Father Seraphim, I am astounded by the amount of work accomplished. If the two worked in the private sector they would be successful  entrepenuers. But that is not where their heart or calling is directed. Therefore they must as Father puts it (beg for) their money and resources. However, what they receive never stays with them. For although they are physically here they are driven to care for the poorest of the poor. They have found this in Siere Leon and with their loyal assistant James  living on site have been able to do impossible things to change so many shattered lives.  To continue to do this challenges all. Father Seraphim has a heavy burden  praying almost nonstop for those  who most need Gods help both here and abroad. As one steps onto this serene property a peaceful  atmosphere permeates the soul but belies the furious hard workings going on in an unrelentless effort to save poor and poorer souls. 
Nazareth House Apostolate	261268	1	/users/profile/349865	Writer,	General Member of the Public	5	10/02/2015	Nazareth House Apostolate is the greatest non profit organization I know of. Fr. Seraphim and Vicki are truly inspirational to everyone who knows them because of the devotion they have to this cause, their love for The Lord, and their love for the people they serve. They are 100% dedicated to serving and they do everything with sincerity, integrity, and love. I would highly recommend donating to this organization as you can be sure the money will go directly towards the work that needs to be done. When so many organizations today are not deserving of trust, Nazareth House Apostolate is a breath of fresh air and truly " the real deal".
Nazareth House Apostolate	153079	2	/users/profile/203937	dogbane	Donor	5	04/07/2013	We have known Vicki and Father Seraphim Hicks since 2005 when we moved to Louisville, KY. Father Seraphims uncompromising spirituality drew us to his church, where we learned more about the mission of Nazareth House in Sierra Leone. Vicki is the administrator of Nazareth House, as well as the treasurer, public relations liason and mail boy. She does it all with the oversight of a dedicated board of five others, none of whom receives, to our knowledge, compensation as a member. (The three civilian board members are in fact reliable contributors to Nazareth House.)  We can attest to the modest lifestyle of Father and Vicki, so that if she is paid from donated funds over and above her expenses, it is not very much.  The Hicks do not vacation or buy new clothes and furniture. Seraphim takes no salary at all.One expense of running Nazareth House is airfare for rare trips to Sierra Leone. But once there, Vicki attends to villagers illnesses and Father travels on foot to villages with his prayer beads (not to convert anyone, just to pray). They reside on site with James, NHAs Sierra Leone representative, and his family and do not seek out a comfortable hotel room.Father and Vicki have witnessed abhorrent things done to the people of Sierra Leone. The Hicks goal in all this is to keep more Sierra Leoneans alive and whole and give them hope of a future. 
Nazareth House Apostolate	152967	2	/users/profile/203834	Kathy100	Donor	5	04/06/2013	I have had the privilege of visiting their base of operations in Taylorsville, KY and witnessed the hard work and dedication of this small group of people. I have helped Vicki, Mama Vicki, package up boxes for shipment to Sierra Leone; it is amazing the amount of stuff this woman can fit in to a USPS fixed postage box at $60 a box she needs to get as much as possible in each one. Now there is a weight limit she must contend with but she thinks of everything, "I use tuna packets to fill empty spots. They need protein." Truly no organization has done so much with so little. The supplies are walked into the remote villages where others will not go. It is dangerous and hard. Children are dying of worms, intestinal parasites! they would not die if they could get enough medicine. They built a compound in the safer town of Kabala employing local builders. "It is important that we buy what we need and employ who we need there to boost the economy." Vicki's makes one dollar work like two. She and her husband have given all to help these people, to love these people. They have cried and laughed with them, they have celebrated life and mourned death with them; they are family, we are family. Your donation will not only support what they already do: support a school for 300 students, support five villages, supply a medical clinic and employ a nurse, provide clean water (They hired native men who hand dug the well), etc. The long term goal is to provide the means by which these people will no longer need Nazareth House Apostolate. "Then", says Mama Vicki, "we will move on to another area in need." 
Nazareth House Apostolate	152925	4	/users/profile/203801	Deedee M.	Donor	5	04/06/2013	They help Saloneans in need, plain and simple. Nazareth House Apostolate receive over 85% of our charitable giving, chiefly, because it is a small organization with over 90% (think it was 96-7%?) of their donations going towards humanitarian aid  and *not* frivolitiies.  Four years ago, we learned about NHA via a prayer workshop highlighting their work in the mission field of Sierra Leone. Many Saloneans (Sierra Leone citizens) do not have their basic needs of food, water, shelter and safety met. NHA distributes rice, but, often, are only able to distribute small quantities due to lack of funds and the greatness of the need over there.  Medication is distributed, but in regular doses via the operations manager, James. This prevents poverty convincing the aid recipient that it would be better to sell the medication rather than take it and care for themselves. Anti-worm medication is often distributed because clean water isn't regularly available and parasitic infestation occurs easily in such an environment.  I'm able to relate all of these details to you, because NHA is forthcoming with their missionwork. They are more than happy to show pictures of how your donations are being used.  The staff are very accessible for communication, via phone, email, their website, and Facebook.  Because their focus is on food, medicine, safe housing, and education, many of our secular friends have been comfortable donating to NHA. It is true that it is mission work of a monastery and church in Kentucky, but they distribute aid according to need. They help Saloneans regardless of Muslim or Christian.  Like I previously wrote: They help Saloneans in need, plain and simple.
Nazareth House Apostolate	152911	1	/users/profile/203790	Vicki32	Board Member	5	04/06/2013	Being a part of Nazareth House Apostolate is more than a position as board member or donor or volunteer - its being a part of a family that works together to help each other out.  From the giver to the receiver, everyone gets to know each other - there are faces behind the needs and faces behind the donation - everyone benefits.  Through this family-like bonding much has been accomplished.  We have built, operate, supply and support a school in Kabala, Sierra Leone that educates 300 students.  Its a free school, too - we do not charge tuition and we supply the uniforms - all from the donations we receive.  Medications and hospital supplies are provided both to individuals in needs and many clinics in the area. Families are given the boost they need in food, shelter - whatever the need - so that their families can function and flourish.  We've put in wells for fresh water, built a compound that houses our staff and supplies. Daily aid is given.   Check out our blog and you will see your donation in action.  http://blog.nazarethhouseap.org/

It was an awesome expierence. We were blessed as well as the people we fed. Our church collects food donations for Open Hands throughout the year. It is one of the ways God provides us to serve others. Open Hands is a wonderful organization and my prayer is that they would be able to continue to serve the community and show the love of Jesus Christ to the people who use their services.

The organization is professionally operated to enable anyone in need to food to obtain it when necessary.  It is an excellent community servant in that it works well with other community entities both in supportive and receiving roles.  Open Hands Pantry provides opportunities for people of all ages to learn about the importance of giving to others in need, as well as working as a volunteer to benefit others.

Lamp and Light Ministries Incorporated	163809	1	/users/profile/217566	June Gardner	Volunteer	5	07/29/2013	I love the Helping Hands Food Pantry.  I volunteered there for a week, it was the best week of my life.   The joy it was to serve the people in that area,  and watch the faces when we gave them food.  Not only did I get to serve but I prayed for 68 families and passed out prayer rocks.  It was very touching to listen to their stories, and made me realize what a servant is all about.  I would love to go back and spend some more time there.  I believe each person in the Lawrenceburg area needs to volunteer at least one day to see the joy in people heart.  This is what we are called to do.  God Bless David for all he does to help the community.
Lamp and Light Ministries Incorporated	163807		/users/profile/217564	liz.zopff	Volunteer	5	07/29/2013	I help serve meals once a month at Open Hands with a group of people from different churches in our area. The building is fantastic, handicap accessible, and serves so many needs. The kitchen is fully equipped, with plenty of room to prepare and serve food. There is enough seating in the dining area for 80 or so people, including a highchair and booster seat. The pantry area keeps non-perishables, breads, fresh fruits, and vegetables on their numerous shelving units, and I've noticed deep freezers and refrigerators for essential perishable items.  I know volunteers do deliver meals and groceries to those unable to leave their homes. In my experience, the people who come are kind, warm, and grateful. They come from all different backgrounds, and ages. Many eat as though they haven't in a while, preferring meats and high fat foods to sustain them, especially in the winter. Open Hands fills an immense need.

Lamp and Light Ministries Incorporated	126190		/users/profile/171267	dhender	Donor	4	10/16/2012	My church donates to  the pantry and that is how I came to know about it.  There are so many needy people in our community, a large number of them Senior Citizens that are having a difficult time trying to survive on Social Security.  There are not a lot of resources in our small, fairly rural community and for many, Open Hands Food Pantry is the differnce between eating and not eating at all.  Several churches in the area provide a free meal on one or two days a week which is a  huge help,but the Pantry still has a hard time keeping their shelves stocked. The last time I went with a Sunday School class to help serve I was surprised by the number of people served meals that one night and by how scantily stocked their shelves were!  I was overwjelmed by the need in my community!

Lamp and Light Ministries Incorporated	113696	1	/users/profile/154696	katiehoward	Board Member	5	06/04/2012	Open Hands has been faithfully serving Anderson County's neediest residents with food, love and encouragement. A typical month brings nearly 400 families, representing almost 800 individuals, to our doorstep. These families live in poverty, and find themselves without food. They often are also suffering from disabilities, job loss and other family hardships. The volunteers treat everyone who walks in as family and give whatever they can, operating on a shoestring budget. Their work is amazing!
Christian Appalachian Project, Inc.	319670		/users/profile/411433	pevveddonor	Donor	1	12/01/2016	I donated $25.00 as a ONE TIME DONATION but today when I got my bank statement it was marked as a recurring monthly donation. It bothers me that they took the opportunity to help themselves to my bank account. I will take steps today to make sure they will not benefit from my account any longer. BTW, I was under the  impression this was a small church group raising money for locals but now I found out this is a very pushy organization.   
Christian Appalachian Project, Inc.	297698	7	/users/profile/388504	MattieRoss	General Member of the Public	4	07/22/2016	First let me say, I have not ever worked here or even contributed to this organization. I might contribute after the research I just did though. There are many worthy needs out there including this one. I looked this charity up in Forbes reviews. Based on their report of the revenues of the charity compared to expenditures on the Appalacian people in need, it does pretty well. Most of the complaints of the people reviewing on this site are related to being solicited so much (that is super annoying. I have that complaint about several charities. I'd like to see this practice stopped as once or twice a year is enough) and the high salaries of the people running the place (not really bad if you want good administration) BUT it seems most of the money goes to the charitable work of the organization. Also, one of the reviews I read on this site was by a former volunteer and it was very good. 
Christian Appalachian Project, Inc.	296809	4	/users/profile/387586	casey23	Donor	2	07/17/2016	I have been donating for several years! After reading of these reviews I question this organization!! I don't think someone who runs a charitable organization should be making a high salary!! I work hard for my money and want to know it's getting to the people who need it not salaries!!
Christian Appalachian Project, Inc.	291400	3	/users/profile/381811	Guy A.	Board Member	5	05/30/2016	Hello Kathryn43. The top salary at CAP is mine, which is under $185,000. Anyone with questions is encouraged to contact me directly at gadams@chrisapp.org. All questions are welcome. Blessings, Guy Adams, President & CEO
Christian Appalachian Project, Inc.	275103	23	/users/profile/364666	Kathryn43	Donor	2	12/29/2015	I researched charities this time when donating. CAP had been one of my favorites, & I only get a few solicitations. Charity Navigator only gave them 2 stars, but with 83.5% of funds raised going to programs, which is good. What really bothered me was the listed top salary of $531,000 which is obscene for a charity of this sort!! I wish I knew what to really think.... Sounds like some projects are really good, & they certainly are needed, but I question the efficiency...
Christian Appalachian Project, Inc.	255664	12	/users/profile/344042	ClaireKat899	Volunteer	5	09/09/2015	I volunteered with CAP during 2004- 2005.  I had an amazing experience and the organization has truly impacted the people of Eastern KY in a positive manner.  CAP provides wonderful programs including housing repair, child care, respite,  after school care, adult education,  elderly care, and a host of other programs.   There is a paid staff that is part of CAP and a board of directors... without which the organization would fall apart.  Father Ralph Beiting started the organization 50 years ago and it is a huge undertaking... not everyone can be a volunteer anymore as there is too much work to do and plus... it's providing jobs for people in the area.    Please consider volunteering for this organzation... it is a life changing experience.  
Christian Appalachian Project, Inc.	235350	52	/users/profile/317905	Oren T.	General Member of the Public	1	12/11/2014	I saw an ad for this so-called charity on the UP tv channel.  I'm so glad I decided to do some research before giving money.  Looking at the reviews, the only POSITIVE ones I'm seeing are from board members.  To me that is extremely TELLING.  I will not give one cent to a 'charity' where the president makes an obscenely high salary and the professional fundraising harasses people.  This is an example of what began as a GOOD organization and has now been corrupted into a money making machine.  Shame on the people who have ruined this and are taking money intended to help the poor and are putting it in their own pockets.  God will judge you and you will see what you have done when you are punished.

Christian Appalachian Project, Inc.	170311	43	/users/profile/225641	LizM	General Member of the Public	1	09/18/2013	I To Have Been Pushed Away By The Frequent Solicitations For Donations In The Mail.  What A Waste!   What Jumps Out At Me Reading These Reviews Is The Overwhelming Number Of Over-Paid Executives Having To Write 5-Star Reviews To Defend Their Charitable Organization...And It Still Only Bringing It Up To A 3-Star Overall Rating.  How Sad.  The Wonderful, Kind-Hearted, Giving Appellation People Deserve Better Advocates!!!  I'm Sure If Someone Took The Time To Add Up All The Money Spent Directly To Help The Appalachian People Under The New Administration And Compared The Total To The Money Spent On The Organization (Salaries, Overhead, DirectMail, Publicity, Etc.), The Organization Would Prove To Be the Greatest beneficiaries Of Our Hard-Earned Donations Of Late!  ShameOnYou!
Christian Appalachian Project, Inc.	159399	45	/users/profile/211556	DTRT	Donor	1	06/04/2013	I can tell you that I am offended by the mailers, especially when they have coins glued in them....what a waste of resources!  Am I'm sorry but G Adams getting over $171k per year to run a CHARITY? ....that's just plain sick!  CHRISTIAN App should remember the scripture that says 'anyone who leads one of these little ones astray...it is better to have a stone around his neck and dropped into the depth of the ocean than to experience the wrath of God. You're greed has become your focus just like every other company in America....and you will pay for it.....
Christian Appalachian Project, Inc.	158764	43	/users/profile/210676	Jorg	Donor	1	05/24/2013	This is the third time I erite the review -your website knocked me off twice.We know Cap for 25 plus years. Father Beitng was in charge. Cap had an asssociated busine4ss selling Xmas wreaths. We gladly gave to the organization helping the poor of Appalachia. Thedn after some years Father Beiting was out (Did he die I never heard of it) Now there was a Charity BUSINESS with all the consumer trimmings. We asked to reduce the mail and stop phone calls. On Nov. 18 2011 I sent a registered letter to Sue Sword to stop our association. Mailings continued -2 letters at a time- ever since. The letters went iinto the fire -unopened. I feel responsible for the donors, now; they need to know how their money is wasted. I feel mre sorry for the charity recipients -there is so much more they could get with a decent administration.

Christian Appalachian Project, Inc.	152951	4	/users/profile/203821	ShannaE	Board Member	5	04/06/2013	I have been a board member since 2005 and have seen first hand what a wonderful program the Christian Appalachian Project (CAP) has developed.   They are a service based organization that tries to strengthen the people of Appalachia and help them find a way out of poverty.  I have served on the Development Committee as well as currently serving as the chairperson of the Program Committee and have seen the kindness of our employees and their willingness to help those in need.  One of my favorite  programs is our alternative spring break Work Fest , which benefits people whose homes have fallen into disrepair.  How wonderful to teach college students to help those less fortunate.  It has been a privilege to be associated with this organization. 
Christian Appalachian Project, Inc.	152816	6	/users/profile/203716	Tony-H	Board Member	5	04/06/2013	I have been a Board Member for 8 years, have chaired the Personnel Committee, been Board chair for 3 years.  I also assisted with upgrading the camp facilities and volunteer housing.  CAP has continuously reviewd its mission, and strives to provide the maximum impact on people in need for the funds they receive.  They look at the whole of hte person and their situation including the family.  If the child has needs, they also look at the housing as this child cannot do good work in a poor environment. CAP continuously evaluates the needs of the area and adopts to those needs.
Christian Appalachian Project, Inc.	152377	7	/users/profile/203394	rjrams2	Board Member	5	04/05/2013	I have been a board member for over ten years.  I have served on the finance and audit committees during that time.  I have also participated in Workfest, and I have visited other operations.  I can say the people of CAP are honest, hard-working, and devoted to serving the people of Appalachia.  The legacy of Fr. Beiting is strong in that CAP works to serve the needs of of the poor many ways.  We recently decided to focus on development of Appalachian children through their families, while maintainingg service to the elderly.    I have seen CAP lead college students to change houses that were virtually unlivable into decent homes.   I can also tell you that the board is conscientious about ensuring donor money is well spent in accordance with our mission.  CAP does invest in fund-raising because the environment for charitable giving is very competitive, but the money that is raised is well-spent.
Christian Appalachian Project, Inc.	151281	47	/users/profile/201935	David142	General Member of the Public	1	03/19/2013	In May of 2010 my Father In Law passed away and my wife and I moved back in with his widow, my wife's Mother, to care for her since she's in her late eighties and has senile dementia and severe hearing loss.  We inherited a mess.  My mother in law was donating money to multiple charities and was a member of thirty plus book clubs.   Most, if not all, of those book clubs continued delivering books to the address and a mountain of debt was incurred.  My Mother In Law didn't remember ordering them, and thought they were gifts. In the category of charities, Christian Appalachian Project was one of many, and it was sending multiple requests for money in two different names at the same address.  Both addressed to the Mother In Law.  Since May of 2010,  both my wife and I have called the Lexington Office to remove the address from the mailing list,  Mom obsesses that she should do the Christian thing and donate money to the charity.  And it goes on for days.  Early on we learned to hide the contacts from CAP.  We can do that since we're her guardians in the home.  We've also e-mailed CAP, and made numerous contacts on Facebook.  Still, the contacts come.   Recently I gave up.  I got tired of hearing the same excuse repeatedly from the people at CAP, especially Phyllis Caudill.  So, I submitted our evidence and filed a complaint with the Indiana Attorney General's Office, and after a short period, CAP through Phyllis Caudill responded to the mediation with the IAG.  Glaring omissions notwithstanding, we were assured we wouldn't receive anymore contacts.  Since that letter from the IAG, CAP has contacted us through the mail twice in two consecutive months. I have serious doubts about the legitimacy of this group.  I get angry when I think of anyone trying to ask for money from an 89 year old woman who can't hear well even with hearing aides, and has senile dementia.   It's been twenty months.  Enough is enough already.  If it goes a full two calendar years, I'm seeing a lawyer about harassment. Luke 20:47English Standard Version (ESV)47 "who devour widows' houses and for a pretense make long prayers. They will receive the greater condemnation.
Christian Appalachian Project, Inc.	150681	10	/users/profile/200940	Jeffrey G.	Volunteer	5	03/07/2013	I have volunteered and continue to do so on a short term basis, in Housing, typically spending 5 months a year with them since 2009.  CAP is an excellent organization to volunteer with, and has a direct and effective impact on the lives of those in Appalachia it serves. It also has a life changing impact on the college students who sign up to volunteer each spring on alternative spring breaks, known as Workfest (similar program for high school students, Youthfest).  Like so many charities, it has been severely stressed by the reduction of donations in 2012. It is not alone in this situation, and must try to maintain or solicit new donors to overcome this 25% or so decline. I cannot say enough about this organization and the opportunity it presents for volunteers to truly engage and impact the needs of the poor in Kentucky.
Christian Appalachian Project, Inc.	149723	16	/users/profile/171857	Guy Adams	Board Member	5	02/21/2013	In the interest of full disclosure, I am the president/CEO of Christian Appalachian Project (CAP) and a Board member. My purpose in posting a review is to address both reviews posted on 1-9-13. First, in the review written by gfawkes1151916, it states that our website is misleading because we list a respite care program, when we no longer have one. This is false. We no longer have a residential respite program, however, CAP continues to provide respite care through an in-home respite program with three full-time employees who travel extensively to help meet the needs of families and individuals providing care to disabled loved ones. We provide up to 5 hours of relief at a time to allow individuals the opportunity to take a break and to  do what they need to do. Second, LaPointe implied that our founder, Reverend Beiting, would not be pleased with CAP in recent years. To my knowledge, until his death on August 9, 2012, he was very proud that CAP's mission continued to make a difference for people in need in Appalachia. It was a blessing to me to have served CAP with him for 3 1/2 years from 1982 - 1985. When I was asked to return to CAP in February 2010, I did so with a strong sense of keeping Reverend Beiting's legacy strong because the challenges of people in need in Appalachia continue to be great. CAP is a transparent organization. Our IRS Form 990 is accessible on our website. Anyone with questions can visit us any time, scheduled or unscheduled, to see firsthand how we operate. We have nothing to hide. Should anyone want to call us to have questions answered, please call (859) 269-0635. May God bless you, Guy
Christian Appalachian Project, Inc.	147903	11	/users/profile/195711	LaPointe	Professional with expertise in this field	1	01/09/2013	This organization is awful and does not have the view that Cap orginially had.  Father Biden would turn over in his grave to see this place that has become more money hungry than client concious.
Christian Appalachian Project, Inc.	147888	9	/users/profile/195687	gfawkes1151916	General Member of the Public	1	01/09/2013	Mr. Patton states CAP scores highly on transparency, and I'm sure he is referring to finances; however transparency indicates honesty and truthfulness.  As of today, CAP's website- under the heading "Who We Serve" and "Disabled" they list Respite services.  They closed this program and terminated the employees quite some time ago.  This type of misrepresentation happened when CAP closed down their Adult Education programs.  Years after the programs had been closed, they were still being advertised on their website as services CAP was offering the area.And, I am not surprised Mr. Patton promotes himself as a businessman.  "More bang for your buck" is a very businesslike attitude - but not one that should necessarily be associated with a "Christian Nonprofit."  I'm sure to a businessperson, outsourcing American jobs to China, India, and Pakistan gives you more bang for your buck.  I would think a Christian nonprofit should be more concerned with their mission statement of assisting those who are needy in Appalachia.  CAP employees that have lost their jobs, I'm sure, do not see it as more bang for the buck.
Christian Appalachian Project, Inc.	147523	9	/users/profile/195054	Pat Patton	Donor	5	01/01/2013	I don't know if I would qualify under emerson1966's criteria as an expert, but I have been a consistent donor since 1985 and serve on the Board of Trustees for a regional non-fo-profit dedicated to welfare of senior citizens, am Secretary and member of the Executive, Finance and Co-Chair of the Employee/Volunteer Complaints Committee.  I also own two private businesses.   If you dig into the data Charity Navigator, Christian Appalachian Project scores very well for a small to medium sized charity.  Their percentages of revenues spent on administration and promotions (for donations) are relatively low - a very good sign.  They also score highly on transparency, another key variable prospective donors should review.  They should be commended, not criticized for substituting volunteers for paid employees - it gives you a much larger "bang for the buck."       
Christian Appalachian Project, Inc.	147436	5	/users/profile/167808	AES2	Volunteer	5	12/30/2012	I participated in Workfest 2005 and 2006.  Workfest is an annual gathering of college groups that travel to Kentucky during their spring breaks to help rebuild homes in Eastern Kentucky.  I am saddened to see negative reviews because both my experiences were awesome.  Workfest was organized and the team leaders were excellent.  They provided me and the other volunteers with guidance (most of us had never worked with power tools before this) and they also helped to educate us on some of the problems that people in this area face.  It is truly mind-boggling that people can be living in such poverty in this country!  The first house my group helped rebuild was owned by an 80-year old woman named Opal.  Her walls were insulated with cardboard boxes and her house was basically falling down around her.  She was extremely grateful for the work we did and not at all ashamed of her financial situation.  We visited with her at the start and end of each work day and she was always thanking and blessing us!    My second experience with WorkFest was just as good as the first.  The homeowners were extremely happy we were there and often cooked us traditional southern dishes to show their thanks. If you want the chance to step outside your comfort zone, learn to use power tools, talk to people whose lives are completely different from yours (even though you live in the same country), meet other volunteers from places all over the US, and see a very beautiful slice of America, I recommend getting involved with CAP.
Christian Appalachian Project, Inc.	147087	11	/users/profile/194246	dndntx	General Member of the Public	1	12/20/2012	It is very interesting that no reviews are from experts, clients, advisers, or board members!  It indicates that emerson1916 may have an inside view of the operation having volunteered in the administrative offices.  I was going to donate to this organisation because I BELIEVE WE AS A COUNTRY WE SHOULD HELP THE DISADVANTAGED IN THIS COUNTRY BEFORE WE HELP EVERY POOR COUNTRY IN THE WORLD, but am not now because looking at the financials the is a reserve ? of 1.4 million dollars that is not shown! Admin and fund raising costs must be enormous! Choices for volunteer & donor should be severed, one might volunteer to get an inside look at the organizations workings!
Christian Appalachian Project, Inc.	121196	3	/users/profile/164910	Dan Burch	Donor	5	08/22/2012	I just cannot say enough positive things about CAP.  Very impressed with how funds are used to help the poor.  This is a grass roots, on the front lines type organization.  Take a trip and see their operation in eastern Kentucky and you'll feel good about your donation, just like I did.
Christian Appalachian Project, Inc.	112378	13	/users/profile/152936	hlfjve	Donor	4	05/18/2012	I was born in KY and know the problems there.  As a Christian I felt it was a wonderful cause.   Like others I have been concerned with the excessive solicitation letters I received.  They appear to be declining under the new director.   I hope so.                                                                        The practice of sending excessive solicitations is not just a waste of funds but has caused me (and others) to stop donating.  They must become more responsive and respectful toward their donors. 
Christian Appalachian Project, Inc.	111621	10	/users/profile/151984	Ms pat	Volunteer	5	05/09/2012	I started donating small amounts of money years ago to this organization in honor of family members. They treat small donors with the same appreciation of larger ones.  After retiring, I decided to increase my donation by becoming a short term volunteer. I have served at WorkFest, YouthFest and Children's Summer Camp. I have observed how the funds are spent. All persons involved are dedicated to stretching the donations, and at the same time having quality programming.  I admire what this organization does for the people of Appalachia. They are truly Americans helping Americans---They are 'What's Right with America"
Christian Appalachian Project, Inc.	110717	16	/users/profile/150705	George Falter	General Member of the Public	2	04/25/2012	I received my first solicitation from this organization yesterday and the outside of the envelope said "check enclosed."  Sure enough, there was a $2.00 check enclosed.  This was an obvious gimmick that I find to be offensive and a potential waste of money.  For this reason alone, I will not give to this organization.  Moreover, I've recently been flooded with solicitations from various organizations and I'm just getting tired of it.  Obviously, I gave to some organization that gave/sold my information. From my perspective, charities would do well to avoid gimmicks, overly emotional appeals and supplementing their income by selling their contributors' contact information.
Christian Appalachian Project, Inc.	100071	23	/users/profile/121577	hixd	Donor	2	10/31/2011	I chose to donate to this organization because back in April of 2011 they had a reasonable overall score of 58.37 with administrative expenses of 3.6.  I asked at that time, that they not solicit me further and I would give on my own schedule.  Since then, I have been receiving solicitations at least twice a month.  This is a worthwhile charity and many, many poor in Appalachia need their help.  However, it bothers me that the past president continues to draw a salary of $71,532.  I realize it takes qualified people to run an organization like this, but the salaries of the exec.VP  ($93,687) and controller/ treasurer ($82,532) seem like a lot considering the needs of those they claim to serve.                                                        
Christian Appalachian Project, Inc.	89494	13	/users/profile/101740	Linda Pogue	Donor	3	06/02/2011	After requesting that I receive fewer fund raising requests in the mail, I continue to receive two or three requests a WEEK from CAP.  I will continue to donate on my own schedule. It's a shame they didn't honor my request.  That being said, I believe in their mission, and think they are doing good.
Blessing Hands Inc	316643		/users/profile/407867	Writer	Donor	5	10/29/2016	I have been a fan of Betty Cutts for many years, but never more than I am for her work with Blessing Hands, Inc. Her love for children and her desire to see children have the opportunity to achieve the purpose they were created for has shown me the most profound love of God to be His Hands as helpers to encourage children to reach higher by giving them access and opportunities to enable them to transform their dreams into reality. Very little of our donations goes toward salaries, as Betty works tirelessly to make sure the donation goes where it's intended. I trust that "my grain of sand" is used wisely. I have been a volunteer, prayer warrior, and donor to Blessing Hands since its inception in 2005, and heartily recommend it as a worthy non-profit. Sincerely, Phyllis Nickel.
Blessing Hands Inc	218124	1	/users/profile/281674	PaulaAni	Volunteer	5	09/29/2014	I received a newsletter from Blessing Hands today, and I was truly moved by an open letter written from a student to his funder, where he thanked the funder for the educational support which he had received over the years.  The student said that he would shortly graduate from his university and would be able to pursue his dream of becoming a software engineer.  The student gave a summation of his educational progress, which went from him writing with pencil at the beginning of his studies, to being fully computer literate today.  This student now looks forward to a prosperous life in a career that he loves and he ended his letter by making a commitment to one day helping others who are in need.   To me, there is no greater gift that you can give other than the gift of love to a child.  This is what Blessing Hands offers to those wishing to make a real difference in the world.  Now, I feel blessed because I have the opportunity to make a difference as well.
Blessing Hands Inc	212058		/users/profile/275005	Tanislkn	Volunteer	5	08/23/2014	Blessing Hands is truly an amazing organization.   They have help countess children and villages have a blessed life through education, clean water, and a multicultural experience. This is the future of China and the Chinese served by Blessing Hands have seen great Christian models and amazing, giving Americans.
Blessing Hands Inc	212051		/users/profile/237129	Junyan F.	Donor	5	08/23/2014	I started donating to Blessing Hands since 2007, since I first met Betty in my church in Lexington, Kentucky. I was touched by what she had done to help those students and their families in China, even they are on the other side of the earth. I was also surprised knowing that a little money can make difference in those students' lives.  In recent years, with the cost of living increases in China,  I donote more than before. This is fine with me. I have realized that I don't need to go to restaraunt every week, I don't need to buy expensive clothes. There are so many ways saving money.  If I go to a vacation in Florida and Mexico it will cost me one thousand dollors, but if I don't go to this expensive vacation, I can save the money to help about five students through "Blessing Hands" . While I continue donating to "Blessing Hands" every year, God continues blessing me and my family, I never had any issue with finance. Today I received the sharings from two Blessing Hands students who got help from Blessing Hands since middle school or high school, now they are almost completing their college study.  I am  very touched by their stories, especially knowing both students are now helping others in the same way as Blessing Hands helps them. Thank you, Blessing Hands,  for continuing the good work year after year! Junyan
Blessing Hands Inc	180450		/users/profile/237129	Junyan F.	Donor	5	10/21/2013	I started donating to "Blessing Hands" about six years ago. What Betty has done really inspires me to help those in need. Betty consistently puts her love, her time, her gift and her heart in helping those in need through this nonprofit organization. I really admire her.  I believe what this nonprofit organization have achieved has great impact to those students and families who are poor and in need in China. I will continue contributing to "Blessing Hands" as much as I can. 
Blessing Hands Inc	207914		/users/profile/225264	Dickison	General Member of the Public	5	07/31/2014	Blessing Hands started with high school scholarships to the Peasant Farmers children and poorest of children in Southern China.  It has expanded to the needs of these schools by now providing water purifiers, ambulances, medical personnel and the list goes on. Betty Cutts gives tirelessly of her time and energy enrolling nationals as well in her goal of getting these children through school.  They now provide university scholarships as well.  I have met and become friends with several of the recipients of this charity. Following them as they are now college graduates with good jobs sending money  back to their parents and siblings to help pull them out of the extreme poverty felt by so many rural areas of China. Amazing results for the investment.
Blessing Hands Inc	169982		/users/profile/225264	Dickison	General Member of the Public	5	09/16/2013	 In 2008 while visiting my son, an English teacher in Qinzhou,  China I entered his high school lunchroom to find a small cluster of students around an American woman with a translator.  She was interviewing students who had asked for a scholarship to pay their tuition cost so they could remain in school.  Their families were too poor to pay the modest fees charged by the public school system in China.  As she qualified each student for a scholarship another would then sit down before her and present his request.   The process seemed very straight forward.   When the last student was through I introduced myself to Betty Cuts and was treated to a friendship that has lasted and lasted.  I discovered she represented Blessing Hands Charity which, at that time only granted scholarships to high school and college aged students.   The funds that provide those scholarships come from donors who will correspond with the recipients and receive updates on their progress through the school year.  When I learned that the Charity had no paid staff and all the funds went to the students I began to understand the dedication and commitment Betty had to provide the most benefit to each student possible.  Since our first meeting the scope of the Charity has enlarged to provide pure drinking water to rural schools, medical aid to children of the most rural areas of China and this may only be the beginning of what I see as a total commitment to the peasant Farmers children of rural China. Over the 6 years I was in China I supported several College students with scholarships through their university years and now follow their careers as they have left behind the peasant life they started in and have become productive participants in the Chinese ascension into the Global Economy.   The vision that started Betty on this amazing trip has continued to grow as her base of supporters pass on the word to others of what great things come from participation in Blessing Hands scholarships and projects. Jerry Dickison
Blessing Hands Inc	178547		/users/profile/235176	Destiny C	Volunteer	5	10/17/2013	This charity was truly born out of love for others. Their mission and vision have such a great impact in the lives of the children and community there, as well as in the lives of those of us involved here. We are really blessed to have this opportunity to serve and be involved. What strikes me as a great feature is that this organization is truly there to serve, from top down, everyone volunteers their own time and money for others. There is so little overhead so the money goes to where it is supposed to go: to the children. This is a wonderful example of how "Love does", just go and do good for others... no hidden agenda, no coveting of glory, no greedy people... just kindness in action. It is through the little ripples touching the lives of others that we make a difference. I will continue to encourage and support this great group of people.

Blessing Hands Inc	178530		/users/profile/235160	Tom Politowski	Volunteer	5	10/17/2013	I met Betty at a conference where she came up to me and asked for help. I listened to her story about how Blessing Hands helps poor Chinese children have an opportunity for an education. A few months later Betty and I connected and spent a weekend completing their system and loading in all the students and Donor information. Betty was tireless in the mission to complete the task. We accomplished her goals so she can communicate with all the students and sponsors easily. Betty and the Blessing Hands team are dedicated to their mission and persistent in making a difference in the world. I'm happy to help. Tom Politowski, CEONthropy, Inc.
Blessing Hands Inc	177129		/users/profile/233646	Carole15	Donor	5	10/12/2013	We sponsor three children through Blessing Hands: a college student, a middle school student, and an elementary school student.  The amount of money Blessing Hands collects for each is very small, yet provides so much to these children.  They all write letters to us, and they seem very motivated to learn and so appreciative of our sponsorship.  Blessing Hands seems to encourage them to reach out to others in their area, and to pass their blessings along. I have known Betty Cutts for 40 years, and I have great respect for all she does.  She cares for each child, and visits China often to check on all facets of the charity.  She is a very intelligent woman of great faith, integrity, and compassion, and she is a great friend to so many. 
Blessing Hands Inc	168887		/users/profile/223859	roritd	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/10/2013	in an era when many non-for-profit foundations extract immense expenses for operation, it is a rare treat to find one as selflessly devoted as blessing hands aka betty cutts has with financial integrity, using  extremely limited resources, impacted so many less fortunate lives. Many of these less fortunate have acquired an education they otherwise would never have received, and now are contributing to society.  My brother and i also operate a non-for-profit in Hong  Kong,  and have known this organization since 2002

Blessing Hands Inc	168358		/users/profile/223247	Mike Rayburn	Volunteer	5	09/08/2013	I have known about Blessing Hands and their mission for a number of years now.  At first, I didn't know that much, and I didn't get involved, but I paid attention to what I heard about them.  Finally, I went to a couple of events where Blessing Hands had an information booth.  When I really looked over the material, I realized how much difference they were making in the lives of poor, deserving Chinese kids, and I also was amazed at how much they could do with a small donation.   I have since made several donations, and I intend to do more in the future.  I feel that for a given amount of money, a donation to Blessing Hands can make more difference in the lives of people than any other nonprofit group I am aware of.   A really small amount of money can result in a child getting an education... first through middle and  high school, and if they do well, through college.  And after this, the recipients will most likely help others in their family and their community to also get educated.. so the results just snowball!   Blessing Hands also provides water purficication for schools in poor, rural areas--literally changing the lives and the futures of all in those communities.If you don't have unlimited wealth, but you want to help others, there is no other organization that I know of more deserving of your support --- a small donation really does make a difference -- and when you donate, you will know exactly what your contribution is going for.  If it's for a student, you will receive genuine communication from that student..  your help will change their life, and their gratitude will  change yours !

Blessing Hands Inc	113959	1	/users/profile/155064	Jeff34	Donor	5	06/06/2012	I met this guy Eric at the local gym. Our first conversation was your basic hello, my name is.. & we shook hands. Over the next couple of months we got to know each other a little better & one day i asked him what he did for a living. He said he was involved with a charitable group called Blessing Hands & enjoyed it very much. I asked what it was about & he told me. At this point I was kinda bracing myself for the, can you..... but it never happend. A couple weeks later I felt led to ask Eric about this again & wanted to know how we could help. He graciously gave me some scenarios of what would be most helpful. Folks, I would like to say this, from the moment i met Eric he never hinted for help in anyway!! We are very fortunate & blessed to help these guys & will continue to do as much as we can. From the folks at RubberNeckin Tshirts, Thank you.

Blessing Hands Inc	113924	1	/users/profile/155020	EfuaJJ	Volunteer	5	06/06/2012	I have been associated with Blessing Hands in various capacities (former Board member, volunteer, donor) for 5+ years.  It is clear by its mission statement that it serves a humanitarian need.  It is very hard for me to pick which of my roles has been most rewarding but I think the role of a volunteer has made the biggest impact on my own personal life.  I was fortunate to be able to travel to China last year with Blessing Hands. While there I was able to teach health related classes.  What a joy and a pleasure to be part of that experience and to see first hand how the lives of hundreds of children and their families are so positively affected by the work of Blessing Hands.

A little bit of funding for their education in China can help improve the quality of their lives & those of their families so very much. Betty is very careful in her selection of assistants in China to help her maintain the intent & quality of BLESSING HANDS.

Blessing Hands Inc	113905	1	/users/profile/154993	Jerry66	Volunteer	5	06/06/2012	It was such a pleasure to assist Betty and her staff in Guang Xi Provence when they were there looking for candidates to receive her high school tuition scholarships.  Over the past 4 years here in China I have tracked the lives of several or these students that came from peasant Farm families and would have ended up on the farms doing stoop labor the rest of their lives.  One is ready to graduate college now in the top of her class and another is in his second year studying to be a border patrolman.  They are so bright and this opportunity has changed their lives in ways that can only be measured in reduced life struggles for them.  I love the work and efforts this program represents and the incredible changes it makes in the children's lives.

These donations can reduce your taxable income and lower your tax bill. At Kiddssociety.net they have no salaries and you can be assured that every dime, piece of clothing, blankets, food, gift cards etc are donated to the homeless vets and kids or applied to counseling and or housing.  Think about this when donating to the larger non profits.  I have seen the countless hours put in by these people just to do the right thing and pay it forward.

CMConference is the best children's ministry conference I have ever attended. Scholarships make it possible for under resourced children's pastors to go.

They are genuine and humble in everything they do. I would definitely recommend donating to this worthy non-profit and attending the CMConnect Conference. 
CMConnect	319893	1	/users/profile/369096	Wayne80	Client Served	4	12/06/2016	CM Connect is a great organization. They are prolific in equipping people who work with children. They have a lot of online resources that I never even have time to discover, because there are so many.  They have an online community you can connect with - for free! They help me best through their podcasts though. I try to listen every week. They recently aired a breakout session from their 2016 CM Conference that has really encouraged me to look outside of our church to minister. The session was entitled Dealing With the Orphan Spirit in Your Church and it was podcast #40. I have listened to it twice now, and plan to listen again until I can sense what we need to do here in the town I live in.
CMConnect	319786	1	/users/profile/411636	Jessica325	Volunteer	5	12/04/2016	CmConnect is an organization I have loved being a part of. Connecting under-resourced children's workers all around the world to those who are able to provide trainings and curriculum that is Christ-centered is the one thing I admire most about CmConnect. It's an organization that God has used to provide many needs for many people. Most recently, I worked alongside Michael to co-lead a group of 17 people with a heart to serve children on a mission trip to the jungles of Belize. This trip was unique in how we worked alongside a local ministry and the local community in Belize. Michael was adamant about working with the people there, not just for the people. It's been a blessing to serve alongside CmConnect, and I look forward to continue international ministry with them.

My granddaughter was born with AMC and it changed our world.  Without the support and understanding of AMC, our family would have been rocked to the core.  This little baby has grown and has become a wonderful child that can adapt to almost any situation.  She has gone thru numerous surgeries, castings, braces and splints.  Each time we run into a bump in the road, AMC Support has gotten us thru the hard times.  They keep us updated with new medical advances, therapies and hardware that our children need.  The AMC Support Group is our family.

The doctor knew very little and even the maternal fetal specialist had limited knowledge on the condition.  We found this support group on-line when a friend searched the term "AMC" and "blessed" and we came across the founder's web page about her daughter Abby and then the group web page.  From that moment on, I memorized all the stories and information I could absorb and found hope, faith and a feeling of peace that everything was going to be all right.  We have relied heavily on the information and support found within this group of AMAZING people and don't know how well we would be doing without them!  Roger is almost three and doing just great! They are so informative by means of sharing every, and I mean EVERY aspect of what can be expected.  We are truly indebted to Ani, Theresa, Tracey and Peg, just to name a very few.

All of our biological children have been healthy, so the news of Declan having Arthrogryposis seemed overwhelming. We knew that termination was never an option, but resources on AMC seemed lacking. AMC Support has helped provide a wealth of tips, knowledge and advice to our family. We are very thankful for this agency and recommend it to anyone looking for resources on AMC.

After birth and three weeks of test we were told she had Arthrogryposis, not that we'd heard of it before or knew anything about it.  Jump ahead 10 years and we stumble upon the AMC Support, Inc. website and annual conference information.  We attended our first conference this year, it was eye and heart opening!  We found out so many tips, tricks, ideas, inventions, and FRIENDS and SUPPORT.  Our daughter discovered she was "not unusual" after meeting and playing with kids of all ages.  AMC Support, Inc. is making it possible for parents like me to discover and share all the various aspects of living with a AMC person.  Thank You AMC Support, Inc!

I started out as a client served and continue as one but also I volunteer in moderating the chat that we hold every week online. The people I have met through this support group, AMCSI, have become my family. Without them I wouldn't be able to ask questions from the people who have been there and done that and I couldn't bond with the mothers and fathers who are going through it now or will be going through it soon. We are a family, we are friends. Two years I spent alone (besides my family) doing my best to flounder through therapies and surgeries and AMCSI offered up their memebers to help us through the hard times and find people who would share our small triumphs.

When we found out that it was Arthrogryposis we started looking into things.  I had even did a search trying to find support groups. I came up empty handed, but then a little before he had turned 2 yrs old I decided to look again and this time I must have put the right wording in because up came AMCSI.  I had never felt more relieved in my life.. For almost 2 yrs I felt alone and then there it was my light to guide me through the tunnel.  Everyone has been so wonderful and accepting and helpful.  Having others who understand you is quite a wonderful feeling and I'm glad that I found AMCSI in that search.

Last summer, I became the mother of a child with a mild case of AMC. Through this support group, I have had my hope renewed, and many, many questions answered. This group has shown me that children with AMC can thrive, and become well adjusted adults living close to "normal" lives. It has shown me that people with AMC don't have a disability, they have a "diff-ability". AMC'ers can do just about everything a 'typical' person does... they just may do it differently!

The stories shared by these adults and parents of young children, and their kids, have been an incredible inspiration to me. They help me to see how far I have come in my journey with AMC and in turn enable me to light the way for them on the earliest steps on theirs. None of this would have been possible without this amazing ORG.  I hope one day there will be no need for such an ORG. Until then, I hope it grows exponentially to envelope many many more in the support,  knowledge and inspiration I have come to know and love through their heartfelt mission.

AMCSI owns a major part of my heart! My daughter Bailey was born with AMC August 21st 2008, we were un-aware of any complications before birth so when she was born with AMC my Husband and I were very shocked and scared. Doctors were telling us of the thing's she wouldn't be able to do, the affects, the therapies and doctors she would need to see.. etc. It was a very overwhelming expierence and we were very frightened. We found AMCSI through an internet search when Bailey was a few months old and it was the BEST link I could have ever clicked on in my entire life. They took my family in like their own, offered support and most of all friendship. They made us realize that it was not about what Bailey wouldn't be able to do but about what she WOULD be able to do! They squashed our fears and opened our hearts! I couldn't ask for a better organization to be apart of! I'm so blessed to know many warm-hearted people through this support group and I am thankful everyday for them!

I was given a few possible diagnoses. The day she was born we were given a definitive answer. My daughter had Arthrogryposis Multiplex Congenita. I was so confused and was looking for support. I found amcsupport.org. through an online search engine. Then I found the forums. I asked questions and received an instant answer from Tracey one of the board members. I have learned so much in the past two years. last year we even went to the 5th AMC convention. I had NEVER met anyone with AMC in person. I was so excited to see what they had to offer. I was able to attend workshops for me and workshops to learn about my daughter's AMC. I must say meeting adult AMC'ers as we call them was priceless.  I cannot imagine my life without the AMCSI. If I have a question I know I can go to the forums and get an answer.

It began as a  support group with online forums and has grown immensely over the years providing outreach to new families receiving the diagnosis, parents of children with AMC, and to adults with AMC from various parts of the globe. AMCSI provides a wonderful way to connect with others whether you are a new expecting parent, parent to a child with AMC, or an adult looking to connect with others that understand where you have been or what you are going through.  Our "family" connects through the free online support forums and through the annual conference which is a wonderful time to network and learn about current treatment options, make new friends, meet old ones,  and to receive support.

These complete strangers called us "Family" and patiently prepared us to be great parents to our sweet girl.

I won't be the only glowing testimonial so I'll keep it short. This organization has helped encourage and support me through the worst trials of my new life with a very special daughter. There were times I was at my worst and a word from a member put me to rights. I would not be as confident or happy today without them. My daughter stood for the first time after a surgery suggested to me by a board member. We were told she never would. Then after several ideas about physical therapy were shared she started self-feeding and using her arms more. Love this group!

Kentucky Gateway Museum Center	49103	8	/users/profile/50388	russ2	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/04/2010	I cannot begin to tell you how much I enjoyed the museum/library when it was housed only in the original old library building.  My father instilled a respect for and interest in history and a great-great aunt inspired me to do research on the family.  My father would drop me off and I'd spend the entire day (until closing) doing research, looking at exhibits and learning about my community's past.  The staff were the best and treated me (a child) with as much respect as any other person who was there doing research.  They looked out for me as well.  They'd ask what I was researching and while away from my table I'd be pleasantly surprised to find a book or file left for me to review.  They also connected me with others doing research on my family.  It has been years since I visited the museum but I remember those days fondly. They were very much an influence on my future as I obtained a Masters in Library Science and have worked in a major urban library in Ohio for over 20 years now and am currently the Genealogy Subject Specialist for this library.  I very much enjoy helping others pursue their interests in genealogical and historical research and hope that I inspire others as much as I was during my visits there. I wish to say thank you for such a wonderful experience and am proud to see how you've grown and continue to help and inspire others.  Thanks, Russ Pollitt

Anyone who visits will have a truly great day.  The Museum has many items and exhibits that rival museums in much larger cities in the world.

I have only been a member for a few years but have come to appreciate the museum and all it has to offer recently.  There is a vast amount of research information available and the local historical artifacts is wonderful.  The miniatures gallery is a gem all by itself!

I have only been to this museum 4 times---it should have only been three but no one could answer my questions or fax or email me the answer So I had to make a special trip.  Also, I have been all over this country doing research and the prices they charge for pictures to use in publications is just outrageous.  They wanted $100 to use a couple photos--I found them at a different historical society and was charged $20.

The Museum has offered educational shows for children and adults.  It houses a miniture collection that rival none.  Visitors are amazed at how the museum is layed out, what it houses, and the programs in which it offers the community to participate in.  The children of this area are given more ooportunities to educational programs and rewards that the museum offers than any other place in the state.  Programs ranging from Holloween stories for the children at the old courthouse, to parades, having the opportunity to visit world class exhibits like Children Like Us.  The progams that are offered also entertain as well as educate. This community is just now beginning to realize what a gem we have here in Maysville, Kentucky.  I am proud of the volunteer program that the museum utilizes withing the community, and the staff of tireless workers that seem to always pull together to complete a show or exhibit that the area truly enjoys.

In 2009, I successfully sold two circa 1795 Mason County stone homes (which has to be rare as there are not that many stone homes within the county), both located in rural areas of the county (4.05 acres on Parker Lane at Mays Lick and 2.85 acre  on Taylor Mill) and both situated on small acreage, both on the National Register of Historic Places (the Poague House Mays Lick and Milton Mills Taylor Mill Road, Maysville, were both added to the National Register Jan. 8, 1987), and I contacted the museum when researching some of the history of the properties for purposes of providing historical data to prospective purchasers, including those persons who ultimately purchased the properties (the purchasers were non-residents, one from Maryland, the other from Ohio). I have found the staff very helpful and accommodating. I also have donated my time to conduct charity auctions to benefit the museum (the Museum has a world class miniatures collection and I conducted an auction to benefit the museum in 2008, selling a miniature collection, and -- in addition to Kentucky and US bidders -- we had bidders/purchasers from several foreign countries including Switzerland, England, Japan, and Germany, and this was a "Live Auction", with these bidders actually present in the audience! I also conduct an auction on their behalf annually (March 5 will mark the fourth or fifth year of my involvement and I conducted two benefits auctions in 2008), volunteering my services as well as that of my staff, and I don't even live in Mason County, but in the adjoining county (that shows how much I appreciate the Museum as I am willing to travel outside of my county to support them!).

History, genealogy, culture and heritage all wrapped up in one fantastic place.

Just go to Charity Navigator if you have any doubt. You will find that they do a great job of helping vets that our government has shortchanged for their service.
Disabled American Veterans (DAV) Charitable Service Trust	283215	5	/users/profile/373420	Writer	General Member of the Public	2	03/23/2016	I am a vet and a life member of the DAV. I have sought advice and assistance a few times over the last 16 years and only once have they actually been helpful. Currently I need to have my VA records corrected. Please note I said VA records, the service records are correct, the VA did a terrible job transferring the information and the multiple errors are causing problems including obtaining health care for a service connected disability. I asked the DAV for help on identifying the VA office that can assist in correction of these errors. Two exchanges of e-mails gave guesses about where I might obtain assistance locally which would require about an 80 mile round trip to, maybe,, get some help. Now my e-mails to DAV aren't even responded to. With all their alleged resources why a life member can't get a simple answer is a serious question to me. And the requests for more donations are nearly weekly. Based on my experience why they get such high ratings as a charitable organization is beyond me. I see some of their good works but those are high profile that stimulate donations. As for individual assistance with simple matters, they came up short for me.

It was a recorded call and when I called back, I just got a bizzy signal.  It was a Rochester, MN call and they called themselves American Disabled Vets.

He joined DAV to help with his outstanding VA disability claim. He called DAV 3 times over a period of a few months. Each time he was told he would get a call back from someone to help him. NOT ONE SINGLE RETURN PHONE CALL from DAV.org. I wish my husband hadn't wasted his hard earned money to join this rip-off place. I truly am shocked at the lack of professionalism from them. He would explain with each subsequent phone call to them that he had already called and was told he would get a call back soon . . . . was always assured he would get a call back . . .never happened.  My husband's claim has now been completed by the VA (no thanks to DAV) and he is 90% disabled. He has turned to another agency for help to get the max 100%. He is using RepForVets and he got a call back the same day, with legitimate help and a packet full of info is already on the way to help my husband. Shame on you, DAV.org. You ripped-off my husband with your membership fee and he got NOTHING in return from you. How dare you advertise your organization on television as helping veterans. I guess that's where my husbands membership fee went . . .to pay for your expensive advertising!

This may sound petty, but it is very important to me that my donations not be spent on marketing and fundraising.  I get my own body weight in junk mail every 5 months and I don't want charities wasting their money adding to it.  In 2011 I donated to 5 US charities and requested that each of them keep me off of any kind of mailing lists.  DAV is is the only one of the 5 who was able to completely honor this request.  I don't doubt the other reviewer's experience but for me all I had to do was ask up front.  So DAV gets 5 stars from me.

All the calendars, return address labels, memo pads, Christmas cards, postage paid envelopes and the rest ,end up in my tras , as I don't need or want any of them. I think it's a very wasteful use of limited resources and I believe that my entire donation has been spent sending me trash. I think it's poor policy to reward donors with non stop pleas for more money. I never repeat donations to any organization which employees this method of fund raising. 
Disabled American Veterans (DAV) Charitable Service Trust	119144	23	/users/profile/161993	sumyunguyz	Donor	5	07/23/2012	After serving our great Country during the Vietnam war I purchsed my first home in 1980 on a VA loan. A couple of years later my job required me to move so I sold my home. The person that bought my home was a former veteran so he just assumed my loan. In 1983 the VA contacted me and advised that they had foreclosed on the home and that I owed them over $25K! They asked for all my income and expenses so they could begin garnishing my wages. They set a court hearing date for me in Houston if I wanted to contest it. I spoke to my attorney and he advised me that nobody would represent me due to the fact that congress doesn't allow veterans to pay more than $10 for legal representation against the US Government. He also told me that the title company I used should have given me a release of liability when I sold the home. It seems the least the VA should have done was notified me when the buyer defaulted on the loan and allowed me to take the loan back but instead they just auctioned it off!  Nervously I showed up for court at the VA's office on the designated day. While having a cup of coffee I struck up a conversation with an older gentleman. Apparently he could see my nervousness and asked why I was there. I told him my story and he asked me to come down the hall to his office. There he told me he was a counselor with the DAV and was going to represent me in the hearing. Together we went top the hearing and he told the VA that I had sold the home in good faith and that the buyer had made 12 consecutive payments on time and they had no case. He scolded them for knowing the fact and what they had put a veteran through. To this day I am forever grateful for what DAV has done for me and others and will continue to be a donor for such a good cause.

Disabled American Veterans (DAV) Charitable Service Trust	89399	13	/users/profile/101594	Johnstoying	Volunteer	5	06/01/2011	I was in the Navy during the Vietnam War. A disc ruptured in my back while doing some heavy lifting. Two weeks later the Naval doctors put me in pelvic traction. With no relief, they operated and removed the disc. I felt a weakness in my left ankle. While playing softball on the base, I suffered an extreme sprain. One year later, they discharged me with a 50% disability rating for my back, 0% for the ankle. The ankle kept spraining itself with the least amount of trauma. I was on crutches 50% of the time. Someone told me to put in a claim. After the exam and a search of my records, the VA conceded and gave me 10% for the ankle, but they said my back was getting better, so they took 10% away from my back. My back then began to go into muscle spasms, crippling me. Someone told me to go back and reopen your claim. The VA then said that my back really wasnt any worse so they would not give me an increase. However, they said that my ankle was better. So they took away the 10%, leaving me with 40%. I wanted to go to college. You must be 50% disabled to get full benefits. I was too poor to go (SOL). A friend, John, told me to join the DAV and they will stop f... with you. Two years I was commander of a chapter and a life member. One more time my back put me back in the hospital. I had the National Service Officer plea my case for me. Next thing I know, I was awarded the 50% back and off to college I went.

Family Scholar House, Inc.	94653		/users/profile/109511	Ricki M.	Client Served	5	07/29/2011	I have been a participant at FSH for 4.5 years. I came to them in 2006 not truly understanding exactly how their program could benefit my daughter and I. They provided us with stable housing, scholarship opportunities, a donated car and most importantly a support system. Since becoming a part of FSH I have grown tremendously as a student, parent and overall as a person.  I received an Associate degree in 2009 and transferred on to work toward my Bachelors degree in Sociology.  I am now one semester away from graduating and currently working as an intern with FSH, all made possible by their great organization. My daughter and I could not have hoped for more. She has made many friends and become a part of a great community over the past 4.5 years. We can honestly say that we have gained a family at Family Scholar House. As an intern I am now getting the chance to help others and become a living testimony to how this program has changed not only my life, but the life of my daughter.
Family Scholar House, Inc.	94648		/users/profile/109505	Harvetta B.	Volunteer	5	07/29/2011	Durring the 2010/2011 academic school year, I served as a social work intern at the Family Scholar House. Before interning at the Scholar House, I didn't think that I wanted to work with their target population. After my initial interview, I immediately knew that this was an organization that was genuine in serving the community and providing their participants with the best possible services available. Having been a single teen mother with two children at the age of 19, I was very impressed with the amount of support that the Family Scholar House provided for the single parents of the program. The support extended to the families makes it possible for the parents to focus on continuing their educational goals as well as have a stable environment to raise their children. This holistic approach supports the mental, emotional, scholastic, and spiritual needs of their participants. With the support of the community, donars, and volunteers, the families are able to overcome their challenging backgrounds and move towards eliminating their generational cycle of poverty. I am so glad that I was able to be a part of such a loving, caring and supportive organization. It was a blessing to assist the staff in providing the clients with tools that will assist in their overall success in life.                                                Harvetta Broadway, MSSW intern
Family Scholar House, Inc.	94644		/users/profile/109498	lccole00	Donor	5	07/29/2011	Family Scholar House is consistently rated one of Louisville's best nonprofits. And considering the many worthwhile nonprofits Louisville boasts, this is no small compliment to the organization.  The staff are competent and dedicated. But the outcomes are the most amazing part of the organization. Participants gain education in and outside formal learning environments.  The organization is based on such a solid model that it is considered a thought-leader among other agencies of its kind.
Family Scholar House, Inc.	94627		/users/profile/109481	QueenE	Client Served	5	07/29/2011	Family Scholar House assisted in paving the path of my educational journey. They offered support and services to my family while I obtained my undergraduate degree as well as, continued support through my Masters program. I am the 1st in my family to obtain a college degree and feel confident my children will follow in my footsteps. Because of the consistency and stability FSH presented, my family is now self-supporting, independent, and confident. FSH is committed and dedicated to supporting their families for the long term. I am looking forward to purchasing my 1st home within the next year with the support of FSHs home-ownership program!
Family Scholar House, Inc.	94613		/users/profile/109465	Dana P.	Volunteer	5	07/29/2011	I was a social work intern at Family Scholar House and I know from experience that this non-profit organization truly acts on their mission each and everyday by providing guidance and support to single parents as they work towards a four year college degree. Family Scholar House not only focuses on the educational aspect of their single parent students but their work extends to their children as well, encouraging their participants to enroll their children in early learning programs. Family Scholar House has shown me that they are not just ANY non-profit organization, but they are one of the greatest. By opening their arms and their hearts to those who are struggling with poverty and homeless, Family Scholar House advocates for their families to achieve self sufficient lives by creating opportunities be involved in such as courses in financial coaching, healthy lifestyle skill building, parenting classes, and much more! Fortunately, during my time at Family Scholar House I was able to see many families successful graduate from their program and make a better life, but always coming back to help and assist those who once was in their spot. Family Scholar House is indeed one of its kind focusing on a population that society often forgets about. The many experiences I had with Family Scholar House and their participants will forever be a part of my life, and I will always be a supporter of this organization.
Family Scholar House, Inc.	94590		/users/profile/109430	Petra	General Member of the Public	4	07/28/2011	This program has helped many who would have otherwise been lost.  Not only have they assisted with support for education but also housing assitance, and childcare.  Not to be forgotten they have provided much needed emotional support that sadly many of the participants have never had.  That support has proven to be the tool needed to assist in breaking the cycle of poverty.

General Member of the Public	5	07/27/2011	I have witnessed the enthusiasm, appreciation, and gratitude exhibited by the clients of Family Scholar House.  These clients are single parents seeking educational advancement to break the cycle of poverty in which they have been caught.  I've witnessed the pride of the clients as they talk about their educational accomplishments.  Watching the staff of the organization work with these parents and their children certainly makes clear the power of mission of Family Scholar House.

Redwood	99946		/users/profile/57542	RdwdBrdGuy	Board Member	5	10/29/2011	Redwood serves individuals with severe and multiple disabilities. As a board member I am constantly impressed with the way that the staff takes on big challenges and completes them successfully.  For example, in the past year Redwood has been accredited by CARF, a major undertaking that required the writing or re-writing of policy on every aspect of the agency from building maintenance to disaster recovery. This was done in 11 months in addition to all the normal day-to-day work.  In the very near future Redwood will begin to offer services under Medicaid's Prescribed Pediatric Extended Care program. This required obtaining a Certificate Of Need, developing new procedures, billing systems, and renovation to comply with hospital-like regulations for the treatment space. In addition, Electronic Medical Record-keeping will be introduced as a pilot program for moving all agency record-keeping (which is substantial) to electronic filing. Every year Redwood improves its ability to deliver top-notch services in an efficient and effective way. I am proud to be a part of this great organization.
Redwood	55418		/users/profile/57542	RdwdBrdGuy	Board Member	5	10/26/2010	If agencies like Redwood did not "do whatever it takes" to help the disabled and their families, no one else would be there for them. The world would be a poorer place. Redwood has programs for babies, for children and for adults. We literally have clients who have been receiving help from Redwood for over 40 years.Through the many programs each of our clients has the opportunity to maximize their potential, and to socialize rather than be confined. Redwood provides another benefit that is an unintended consequence of their programs. While our clients are blossoming, their families are able to work or care for other children knowing that Redwood is caring for their disabled family member. This might be the only way that normalcy can come to a family struggling with a disability.It is especially gratifying to see that Redwood not only provides these beneficial services for the community, but also does it in an absolutely top notch manner.

She is well cared for, happy, and is very a productive member of the community. The staff is well educated and their goal for each client is for the greatest growth of each. 
Redwood	54460	1	/users/profile/55912	kygirl777	Volunteer	5	10/05/2010	My daughter, Natasha, has been attending Redwood for over five years now. She dearly loves "going to work." Her days consist of working on the computer to sharpen her skills, which have progressed a great deal. She has made many friends and learned to interact with others, also well as gaining a great deal of independence.The staff at Redwood are remarkable, becoming family, not just workers. Natasha and I have only lived in the area for close to six years. Finding a day program was a major concern for me with our move. We toured several different facilities but knew we had found the perfect place with Redwood. If it were not for Redwood, I couldn't attend nursing school. Even on my days off, it allow me to have time to rest and recharge. Not only has Redwood been of benefit for Natasha but I've also made several wonderful friends. I am so thankful to each and everyone there. The dedication to their clients is remarkable.
Redwood	55778	1	/users/profile/58010	bkt81	Board Member	5	10/28/2010	In 1983 my husband and I walked into Redwood carrying our 2 year old son Bowen not knowing what to expect.  Bowen had a traumatic birth resulting in severe cerebral palsy and all that comes with it.  Seizures, vision impairment, non verbal, total reliance on caretakers for all personal needs, the list goes on and on.  Little did we know we had started the process of adopting Redwood into our family and Redwood has started adopting us into their family.  We commuted between Cincinnati and Kentucky for 5 years because there were no programs in Cincinnati with the services Redwood provided.  When Bowen was 7 we made the big move across the Ohio River and haven't looked back. Bo is now 29 and is a daily participant in Redwood's Adult Services program.  Redwood has enabled Bowen to be the wonderful young man he is, always viewing him as an individual, treating him with respect, dignity and love.   In 1990 I was asked to head up the Parent Group and serve as a member of the Board of Trustees.  In 1992 I was selected as the Board President and continue to serve on the Board of Trustees, Governance Council and Program Council.  The last 18 years have been years of change on every level for Redwood.   The ability of the agency to remain fluid and accepting of change has allowed services to flow to those most in need and the most difficult to serve.In closing, I can't imagine where my family would be without Redwood.

Redwood staff and volunteers are among the most committed and passionate people I have ever worked with.  They take their mission very seriously, pay attention to detail, and work tirelessly to discover and meet the needs of every client and family.

She attended the early childhood intervention programs and now as an adult attends the adult program.  I don't know what we would do without them.  As an adult it was hard to find a place for her to go every day and feel like she is contributing something.  Redwood did not hesitate to take her and makes her feel included in anything she wants to do.  Everyone there is so kind and respectful of her.    None of her physical disabilities phase any of them.  It is truly an amazing place!!!
Redwood	54595		/users/profile/56134	kmjtaj	Client Served	5	10/07/2010	For years the Ft. Mitchell, KY, exit off of I75 was just something I drove past on my way to and from the airport.  I kept my fingers crossed that nothing would cause me to have to take a Kentucky exit.  After all, I was from Ohio and who knows what would happen if I took a Kentucky exit.  Little did I know that the Ft. Mitchell exit would one day lead to a fantastic life for my daughter, Taylor. Little did I know that the Ft. Mitchell exit led to Redwood.It's hard to find quality day and after school care for any child.  It's even harder finding it for a multi-handicapped child.  We were lucky to find day and after school care in Ohio for Taylor for eleven years.  But we ran out of luck the summer of 1996.  Taylor needed more and more help with personal care and traditional summer camps would not accept her.  My fingers were sore from dialing, my throat was sore from begging, and my heart wa sore from rejection.  Then I called Redwood.  And Redwood said, "Come on down!"  The next two years sped along.  We lived in Ohio where Taylor attended grade school and after school care.  Taylor spent summers attending Redwood summer camp in Kentucky.  Things were too good to continue.  When Taylor reached middle school we discovered there was NO after school care for anyone.  So, I crossed my fingers, I crossed my toes, I crossed my legs, I crossed my eyes, and I dialed Redwood to see if they had after school care.  And, once again, Redwood said, "Come on down!"  And we did.  Only this time we moved to Kentucky.  Yes, a family born and raised in Ohio actually pulled up roots and moved to Kentucky.  Just so Taylor could attend Redwood.For eight years Taylor attended the School Age Program.  In 2006 Taylor turned 21 and graduated to the Adult Independence Program which she continues to attend.Taylor has received so much from Redwood that I felt I needed to give back.  So in 2005 I joined the Redwood Board as a Trustee and when I took early retirement from Procter & Gamble signed on as a volunteer.Now everyday Taylor and I take the Ft. Mitchell exit to Redwood.  Redwood - a place where Taylor can blossom and thrive; where her special needs are seen, not as obstacles, but just part of every day living;  where she can walk down the halls and say "hi" to everyone and have everyone say "hi" back; where she is encouraged to become the best that she, as an individual, can be; where her achievements are acknowledged and praised;  where she is accepted; where she is loved.

Redwood	54497		/users/profile/55966	jrm3405	General Member of the Public	5	10/05/2010	My sister was born with CP in 1967.  Back then, the doctors simply encouraged my parents to admit her to an institution and let her live her life there.  This enraged Mom and Dad and they set out to find a place that would challenge my sister to the fullest extent of her abilities.  For many years, they saw her through a series of special schools and special teachers.  It wasn't until she turned 21 that they found Redwood.  It was there that they discovered a place that allowed my sister not only to be challenged, but that allowed her to grow to the fullest extent of her abilities. My sister is healthy and happy and spends her day in a loving, caring, positive environment where she is looked after and guided to be the best that she can be.  Mom and Dad always tell whoever will listen that they view Redwood as a God-send and that if it wasn't for that organization and the wonderful people who work there that they do not know what they would have done.A wonderful side-bar to this story is that Redwood also has a department devoted to childhood development.  We were fortunate to have my niece and nephew be able to attend the daycare there.  We are all very happy that Redwood is able to provide such a great place for so many members of our family to feel safe and loved.

Redwood	54489		/users/profile/55953	sonya2	Client Served	5	10/05/2010	Redwood has truly established an organization dedicated to children and adult with disabilities to assist them in living a quality-led life. They have been doing this since 1953 and have been a beaming light in northern Kentucky for those that need their services.I have seen this in my own life through my two daughters. Since March, my 2 year old twin daughters have been enrolled in Redwood and they have fostered their growth and development through speech therapy, occupational therapy, and developmental intervention. My one daughter has autism and I believe Redwood has been instrumental in her growth in communication and social skills. She has grown beyond what she could have without Redwood. Their therapists, teachers, and assistants are top-notch and some of the most caring people I have ever had the privilege knowing.

We heard of Redwood by word of mouth even though we lived over an hour away in Southeastern Indiana.  My sister worked as a counselor at Redwood's camp, and drove Tony to and from the camp while she worked with a different group.  Redwood's flexibility in meeting Tony's needs were unexpected and made it unique among organizations Tony's been involved with, past and present.  My family's experience with Redwood set a new precedent for Tony and the services we pursue to meet his needs.
Redwood	54479		/users/profile/55941	family-friend	Donor	5	10/05/2010	My association with Redwood started decades ago when my brother was enrolled in the first group of clients that the then fledging organization cared for.  Redwood has always been a special place and held dear by all my family. Years after my brother began attending Redwood, my son was born with special needs.  Redwood has been a godsend with programs that have addressed his needs through the years.  They supplied infant stimulation programs and preshool programs when he was younger.  There was summer camp for when he was school age in addition to a variety of afterschool services.  Now as an adult, they continue their service to him, allowing him to function to the best of his ability. They are dedicated to taking care of the whole person regardless of age.  I am not aware of too many programs where this is true.  Our community has been truly blessed to have Redwood make it their home.  Praise can never be too high for this organization.

Even before he attended Redwood their therapists were working with him through a State-funded early intervention program.  My son is Autistic, ADHD, has both a primary expressive and receptive language delay, and also has a diagnosed sensory disorder. At Redwood my son has both a Speech therapist and an Occutional Therapist who have proven to me that they truly care about his success and have even gone above and beyond their call of duty by working with his Pre-K teacher at a public school.  I believe that early intervention is key to ensuring that children like my son grow into functional adults and it is fantastic that not only are these resources available to us in our community but the integrity of their staff is incomparable to any other organization in the tri-state area.

My husband had a massive stroke 12 years ago and his health journey has been a constant roller coaster ride.  The storke association has offered help and guidance but most important of all they are a compassionate heart that listens.  The role of caregiver is often as difficult as being the patient.  I know first hand you cannot handle it alone.  The doctors and medical community can only give your so much support.  The patient and caregiver both need emotional as well as physical support.  I know when my husband has a new issue or need the Kentucky - Indiana Stroke Association will know where to send me.  And when I am tired and overwhelmed they are always there to support. me.
KY and SI Stroke Association	152162	1	/users/profile/203261	Carrie44	Advisor	5	04/05/2013	This charity has helped so many people get involved with the community! There are hundreds of survivors and caregivers that answer the call when asked to volunteer. The Kentucky/S. Indiana chapter serves over 1000 people each year with stroke prevention and recovery education. With over 14 years as a chapter and still going strong, this small non profit packs a great punch!
KY and SI Stroke Association	134306		/users/profile/180123	mscon	General Member of the Public	5	11/06/2012	Very proud to know about our local chapter and to have met the Director.  I think great support is needed. for this disease and for all the professionals who work with those affected by stroke.   I have been fortunate enough to participate in a few fund raising events this year and was very proud to do so.  Carrie is doing a great job raising awareness and has great support in her community.  I hope to stay very involved with KSISA  in the future in many ways.
KY and SI Stroke Association	132226		/users/profile/177843	pjeseo	Board Member	5	11/01/2012	I am proud to have the privilege of sitting on the board of the Ky and Southern Indiana Stroke Association.  I have been a member of the board and have known Carrie Orman, the Executive Director, for close to 3 years now. Carrie works tirelessly to create awareness of the help and resources this organization can provide for anyone that has been affected by a stroke. She does this by overseeing fundraising and working tirelessly one event right after another. Her passion for this cause is evident as I have noticed she works many hours and takes a modest salary for her many efforts.  She relies heavily on volunteers to help her and shows great appreciation for those that do volunteer their time to help this wonderful organization.   
KY and SI Stroke Association	132138		/users/profile/177745	Yeadkins	Volunteer	5	11/01/2012	I recently moved to Louisville, KY and the day that I was packing the truck to move, my mom had a stroke.  My grandma passed after having multiple strokes and we found out that my mom has had multiple strokes and didn't even know it.  I wanted to become involved with an organization that helped to educate people on prevention, signs, warnings, etc., and my limited time with KSISA has shown me that they work very hard to give back to their community and the stroke patients and families that need the support.  I am very impressed by their efforts. KSISA is the type of organization that you want to work with to provide them with more help/resources to be able to educate and serve more people. 
KY and SI Stroke Association	132137		/users/profile/177744	M. Katz	Volunteer	5	11/01/2012	KSISA does a tremendous job of getting out and educating the public about every aspect of strokes.  If any business or group of any kind wants them on site, they are there in a heartbeat.  I have been volunteering with them for over five years now.  Unlike some, I don't have a family member or close friend that has had a stroke.  What I have learned over the years is that strokes can touch anyone at any age, even if they are in good physical shape.  Knowing the symptoms and getting immediate assistance is one of many of the important issues KSISA gets out there.  Also providing excellent resouces so individuals can follow up with their concerns.  In addition KSISA does amazing things with the small funding they receive.  They wholeheartedly deserve the recognition fitting of their work.
KY and SI Stroke Association	131756		/users/profile/177342	smith603	Volunteer	5	10/31/2012	My mom had a stroke in 2008, and shortly after I got involved with KSISA.  This organization is very close to my heart, and the work they do makes such a huge difference in the lives of so many.  Stroke affects everyone differently; but, no matter the effects, your life is changed forever.  The support system that KSISA provides is vital for those living with stroke, along with friends and family, to move forward.
KY and SI Stroke Association	62895		/users/profile/68771	traciemmeyer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/03/2011	I worked with this organization to provide a statewide stroke awareness program during the baseball season in 2010. We collaborated with the Heart and Stroke prevention team in our state. We attended 4 minor league baseball games at each of our minor league teams. We provided educational information, video PSA, 1:1 interactions with professionals across the state providing a free blood pressure reading and stroke prevention information. In all of my interactions with this organization I felt there was a personal and professional commitment on behalf of the staff. They had statewide partnerships willing to stand in the hot sun and interact with attendees at the game. They are very professional in their interactions and committed to their mission.

KY and SI Stroke Association	45706	4	/users/profile/46589	awalter	Board Member	4	06/25/2010	My family has been touched by stroke several times, and I work with hundreds of victims of stroke throughout healthcare careers. A stroke can be devastating, but not being aware of the risks, or signs and symtoms to seek immediate help is unacceptable.

Thanks for the leadership of KSISA in taking this desire seriously.

She first went to camp last summer for their physical disabilities week and has been anxiously awaiting all year for camp this summer. The first thing she said last year when we got there was " look mommy there are all kids like me here." Tears of inexpressible joy came to my eyes. She has a photo framed in a place of honor in her room of her time there. I thank everyone who has made this wonderful experience possible from the bottom of my heart.-a very Grateful Mom in Kentucky

They boast a vast array of activities for kids of any age and ability to enjoy: horse barn and arena ring, bowling alley and arcade, woodshop, indoor pool, archery range, and private lake with canoes and a fishing dock. The events they host are unique, inspired, and will never cease to bring joy to the campers they serve. The staff and medical staff are impeccably trained and care for campers as if they are their own children. Overall, the experience CCK provides to children is unforgettable and life changing. Kids get to experience camp despite any ailments or disabilities that disrupt their daily life. They are treated with the best care and can simultaneously feel safe and healthy, while also trying new things that they would never have the opportunity to try elsewhere. Go visit, volunteer, donate, and watch a child's while world view change as they go from a wheelchair to a horse, leg braces to the top of a rock wall, or from feeling alone to being surrounded by friends going through the same struggles as they do.

Project Camp, Inc. dba The Center for Courageous Kids	155411	2	/users/profile/206315	Kim_75	Client Served	5	04/19/2013	Over a Two years ago my family received the very upseting news that both of my children and myself the mom, had Long QT syndrome which is a very serious heart condition that can cause our hearts to stop at anytime.  When I found out about this camp, I was very worried they would be able to take care of my children.  I did the research and was amazed.  Then this summer my daughter went for her first time(it was her first night away from me since we found out about the heart problem in over two years)  I was so stressed and worried.  They were amazing when we got there to drop her off and then when we picked her up she didnt even want to come home.  She had an amazing time that moment was priceless to me.  Then back in Feb. we all went as a family to Family weekend camp.  WOW now I knew how amazing they were for real.  It was so great seeing my children have so much fun with others just like them and no worries about their health even for the weekend.  It was a well needed break and makes us stronger for our children.  I can not express to you how wonderful this place is, they are the best of the best.  Our medical expenses are huge and knowing we dont have to pay a penny is a huge weight off our shoulders.  Please anyone that can help please do, every penny counts and make an incredible difference in the life of a very special child who needs and deserves it.  Thank you CCK for being here and being so wonderful.  A special thanks to the amazing staff and voluteers there too, you make it the best!!!!!!!
Project Camp, Inc. dba The Center for Courageous Kids	155408	1	/users/profile/206313	Melissa131	Client Served	5	04/19/2013	Absolutely amazing!  We've gone three years in a row and my daughters (both the camper and her sister) are already talking about next year.  My daughter is tube fed, and we live in a very rural area.  She'd never met another tube fed kiddo, and getting to spend a weekend with kids just like her is amazing.  Not to mention having a medically fragile child is very expensive and to have a place we can go, meet other families that know what it's like, and it doesn't cost us a dime is so far beyond words to express how great it is.  WE LOVE CCK!!!

We are currently in the process of identifying schools for initial distribution where we intend to give a maximum of five per school until we get more. There are so many schools in need of this facility because the Government of Zimbabwe is coming up with an IT Policy that encourages the use of the Internet in schools including Rural ones. We hope that with the setting up of A Bigfamily Trust here in Zimbabwe it will go a long way in achieving this objective. We look forward to a long and fruitful association with your Organisation. Thank you once again and God Bless

All have one common goal and that is to provide better education opportunities for our children. Each person on their staff is knowledgeable, professional and exactly who I, as a parent, would want to guide my child's school years.With a child in the public school system, I can see first hand the need to connect with Teachers and provide them with the support and tools they need to teach well. In addition, CTL's attention to literacy and the arts are qualities that make this organization the top notch entity that it is.

Their professional development programs that mix the arts with the basics are increasingly being modified for delivery through today's videoconferencing technologies.  They are tops in all aspects.

Starting out as the Kentucky component of the project, CTL soon gained a leadership role within the project.  As a professional educator, I have never worked with a team of educators that were more prepared or more driven to share their knowledge for excellence in teaching and learning.  Even more amazing is their quest for continuing to learn through research and hands on involvement within classrooms across the state and the nation. Within my professional career I have never been more challenged to excel or felt more successful in my profession than in the three years spent as a part of the CTL team.

The purpose of the program was to improve the teaching skills of the faculty that participated.  The focus of the program was to teach students how to read to learn and write to learn so they could better teach themselves.  The program focused on student centered learning.  CTL practiced what they preached. Several techniques were explained and then we participated in the techniques. We used the techniques to learn the techniques.  The experience overall was a good one.  Although CTL states that the techniques are pertinent to all fields I did not find this to be the case in several instances.  I think the experience would have been more effective if the participants were from similar diciplines so the techniques could be adjusted better to fit that dicipline.  The faculty at the CTL were very helpful.  Someone even came to your classroom to observe you implementing their techniques and give you feedback on what they saw.

Five years ago several organizations in Kentucky collaboratively wrote a federal research grant (Striving Readers) to determine the effectiveness of literacy strategies to improve adolescent reading through a school wide model and a targeted intervention model. CTL provided the professional development for the school wide model, Adolescent Literacy Model, for the duration of the research project.  The staff from CTL were very professional, knowledgeable and dedicated to the project.  CTL has been instrumental in the design of the project and overall training in the project.  CTL staff supported all components of the project including the targeted intervention.  All evaluations of CTL's work was excellent citing updated info and research based strategies.  The work developed and implemented was superb to any I have seen in my 36 years in education.  Always prompt and punctual and ready to deliver.  And always keeping the students and teachers as the focal point.  Their work focused on each individual school needs. All partners have been very impressed with CTL's work and many plan to continue the work with CTL even after the project is completed in Spring 2011.

Since then, I've built a small (aobut 300 volume) graphic novel collection at our college library, given a presentation on building lessons using graphic novels and will soon present at a state-wide library conference.

This was a wonderful experience for a college professor.  As a professor, you focus so strongly on your discipline area that actually learning to teach is sometimes pushed aside.  This training gave me the materials and skills to try out new active learning techniques in my classroom.  The follow-up sessions and opportunities to work with other faculty across disciplines was particularly helpful in learning to apply the ideas to my classes.  This training basically helped me learn some new techniques and ideas for reaching my students.  Even though I may not use the exact techniques, the concept of active learning and the types of activities I learned helped me to become a stronger college teacher.

The rehabilitation of injured and orphaned animals is a great service to the community and gives animal lovers a caring and reliable place to call when they come across such animals.  In addition, they provide many wonderful educational programs to school groups and other organizations.

The animals are well taken care for by the director of the organization and the volunteers. It is a professionally run nonprofit that rehabs wildlife and returns them to the wild for another go! The organization also provides many educational programs and gets involved in other community events.

Education of the public is the best way to help wildlife.  Caring for injured and orphaned wildlife and then safely returning them to their wild lives is a privilege.  Most of these animals have been injured or orphaned because of human interference, so it feels like the right thing to do.

The fur ball turned out to be an infant rabbit which had somehow been carried from its nest. The animal was in dire conditions and needed attention. Not knowing where to take mammals who had been injured, I did a quick Google search which led me to Second Chances. I was hesitant at first because I was unfamiliar with this rehabilitation center, and knew from past experiences that not all centers are created or managed equally. That day, however, I was able to meet with Brigette and transfer the rabbit to her passionate care. Her compassion for the animal and knowledge of the condition and processes needed to rehabilitate the rabbit was immediately evident. And her eagerness to get the infant rabbit to immediate care was more than enough to dissuade any notion that I may be doing the wrong thing or leaving him in the wrong hands. I am certain that the quality of care for the animals at Second Chances as well as their educational and community outreach efforts are well above the average in this particular field. From the people to the facility, this non-profit is a great example of what every non-profit should strive to become.

Was picking her kids up at the bus stop when they found 2 baby opossum's. Naturally their first thought is to call me and see if I will take them in. Well knowing that here at my house I couldn't provide the proper care they needed so I asked around the Zoo and Doug McCoy told me about Bridgette working here at Second Chances and so I made the call and she was more than happy to take them in. As I have to name everything.... Thelma and Louise were taken great care of and have since been released. I look forwards to supporting and helping in the future.

Second Chances is a small, grass roots organization. The founder and team of volunteers are passionately dedicated  to the conservation of wildlife through rehabilitation and education.  There are very few agencies whose services are as comprehensive as those offered by Second Chances.  To have the opportunity to preserve a tiny beating heart....to care for an injured animal who would perish without intervention...that is making a difference.  It is hard work....it can be emotionally uplifting, and at other times, emotionally exhausting, but we are making a difference for wildlife in Kentucky.  I love and stand for everything Second Chances does to care for and protect our wildlife.

I absolutely love caring for these precious ones who need us.    Of course, cleaning out all of their cages is not as fun (ha-ha!) but keeps this center healthy for all of the animals and volunteers.   I have only been volunteering for a short time but it has been so worthwhile.   It is hard saying goodbye to the animals as we release them but we know that we are doing the right thing.      I have participated in several of the educational opportunities at libraries and Farmington, and it is so rewarding to see the reactions of everyone to our little charges.    We volunteers all adore the animals we have for educational purposes and spoil them!   My favorite is the groundhog Major.    You will see him on our website and Facebook page.

I had become very attached to a possum who would visit me each night to eat some dinner when one night she showed up unable to use her back legs.  I was frantic with worry as to what was going to happen to her and I had  no idea what I could do to help her.  A friend suggested I contact Second Chances and they immediately agreed to take her.  Ultimately they were not able to save her but it was a huge relief to know that she had a humane ending with love and care.  Even months later I still miss my possum friend. Second Chances provides vital information and education on how humans can coexist with wildlife rather than destroy it.

The facilities are very clean, well maintained, and safe for the animals as well as for the volunteer staff that works there. The care provider is accredited in animal rehabilitation and very knowledgeable about how to care for all types of wild animals, from raccoons to bats. Second Chances also offers educational programs about our state's wildlife to local public and private schools in Oldham and Jefferson Counties in KY. Once they are healthy and/or old enough, the animals are slowly transitioned back into the wild through a process that helps them learn to forage for food and adjust to their natural habitat. Both my 9 year old and my 7 year old have learned a lot from this organization and Brigette Williams, the director and rehab specialist who started Second Chances.

Because of those few, our organization has come a long way in a short time.  Those few have multiplied and continue to grow.   The NWHA is an organization that promotes the sound practices of training and exhibiting the Tennessee Walking horse.  It is also an organization that is just fun to be a part of.  People encourage their fellow exhibitor and are more than willing to lend a helping hand.

In 1970 the Federal Government responded with the Horse Protection Act. Since the beginning, the Act has attempted to stop the abuse of this magnificent breed but has failed. The practice of abuse continues. The National Walking Horse Association has come about for those of us like me that want a forum to show our sound and natural moving gaited horses. I believe that in the near future they will become the organization of choice for the world to showcase the breed. As a hint of whats to come they were asked to represent the bred in the World Equestrian Games. I believe this is a wonderful organization, with a true message of hope for the future of the Tennessee Walking Horse.
National Walking Horse Association	64375		/users/profile/70385	fourbeatbaby	Board Member	5	02/07/2011	The National Walking Horse Association was formed in 1998 to promote the sound Tennessee walking horse and to end the practice of soring. Most people outside the horse world, and even some people inside it, are not aware of the abusive training and showing practices of a certain segment of the Tennessee walking horse world.  These practices have existed for decades and there is specific legislation prohibiting it, known as the Federal Horse Protection Act.  The NWHA offers a show circuit for owners who wish to compete against only sound, healthy horses.  At their horse shows, entries are carefully examined prior to admittance, and there is zero tolerance for horses that have any signs of present or past abuse.  Horses that do not meet the standard are rejected; while their owners are ticketed and face other consequences.  The NWHA continues its goal of advocating for the end of abusive and inhumane treatment of the Tennessee walking horse.  Receipt of the prize money would assist this group in acting on behalf of these voiceless animals.

National Walking Horse Association	64267		/users/profile/70259	Jean-Marie D.	Board Member	5	02/07/2011	I have been involved in the Tennessee Walking Horse Industry for over 20 years now. As a child I enjoyed trail riding and showing in youth classes at local shows.  My father and I seemed to collect horses over the years, for both the trails and the "rail" and I was very blessed to have owned and own some truly wonderful horses that have become forever friends.  The Tennessee Walking Horse Industry is very complex you see.  It is comprised of such a wide variety of individuals that each have their own agendas and wish to promote that agenda entirely.  My father and I have always and ever been advocates for the SOUND horse and we beleive that horses should be treated and respected and given an environment as close to their natural one as possible to flourish.  For an individual like myself who loves to show and wants to educate and network with other SOUND horse people, the NWHA provides a wonderful place to do this.  It is truly the only Horse Industry Organization that stands by their word with fair inspections and honest judging.  It is a wonderful tapestry of individuals that beleives in the naturally gaited horse and how to go about showcasing their abilities the best way for the horse and the rider.  The NWHA also provides an outlet for trail riders, youth and versatility, which are all areas where the Tennessee Walking Horse excels and should be in the public spotlight.  The NWHA is the only Tennessee Walking Horse HIO that was invited to preform at the World Equestrian Games that was held in Kentucky this past year (2010) and I can tell you that this came to be becasue of the amazing volunteers, the organization members and the fact that we as gaited horse lovers police ourselves and want good genuine people to promote our breed and not be a deterrent to our wonderful breed.  The NWHA does what no other HIO does, it provides unity among it's members and gives us a safe place to exhibit and promote our horses with like-minded individuals.  I can honestly say that from showing for over 20 years that this is the first time I have actually felt like I am a part of a family, a show family that appreciates my dedication, my love and my obvious sincerity to the Tennessee Walking Horse and the NWHA not only rewards those that they feel are exceptional they stand by those individuals ideas and contributions.  I have been welcomed to the NWHA with warm welcome arms, unlike other organizations I have belonged to in the past and I feel that the NWHA has high standards for it's members yet each and everyone of us want to be a part of this organization because of that.  This is an organization with integrity, character and morals and for that I am grateful because I have not been able to find that or the comraderie in other organizations like I have found in this one.  A+ to the NWHA and what they provide, their mission sells itself.

National Walking Horse Association	63798		/users/profile/69741	Lila Corey	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/05/2011	NWHA has definitely changed the overall image of the Tennessee Walking Horse for the better.  Before NWHA, there were few horse shows that one could exhibit their horse and know they were on a level playing field.  NWHA has changed that, and given the TWH owners a venue to show with respect, sound practices, and horses who are not in pain and who have better conformation due to more selective breeding practices to get back to that original natural "walking" horse instead of the pacey big lick horses.  There is a huge youth membership in this organization, and versatility of the horses owned by these youth is amazing to watch at shows.  I love taking my students to shows now, they aren't exposed to unethical training practices at NWHA events.  
National Walking Horse Association	63106		/users/profile/68996	Black Keys	Volunteer	5	02/03/2011	Before I delve into positive impacts, influences, mission, vision of the NWHA, I believe the reader needs a quick synopsis of why the NWHA exists today.Since the 1940's the inhumane training practices of the Tennessee Walking Horse(TWH) became widespread and prevalent.  The practice of soring the front ankles to enhance their gait for national competition became the norm and IS heavily ingrained in the culture of the padded performance TWH industry .  Although the Federal Horse Protection Act of 1977 was meant to protect the horse and prohibit such hideous acts, these practices are STILL prevalent in 2011.The NWHA was formed for breeders, owners, and exhibitors who love the breed and realize there IS a better way.  With a strong mission statement and a vision to promote the  naturally gaited Walking Horse, it offers a wonderful alternative to showcase and promote the flat-shod TWH.  Since I have been involved with this organization I have witnessed this organization change the hearts and minds of persons who have participated on the "inhumane" side of the TWH industry.  The NWHA continues to promote positively, maintain their integrity, and allows the membership to drive the organization. In summary, the NWHA offers a three (3) important aspects.  1) It offers a culture and vision for members to be involved in and organization who supports the HUMANE treatment and training of such a wonderful breed. 2) It offers stringent enforcement of the Horse Protection Act, to ensure the horse is protected 3) Offers an alternative for those who EVENTUALLY realize inhumane treatment of the TWH is ethically and morally wrong.

Watching the behavior of these horses and their owners/riders at a large regional horse show, with one rider even asking me to hold her horse while she checked on a ruling, showed me some very positive things about this breed of horse and the friendliness of the people within NWHA. Several months later I adopted a Walking Horse of my own.  The NWHA had opened my eyes to what a Walking Horse should be and could be as an alternative to the gross exageration that I had seen in the media.  The NWHA promotes the versatility and utility of the Walking Horse, sponsors many events and activities that appeal to Walking Horse owners, young and old, as well as works toward developing the potential of the breed in general.  Because of the information that I've learned from the people within this organization I was able to help a friend to find a Walking Horse of her own.  It is a tribute to this organization that they were selected to be the breed affiliate for the Walking Horse at the 2010 World Equestrian Games.  A high honor indeed.  This board and members of this organization make the NWHA a "people-oriented" horse association that I'm proud know.
National Walking Horse Association	62978		/users/profile/68857	Margie	Professional with expertise in this field	3	02/03/2011	 A 'horse nut' since a toddler, as a young adult I  riding smooth-gaited horses.  I've advocated and tried to promote the Walking Horse since 1987 (24 years).  Upon  entering  the show world as an owner/exhibitor (about 20 years ago) I learned  of the routine burning of horses' legs chemically. This was one method of several to help the 'trainer' succeed.  Clearly, I was a novice!Over time, I learned that  basic cruelty was commonly accepted and expected in that show world. People were driven by the desire for public and/or  professional status. I learned too much of various ways to cause pain in the animal. The initial members of NWHA  began organizing those who cared for their animals humanely, regardless of show performance. The horse was expected to move freely and naturally, With No Pain.My best advice to NWHA is to stay true to these roots. Remember the simplicity of the natural horse. Promote That Horse. Train judges who grade by this standard.

National Walking Horse Association	62955		/users/profile/68832	ShowHides	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/03/2011	The National Walking Horse Association changed an industry. My Wife and I were months away from quitting as Professional Horse Trainers because our industry had become so corrupt. Horses were suffering and people were cheating by paying off judges to receive higher placements during the World Championships. If the national news media covered the Walking Horse, it was usually talking about the horrible abuse of horses found within our industry. NWHA stopped this abuse. They created a no tolerance industry, where if you were found to be abusing horses you were suspended from competition for life. Over the last decade, the signs of abuse are almost forgotten and the show ring has become a friendly place again because the abusers left and the membership united against them. NWHA taught us that no government agency, like the USDA or the Humane Society, can stop abuse by themselves, it takes the public or the membership of an organization like ours to unite against it. You must point a finger at the abuser and call their actions out for what they are. The National Walking Horse Association and its members chose to do this and save a breed of horse that suffered under horrible training and showing abuse. NWHA now has 8 of the 10 largest Walking Horse show under its supervision and MacGregor Stables is proud to be a part of this movement and association. Our business is doing great and we just finished representing the Walking Horse at the World Equestrian Games in Lexington Kentucky last fall, which is the largest all horse competition in the world and the first time that it was held in the USA. MacGregor Stables also became the most winning team in the Walking Horse industry because we chose to believe in a new idea, horses could win while showing sound in a protected environment. Thank you, NWHA, for all that you did to save our amazing breed of horse and congratulations for being accepted into the United States Equestrian Federation as an associate member.
National Walking Horse Association	62940		/users/profile/68817	Debconaway	General Member of the Public	5	02/03/2011	As a new owner of Walking Horses, The National Walking Horse Association, has helped me have a deeper, well rounded, knowledge base of the Walking Horse. I have been provided with "go to" resources, and helpful voices for all questions regarding Walking Horses. This breed and those involved in the Association could not be deemed as anything but relaxed, friendly, and versatile! Debra Conaway
National Walking Horse Association	62917		/users/profile/68793	tnwalkin	Board Member	5	02/03/2011	The National Walking Horse Association is a family friendly organizaiton whose mission is to protect the Tennessee Walking Horse from the abusive practices that some use to train the horses of the show world.  NWHA offers a sound, level playing field for everyone from the novice horse owner to the professional trainer to show their horses.  NWHA was recently accepted as a associate organization by the United States Equestrian Federation and is the first TN Walking Horse Association to receive this honor. In addtion, the FEI selected the NWHA as the sole breed representative of the TN Walking Horse during the 2010 World Equestrian Games. With an office at the prestigious KY Horse Park, NWHA not only offers a sound, competitive show venue but has developed programs for verstality promotion, youth and trail.  NWHA is partnered, as a supporter of the American Competitive Trail Horse Association in their efforts of finding jobs and caring for the thousands of rescue horses living in the USA. Through educational programs and expansion nationwide, NWHA is bringing the issue of abusive practices in the TN Walking Horse world closer to an end.  The 100% USDA Horse Protection Act compliancy is a title that only NWHA holds.  Through the dedicated inspectors and judges, as well as the directors and executive committee, NWHA has become a valuable asset in the fight against abuse.
National Walking Horse Association	62896		/users/profile/68772	bamerit07	Volunteer	5	02/03/2011	NWHA is an organization that promotes the "chemical-free"  Tennessee Walking Horse.    This is NWHA's 11th year of promoting "sound" horses and giving those that love them an opportunity to show and compete fairly. I started showing Tennessee Walking Horses about 20 years ago.  I knew going into the show ring that the best ribbon I could ever hope to win was a 5th or 6th, if any, due to the fact that all of the competition was "chemically" soring their  horses.  (chemicals are placed around the horse's front feet, wrapped in plastic to burn the flesh & next chains are applied to the "sore" area.  The horse hurts too badly to put weight on the front feet resulting in an exageratedly "big" front end.)   The pain is excrutiating.   NWHA was started at great personal expense to a few brave & humane individuals who no longer wanted to show against "sore" horses.  They received death threats and the lives of their horses were threatened by those who didn't see a problem with the abusive training methods.  IF they were successful in starting an organization that did not believe in hurting horses, then that would mean that soring must be WRONG.    Now, over a decade later, NWHA is going strong & increasing in members while the "other" Walking Horse organizations are imploding.  Heartfelt thanks goes to the USDA for policing the horse shows through strict inspections that penalize soring.  And great admiration to NWHA for providing the Tennessee Walking Horse with  a "pain-free"  arena to show & their owners a "non-abusive" family with which to belong.       
St. Vincent de Paul | Louisville	141222	2	/users/profile/187485	Scott Haner,	Board Member	5	11/19/2012	Our Catholic faith calls us to find Christ by reaching out generously to those in need. SVDP has given me the ability to do just that. We meet people where they are, some hungry, some homeless, some fighting drug and alcohol addiction. We offer them care and compassion, hoping to communicate that they are not walking alone, seeking to guide them on the path to sustained independence. Our expertise is in case management, offering not only resources but also encouragement to the clients. Hopefully, as we seek to see Christ in them, they will also see Christ in us.  
St. Vincent de Paul | Louisville	139661	1	/users/profile/185782	Blackhawk	Volunteer	5	11/15/2012	Being a part of the St. Vicent de Paul Society is an eye opener. I feel I was going thru day to day with blinders on and not really realizing that there is struggle and suffering not a half a world away but very close to home. Trying to make a difference an ease someone's difficulty is as much of a reward for me as it is to those I try to help. Specifically by seeing the gratitude in their eyes and the relief in their voices when we can help keep the light's on or their kids fed. It is spiritually uplifting for me to think that I'm apart of something so great and genuine. One incredible affect it has had on me is the friendships I have developed with the other volunteers, it is literally like an extended family that grows with no end in sight. It is an honor and privledge to be counted among the Society.  
St. Vincent de Paul | Louisville	139373		/users/profile/185488	Kristin24	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/14/2012	I have had the absolute pleasure of serving at SVdP in multiple capacities, as a program manager, Assistant Director of Programs and as a volunteer at the Open Hand Kitchen.  SVdP provides a variety of inner city and rural offerings to meet and serve others where they are, from housing programs, thrift stores, vehicle donation, food baskets and daily meals - to events such as the annual coat drive and Santa Shop.  The level of dedication, care and service provided by SVdP staff, volunteers/Vincentians, conference members is unmatched!!! 
St. Vincent de Paul | Louisville	138954		/users/profile/185047	Angela Lincoln	Donor	5	11/14/2012	I teach theology at a Catholic high school.  Every semester, I bring all of my classes to SVDP for an experience that alters the worldview of almost every student who attends.  SVDP staff allow my students to see two different shelters and the soup kitchen.  We also get to visit with a resident in one of the long-term shelters.  When we hear the residents' story, it shatters stereotypes that many of my students hold about people who are poor or homeless.  This hour-long visit is one of the most powerful learning experiences in my course.  I'm very grateful for SVDP's efforts to educate our young people about the needs of marginalized people in our community.

St. Vincent de Paul | Louisville	137877		/users/profile/183900	Melissa109	Donor	5	11/13/2012	I was introduced to St. Vincent de Paul by my 9 year old daughter.  She had visited with a friend and donated blankets for the needy.  She was so disturbed that there weren't enough blankets for everyone that she came home and organized a blanket drive at our church.  We returned in a few months with an abundance of blankets that were distributed.  We have since been back with a donation of several large boxes of Kool Aid and Gideon Bibles that were distributed by a Gideon from our church.  We have worked closely with Linda Romine and Donna Young to organize our visits and have been made to feel very welcome.  St. Vincent de Paul is a great organization doing great work for those in need.  I am thankful to be involved and look forward to many more visits.    
St. Vincent de Paul | Louisville	137509		/users/profile/183497	st. Vincent de Paul	Board Member	5	11/12/2012	This non-profit touches many people that are definitely in need. It is truly a rewarding experience when one can see firsthand the fruits of your work.
St. Vincent de Paul | Louisville	137422		/users/profile/183403	CPoelma	Volunteer	5	11/12/2012	The individuals that run this organization, are inspiring in themselves - perhaps because their work inspires them.  Regardless of the church and its members in other capacities, the work that the church does for the poor and down trodden is beyond compare.  If any Catholic is feeling lukewarm about their faith - this organization is one they should get involved with to reignite their passion for being Catholic.
St. Vincent de Paul | Louisville	137317		/users/profile/183287	demarcobk	Volunteer	5	11/12/2012	I joined my parish SVDP conference less than a  year ago.   I have & continue to work in a number of other volunteer orgs since I retired.  Without question I have found this the most rewarding experience in my lifetime.   We channel  near 100% of the donations received from parish members to those in need with a minimum of bureaucry.   Several times a month going into people's homes, reviewing their needs, making recommendations for long term solutions, praying with them & keeping them from being evicted or their lights& heat turned off is truly a miraculous experience.  One especially poignant example was an elderly woman, a Muslim Afgan refugee, who likely would have died if she had lost electricity for her breathing machine.   
St. Vincent de Paul | Louisville	137309	1	/users/profile/183278	dcowhig	Volunteer	5	11/12/2012	I got involved with the St Raphaels Christmas SVdP  Food Basket program several years ago and found it to be very rewarding to be able to participate in brining a little cheer and comfort to those less fortunate than myself,Moreover is is refreshing to be part of the generosity that is shared by our parish that support SVdL and those in need at the local level. I began to attend the SVdL monthly meetings and was impressed with the outreach of the society and it;s inner workings with other SVdP groups in the area through networking resources of the different chapters to help those in need regardless of race, religion ,or creed, I joined the Society in 2008 and vollunteer each month when our chapeter serves at the SVdP helping Hands kitchen when possible, The consept of SVdP of extending a helping hand up vs a hand out makes sense and that is the primary reason for my interest in the Society of Saint Vincent dePaul

St. Vincent de Paul | Louisville	137295		/users/profile/183263	Dminton	Volunteer	5	11/12/2012	Several times a year I work with Donna Young to bring 8th graders down to the St. Vincent dePaul campus for a tour. The youth and adults who come learn so much about the needs of the community: feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, sheltering the homeless. Further they learn how they can serve as well. I believe that this learning helps set them on a path of life-long service for others. It is always a privilege to come to the campus and meet the people who serve and hear the stories of those who have been helped by this wonderful organization. I will continue to support them in any way I can.

And the Open Hand Kitchen provides a safe and comfortable place with a decent meal for an increasing number of individuals and families.

It is truly a one to one personal contact with people who are struggling with life.  In many aspects of life you talk about what needs to be done about a problem and wait for someone else to take action.  Well SVD is taking action and making a difference with every person it has contact with.  I personally have received hugs and thank yous followed by tears of gratitude from clients who were at a point in life when they have lost faith in anyone caring.  God works in this non profit by way of the devoted volunteers who pick people up when they are  at lifes hardest moments.  
St. Vincent de Paul | Louisville	136059		/users/profile/181963	bonk	Volunteer	5	11/08/2012	Being a Vincentian has meant so much to me.  It is a great way to meet my neighbors.  People who I never would have met otherwise.  To hear their stories and able to help them is a real blessing.   Sure there are some that take advantage but there are so many that are just down on their luck.  They have illnesses, loss of jobs, or etc. but to know that you can give them food, rent, or utilities turned back on.  They are so appreciative.  Some begin to cry.  It really touches you.  You go home knowing that you helped someone.  That God used you to bring theym His hope for a brighter tomorrow.  It is a great calling to be a Vincentian and I am so blessed that I answered that call.  
Answers In Genesis Inc	300002		/users/profile/390829	HisDustman	Donor	5	08/09/2016	Visited ARK Encounter July 5, 2016 (ribbon cutting).  Every Christian and every truth seeking non-Christian  should visit.   The written account of Noah and his sons  comes to life.  The worldwide flood really happened and the evidence is displayed at the ARK and the Creation Museum. Answers in Genesis teaches that the Book of Genesis is the foundation of the Bible. There is no reason for any Christian to compromise scripture with the thoughts of unbelievers.  The science is in plain sight and Answers in Genesis spotlights all of it, whether dinosaurs, carbon dating, flood geology, supernovas, bugs, boats, or skin color.  The Bible is true and Answers in Genesis is part of God's plan to save His people.

This is a much-needed ministry in our world today.  Every time I accompany my grandchildren to the Creation Museum, they all enjoy the day, all ages finding something of interest, and end up being much more interest in exploring God's world through science.  I applaud the organization for their courage and vision.

Answers In Genesis explores the truth by proving the Bible to hold true in Science while subsequently disproving the theory of evolution. Please support this nonprofit.
Answers In Genesis Inc	233403		/users/profile/297197	sivequest	General Member of the Public	4	11/11/2014	Answers in Genesis is an organization that fills a large gap in christian apologetics, which is likely why it is strongly disliked by scoffers. It stands unashamed on the inerrancy of scripture by analyzing evidence and searching for answers where they can be found instead of making up answers in archeology.
Answers In Genesis Inc	220554	1	/users/profile/284216	kkit1	Client Served	5	10/07/2014	I have personally met Mr. Ham and found him to be a very humble and sincere man, who is dedicated to God's Word and defending it in our increasingly hostile, anti-Christian culture which finds it foundation in the theory of evolution.  Therefore, those who believe in evolution and the worldview that it leads to are vehemently opposed to the attacks on their foundational beliefs.  I have not found Mr. Ham to be cynical, unkind, or vengeful towards any of his attackers.  I believe that Answers in Genesis simply wants to hold out to the world the information that is (shamefully) not being taught in our public schools. I have been to the Creation Museum and believe that they have done an excellent job at explaining how different worldviews affect how we interpret what we see around us, and they have done an excellent job at explaining the Christian Worldview.

Answers In Genesis Inc	199744	4	/users/profile/260764	jrw11	Donor	5	05/06/2014	I'm a practical scientist (Aerospace engineer), Board treasurer for a non-related non-profit, and a long-time AiG donor. AiG interprets the Bible in a straightforward manner, which is as it should be. No one stands as Judge over the Bible, so as long as AiG stands with the Bible, enough said. AiG may be doing more for mankind and the USA than most non-profits, but sometimes the people who are out of touch with reality don't realize they are out of touch. It takes a touch from their Creator to get on the reality axis. I wasn't there, but an eye-witness reports that dinosaurs and humans were indeed created at the same approximate time. The flood of Noah's day explains a whole lot more geological evidence than any other theory we have, not to mention the eye-witness reports. Keep up the good work, AiG.

Answers In Genesis Inc	95542	4	/users/profile/110942	Dawn Sutherland	Donor	5	08/11/2011	Whatever your position on the creation/evolution debate, I believe that AIG is entirely sincere in their beliefs. They are ultimately promoting the authority of the Bible, and I find that to be a noble cause. A lot of people do not believe in mixing science with faith, but I believe that the scientists at AIG are doing what we are told to do in Romans 12: they are using the abilities that God gave them in service to Him. The focus of AIG is on the book of Genesis, and particularly the creation account, but they are an apologetics ministry that deals with many issues concerning the Bible. When I have a question concerning scripture, I usually check the AIG website first for the answer. However, I devote a lot of time to study, and I always look at both sides of an issue. Thus far, I have not been impressed with the opponents of AIG.  I receive mail and email from AIG, but it is not overwhelming as with other charities; most of what I receive is newsletters that I registered to get.   I judge this organization based on what I see. Their scientists have the credentials, but those that I have seen display humility. At the Creation Museum, I was impressed that the scientists/speakers were so accessible. At the Stargazers Night event, Dr. Jason Lisle was willing to take as many questions as we wished to ask.  I donate to various charities often, but I have been most impressed by the personal interaction with AIG. Each time I have donated, I have received a hand-written thank-you note. One staff member even offered to pray for me, and then responded to my request with a hand-written note. Every staff member that I have dealt with has been entirely pleasant. In my view, AIG reflects Christian love and values.
Answers In Genesis Inc	84677	8	/users/profile/93967	Roxy	Volunteer	1	04/01/2011	Regardless of your personal view of the subject matter this organization is in dire financial position, even for a non-profit.   Their main assets are held within the museum they require for their operation, if we remove mission critical these assets from consideration then their total assets are around $4,000,000 with total liabilities of $11,000,000 and only $220,000 cash on hand.  This organization is playing rather hard and fast with liquidity.   Further more the presidents entire family is on the payroll and the organization makes regular purchases from for profit companies owned and operated by board members.  Including over $1,000,000 to Board Member Tim Dudley and new leaf publishing. Although I have no doubt these transactions are within the letter of the law (considering the hefty amount of money they spend on legal consulting even though they also pay an in house lawyer) it always gives me pause when I see the personal enrichment of those responsible for the stewardship of public funds. Including Ken Ham doubling his compensation from $80,000 to $170,000 over the course of one year. AIG Officer Compensation:  $586,000 (5 officers) Ham family Compensation: $322,000 And all of this while revenue at the organization dropped 13%

Their materials are professional and very useful.  They approach the subject of creation with scientific accuracy, while maintaining Biblical integrity.  They always adhere to high standards in logic, evidence and research.  There would be a lot less heat on this topic if all others would do the same.

They engage our culture and society by exposing opinions that are generally accepted as fact.  The Creation Museum is a professional display of world history from a Biblical perspective.  I highly recommend spending at least on full day at the museum.  Their apologetics resources help Christians defend their faith with a Biblical interpetation of the facts.

They  are doing something wonderful for our men and women who need a home. This is for purecyn: I don't know who you are and reading your comment I don't really want to. And I would almost bet my bottom dollar you have not been to the Village in awhile. I marked your comment as helpful because it will make me work harder, for non-believers like yourself, to eat your words.  My husband is 61 and he could raise cattle and chickens with no problem, just because someone is over the age of 60 and homeless does not mean that they are helpless. Vanover Village is only two years old and it does take time for projects as bis as this will take off and get running.  Keeping the Government out of it is the best way to do what needs to be done. Please be patient everyone and say a Prayer so that we the public can help John and Lisa. 
Pfc. Richard L. Vanover Veterans Village	157030		/users/profile/208261	SheVet	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/03/2013	Vanover Veteran's Village is a wonderful organization that I am proud to be associated with. The founder of this project almost bankrupt himself funding the start-up costs for this project. As a veteran myself, the fact that the veterans will be able to assist in the farming is something they will be proud of, because we veterans are proud of what we've done and continue to take pride in our actions and activities. The organization is a 501C3, the books are open for ANYONE to view, and there has been no unscrupulous activities concerning donations or money - more than I can say for other charities claiming to represent the veterans. The Village is still in its initial phases, as purchasing 35 acres of land alone is a great start-up cost. I would invite anyone to visit the Village, look at the books, look at the plans, and realize something of this size cannot be accomplished overnight. As for not accepting government grants, the purpose behind this is to minimize red tape and costs. As a veteran, I can proudly state my involvement with the Vanover Veteran's Village.

Vanover Veterans Village	156944	1	/users/profile/208148	purecyn	Professional with expertise in this field	1	05/02/2013	I finally found what they are calling Vanover Village, I wanted to see for myself and I'll tell you I wouldn't want my father living there.  For someone that has been raising money for this cause for several years and that is all they have accomplished I question their integrity.  It looks like a tool shed.  The fact that they don't want any government help to be accountable for, how the income is spent is suspect.  They haven't assisted one Veteran!!!!!  I looked up the Articles of Inc. and much to my confusion I'm not sure what "scientific purposes" means in relationship to this organization.  Adding to the fact they are taking Veterans 62 yrs. and older and expect them to raise cattle, chickens and farm his land so they can be self sustaining!  Really have you ever heard of the HUD-VASH program that the VA and HUD are working together in  housing homeless veterans?  They do report to the government.

Vanover Veterans Village	154039	3	/users/profile/204868	Lori59	Donor	5	04/10/2013	What a great service the Vanover Veteran's Village is providing for those who sacrificed so much for us. I am a proud donor of this organization even though I'm only making my first visit there myself next month. John Vanover has a vision and I am proud to say that I am helping, even if only in a small way, to help make that vision a reality.  Our veterans deserve so much more than they often get, and I am so happy that Mr. Vanover is changing that. I couldn't be prouder to be associated with such a great organization.
Pfc. Richard L. Vanover Veterans Village	153625	4	/users/profile/204449	Wen V.	Donor	5	04/08/2013	Vanover Veterans Village is a organization that I proudly donate to. I know exactly where and how my contribution is being used. Being in its beginning stages it is easily something that a single person could give up on, but John's determination to make this work is the reason why I have donated and will donate again to. He's not asking for the world...just enough to make his dream of this Village for veterans self sufficient. I believe in him and the dream, every veteran should have a place to call home. 
Pfc. Richard L. Vanover Veterans Village	152801	4	/users/profile/203703	kellertype	Donor	5	04/06/2013	Being a vet, it breaks my heart when I see once proud men &  women, who once served our country, homeless without the basic necessities of life. This village is beyond a shelter and offers hope and respect to these vets.
Pfc. Richard L. Vanover Veterans Village	152376	4	/users/profile/203393	fcaikerd	General Member of the Public	5	04/05/2013	Vanover Veterans Village is a tremendous asset to our community. It provides housing for Veterans who otherwise would not have a place to live. The founder of this wonderful non-profit has been able to do so much with very little. John Vanover has the heart of a champion and he will not stop until he has completed the overall mission and goals for housing homeless veterans. How wonderful it is to have people like him in our community who literally give everything they have to help others.
Pfc. Richard L. Vanover Veterans Village	149736	3	/users/profile/199677	Shannon39	Volunteer	5	02/21/2013	I admire John's efforts and sacrifice for the sake of all veterans and his willingness to keep pushing forward in his efforts against adversity.   Hoo Rah!
Pfc. Richard L. Vanover Veterans Village	149667	4	/users/profile/199556	Ann Nation	General Member of the Public	5	02/20/2013	I have known John Vanover for over a year now and I think I know his heart.  He has a heart for homeless veterans.  I have been to the site of the Pfc. Richard L. Vanover Veterans Village and been inside one of the housing units on the property.  I am very excited about the possibilities for the men and women that will be able to live in these units and what they will be able to accomplish once they feel secure in having a place to live.  These homes will bring back dignity to the men and women that most deserve it, the ones that risked their lives for our freedom.  
Pfc. Richard L. Vanover Veterans Village	149664	4	/users/profile/199552	Camplarge	Volunteer	4	02/20/2013	I had the honor of spending a weekend last year as a guest of and volunteer at the Pfc. Richard L. Vanover Veterans Village. Though still in the early stages of development, the vision of director John Vanover is marvelous.Once fully operational, the triple V will provide sustainable housing where Veterans that might otherwise drop through the cracks of society can live in an environment that promotes health, well-being, and will sustain the pride so richly deserved by those that served our Country. Perhaps greatest of all, the mission of the triple V calls for providing these services with NO funding from any Government agency.The Vanover Veterans Village is also equipped to serve the community by providing a venue for entertainment during its fundraisers and at other times of the year.Summing it all up, the triple V is responsibly managed, will serve Veterans, and the community with no cost to taxpayers. Thats a rare find these days! Respectfully Submitted, Harris Parke
Childrens Healthcare Is A Legal Duty Inc	93673	2	/users/profile/107898	DeHarpporte	Donor	5	07/09/2011	CHILD works tirelessly with individual State legislaturs to remove the legal exemptions that some parents claim from State laws that require parents to provide medical care for their children, regardless of their own personal or religious beliefs. I have seen the founder of CHILD, Rita Swan, present her case with great compassion and powerful impact. She reaches the hearts of the legislators, motivating them to put the health of children above the personal beliefs and religious "freedom" of their parents. Ms. Swan travels tirelessly to State after State, working with attorneys and health professionals to overturn the exemptions from child protection laws that many States have passed under the pressure of the Christian Science Church and similar cults that claim that Christ will do a better job than doctors in treating children's illnesses, even when the illnesses are life threatening. Over the past several years,  Ms. Swan has acheived success in many States, thus greatly improving or even saving the lives of many children. CHILD does not have a large fund raising departement. It devotes almost all of its contributions to travelling and lobbying state legislatures throughout the country. The only thing donors receive from CHILD is a bimonthly newsletter documenting the poignant stories of child endangerment and the success CHILD has had. I can't think of a more worthy cause than protecting the health, and sometimes the lives, of innocent children. CHILD, working with minimal funding, has acheived great success in rescuing children from the cruel practices of some parents who allow their children to suffer or even die because they believe that God will protect them or, shudder, allow them to suffer and die because God wills it.  
Childrens Healthcare Is A Legal Duty Inc	93181		/users/profile/106978	Carol	General Member of the Public	5	06/30/2011	I have supported CHILD for a few years now and was impressed with their dedication to children's health.  The organizations leaders actually moved to my state, Oregon, to urge lawmakers to repeal exemptions to prosecution for neglect and endangerment of children by their misguided parents.  They were critical to the success of passing legislation in Oregon to help ensure children's access to proper medical intervention.  I applaud their every effort and will continue to support this important work.
Childrens Healthcare Is A Legal Duty Inc	92924		/users/profile/106665	Laura Rosenbury	Volunteer	5	06/29/2011	I have admired the work of CHILD for almost twenty years.  No other organization is solely committed to helping children subject to religious-based medical neglect.  And CHILD has been remarkably effective in reaching policymakers and achieving change.  In 2010 alone, CHILD representatives testified before the Wisconsin legislature, lobbied the United States Congress, and urged prosecutors in New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Oregon, and Washington to prosecute fully parents who permitted their children to die of treatable illnesses.  This past spring, CHILD focused its efforts on achieving legislative change in Oregon, and it succeeded:  on June 9 Oregon Governor John Kitzhaber signed into law an emergency bill removing Oregons religious exemptions pertaining to medical care of sick and injured children.  CHILD is the model of a small nonprofit achieving real change.
Childrens Healthcare Is A Legal Duty Inc	92852		/users/profile/105692	Nancy_H	General Member of the Public	5	06/29/2011	Childrens Healthcare Is a Legal Duty, Inc. is an excellent organization that makes a difference by advocating for a class of children who are at risk (children whose parents hold strict religious beliefs that prevent them from seeking medical care for their sons and daughters).  I have experienced firsthand the seriousness of a scenario when medical care is withheld from a child because of religious beliefs--36 years ago when I was a 10-year-old child I saw the suffering of an older sibling who received no traditional medical treatment for a painful and ultimately disabling condition. I appreciate the work of CHILD Inc. to provide information about the dangers of child abuse or neglect related to religion. I greatly value CHILD Inc.s targeted lobbying efforts to reverse laws that currently offer religious exemptions from child health and safety laws.  I urge others who care about the well-being of children in the United States to make a donation to CHILD, Inc. and support the work of an extremely efficient organization that makes the most of its resources.
Childrens Healthcare Is A Legal Duty Inc	92686		/users/profile/106357	Beth12345	Donor	5	06/28/2011	CHILD is an advocacy organization that works to eliminate religious exemptions to child protections.  Most of us would never dream of denying our children all medical treatment, everything from noninvasive hearing/vision tests, to pain relief (even aspirin), to lifesaving insulin for type I diabetes.  But some churches have successfully lobbied to exempt religious parents from providing such common-sense care. CHILD documents how such exemptions have led to children being permanently harmed or killed for lack of treatment.  These cases are tragedies for parents as well as for children.  Most parents are not scofflaws and wish to do what the law requires.  Also, these exemptions falsely give the impression that our government believes faith healing to be just as good as standard care.  Children of all religions deserve to survive their childhoods so that they can make decisions for themselves. CHILD has made a positive difference for many children through education, legal action, lobbying, and research.  As far as I'm aware, CHILD is the only organization dedicated to this issue.   
Childrens Healthcare Is A Legal Duty Inc	92631		/users/profile/105553	xcschild	General Member of the Public	5	06/28/2011	CHILD does wonderful work in the legislative field which has been discussed in other reviews. And that is absolutely vital. The legal issues MUST be brought to the publics attention. But religious abuse also causes emotional trauma. The unseen psychological damage that can be caused by faith-healing religions can literally destroy peoples lives.  Even if you are not subjected to VISIBLE horrible deaths and illnesses, being exposed to this type of irrational thinking can cause deep INVISIBLE lifelong damage. Having been denied medical care as a child, I had many difficulties which had a negative impact on my adult life. For example, I suffered from untreated asthma and allergies. Granted, these are not life-threatening, but can make life extremely difficult and cause significant emotional fallout. I consider CHILD as Adult Children of Christian Scientists. (You can insert the name of any other damaging religion.) We suffered many abuses similar to those that children of alcoholics and other addicts are subjected to. CHILD educates the public. Bringing the abuse to the publics attention through the legal channels will help all affected children.
Childrens Healthcare Is A Legal Duty Inc	92615	3	/users/profile/106275	billcool	Board Member	4	06/28/2011	I have been the Board Chairman of Children's healthcare Is a Legal Duty, Inc., for twelve years, and I was a Board member for some time before that. I consider it a privilege to have worked with the tremendously talented and dedicated founders of the organization, Rita and Doug Swan. They reacted to a tragic loss of their son because of religiously motivated refusal of medical help for the son, who died as a result. Instead of retreating into a life of solitude they renounced their previous religious affiliation and founded CHILD, Inc. They have worked tirelessly to influence state and federal legislators to eliminate exemptions to child-guarding laws that mandate medical treatment for children regardless of the religious or personal beliefs of the parents that would prevent such treatment. In my work as Chairman I have striven to promote the objectives of the organization and to bring principles of good organizational practice to the administration of the group. Though clear legislative victories have been few for CHILD, Inc., those that have been achieved have been decisive and life-saving for children whose fates would have been tragic indeed without the work of this organization. It is a pleasure as I retire from the  Chairmanship to endorse fully the continuing work and to applaud all who support it, especially the Swans.  
Childrens Healthcare Is A Legal Duty Inc	92596	1	/users/profile/106259	jiml	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/28/2011	this organization does amazing work with a limited budget.  Rita and her husband helped change the statutes in oregon that allowed parents to avoid their legal duty to provide medical care to their children.  these parents were using spiritual treatment as their only method of providing medical care to their children.  many of these children died because of this neglect.  we started to eliminate these statutes in 1999 and finished with the last 4 statutes this session.  the governor has signed the bill into law.  without rita's dedication to this issue the statutes would never have been changed.  the children of oregon are eternally grateful to her hard work.

Childrens Healthcare Is A Legal Duty Inc	92127	1	/users/profile/105543	Matt	Donor	5	06/26/2011	Childrens Healthcare Is a Legal Duty (CHILD) protects children from abuse and neglect caused by religious and cultural practices.  Decades ago, Christian Scientists, who reject medical treatment, succeeded in getting almost all states to enact exemptions allowing parents to rely solely on prayer when their children are ill.  As a result, many children have needlessly suffered permanent health issues and many have died.  In most cases, the children suffered from illnesses that would have been easily and quickly resolved with medical intervention.   Thus, these state-approved exemptions have harmed children.  In addition, the exemptions give religious parents the impression that the government endorses their prayer-only practices. CHILD works to remove these harmful exemptions from state law.  CHILD believes that the right of vulnerable children to get appropriate healthcare far outweighs the right of parents to neglect those children.  CHILD has successfully reversed exemptions in several states.  Most recently (2011), the director of CHILD, Rita Swan, demonstrated her dedication by temporarily moving from Iowa to Oregon to get the Oregon legislature to end religious defenses for homicide. In addition, CHILD works to ensure that children are appropriately vaccinated, without exception for religious belief.  The group also lobbies for the licensing of all childcare facilities, including those run by churches.
Childrens Healthcare Is A Legal Duty Inc	92111		/users/profile/105556	Pankratz	General Member of the Public	5	06/26/2011	Several children have died needlessly in Oregon because their parents refused medical care while relying on prayer.  Our state laws were not sufficient to protect them.  That's where CHILD proved itself so valuable.  The executive director, Rita Swan, moved to our state capitol, helped write new legislation, and sold the bill so successfully that everyone was rushing to endorse it.  Such unanimous agreement in our state capitol has never been seen before, but maybe that's because God himself lobbied for its passage.  Protecting children is now the law.  And all this was accomplished on a shoestring budget.  
Childrens Healthcare Is A Legal Duty Inc	92070		/users/profile/105497	4148childpro	Volunteer	5	06/25/2011	CHILD, Inc. an organization founded to promote equal rights for children to have access to appropriate medical care, has been responsible for bringing to light hundreds of cases throughout the world where children have been physically and psychologically neglected/abused, or have died when their parents have chosen treatment through their religious beliefs or cultural practices and have denied medical evaluation and treatment. In addition, their founders have worked tirelessly with state legislatures in the United States to remove any exemption clause(s) in the statutes that prevent prosecution of parents when such situations occur. 
Childrens Healthcare Is A Legal Duty Inc	91669		/users/profile/104916	Ken Stringer	Board Member	5	06/22/2011	This membership organization (CHILD, Inc.) has been working for nearly 30 years to protect children from the harm, and often death, resulting from not receiving medical care due to the parents' religious beliefs.  I joined over 20 years ago, myself, because such a tragedy occured in my family.  My nine-year-old sister died of treatable pneumonia because my Christian Science parents refused to seek medical treatment for her.  Such parents are protected from prosecution from this kind of child neglect and abuse by various laws in most states, while parents who withhold medical care without the "religious exemption" umbrella are still held accountable under the law.  CHILD works to educate the public, the media, and lawmakers about this fundamentally unequal treatment of children who happen to be born into families with religious prohibitions against medical care.  CHLD also has had success (most recently in Oregon this year) in getting such religious exemptions removed from the law.  It has been shown that where the threat of prosecution exists, the death rates of children, even those children raised by still devout parents, goes down.  CHILD does a lot with a little: even small donations go a long way with this extremely efficient operation.  It's an honor to be a supporter of CHILD.

Children are silent and do not have a political voice and budget cuts take away many "fun things."  I have seen people in this agency work to create an income to replish some of these "fun things" to the children, through their hard work.  A smile and a gleeming eye from a child is a sign of hope and love.  May the smiles and love continue as you provide special moments for special children year after year.

Family & Children's Place	63463		/users/profile/69387	Rosalie G.	Board Member	5	02/04/2011	Family and Children's Place is a Louisville non-profit agency that serves families in Kentuckiana that experience abuse, particularly child sexual abuse.  This agency is raising the bar for first-response services for children who report sexual abuse in Kentucky! By establishing a world class co-located Child Advocacy Center in Louisville, Kentucky, the agency is putting Kentucky on the map as a leader in the fight against child abuse. There are several essential services under one roof:  Family and Children's Place offers forensic interviewing (held to the highest standard and best practice models), medical examinations to treat for injury or infection, and offices for local law enforcement and the Crimes Against Children unit. Having all these offices in one location minimizes the risks that children face when they report abuse.  A victim's story can be told once and an immediate response can be made to protect the child and stop the abuse.  They also provide ongoing services to families that seek the assistance of Family and Children's Place such as counseling and other services designed to help families heal, stabilize and recover.  This organization has a heart for the future of our children and our community!  Keep up the good work!

I have had NKCAC come to staff meetings to talk to staff about the programs they provide to the public.  I always tell new staff if they are looking for a resource for a family to contact NKCAC.  I add that if they do not have the resource needed they will know who does or help the family locate it.  I am very impressed with the services provided as well as communtiy outreach for its programs. 
Northern Kentucky Community Action Commission	184560		/users/profile/241473	ardnas	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/29/2013	The NKCAC provides a host of appropriate and targeted programs in response to the diverse needs of the Northern Ky community.  They have been instrumental in forming  cooperative relationships among both private and religious organizations who are providing services in order to reduce duplication and  increase the range of services available to recipients--and to minimize misuse of services.  The feedback I have heard from recipients is that they are treated with respect and that the service providers are responsive.

They want to do the right thing and look to us for ideas.  Through the Greater Cincinnati World Affairs Council, we here in Cincinnati perform a valuable function by showing visiting thought leaders how social systems work in a democracy.  They take home their observations and use them to improve life in their countries.  This is far cheaper and safer - and I wouldn't doubt more effective - than army boots on the ground. The Greater Cincinnati World Affairs Council offers many ways to serve as citizen diplomats.  Believe it or not, when Cincinnatians smile at and help strangers, this in itself is a "big idea" for many visitors.

Thanks to highly motivated volunteers, members and staff  the organization is on a strong growth trajectory--working with more schools and students on global issues and dramatically increasing the number of international visitors coming to Cincinnati as part of a critical State Department program.  I joined the board after my family hosted two Japanese visitors for three days. Over the course of a weekend, my three young children were exposed to an entirely different culture in a way no textbook, film or website could ever duplicate. I decided then and there to get more involved by donating to the group, serving on the board, and working with the staff to help the organization thrive.

I was introduced to the organization through a fellow supporter of conservation easement, and have encouraged others to support the ELCR.  As a horse person and realtor who specializes in equine properties, I have great concerns in regards to the loss of land to development.  The ELCR focuses on these issues, and has made great inroads in awareness throughout the equestrian population.

When I needed help, I just called Deb and she was right there.  Since my times volunteering, I was able to connect Deb with Florida, California, NewYork and Pennsylvania, just to name a few, so they now can start an ELCR in their area.

Edge Outreach Inc	90453	1	/users/profile/103166	jolleym	Volunteer	5	06/11/2011	Edge is an absolutely amazing organization. I personally when with a group to Costa Rica, before the trip we had a day of water, health and culture training to go through as well as discussing what to pack. THey were extremely helpful and just about everything we learned that day came in handy. The schedule of the trip in Costa Rica ran extremely smoothly, we got a lot done, connected with the communities and we were safe at all times. Edge is a remarkable nonprofit.
Edge Outreach Inc	90418		/users/profile/103121	cargojack	Volunteer	5	06/10/2011	I was first touched by Edge Outreach in 2007 when I attended a water training session.  I immediatly saw the possibilities to help those in the world who did not have access to clean water and were suffering from water borne diseases.  Our church planned and trained a group of (50) prople in Southern California and equipped them for (2) Water Outreach trips to Costa Rica led by Edge and another to Nicaragua where we installed a water purification system for approximately 2500-3000 people. Edge is a wonderful organization that is very helpful with many experts from pump repair to community assessment, to hygiene, or any aspect of water purification and treatment.  Their ministry is to make this a better world through the gift of clean water.

It was such a fun, positive expirience and a great way to help others. After my first mission trip with EDGE i did another and had a great time again! I havnt been able to volunteer for edge in two years, but ill do other missions until i can work with EDGE again.
Edge Outreach Inc	90168		/users/profile/102765	IFly767	Donor	5	06/09/2011	I have found these folks to be the most singularly focused, most genuine group of people I have run into in my lifetime. The passion with which they embrace bringing clean water to all parts of the world (Haiti, Costa Rica, India, many Arab countries, Africa, and South America via the USS Comfort navy ship) is unsurpassed. While they desire to show God's love as a Christan group, they are in no way "stingy" with their resources and restrict their activities only to Christian groups.  On the contrary, they are eager to show Christian love to groups of other faith backgrounds and have worked hand in hand with Muslim groups in Pakistan and elsewhere to meet the needs of all peoples, without respect to their faith traditions.  To paraphrase thier mission ... "It is hard to evangelize to people's soul when they are dying daily due to the diseases carried in dirty water"
Edge Outreach Inc	90165		/users/profile/102751	Jeffrey M.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/09/2011	For me the work should be judged by the passion of its people! We've had the honor to work along side EDGE over the past few month's and I have yet to find any group as excited and driven as the EDGE team members! Each person their desire and hope for helping others is incredible! From shoe drives to water purification it is unbelievable! You want candid? I believe that this organization will in its lifetime eradicate water issues globally. Drive by their warehouse and ask for a tour, it'll change your life!

I only wish I had the chance to still know him! If you ever have the chance to be a part of this very cool organization, consider yourself blessed and forever changed! Five hundred stars!
Edge Outreach Inc	90032		/users/profile/102594	John M.	Volunteer	5	06/08/2011	As a UofL MBA student I had the chance go work with Mark, Dee Dee, and George too help look for ways to improve the Shoeman Water Project and Edge efforts.  It was a truly amazing experience to get to see all of the ways that this truly inspiring group can take something as simple as our used shoes and turn it into something as important as clean water and health training.  As a Certified Fraud Examiner one the concerns I always have with non-profits is the risk of extremely poor money management. However, what I saw with Edge is what they went every step of the way to make every cent count for the mission they have laid before themselves.  The leadership in this group has a way of inspiring any and everyone they come into contact with, and it's for good reason.  As I saw the innovative and new ways they were creating to clean up such a fundamental life need it convinced me that this was an organization that would truly be able to transition into a staple of service within not only Louisville, but every area of the world they get a chance to come into contact with.  I saw them not only develop ways to clean the water, but ways to improve getting it out of the ground, storing it locally, transporting it long distances, and keeping it clean until use.  They have created methods that in themselves would have a great small business opportunity for aspiring members of developing countries.  The shaman water project. Is one way that this group is working to stabilize it,s funding throughout the year, and the ability to recognize this need is yet another reason this group is insuring their long term existence.  Edge has such a great outpouring of support in times of crisis, that it could cause them to falter on this large undertaking they have choose, but The Shoe,an gives them an opportunity to not only generate a regular funding source, but also to allow all of us here without the ability to take a week away from work or make a large donation to find our own little way to help!

Bianca gets to eat a hot sausage biscuit every Friday morning because of FP- its the only time she gets to eat McDonalds, she said. Kelsie was devastated after her family suffered from a break-in- she had someone to comfort her and listen because of FP. Allyson had been the popular kid, attending all the high-school parties- now she leads the school in a positive way because of a speaker at FP. Jacob was lost but now he has found the One, True Savior because of an invitation given at FP. Huge impacts from individuals in FP who have a heart for the lost.

This non-profit works tirelessly to provide immediate help to women stay current with their bills. The organization considers everyone who works for it, volunteers for its events, or benefits from its financial grants like family. It is truly a home-grown, grassroots organization that has made such a difference in the lives of the women it serves. 
Jill's Wish Foundation	263585		/users/profile/352286	Writer	Board Member	5	10/13/2015	Jill's Wish Foundation was built upon the wish of breast cancer champion fighter Jill Conley. After Jill's was diagnosed with breast cancer in her early 30's, she witnessed first hand the financial struggles brought on by fighting her battle.  Her wish was to help others and she formed Jill's Wish.  Although still fighting her own battle, Jill continues to inspire others to live, and give, for the moment.

This is not another breast cancer awareness non-profit, Jill Brzezinski-Conley and her husband, Bart, know first-hand what it's like to struggle to pay bills while surviving cancer, they want to pay it forward, and once you meet either one of them, you are family forever. They bring innate warmth, energy and hope to Jill's Wish, its fundraising efforts and all of its grantees. If you are looking for a non-profit that thinks globally, but acts locally and makes a vital and marked difference in the lives of the women it helps, look no further than Jill's Wish.

We had a party at the airport - all catered to the kids favorite things, we stayed at the most magical place in Disney, received special ride passes, and were really able to enjoy some fun, normal time together as a family.

Nate loved to play and have fun with his friends, and facing his cancer and being around other children who were sick, made him realize that he wanted to help others.  Nate's parents,  Jeff and Stacie want to honor their son's wish and help other children.  The Richard's are an amazing family and so many children are being blessed by them. There is nothing more precious than a smile on a childs face.
Nates Wish	229537		/users/profile/293187	BeckyandBilly	Volunteer	5	10/29/2014	My husband and I have been blessed to help serve in various ways  in helping Nates Wish.  This wonderful charity gives hope, love and support to families whose child has received a cancer diagnosis.  Nate loved basketball, and this organization hosts an annual basketball tournament to help raise funds to fill backpacks with items to help each child as they go through their treatments to overcome their illness.  Nates parents and sisters are truly amazing as they serve tirelessly and share the love of Jesus Christ through this important charity.   Becky & Billy Albritton 
Nates Wish	229365		/users/profile/293015	Dneanea	Donor	5	10/29/2014	I can not express enough of Jeff and Stacie, and the love that they have for the childeren. Nates Wish brings joy and love to all the childeren who have cancer. They go way beyond anything thing I have ever seen to show those kids that they are loved and they are praying for each child. God Bless you both for what you are doing for these kids
Nates Wish	225882		/users/profile/289634	drbuehrer	General Member of the Public	5	10/23/2014	Jeff and Stacie are amazing.  They have kept Nate's wish alive by helping kids going through cancer.  They are able to bring smiles and joy to other families battling this disease.  They are truly a Godsend.
Nates Wish	225806		/users/profile/289559	TDubyah	Volunteer	5	10/23/2014	The heart of Jeff and Stacie to love on kids going through cancer and help comfort their parents shows in everything they do.  I've been blessed to volunteer in some small way with each of the annual basketball tournaments (the primary fund raiser) and simply love that experience each year - to see how fun had by kids/teens translates into help and compassion for kids miles away going through a very scary experience.   At the root of the backpacks is simply a collection of items to help distract and inform - both important pieces during those first few weeks after a new diagnosis and treatments have begun.  I love that this family uses the pain they have been through to reach and help comfort the pain many other families are going through.  That to me is key - simply reaching and sharing where one has been in the desire to help others now walking a similar path.
Nates Wish	225666		/users/profile/289426	kentuckygurl	Volunteer	5	10/23/2014	This charity organization helps bring joy to children. Nate's wish allows these children to know that they are thought of and loved. 
Nates Wish	224650	2	/users/profile/288407	terrihouser	Volunteer	5	10/20/2014	The desire to reach out to a friend with cancer is sometimes met with uncertainty of "what to do?".  And  Nate answered that question.  He knew the need through his personal battle with leukemia and in his God-given wisdom and spirit of giving, he created a way to help other children.  Nate's parents founded Nate's Wish to provide some comfort and distraction for children struggling with cancer treatment.  What a blessing to be a part of helping with that need.  Nate knew what the need was.  
Nates Wish	224027		/users/profile/287779	shelbycody	Volunteer	5	10/18/2014	The Nate's Wish organization has brought much needed smiles to hundreds of children with cancer.  The many hours that a child spends in the hospital during the months and years of cancer treatment can be filled with a little joy because of the wonderful items provided in a Nate's Wish backpack!  
Nates Wish	223171	1	/users/profile/286914	Suzann_Lovelace	Volunteer	5	10/15/2014	Nate's Wish is an organization that brings joy to children who are struggling with cancer and undergoing the difficult treatments to overcome this dreaded disease.  The organization was established by parents who have gone through this with their son, Nate.  Nate's desire was to help other children and his parents are fulfilling Nate's wish.  Having gone through the loss of a nephew in his teens to cancer, I know this is a worthy and needed organization.

Star Saving The Animals Of Rowan Inc	127484		/users/profile/172544	Karen103	Client Served	5	10/20/2012	 The  most amazing people and rescuers. They put the animals first and themselves last. They will do anything to help. We have adopted 2 dogs from them. Just look at the pictures they have on their sight and facebook. I have printed a few of these pictures because they are inspirational.One picture in particular stands out and that is of FIDDLESTICKS. The picture tells it all.  I show them to people hoping they will help a rescue. Will I adopt from them again in the future...definitely yes. 
Star Saving The Animals Of Rowan Inc	123988		/users/profile/168779	Cathy30	Client Served	5	10/01/2012	We have been rescuing dogs from STAR since they began helping saving the animals of Rowan County. I have had the pleasure of driving down from Buffalo, NY 4 times and met these dedicated volunteers.  The other dogs have been transported here. An estimated 50 dogs have come from STAR and unlike other shelters we have rescued from, every dog we get from STAR is exactly as described with no surprises regarding their health,  age, or temperament.  I cannot think of any group of animal volunteers I would rather work with!
Star Saving The Animals Of Rowan Inc	123165	2	/users/profile/167762	Kelli H.	Volunteer	5	09/25/2012	Before joining STAR, my husband I had been rescuing and adopting out animals for nearly nine years.  It is sometimes a heartbreaking job, and a mental and financial drain, especially without the support of an organization.  In March, I became a proud, proud member of STAR, and I have been able to rescue and foster more than ever.  It is a wonderful organization with a reputation for extraordinary kindness.  The women and men I have had the honor to meet have become family.  They work tirelessly and often without gratitude to save precious lives.  They give generously of their own time, money, blood, sweat, and tears, and are often a great encouragement to those they encounter to do the right thing, always.  I have great love and respect for STAR, and only wish I had more to give.
Star Saving The Animals Of Rowan Inc	119814	1	/users/profile/162871	Deb_10	Volunteer	5	08/01/2012	STAR is the most respected rescue group I know! I first met Julia about 6 yrs ago when I came across 2 dogs she needed help with and I eneded up sending her toys and treats for them since that was all I could do from Illinois at the moment. We became good friends ever since and I have been having several fundraisers , asking for donations at my garage sales using poster boards full of the Rowan County dog pound dogs pictures and selling dog treat bags at my aunts store to raise some money for STAR! I send care packages from my organization called Baileys love to STAR full of goodies for the pound dogs, dogs on transports and foster dogs! I even sponsor dogs and ask for donations from family and friends. STAR is an outstanding rescue group and rise above everyone else and what they do for the hundreds of dogs not only in rowan, but other counties when dire help is needed weather it be 6am or 10pm, usually someone is there for a call, a pick up, or any other emergency!  I have so much love and respect for the people with STAR and support their progress!  There are a few ladies with STAR who are my role models, and are certainly hero's and angels! They do what is right and I wish I could take away some of their heart ache with all of the problems that occur with the homeless, dumped, abused animals in Rowan. They fight until the last minute to find a safe and loving place for every dog they can They show the world what it takes to be kind, loving and compassionate and the constant struggle it is to help animals. I love them very much and want only the very best for them and their families and the animals of Rowan County! STAR rates 5 stars from me!! 
Star Saving The Animals Of Rowan Inc	119738	1	/users/profile/162771	Judy39	Volunteer	5	07/31/2012	I first became associated with STAR (Saving The Animals of Rowan) when someone near my home moved and left their dog. I would stop and leave food and water, however the dog was to frightened to come to me.  Star had things well in hand and were able to rescue the dog.  Later that year another case of a family moving and leaving a very pregnant dog made me think of STAR.  I became a foster for STAR with the litter of 9 puppies, and their mother.  Since then, I have had the honor of fostering hundreds of puppies and dogs for STAR.  I am continually amazed at the dedication and hard work members are involved in in order to find rescues, transports, veterinary care, and adoptions in our small community.  We have some of the hardest working volunteers I have ever know. I have now been associated with STAR for nearly four years now, and foster on a regular basis as well as participating in fundraising when ever possible.  It is truly amazing the transformation you will see in dog that has been abandoned, or abused when they are given the opportunity of a loving family environment.  I am very proud to be associated with STAR.  
Star Saving The Animals Of Rowan Inc	119705		/users/profile/162734	Pat Needham	Volunteer	5	07/31/2012	 STAR (Saving the Animals of Rowan) has some of the most dedicated volunteers and it is ALL about the dogs. It is an all volunteer group, there are no paid positions, every penny goes to the care of the animals. STAR has been able to make the county pound go from a 95% kill rate to a 95% save rate.  I only wish every county could have such a group working for and helping the dogs.  I have adopted a STAR dog and he is the most loving dog and has brought me much laughter. When there is an injured, neglected or abused animal STAR is called and steps forward. A puppy mill was raided and STAR is the group that stepped forward and assisted the ASPCA from Oct. until March to care for the dogs. This is amost worthy and deserving organization. I am proud to be associated with this group.

Star Saving The Animals Of Rowan Inc	119625		/users/profile/162633	Lynn28	Volunteer	5	07/31/2012	Prior to becoming a STAR volunteer, I read about their fundraisers in the local paper.   I have been a volunteer now for about a year and a half.  I had no idea how much work they do, or how many dogs they save prior to becoming directly involved in STAR.  As a volunteer, I go to the local Canine Shelter almost daily to take photos of new dogs, evaluate them, and observe any physical problems that might need attention.  Photos are put on Petfinder as part of the effort to find homes and rescues.  STAR takes on the expenses of veterinary care of dogs in need.  Members immediately step up to foster dogs and puppies that would not do well in the Pound environment.  There is not a day that goes by without STAR helping animals in Rowan County in one way or another.  STAR works diligently with the County to keep the shelter low kill, and assists the County in providing for the care and rehoming of homeless dogs.  In addition to directly helping the dogs, STAR members are constantly planning and conducting fundraisers to raise the money needed to cover veterinary, transport, and other expenses.  STAR is dedicated to helping homeless dogs of Rowan County!
Star Saving The Animals Of Rowan Inc	119574		/users/profile/162578	Lori31	Volunteer	5	07/30/2012	I learned of STAR from another organization who was requesting help with transporting a dog from STAR to them in Cincinnati, OH. From that point on I began following STAR through the United Rescues of Kentucky listserve, and eventually their Facebook page. I began fostering for STAR, and have been very impressed with their commitment to an awesome foster experience, as well as their dedication to seeing that all animals find a loving home. I cannot help but be impressed with their ability to get shelter animals out and into rescues or foster homes, keeping the kill rate at the pound extremely low. Their hard work and dedication certainly are obvious. The saying "When the going gets tough, the tough get going" certainly applies in the case of STAR!
Wilderness Trace Family Ymca Inc	114927		/users/profile/156588	melwof	General Member of the Public	4	06/13/2012	The "Y" is a great place to go for around family fun and physical activity.  Recent renovations to my local "Y" in Mercer County have been awesome and the anticipated projects are much needed.  Over the years I've watched the "Y" continue to grow in programs, people and performance.  My local "Y" is a great community partner and always willing to work to increase awareness around projects or programs that will have a positive impact on the community.  My favorite "Y" program is the Afterschool initiative.    
Wilderness Trace Family Ymca Inc	110674		/users/profile/150647	ballmom	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/24/2012	Wilderness Trace has helped fund Substance Abuse Prevention Counseling for the local school districts and this service has been invaluable!  Unfortunately, our children are faced with a variety of addictions and intervention and prevention counseling is one way to battle this tragedy.  The school systems are not equipped to handle such issues and that makes the vision of the Wilderness Trace Family YMCA that much more important.    They have seen the need for more help and have done their part in offering it.  I sincerely hope funds will continue to be available for substance abuse prevention counseling and activities in our communities. 
Wilderness Trace Family Ymca Inc	110156		/users/profile/150013	sjslone	General Member of the Public	5	04/18/2012	If you ever felt the need to somehow give in our community and help children of all ages, this is the time & way.These children, with our help and support, will have posistive Christian mentors in their lives that they may not have at home. They will have healthy meals and a chance to experience real friendships with others their age and older/younger. They will maybe even have a place to stay, not just be locked up at home by themselves, because the mother, father, or grandparent can not afford to pay for childcare while they go to work to try to pay the bills. You dont have to travel accross the world, we have children waiting for us to make a difference for them here in Mercer County & those counties surrounding us that also share our YMCA facility.                 If money is not an option at this time and you would like to volunteer to help at the YMCA that would also be a blessing for you and the children that attend. You can contact Mark or Jacquie at the YMCA anytime at 859-734-9622 if you may have any other questions or concerns. Please pray on this awesome oppertunity to be a blessing in so many little hearts today & help in any way you can!

This is just one example of the many things our Y does to help make our community healthier.  The Y offers numerous programs that serve every population in Mercer County.  Thank you, Wilderness Trace YMCA, you are great!

Mark Fryer has worked tirelessly to improve on the facilities and increase the amount of services offered.  The void that is being filled is incredible making our community's future look increasingly brighter.  The future plans for this facility and grounds presented at many gatherings locally, which are dependent upon donated or granted funds are forward thinking and will improve upon the entire community. Great programs, great mentors and great leaders all in one thanks to Mark Fryer, YMCA staff, volunteers and Mark's lovely family.

Wilderness Trace Family Ymca Inc	109705		/users/profile/149458	Pat_6	Board Member	5	04/11/2012	The Wilderness Trace YMCA plays a big roll in providing after school care for a very reasonable price in several counties to children who have working parents and are having trouble in these economical times.  Along with the after school program we also have other sports programs going on throughout the whole year  and a summer day camp for kids to attend. The Y helps scholarship  kids that need it for these programs and no child is turned away.     The Wilderness Trace Y is known in Kentucky for having more running programs with a very small facility then any other Y in Kentucky.                                                                                                                      
Wilderness Trace Family Ymca Inc	109538		/users/profile/149249	jacquie woodward	Board Member	5	04/10/2012	This YMCA serves 4 fairly rural counties and provides programs and services not otherwise available to families and children.   There is little option for affordable child care in this area and working families are dealing with challenges to "make ends meet" by working multiple part time jobs, doing shift work, or traveling into more urban areas 30 to 60 miles away.   The Wilderness Trace YMCA operates child care and supervision programs after school, snow days, teacher "in-service" days and summers so that parents can stay in the work force without anxiety or poor attendance.      The cost per child is more than 25% below commercial child care and 30% of the children receive need based scholarship.  The WTFYMCA child care programs are certified, accredited, registered and receive no federal funds.   The venues are local schools so that the children are either bused to the program or remain in their own school.   There are 4 locations in 3 counties.   The "Y" provides its own trained and nurturing staff and all the materials.    The program provides a healthy snack, homework support, quiet reading, physical activity, arts/crafts and stresses caring, respect, honesty, responsibility.   Ages served are 5-12.   Older children are able to participate in the supervised  "open gym" activities at the "Y" building from school closing until 5:30 pm for a $20/year membership or $1/day.     This program protects more than 100 children who would otherwise be "latchkey kids" at risk for physical and psychological harm, poor school performance, bad social influences, and cultivation of bad eating and exercise habits.   This "Y" runs a lean budget with only 2 full time employees.    The United Way has cut financial support in recent years due to stress on its own fundraising in this area.   
Our Mims Retirement Haven, Inc.	225454		/users/profile/289230	Carol170	Donor	5	10/23/2014	I have been lucky enough to visit Our Mims several times.  The Ladies all look great and are healthy and happy.  Owning an aged mare myself, I know and understand the level of devotion and care it takes to care for them.   The Ladies are so lucky to have landed there and they know it.   The cemetery is such a special place too.  The Ladies there are so deserving of being remembered.  Thanks to Jeanne. Pete and the volunteers for making everything there so special.

The transperancy and frequent updates give a donor the instant gratification of making a difference.  These horses may be far away from me but they're always close to my heart.
Our Mims Retirement Haven, Inc.	205148	1	/users/profile/267251	asonoble	Volunteer	5	07/04/2014	The first time I drove down the driveway of Our Mims Retirement Haven I knew that I had found Heaven on Earth. Jeanne Mirabito has taken her farm and turned it into a true haven for a band of mares and a gelding who can live out their lives in comfort, and peace surrounded by love.  The care shown for the Ladies and Elmhurst (and her own horses) goes far beyond the regular horse farm. She makes each mares meal individually, to a special diet.  And all of the horses at Our Mims look far younger than their actual age. I started volunteering twice a year for a week and a half at a time after my first visit. This place just draws you in and the mares are magical. I once stood on the top of the big hill on 9/11/12. I was thinking about those who were lost. I felt a nuzzle on my  cheek and Lotka was there next to me and then all of the mares were in a circle around me. Elmhurst wanted in the circle and finally Lotka let him in. It was spiritual. I am not just a volunteer there but also a donor and drive from FL.
Our Mims Retirement Haven, Inc.	205019		/users/profile/267105	Zenyatta	General Member of the Public	5	07/02/2014	I came across OUR MIMS RETIREMNT HAVEN a few years ago and my life changed. It is a remarkable experience for anyone lucky enough to share some days with Jeanne and the Ladies, as they are called, the retired mares and also former racehorses, including Elmhurst, the 1997 Champion Sprinter and grandson of the great Our Mims. The Haven is a spiritual place of beauty and soul, like no other place I have experienced on earth....and I have been around the world, several times. The individual, brilliant care Jeanne administers to her charges, is inspiring and educational, for she brings a wealth of first hand knowledge, experience and innate sense to everything she does for the horses on the farm. Heaven is between you and the Haven, if you want it.

Our Mims Retirement Haven, Inc.	204051		/users/profile/266077	chazel	Donor	5	06/26/2014	When my mother could no longer care for my late father's horse, Exciting Bucket, she was accepted to live out her retirement years at Our Mims Retirement Haven.  What a blessing Jeanne has been to our family.  By accepting "Buckets" she relieved a tremendous burden from our hearts.  We have had the pleasure of spending time at the Haven.  The love and care Jeanne gives the Ladies and Elmhurst is to be admired. The horses know they are loved, and they are happy.  We were surrounded by these amazing thoroughbreds, and all they wanted was love and lots of treats!  It was such a wonderful afternoon.  My father would be so proud! 
Our Mims Retirement Haven, Inc.	88560		/users/profile/99824	ladyadler	Volunteer	5	05/10/2011	Spent a wonderful day with the Ladies of Our Mims and their caretaker, Jeanne Mirabito.  What a wonderful, peaceful place to be!   Got to feed the ladies, groom them, and then do some artwork on the stall doors.  Jeanne was so knowledgeable about the previous lives of all of the Ladies.   If you want to feel like you have helped do something important.  Spend a day with these Regal Older Ladies.  
Our Mims Retirement Haven, Inc.	88532		/users/profile/99775	LindaVA	Volunteer	5	05/10/2011	Our Mims Retirement Haven is a home for retired broodmares from the horse racing insdutry, run by Jeanne Mirabito.  I had the pleasure of visiting OMRH on May 1, 2011 for a volunteer working lunch.  It was without a doubt the best afternoon I've ever spent working!  The ladies (as we call the mares) are all "seniors" but you would never know it by looking at them!  Eyes are bright, coats are shiny and they are all sweethearts to be around.  It was wonderful to have a "hands on" experience with the ladies grooming them and feeding them treats.  Jeanne takes excellent care of them on a daily basis.  I urge everyone who loves horses and especially thoroughbred racehorses, to consider donating to Our Mims!  
Isaiah Alonso Foundation	126702	1	/users/profile/171705	Mindy72	Volunteer	5	10/17/2012	I have been impressed by the Isaiah Alonso Foundation.  Although I have not been personally impacted by childhood cancer, I followed the wonderful work this group was doing for several months before becoming involved with their work.  Childhood Cancer impacts families, parents, brothers, sisters and the children themselves.  The Isaiah Alonso Foundation is there helping.  They help raise awareness of childhood cancer, they help provide for the day to day essentials and provide a bit of comfort whenever possible.  Many of the volunteers in this group have fought the childhood cancer battle and are turning their experiences into positive action for others.  
Isaiah Alonso Foundation	126513	1	/users/profile/171532	CeeJay W.	Volunteer	5	10/17/2012	As the mother of a pediatric cancer patient I know how stressful and expensive it can be to take care of a sick child. Following my daughter's death, I wanted to do something to help other families in the same position I had been in. The Isaiah Alonso Foundation provided me with both a way to help other patients and to raise awareness of the lack of funding for Childhood Cancers. Working for the foundation has been a fun and rewarding experience for me and the foundation board members have made me feel welcome and needed. 
Isaiah Alonso Foundation	126419	1	/users/profile/100854	crushcancer	Board Member	5	10/17/2012	As a volunteer and board member, I see the difference we make for families fighting childhood cancer daily.  We provide financial support to families and it makes a huge impact on those families struggling to pay their bills while doing all they can to help their sick children.  In addition, the family gift bag program is wonderful and a big help to especially those who are in the hospital and weren't expecting to be inpatient.  I also love the fact that it is an all volunteer charity and no one involved takes any salary.  
Isaiah Alonso Foundation	89048		/users/profile/100854	crushcancer	Volunteer	5	05/23/2011	I volunteered for the ARMHC gift bag drive in Georgia.  Those bags were amazing and included gift cards, snacks, toiletries, toys, books, games, blankets, etc.  We ended up with enough bags so each family staying at both houses got a nice gift bag.  I was so happy to play a small part in making a difference for those dealing with serious childhood illnesses.   I hope they do it again next year because I will be first in line to sign up and volunteer!  Keep up the great work, IAF!
Isaiah Alonso Foundation	100640		/users/profile/123712	Susan23456789101112131415	Volunteer	5	11/14/2011	I became involved in Isaiah's foundation the night I took a walk with his Mom, Cheryl. Isaiah was a student in my school, a regular little boy with a great personality. Although he wasn't one of my students, I often visited his classroom and grew to know him in that setting. Great student, real personable, very popular with his teacher and his classmates. His passing was a tremendous shock to all of us, his former teacher left the building immediately, in tears. Talking with his Mom months later made me aware of the immense toll that childhood cancer has taken on our children. The foundation not only educates and raises awareness, it helps families who are dealing with this devastating diagnosis, both emotionally and financially. The Isaiah Alonso Foundation touches so many lives. It has cemented our military community, and made me a more compassionate educator. It is a priviledge to be associated with the Isaiah Alonso Foundation!
Isaiah Alonso Foundation	93471	1	/users/profile/107561	Stephanie R.	Volunteer	5	07/06/2011	I am blessed with having known Isaiah, as the family lives across the street from me. When this tragic event took hold over the family and community the family rose above through the birth of the Isaish Alonso Foundation.  Like a Pheonix, through fire there is rebirth, however painful, the foundation has found ways to help ease the pain of other family's that suffer in the same manner they did.  A few times a year we come together in Isaiah's honor to return to the hospital and bring a moments joy to it's "temporary" residents through toy drives. Throughout the year a booth can be found at nearly ever local community event to help bring awareness, chapters have been set up in other states, the foundation is growing!  The organizations ultimate purpose to is stop cancer, until then we will be there to help families that are walking through fire.  I support the Isaiah Alonso foundation. 
Isaiah Alonso Foundation	93469	1	/users/profile/107557	moon smith	Donor	5	07/06/2011	As a personal friend to Isaiah's mother, I think it is a beautiful thing that the foundation is doing. They help other parens with children fighting cancer. They chose not to close themselves off from the world after Isaiah's death, but rather to open themselves up and say "We know your pain and we are here to help...even if its just a little". The foudation is such a wonderful, selfless charity.
Isaiah Alonso Foundation	89049	1	/users/profile/100857	Proud Fight	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/23/2011	They are awesome! Isaiah would be proud of his parents and all who are supporting this organization!
Isaiah Alonso Foundation	89047		/users/profile/100856	Mike E.	Donor	5	05/23/2011	 I have donated and volunteered for this non  profit. I am so inspired by not only the story that started this, but the heartfelt caring that goes into everything they do. These are people who could not be more motivated to not only help on a local level in direct donations to families in need, but also in the bigger picture, that is spreading awareness about childhood cancer.Every day there are posts to help at all levels and messages that inspire, and help raise awareness.I myself had no idea how bad and how many people were touched by this terrible disease. With the foundation's help, I am made aware every day of the need for help, where to help, and how to best utilize my personal ability to help. 
Wendell Fosters Campus for Developmental Disabilities Inc	72220	1	/users/profile/78965	reneeking64	General Member of the Public	5	02/21/2011	I am not directly involved with WFC but I have had the wonderful experience of attending fund raisers and other special events, and have met many of the staff and therapists there. The thing that stands out most in my mind about my experiences with WFC is the way they celebrate the lives of the people they serve and the passion that drives them. An example of that passion is the creation of the sensory park. I learned from the staff how the park started with a small, "I wonder if we could...", that turned into a unified brainstorm among them with no limitations! The result was a huge plan to make a park that enhances the lives of the resedents and individuals served by WFC, and then to have a big celebration and dedication of the park. My family and I attended the dedication and we were all touched by the love, the unity, and the passion of everyone involved. The spirit of the people, staff and clients is definately contagious. As I said before, I am not directly involved with WFC but I hope to be in the near future. I would truely be blessed to be a part of their mission.
Wendell Fosters Campus for Developmental Disabilities Inc	69924	1	/users/profile/76427	DonnaBrown	General Member of the Public	5	02/17/2011	I have had the chance to participate in training at Wendell Fosters campus.  I have always enjoyed the training and found it benefits my job.  They are close by, cost effective and always very sincere in the work they do.  I have recommended several community individuals to turn to Wendell Foster for services in assisting with Austim Spectrum Disorders.  
Wendell Fosters Campus for Developmental Disabilities Inc	68668	1	/users/profile/75032	Kristy Keith	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/15/2011	I have had the wonderful opportunity to work at Wendell Fosters Campus for Developmental Disabilities for 15 years in the Outpatient Therapy Department.   I have also had the pleasure of bringing my son when he was a young child to the campus to receive outpatient Speech Therapy and Occupational Therapy services.  The Campus strives to ensure that their professional staff are adequately trained to meet the needs of a variety of individuals with a multitude of abilities.  They put the individuals they serve first and ensure they receive high quality services.    The campus has a wide variety of Assistive Technology equipment available to them to better serve the needs of individuals with multiple disabilities.  The campus also provides trained Assistive Technology Professionals in Speech Therapy, Occupational Therapy, and Physical Therapy to facilitate the use of this cutting edge technology.  
Wendell Fosters Campus for Developmental Disabilities Inc	68611	1	/users/profile/74962	Keith	General Member of the Public	5	02/15/2011	As a former employee of WFC for eight years I believe no other facility has such a profound impact on the lives of multi-handicapped indivduals as the WFC. The employees are dedicated to the well-being of the individuals served and through therapies and active daily living skills, many clients have gone on to more independent living that was never dreamed of years ago. There is a commerical that runs on CBS every spring about the Masters Golf Tournament stating, "A tradition unlike any other.." Well, you can say that about WFC, "A tradition unlike any other..."
Wendell Fosters Campus for Developmental Disabilities Inc	68556	1	/users/profile/74899	Linda House	Client Served	5	02/15/2011	My brother was a resident of the WFC for 49 years.  He came to the Fosters as a baby, very early in the development of this fine place.  My Mother was on the Board for most of her adult years, all our family volunteered in preparing food, painting walls, cleaning floors, helping procure and donate funds, thru my entire life.  We are very proud to have been a small part of the growth.  The facility has many facets and we have not found one that hasn't excelled!  All the therapies are state-of-the-art, the care is top notch, cleanliness is outstanding and the staff is so loving and gentle with this group of special people.  It is a very respected home for many special needs folks and a great service to the community for others who use it.
Wendell Fosters Campus for Developmental Disabilities Inc	68250	1	/users/profile/74573	Sharon Secrest	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/14/2011	2 1/2 years ago I moved from Kentucky to Nashville, Tennessee.  I left behind the most fulfilling experience of my life outside of my salvation through Jesus Christ and the birth of my children.  I was the Director of Nursing at WFC for a very short four years.  I went there with several years experience as a nurse in long term care (nursing home), but I wanted to venture into a new horizon.  It took a very few short weeks for me to become acclamated to the absolutely beautiful, state of the art facility and the residents that live there.  I must admit, I was apprehensive in the beginning, but soon these guys stole my heart.  Even though I knew God wanted us to move to Tennessee it didn't make it any easier when I submitted my resignation.  I felt a part of my heart die that day...I cried for the next thirty days.  It's been 2 1/2 years since then and it still brings tears to my eyes to just think of how much everyone meant to me, but most of all I miss the unconditional love each resident bestowed on those of us that have and had the rare privilege and honor of being allowed to be a part of their lives.  In my new job I often have an opportunity to "advertise" Wendell Fosters Campus to folks seeking a more appropriate placement than a nursing home for their loved one's future residence.   When I was in the midst of one of these conversations with a co-worker I began to cry at the very mention of the name Josh, Andrew, John, Robbie, Megan Leigh, etc.  The co-worker stated, but Sharon, "you've just got to remember how much you helped change their lives."  It was at that moment God made it so very, very clear to me what had really happened and without missing a beat I had to say it, "No, don't you see, I didn't change them.......they...changed me....forever."  I could go on and on with this emotional outpouring, but suffice it to say I've never been associated with a more pure hearted, loving, caring and dedicated group of people than those that I knew at Wendell Fosters Campus...both residents and employees.  They will forever be in my heart and part of the fabric of my life.
Wendell Fosters Campus for Developmental Disabilities Inc	68220	1	/users/profile/74542	Susie Rideout	Donor	5	02/14/2011	 I have visited and served on committees at Wendell Foster since as far back as 35-40 years. I have an adult disabled daughter whom lives with me and has for 43 years. I have seen Wendell Foster change and grow over these years, and have seen the good that they do and the change in peoples lives that they have made. My own daughter is on the state SCL waiting list, and Wendell Foster is my placement of choice for her when I can no longer care for her. I am an artist, and this year have done art classes with the Hugh E. Sandefur Work Program at Wendell Foster. I work on a VSA grant through the state of KY and have done so in my hometown of Henderson, where Hugh E. Sandefur Training Center is located,  for several years. The staff and clients at Wendell Foster  Center program have made me feel welcome, been very helpful, and I have enjoyed getting to know them.  More importantly, the director of the work program, and the staff, are very respectful toward the clients, as well.  Wendell Foster does good work, and is deserving of the support of the citizens of Owensboro, as well as surrounding areas.  It is my opinion as a lifelong caregiver and mother of a disabled young woman that Wendell Foster is an  excellent facility providing a much needed service to the disabled folks in our midst. 
Wendell Fosters Campus for Developmental Disabilities Inc	68118	1	/users/profile/74433	Jen O.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/14/2011	Wendell Fosters Campus is an amazing place to be a part of.  The therapies that they offer with all the hands on that the residents or the clients get to have.  I don't know very much about the therapies due to the fact that I work in one of the cottages there at Wendell Foster.  So I do have a hands on experience all the time with the residents that live there.  From my understanding from my residents that I help assist, they enjoy their therapies and the other things that they do during the day.  The residents take pride in the new Sensory Park that was just built a little over a year ago.  It is an awesome feeling working in the cottages with the residents.  You assist them with daily tasks and hygiene.  Plus nothing beats the feeling you get when some one walks in and one of the residents' face just lights up.  They really enjoy going out into the community and doing normal everyday things that we do.  I love being able to say that I'm a part of the Wendell Foster Campus' Staff.  I take pride in my work to help some one work toward a goal that they have set.  Nothing beats that feeling when you leave to go home, knowing you have helped those residents work toward a potential goal or helped them set a goal to work toward.
Wendell Fosters Campus for Developmental Disabilities Inc	68033	1	/users/profile/74346	Uticabob	General Member of the Public	5	02/14/2011	While not having direct contact from the client standpoint I have had positive contact with the staff and administration. I have not met a more dedicated or professional group that deal with the special clientel that are served by Wendell Foster Center.  They keep themselves up to date and educated so as to provide the best service possible. They also see to it that the participants have input and a say in how things are done.  They take great pains to see that the residents are integrated into the Owensboro community. The center facilities are clean, modern and constructed for the needs of the people they serve.  They are constantly looking for ways to enhance the property and the area surrounding it.  A recent outdoor park attached to the main facilities allows for the interaction with the outdoors and the relaxation it provides.
GLSO Pride Center	5578	11	/users/profile/7316	Ginger Moore-Minder	Volunteer	5	06/25/2009	I came out at a ripe old age.  Scared to death, I circled the block of the Pride Center for a year before I got the nerve to go in the door.  When I got there, I found people laughing, happy and secure, all the things I was not.  I needed to know that I was OK and that there was a place where I could be me and not be afraid.  After coming back time after time, both in curiosity and a need to connect and learn about my new community, I found a peace that I had never had.  A sense of belonging.  The more I volunteered and went to various meetings and functions, the better I felt about myself.  I found a place I fit.  The pieces that were so shattered began to mend.  I also found the love of my life.  For that, I will be forever greatful to the GLSO and the Pride Center. I hope to work there until I cannot.  I hope that I can give back at least part of what was given to me.  Sincerely, Ginger
GLSO Pride Center	5480	1	/users/profile/7288	Beth H	General Member of the Public	4	06/23/2009	The Pride Center is an essential hub of the LGBT community in Lexington.  It is the primary source of info about organizations and events. It has and continues to provide resources for a wide range of people and groups including youth, transgender people, and others who may otherwise feel desperately isolated.  It provides a physical space for many groups to meet in safety and confidentiality.  Some of the folks who have sustained the center over many years are heroes in my mind.
GLSO Pride Center	5471	1	/users/profile/7279	kennyg	General Member of the Public	2	06/23/2009	While the GLSO does provide a few services, including a very nice book and video library, its main functions are not very prevalent in the community. As a matter of fact, the facility needs a complete overhaul of strategy and offerings for the gay community. While some have had very pleasant interaction with the facility, I fail to see how and where they got them unless they were part of the clique that makes up the so-called administration of the center. True, many of us need to volunteer or give more money, possibly, but there is enough revenue from a newsletter that is printed in color, but in a poor manner and on cheap paper. Not the quality newsletter a city like Lexington, Kentucky should be publishing. Furthermore, other than Insight and maybe another group there are very for activities for the community. Yes, theres going to be the 2nd Gay Pride Festival which sounds fantastic  but that alone does not make a GLSO center. And by the way  how was the money spent from last years festival and events? The center should also be located in a more central location so that all of the gay community could participate  young and old alike. Being closer downtown would probably draw a larger crowd of UK students and young people from the community. Older adults who frequent the bars and restaurants would also probably pay the center a visit. But to make it viable, it must have quality programs, a friendly staff, and some consistency. As far as I am concerned Insights is the only thing that has been positive for me.
GLSO Pride Center	5434	1	/users/profile/7235	Thomas Collins	Volunteer	5	06/22/2009	I started dating my first partner when I was 15. We were together for 10 years. Sadly, at the age of 25 I became a widower and a recluse. When my partner died I basically went into hiding for 9 years. I was done with the world until I found the GLSO Pride Center. Everyone I came into contact with there listened to my story with compassion, sincereity and heart. They encouraged me to reconnect with the community and supported me emotionally as I did. Eventually I began volunteering with The GLSO Pride Center and still work with them to this day, 10 years later. One thing I am most proud of is the fact that The GLSO Pride Center makes every attempt to keep their social event prices low so that EVERYONE in the community who wants to attend can.
GLSO Pride Center	5431	11	/users/profile/7230	lexpride	Volunteer	5	06/22/2009	The Pride Center has become my home. The people here have help find myself after hiding from the world out of fear for so many years. I have learned how to give back through volunteering here, and have met many new while doing so. This organization deserves so much more help than it receives from its community. It has come a long way though from its beginning many years ago.
GLSO Pride Center	5354	7	/users/profile/7154	burned	Volunteer	5	06/18/2009	They created the first downtown high visability pride festival in 2008 and this year promises to be even larger. They have made Lexington Kentucky a warm place for GLBT folks by working hard with other organizations and being THOUGHTFUL about those interactions. This is a very conservative state and Lexington is a beacon of hope now to GLBT people living with a lot of homophobia in the surrounding area.
GLSO Pride Center	5341	7	/users/profile/7138	James Guerrero	General Member of the Public	2	06/18/2009	Although the GLSO Center seems to be very helpful in terms of resources, such as social and support groups; I didn't feel like I fit in well very.  By this I am referring to the Insight group, the only gay social and support group that I've had exposure to. I've attended several meetings and felt very isolated.   There seemed to be a lack of activities that the group participated other than movies and potlucks in the center.  Perhaps topical discussion, games, and outings should be incorporated within this social and support group.A second comment refers to the availability, or rather lack of availability, of social and support groups at the GLSO Center.  There seems to be a lack of social and support groups for younger people, particularly younger professionals and college-oriented students.  Perhaps I would be more inclined to support the GLSO Center if such a group were available.My last comment refers to the location of the GLSO Center.  Though the Waller Street does not seem like a poor location relative to other locations within Lexington, I believe a more central location of the GLSO center should be considered and may even perhaps be beneficial to the gay community in Lexington and within the Bluegrass Region at large.  A downtown location, for example, may help increase the visibility of an active gay community within the city of Lexington and its surrounding communities, especially because our city's downtown is very vibrant, active, and a magnet for both residents within the city and residents within surrounding Bluegrass Region.
GLSO Pride Center	5255	7	/users/profile/7051	morganfry	Client Served	5	06/16/2009	The GLSO Pride Center, its volunteers and officers have been instrumental in the formation, establishment and growth of the non-profit group, The Rainbow League.  The Rainbow League is a GLBT all-inclusive bowling league in Lexington, Kentucky.The GLSO has helped us find and retain new members by including our announcements in their newsletters.  They have personally connected me with interested folks in the community and with volunteers who have helped me organize and start the league.  Our goal was to begin the 2009 season with 10 teams.  We reached it within two weeks of start-up.  Without the GLSO, I don't believe we would have been able to bring in so many participants or have created the receptive and large community awareness we now enjoy.Many thanks to the organization and its staff for their hard work, professionalism and dedication.Morgan FryPresidentThe Rainbow League
GLSO Pride Center	5240	8	/users/profile/7046	Barb Stead	Donor	5	06/16/2009	The GLSO Pride Center is the "hub in the wheel" of LGBT activities in Lexington. It is through Pride Center activities that much of the LGBT community in Lexington (actually in the entire eastern half of Kentucky)stay connected.  From the groups they sponsor to the newsletter to their outstanding library built entirely from donations from the community to the 2nd Annual Lexington Pride Festival coming up in a couple of weeks, Board members and volunteers have worked tirelessly for years to make sure that the LGBT community is not invisible in Lexington. The Pride Center staff have been there for me and many others and as the only Pride Center in the State of Kentucky has done an outstanding job of bringing the face of the LGBT community to the front in situations that affect its well-being.
Armed Services YMCA of Fort Campbell, KY	34401	6	/users/profile/35224	uh60-cw	Client Served	5	04/01/2010	Fabulous organization that provides free activities for my toddler. My son loves the Tumble Tots and Discovery Time. There are very few free in-door resources for active play for young children in this area, but the YMCA does a wonderful job of filling that gap. We were regulars all winter - don't know what we would have done without them!

Armed Services YMCA of Fort Campbell, KY	34120	1	/users/profile/34945	tiffany1	Client Served	5	03/29/2010	I have been going here with my 2 year old for over a year. It is wonderful, All the ladies that run it are saints, they go above and beyond. The playgroups are so much fun for all the kids, they learn so much. And all the field trips make things possible that normally i wouldnt never be able to do or afford with my daughter. Here we have made best friends, and wonderful memories. I wouldnt know what to do if we didnt have the ASYMCA available for us.
Armed Services YMCA of Fort Campbell, KY	34099	2	/users/profile/34924	sheilapatton	Former staff	5	03/29/2010	I was introduced to the Armed Services YMCA by a very close friend of mine. She needed help starting a new program for children who needed an extra boost in their lives. The Operation Hero program has been a wonderful asset to the Fort Campbell Community for the parents and teachers of the children they assist. It provides children with guidance in learning how to be a more positive person and making them feel like they are special. It is great for self esteem, communicating with others and learning how to deal with separation of a parent due to deployment. There is much more to the program, but this is the basics. It is offered in all the elementary and middle schools on Fort Campbell. I was an instructor and the feeling it gave me just knowing I was making a difference in their lives, was so rewarding. The ASYMCA also has programs such as the Back Door Boutique, which allows families of the Junior Enlisted Soldiers to come and "shop" for clothing, household items, toys, and other miscellaneous items. They get these items for free. They also have a formal section where anyone can come and "rent" formal wear, for men and women. A deposit is put down and once the item is returned, you get your deposit back. I have used this several times and it has saved me money in having to go out and buy a dress and accessories. It also helps the Junior Enlisted soldiers to attend the events that they would not otherwise attend due to the cost of purchasing the formal wear.  Each year at Easter they have a post wide Easter Egg Hunt where all the children come and meet the Easter Bunny and search for eggs. I have volunteered with this and once again what a rewarding feeling. Seeing the smiles on the children' faces is an awesome feeling.At Christmas, soldier's who are in a financial crisis or just can't afford to give their children the Christmas that they would like put in request for items. Not always do they get what they ask for, but the ASYMCA works very hard putting the family baskets together to meet those request. It takes a lot of money and dedication from the volunteers to put these baskets together.The baskets consist of toys, clothing, winter coats, family items, household items just to mention some of what they contain. Once again, I helped volunteer with this. Not as much as I would like or as often, but the program is there and it is a wonderful program. Children receive a Christmas celebration that they would not get if it were not for the ASYMCA.I would have to say the the ASYMCA helped me to get a job at the school I work at. I was doing the Operation Hero Program and was asked to put my name on the substitute teaching list. I was hired and have been subbing for several years now. I am not as involved with the ASYMCA as I use to be, but I still support the program and believe in it's existence. It is a vital part of the Fort Campbell community. I only mentioned a few of the programs they offer, there is so much more. The funds are limited and the space is small, but the staff and volunteers have hearts of gold and accomplish what they set out to do. I was/am honored to have been a part of the program. They deserve all the recognition they can get and then some.
Armed Services YMCA of Fort Campbell, KY	34085	1	/users/profile/34904	ai	Volunteer	5	03/28/2010	This organization has several services which are all great: daycare, playgroup, dress rental, and 2nd hand store, all for free.I have volunteered at the daycare for three and a half year while my husband was station on Ft.Campbell. My husband have deployed twice during the time, and this service help me both phisically(financially) and spiritually. Not only they gave my children chance to experience preschool, but they trained me as a caregiver, foodhandler, and as lead caregiver, and held benefitial meetings twice a month for all volunteers.It is very difficult to raise small children especially when including infant while spouse is deployed...and it is more difficult to keep the marriage from corrupting, but I was able to be strong and focused because I had the support from the ASYMCA and co-volunteers.I was even able to go back to school while raising 3 children aging 5yr, 3yr and infants all by myself.My experiences at ASYMCA are beyond any words; they were like a blessing from heaven.
Armed Services YMCA of Fort Campbell, KY	33938	1	/users/profile/34754	brandtlyon	Volunteer	5	03/25/2010	My Church and I have been volunteering at the ASYMCAon Ft. Campbell for the past six months.  This organization truly cares for its community and the morale of teh military it serves.  From the monthly free meals that we help serve, to the free clothing, to the formal gowns available to borrow, to the free childcare it provides, this service offers practical help to teh junior enlisted at Ft. Campbell.  The staff is well trained and passionate about the people they serve.  This is a ministry/service that deserves recognition.
Armed Services YMCA of Fort Campbell, KY	33936	9	/users/profile/34751	naomi3	Volunteer	5	03/25/2010	The ASYMCA program of Ft. Campbell offered many free programs and activities for families of the community.  I participated in the co-op daycare program for about two years while stationed there.  The program allowed me to receive free training to be a qualified daycare provider.  At the time I had two children.  They loved getting to go to co-op to play with other children their ages.  They were able to do age-appropriate lessons to help them with ABCs and numbers.  They thought of it like preschool.  I volunteered by working in the classrooms and in the kitchen.  In turn for my time I received free childcare.  Soldiers at Campbell deploy often so having this service was such a blessing for my family.  I made friends and connected with others who were facing the same issues.  The co-op network helped the time to go by faster.  I really appreciated the time I was able to have for myself being a part of the ASYMCA.  The ASYMCA also offered other programs such as crafty kids and tumbling classes and even free dinner nights for the family with door prizes. Since being stationed at another post I truly miss the ASYMCA programs.  It would be wonderful if every post could have a program as devoted to helping families of the community as much as the ASYMCA of Ft. Campbell does.
Armed Services YMCA of Fort Campbell, KY	33882	7	/users/profile/34694	kimyoung	Volunteer	5	03/24/2010	I volunteered with the ASYMCA from January 2005 until May 2009 (when we left Fort Campbell, KY).  Our family has been assigned to several posts, and none of them have had the programs and family support that we found with the ASYMCA of Fort Campbell, KY.  The ASYMCA provided lots of programs that were very beneficial to my childrens mental, emotional and social development.  Programs that allowed my 6weeks old-school age kids interact with other kids and develop educationally such as the ABCs&123s;class, the Tumbling Toddlers class, and the Co-operative Daycare.  The ASYMCA also provided programs including the Co-operative Daycare and Backdoor Boutique that I was able to take advantage of. By volunteering my time at the Co-operative Daycare, I earned points to drop my children off for free childcare while I used the time to go doctors appointments, grocery shopping or just take personal time for myself.  This was extremely helpful during the multiple deployments when my husband was gone for 12-15month at a time.  Being able to go grocery shopping without 3 kids or having time to get a massage really relieved a lot of stress during the deployments and made it a little easier to get through them.  At the Backdoor Boutique I was able to go in and find gently used donated items for myself and my family at no cost.  I was also able to donate items that other soldiers and their families could use such as used computers, bed mattressess, clothes, and dishes that my family no longer had a use for.  At the Armed Services YMCA of Fort Campbell, KY, my family and I have built lifelong friendships with other spouses and families that I am still in contact with after going to a different posts.  We used to have holiday parties together, sleepovers for the children, and other get-togethers while supporting each other through deployments or other tough times.  Now we meet up whenever we can for family vacations together while keeping in touch via e-mail, telephone or social networking sites.  The experiences and bonds that I've made during my time with the ASYMCA of Fort Campbell, KY, are ones that I will truly treasure for the rest of my life.

Heart To Heart Rescue	285373	1	/users/profile/375359	Landis	General Member of the Public	5	04/09/2016	Wonderful Rescue! People listen to to much drama and they don't look at the facts. Fact is that people are small minded and the listen to people who are crossed and lack perspective. For instance Mary Dickerson-Goldman has been sued by Heart to Heart Rescue for theft of animals and because she drives a truck and has no real home, they can not get her into a courtroom. The Barn that people have mentioned has under the control of the caretaker Victoria Whiting who abandoned the property and left without notifying the rescue of her actions, Victoria Whiting endangered those animals and if they were not clean or feed she didn't clean them or feed them. To much faith in that person is all that the rescue is guilty of, if this wasn't the case i am sure the police or government would have turned something up to charge other people with and so far Victoria Whiting is the only person who has had charges brought against her. Get your facts right. and Rescue on Kim!
Heart To Heart Rescue	285359	1	/users/profile/375345	Sara_love	Volunteer	5	04/08/2016	I do not believe the gossip or the haters i have met Kim several times and she has helped with many animals. I have only had the best results with her. to the previous post about how you checked up on veterinarian offices your lying. I know that vet offices do not give out account information to anyone but the account owner and if your not the person on the account than you lied to gain access to someone else account which makes  your statement crooked and an admission of a criminal act. People need to realize that Facebook drama is not always correct. 
Heart To Heart Rescue	274508	5	/users/profile/363922	Writer	Donor	1	12/15/2015	It is obvious that Kim wrote the post slamming Vicky.  This site has all negative things on H2H. Just go away you have done enough damage.  Take responsibility for your actions. You gave the car to her. You know you did. I hope they a arrest you for filing false reports
Heart To Heart Rescue	272081	2	/users/profile/361039	The Arrow Fund	General Member of the Public	5	11/15/2015	Does any of the previous posters know where the person Victoria Whiting is located because i checked the information in the one post about being wanted and all of the information is correct this person is wanted it seems that people are blindly accusing the wrong people for the wrong thing. I asked the organization for more clarity and the provided me with more than enough proof that that are legitimate and operate correctly. 
Heart To Heart Rescue	261893	6	/users/profile/350537	Writer	Donor	1	10/06/2015	Scammers that have killed many dogs after receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations! BEWARE!! Kimberly Brooks Massey, aka Kim Deutsch, and David Powell, aka Jonathan D. Powell and associates. All unemployed deadbeats.
Heart To Heart Rescue	260108	16	/users/profile/348671	Earnie	Donor	1	09/29/2015	Since there are no previous mentions about Vicky Whitey, how does attacking this individual pertain to the discussion which was posted about this rescue? If you are trying to discredit any rumors which have not been discussed in this forum by addressing criminal charges, lets discuss the 3 counts filed on 17 July 2012 and the 2 charges filed on 3 June 2015. With that, I will move on  I for one was a donor to this organization and donated a good amount of money to them. It hurt me so to hear and to read about the deplorable conditions in which these animals were found.  Nothing here is being fabricated to "Bully" this organization or push them around.  I have dealt with a few individuals from Heart to Heart and have found them to be the rudest people I have ever met and this was while I was trying to help them.  I was attempting to adopt an animal from this rescue when it blew apart from the many photos and allegations made in the early part of July.   Your board members ( Heart to Heart ) folded overnight claiming no knowledge of this ongoing neglect of these poor animals.  I watched on face book as the director of Heart to Heart , day in and day out,  denied any knowledge that these many animals were being neglected and claimed to provide "Proof" that the photos and allegations were in fact lies.  The "Proof" never came and the Heart to heart face book disappeared. The last statement I remembered reading about this organization was they were closing their doors and would be dissolving  when they Federal expressed the proper paperwork to authorities. To the best of my knowledge, they are no longer in the "rescue" business.  It also appears that one writer is spreading tons of fertilizer about an individual named Ms. Whiting. I am not sure how and why you are calling this individual a thief and drug dealer, but I suspect this may go against the terms of use and in my opinion would be classified as bullying and advocates harassment towards her. It appears as though this writer, (12 November 2015) has a personnel grudge against Ms Whiting. I do not see where the publishing of any arrest records are facts nor would I understand why a supposed felon would be allowed to handle the welfare of all these rescued animals.   Again, these post's are a review against an organization and not an individual and I have requested this writers comments be flagged..   As I said earlier, I was a donor in this organization and after 25 July, when the animals were rescued from a hot barn in VA., I heard many rumors that some donated monies were never used for animal care.  Therefore I did check with the attending Vet on a certain animal which I donated money for.  It took some doing and I had to speak with several individuals, but I was finally informed that the Vet bills were not paid by this organization.  This is not bullying, this is what I was told by this staff and I am relying on the photos and this information from the vets office to formulate my opinion, not emotion. ( I am speaking of the Freedom 46 photo's.)

Speak Up For Horses Inc	220585	10	/users/profile/284253	TeresaTravis	Advisor	5	10/07/2014	I am a champion of animal guardianship.  If children had public school classes in- caring for - animals with credits -  compassion would be more common.  NO excuse for animal abuse or neglect. Legal ZERO TOLERANCE for animal abuse.  What a human does to an animal should be done back to the human to show them what it feels like to be treated with disrespect or cruelty.      KINDNESS becomes good manners,respect, and responsibility.  Important for our future - human evolution.... Violent films and video games trains more bullies and encourages sociopaths. Children think that  is normal..Horses - our beautiful and powerful friends from ancient times.  HORSES were our main transportation -they plowed our fields and died in our battles . When MEN  send horses to be slaughtered for profit ...it is the  lowest betrayal of which men are capable.  THANKS TO EVERYONE WHO CARES ENOUGH TO STAND UP AND SPEAK UP FOR HORSES!GOD BLESS SANCTUARIES WHO HELP THEM.   IT ISN'T CHEAP.   However, children need to be shown that it is normal to care and NOT right to abuse or hurt any living being.   We would not need wars and other violent means to achieve  goals.  Our culture couldevolve...it isn't technology that evolves man's culture but being  humane. Teresa Travis
Speak Up For Horses Inc	155301	17	/users/profile/206190	Angels memory	Volunteer	5	04/18/2013	While attending a family reunion last July, I learned that there was a beautiful mare that was abandoned on an adjoining farm.  She was underweight, had tangles in her mane and tail and her hooves were severly overgrown due to neglect.  I do not have the know-how, land or $$$ to keep a horse, have never owned a horse, although I would dearly love to have one someday.  It was fate that I came across the webpage for Speak Up For Horses.  They sounded like the perfect rescue for my "Angel" who desperately needed to be rescued, so I got up my courage and called Shelly at Speak Up For Horses.  She quietly listened as I explained to her about the plight of "Angel", a beautiful, loving and friendly mare, and how quickly she needed to be transported to begin her long road to recovery.   Angel was soon transported to SUFH and was quickly attended to by Shelly, the vet and farrier.  Angel captured the hearts of anyone who was lucky enough to see her.  Blood work was done, hooves were trimmed, nutritional needs were met, and she received lots of love and kind words from everyone.  I was impressed by the clean, bright and airy barn and the kindness of Shelly, the vet, the farrier and all the volunteers.  Despite all the love, attention and medical care, it was determined that Angel had severe founder, lamintis and was in severe pain due to some other complications with her feet and that the most humane thing to do would be to help her cross over Rainbow Bridge.  It tore our hearts out to lose Angel, and anyone who met her was crushed by the sad news that she had to be put down.  Many tears have been shed in Angels memory. It was one of the most difficult days of my life to see this beautiful horse euthanized, but Shelly and Dr. Glaza were so compassionate and loving with her and they explained every step of this extremely sad process to me.  On the way home that night, with tears streaming down my face, I decided to turn a negative into a positive in Angels memory.  I now volunteer at the barn, know and love each horse, and look so forward to my visits to the barn.  It has changed my life forever. Over the past 8 months I have learned so much from Shelly about the care of horses, have seen her passion, love and dedication to each and every horse in her care, and how each horses' needs are met in the best way possible.   Shelly would walk to the edges of the earth to make sure all of the horses are taken care of and that they are happy and healthy. I am so glad that I found Speak Up For Horses for Angel........and for myself!  I anxiously look forward to every weekend that I go to the barn and see my "babies" as they now recognize me and look forward to being petted, loved and cared for.  This has been an incredible journey for me and I look forward to many, many years of volunteering at Speak Up For Horses.
Speak Up For Horses Inc	148956	10	/users/profile/198423	rafter	Volunteer	5	02/05/2013	Speak Up For Horses is one of the very few rescues i totally support in every way. They are committed to rescuing horses in danger or need and dedicated to providing them with the best environment and care they need for recovery. Their goal for each horse is to find a new home and new owner who is the perfect match for that horse. They will keep every horse and train and rehabilitate that horse until they are ready for adoption. Speak Up For Horses is dedicated to educating everyone about the horrors and cruelty involved in horse slaughter....not just the ultimate pain and fear at the end of the journey...but....the inhumane way many horses are transported there. They offer a free seminar for law enforcement agencies that teaches them how to recognize cruelty and neglect in horses. Many agencies are not familiar with livestock and are not able to identify what is really neglect until they are trained to do so. Speak Up For Horses will provide this training for anyone that asks for it. I would not hesitate to speak up for this rescue anywhere...anytime. Speak Up For Horses truly understands what rescue means....providing a safe environment....meeting nutritional requirements....providing medical and farrier care as needed...and a good quality of life for each and every horse they take responsibility for.

Speak Up For Horses Inc	101277	10	/users/profile/129067	bvandergrift	General Member of the Public	5	11/29/2011	My name is Bonnie Vandergrift, I live in Canterbury, Ct and adopted a 6 month old colt from Speak up for Horses 2 years ago.  When I got him he was being called 'Peanut', I chose the name Cheyenne for him and he readily answers to it and when I call him he comes running to me, he was pretty wild and afraid of everything for a good 6 months, but then one day he came over and allowed me to pet him, it's been nothing but good.  He appreciates everything that is done for him and to me is loving and seems to be my shadow most of the time.  Needless to say I can only imagine what may have happened to him if Shelly hadn't taken these horses in!  I feel so very lucky to have been able to adopt him, I only wish I could take in another one, but don't have enough pasture for another horse.  The only problem at all when I adopted Cheyenne was the weather, seemed every time we thought we'd be able to pick him up the snow would pile up way too much to be safe to drive from Ky to Ct.  Finally in March he got here, if I could figure out how to do it, I'd send in pictures taken the day he arrived and then 6 mos later, and again at 18 mos.  He is now a bit over 2 and beautiful.  I'm so grateful for people like Shelly, who have the land and use it to help our most majestic animals, who helped to make this country what it is.  Cheyenne's ancestors helped many hundreds of years ago and now I was able, with Speak up for Horses help, to help this young fellow.  Any help that anyone could give toward feed, medical, etc would be so appreciated, it is so rewarding to be able to do anything you can.  You will never regret helping in any way you can!

Speak Up For Horses Inc	101211	10	/users/profile/128830	Pat_234	Donor	5	11/28/2011	I had some wormer that I wasn't going to use so I went looking for someone to donate it to. I wanted someone or a rescue that I could believe in and I wanted to be able to visit the place I chose. I did a web search and Speak Up for Horses was one of the sites that came up. I called and spoke to Shelly and she said that she would appreciate the wormer. During our conversation she mentioned she used the same vet practice I did. I called my vet and inquired about the organization and why I wanted to know. They gave a very high recommendation and for my vet to do that is not something to take lightly. I went to the location where the horses were kept and was given a tour of the facility. I was very impressed with the cleanliness, organization of the facility, and the way the horses responded to Shelly. She knew each horse by name and was careful to let me know which ones were still fearful of strange people. I was impressed at the dedication and love that where given to the horses. This is a wonderful rescue! The horses are given what they need in order to have a better chance at being adopted in a happy forever home. This is a rescue where each horse is an individual and treated as such. Lucky is the horse that gets rescued by Speak Up For Horses.

The people in the organization devote many hours to helping the horses that others have forgotten about.  Without these people many horses would have no hope of finding loving homes.  I have personally seen the people in Speak Up For Horses work with animals that some thought were unable to rehabilitate and through hard, dedicated work brought the animals to a point where they were able to be placed in loving homes.

And he obviously visits the site just to lower the ratings? For those not in the know but who truly care about veterans, this foundation is building a memorial in Washington, DC to honor the sacrifice of disabled veterans. From what I've read, they are expecting to be ready and open to the public in the fall of 2014.

It will be a welcome and beloved addition to Washington DC. It's time to honor those who have been disabled defending our country. As for another comment on this page ... this is NOT the group profiled on Anderson Cooper. The names are very similar but they are different groups entirely. This one is on the up-and-up.

They are not related in any way. THIS Foundation's sole focus is to raise money to build The American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial in Washington, DC, to honor and pay tribute to some of Americas most courageous heroes, and to celebrate those men and women who may be broken in bodybut never in spirit. It is expected to be completed and dedicated in late 2014. Updates can be found on the Memorial website, www.avdlm.org.

She is constantly working on grants, a variety of donations (food, furniture, clothing, toys, household supplies, etc.), and services to aid with the needs of families.  The employees and volunteers are loving and kind and always have a smile.  They are warm and caring and make everyone feel comfortable and welcome.

We have recently adopted a wonderful dog who was the victim of extreme neglect and who would not be alive now without the Arrow Fund. They learned of this dog's plight, arranged transport from the other side of the state, paid for weeks of veterinary care that restored the animal to health, found a foster home for him and finally paid for him to be neutered before giving him to us for adoption. This story is repeated week after week, month after month with animals in the most extreme of conditions due to abuse or neglect. Most other organizations are not as able as the Arrow Fund to take on this responsibility. The Arrow Fund is worthy of everyone's respect and support for the work they do for these animals in need.

When there is evidence that the injuries are the result of cruelty, The Arrow Fund works with prosecutors to seek justice for these animals.

The Arrow Fund Inc	208421	7	/users/profile/271104	Merrol F.	General Member of the Public	1	08/02/2014	This organization began as part of The Shamrock Foundation. The date of separation was March 2013.  Instead of going through the process required for a nonprofit to receive tax exempt status, they repurposed a dormant but existing nonprofit called Neuter Town, Inc.  The Arrow Fund has a very different mission than Neuter Town, Inc. Spaying and neutering of domestic cats and dogs is not very high on its agenda. Yet The Arrow Fund took time to change the name, but not the mission. Sure altering pets and other related activities are covered by the mission statement, but The Arrow Fund focuses on the rehabilitation and medical care of animals that have been subjected to extreme abuse.  The Arrow Fund likely could not stand the financial scrutiny of the IRS and wished to avoid paying the fee. An animal rights attorney is one of the board directors as well as the Kentucky director of the HSUS regional office so this organization should be well aware of the legalities.

Per the Butler County courts he must complete their program or stay in jail. Oh he went willing to Isaiah House after all it was the best of the two evils he said. Since entering the program he has become clean and sober for the first time in 24 years. He has become a person we didn't know existed. He has done so well that he is now working for Isaiah House, living is sober living housing, paying child support. All of these things are wonderful but above all he believes in God. His testimony brings me to tears yet I continue to listen to the recording daily. The drug problem is out of control and will continue to grow if this program isn't funded fully. Please make the commitment today to donate to them. There are many more success stories like my sons. I have meet some of the nicest young and older gentlemen that are just as successful.

I was facing 25 years in prison for manufacturing meth. I came to IH broken. They taught me how to seek God and His will. They loved on me and gently lifted me up. Today I've been clean almost 3 years, I have a steady full time job, a home of my own, and most importantly my husband and I regained full custody of our children. God is good!

They came home with many friends and they both gave their hearts to The Lord. Now that they are grown they still talki of their experiences they had there and my son goes back as a counselor. This is a great place to let your kids go to have a week of fun and not have to worry about them. The Chambers family that takes care of the place are wonderful people whom I have a great respect for. I pray that God continues to let this camp carry on for many years to come to reach out to other young people that are searching for a  place to find peace within. 
Glen Eden Youth Center Inc	196149		/users/profile/256437	ScottBledsoe	Volunteer	5	03/22/2014	Glen Eden is a youth camp that I hold very near and dear to my heart. I began going to the week long youth camp as a child and on through my teenage years. After becoming an adult I was blessed with the opportunity of becoming a councillor, giving me a chance to give back to childern much like myself as an adolescent. I also do some of the upkeep to the facilities at times. Most people would have a hard time believing the power and energy of these grounds, but let me tell ya, this place truely touches people. I couldn't begin to count the number of miracles that I have personally seen take place on these holy grounds. A very special place that feels more like home than my own.

Glen Eden Youth Center Inc	3524	1	/users/profile/5308	Alicia Smith	Volunteer	5	04/15/2009	nestled in the hills of untouched natural forest is a small camp with a huge heart...The soul of Glen Eden was established by its founders Reverend John R Chambers and Rev Caudill.  Their dream to give hope to children living in poverty, to provide spiritual foundations and education for those who perhaps had no other opportunities to find them.  I grew up on Glen Eden, playing in the creek, climbing beneath the waterfalls, swimming in the river.  As a military brat, Glen Eden provided me with an anchor to a "home" I didn't have otherwise.  My memories are of singing, exploring, and worshipping our wonderful God.  I am looking forward to working there as an adult counselor in the future.

American Printing House for the Blind, Inc.	180598		/users/profile/237286	Cheri Todd	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/21/2013	Just attended the APH Annual Meeting in Louisville, KY., which was very well attended by many professionals in the field of visual impairments! Three in our group from Tennessee had missed the scheduled tours of APH, and then we met Bob Belknap! He took time out  from his busy conference schedule, and conducted the tour to our delight! It was my first time to actually see where the many adaptive materials are not only designed, but created, boxed up, and delivered to other school systems all over the USA! Our students with visual impairments not only use many of these wonderful materials every day, they help to increase their chances of being successful, independent learners with these APH products! The tour was definitely one of the highlights of our APH Conference visit!  I was also impressed with how "clean" the work areas were,  and how "safety-conscious" the APH workers were in the various parts of the building! Many of the workers have chosen to stay and work at APH for several years, and definitely claim ownership of the amazing products they help design for the Vision population! I think this speaks very highly of not only the workers, but the APH management staff as well! I also enjoyed seeing many of my Hero's in the field of Vision in the APH Museum! What a testament to so many inspiring, humble teachers, who have worked tirelessly for our student's with visual impairments! It made me very proud to be in this field, and to know that they are many professionals continuing to improve the academic careers for individuals with vision loss! Thanks, again, for a wonderful, informative tour! I look forward to visiting with APH staff and professionals in the future!

I have lived in Louisville most of my life and have passed by the location, but did not realize they gave tours.  The Museum is excellent.  Our tour guide was great and kept the kids engaged.  I didn't realize how many items they make and the number of children they serve (over 59,000 across the United States). The tour is free!  Take my advice and take advantage of this Louisville Treasure.
American Printing House for the Blind, Inc.	89319	2	/users/profile/101429	Margaret Von	Donor	1	05/31/2011	Though APH serves many important functions in the VI community,  it is very clear that it is beginning to lack cohesive in-house leadership and a proactive direction.   The organization could utilize technological advances more effectively with more direct emphasis on modernization of outmoded items.      Traveling to APH is a step back in time.  While this could be seen as a positive for some businesses, in one that should be current with cutting edge developments, it is not a compliment.   Equipment appears worn and antique.   Staff diversity is lacking and in positions of strategic import and authority, this is all but invisible.   I have donated to the American Printing House for the Blind, Inc. for 30 years in some capacity or another.   I will continue to do so but will be more apt to make larger donations should the Board of Trustees take a closer look at moving the organization a few leaps into the future.

Mrs Sheila and all the ladies are truly heaven sent. It was times I felt defeated and didn't think I could make it and would call and talk to Mrs Kim or Mrs Sheila  who gave me encouragement to keep going. I don't know what I would have done without them and I am so very grateful God placed them in our lives. Even though it's been years since we were in the program, I still talk about it today like it was yesterday because it was so life changing. I pray God continues to bless Mrs Sheila and this wonderful program. The Page Family
Moms Closet Resource Center Inc	82962	1	/users/profile/91759	Julie R.	Client Served	5	03/23/2011	Mom's Closet changed my life. When I discovered Mom's Closet I was just starting work on my dream to go to nursing school.  I was at a  time in my life when I felt as if it were me against the world. Being the single mother of 2 young children is a very hard situation. Without any support from their father I was finding myself falling further and further in debt. Many of the agencies that offered assistance to single mothers often made me feel as if I were a disgrace to the community because I couldn't afford to raise my children without help. By sheer accident I came across a brochure about Mom's Closet. I decided to see what help they might offer. On the day of my appointment I readied myself for the usual looks of disgust and tried to prepare myself for the shame I thought I would feel after leaving there. To my surprise, Sheila, Kim and the other workers there made me feel like I was in fact someone special. They reminded me that my focus to better my life for the sake of my children would be the driving force behind my success. They showed me that I was a good person and reminded me that it "takes a village to raise a child."  I think above everything else, they reminded me that I am a child GOD that deserves happiness. That means more than anything to a person that is close to giving up. After I was accepted into their program, the support didn't stop at the door and was not just from a financial stand point. Many times I called Sheila and Kim just to hear a friendly word and to get the extra offer of encouragement that they always had for me. They helped me keep food in my children's tummies as I struggled through the long days and hours of nursing school. They provided a wonderful Christmas for my children and me and even took time to  throw in little special events that gave me opportunities to do things with my kids I could never otherwise have afforded. Throughout my time in this program and even well after graduating nursing school, the ladies and gentleman of Mom's Closet remained a big part of my life. It has been over 4 years now since I graduated. I never hesitate to try and pass on the story of what Mom's Closet has done for me. No other organization could be more loving and GOD centered than the workers at Mom's Closet. These people dedicate their time and their hearts to show single mothers of Kentucky that GOD does indeed have a plan for them and they are not alone. Without them, I may have given up on my dreams of becoming a nurse. But thanks to them and to GOD above, I was able to find strength to push forward and become the nurse and mother that I am today. May GOD bless every person that walks through the door of Mom's Closet and all those who donate their time and money to see that this program continues.

One day in an interveiw a boy about 11 years old was asked what would he like to have!! He stated that he would like to have meat to eat. He and his mom had not had meat in about 8 months. Bringing them in to the food pantry for food was like watching a child get a new bike, only it was 4 pounds of ground meat and a package of chicken. He carried the bag of meat out the door as we stood there crying and smiling!
Moms Closet Resource Center Inc	82884		/users/profile/91657	mordor7	Board Member	5	03/22/2011	19 years ago I was a single mother with two small boys.  I would have loved to have had a resource like Mom's Closet to help me.  Women who are going to school, working, and raising children alone are pulled in so many different directions, sometimes they just need encouragement to keep going and realize their dreams of being able to support themselves and their family without assistance.  Mom's Closet Resource Center, Inc. does just that.  They are a help up to these women, not just a hand out.  The director of the program Kim Jacobs, takes the time to get to know each of the women and her children that are in the program.  She offers her friendship not just financial help.  Sheila Day the president and COO is not just a figure head, she is at the Center daily and works along side Kim and all the other volunteers.I am proud to be a weekly volunteer and a board member of Mom's Closet.  We are continuing to grow and add more women and children to our program, that shows that women are looking to education as a way out of desperate situations, and that through hard work and dedication they can better the lives of their children.  Mom's Closet has restored my faith in what can be achieved when people care about each other.  
Moms Closet Resource Center Inc	82834		/users/profile/91580	Laura Wingfield	Board Member	5	03/22/2011	What a blessing Mom's Closet has been to single mom's in our area.   On the front of our brochure it says...Changing the future of Kentucky's kids one mom at a time....I have watched over the past seven to eight years the lives that have been changed due to the assistance these moms receive from the center.   They are taught about accountability, but with love.  They receive assistance where they run short each month, either by assisting with utilities, gasoline, or even just trips to the food pantry.  When these mom's become a part of the Life Plan at MCRC, they become part of our family.  We help with Thanksgiving, Christmas, back to school.  Any of those "extras" that can throw someone off track, and, sometimes it seems like you can't get a break to get back on track.  We have seen so many success stories as these women graduate and move on to get good jobs to be able to continue to support their families.  And we haven't even begun to talk about the difference it makes in the lives of these kids.  To be able to have some of the basics that we take for granted, and to get a little extra every now and then.  Simply amazing!   Sheila always says...we are not a hand out, we are a hand up!

At the time I was a trainer providing direction to 80 emergency shelters throughout the southeastern United States.  Brighton Center staff were prominent at every event we hosted.  They are known for leading the field, accepting the challenge, and valuing young people as equals and contributors to their own success.  I don't work with them directly now, but thanks to their unparalleled social networking efforts, led by some guy named "Bear" I can keep up with their efforts to motivate and serve their community.  In that way, Brighton Center serves me daily down here in Florida, connecting their mission to the people in a way that continues to move and inspire me.

Not sure what to do with myself, I started applying for jobs and sadly at 60 years old no one wanted to hire me.  I applied at over 1,000 jobs and had over 100 interviews.This is after having a great career as a manager of a large utility company and they gave me made skills over the 30 years I worked for them.Needing to put my brain back to work, I decided to find a nonprofit I could commit to and I found that in Blessings in a Backpack Rancho Cordova.It was a HUGE eye opener for me to find that children go without food on the weekends, when I say this on the national news and I knew I had found my nonprofit.Children that are on the free/reduced lunch program are not guaranteed food until they come back to school on Monday but not at the schools we have adopted.We send home 6 meals and 2 snacks each and every Friday and have for 2 school years because children should worry about being kids and not where their next meal is coming from!

They have lots of fun, heartwarming stories, but no 990 posted and when I tried to get more information about where they worked in my area, or the specific numbers of kids served, they blew smoke in my face and said something about privacy and protecting kids. I am all for helping kids, but when it comes to my donation, I will give it to an organization that's transparent and one I can trust.

Over the last two years, he has blossomed both intellectually and socially. All of his teachers have been a pleasure to interact with and a blessing in our child's life. Keep up the great work, NKMA.
NORTHERN KENTUCKY MONTESSORI ACADEMY	290648		/users/profile/381010	Writer	Donor	5	05/23/2016	A nurturing and well-rounded educational experience for my child, a very true-to-form Montessori model.  Very happy with parent engagement and very happy with the development of my child both from an educational perspective but also an interactive/social perspective.  The school, while 50 years old, continues to grow and continues to look for ways to improve itself and its offerings to its students/parents.  NKMA is currently in the process of becoming only the second school in the state of KY to gain accreditation status with the American Montessori Society.  Overall, it has been a joy to watch my child grow intellectually, emotionally and socially and NKMA has been a very positive influence in these areas.  It really is more than just a school.

We have two children at the school.. In the time we have attended, the school has evolved from a 1 room school house into a 5 classroom academy. The level of independence, confidence and compassion my children have learned at NKMA and the rich teaching environment make it a place all schools should aspire to.

Through EDA's MANY operating divisions every person in Estill County can find their niche in the community.

DBA Estill Development Alliance	244998		/users/profile/332077	Loser12345	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/10/2015	Estill County 21st Century or Estill Development Alliance, as we know it in Kentucky is a great organization committed to growing the economy of Estill County.  The organization is involved in a number of projects in the community like the River City Players that are trying to re-start the old Mack Theater, tons of community projects, and works strategically with other organizations to lift the community.  A lot of other communities would like to have an EDA, but find that they can not do it with a volunteer board.  The Director of EDA, Joe Crawford, is extremely committed to Estill County and to making it an even better place to live, work, and grow.  What makes EDA a different non-profit than others?  Well, the mission of course but it is the people who work for EDA, the community that supports it, and the organizations that are affiliated with EDA that make EDA a special non-profit.  There are number of ways people can support EDA, and you don't have to live in the County.  If you grew up there, and want to help, just call the EDA Office and ask for Joe.

River Discovery Center	37008	10	/users/profile/37776	river-rat-10	Client Served	5	04/26/2010	As a resource teacher for our city's gifted and talented population, we are always struggling to find programs which are beneficial and affordable.  Imagine our delight when EJ Abell volunteered for our students ro visit the River Heritage Museum!  The students ranging from 4th-8th graders were greeted by three volunteers who were extremely prepared, organized, and well-versed.  Since they divided the large group into three smaller ones, the students were able to learn a lot along with having their questions answered.  The students also loved having the opportunity to use the simulator and creating an individual art project with Ms. Abell.  The professionalism of the staff of the River Heritage Museum was above reproach!  It was most rewarding to have the students and adults who attended this field trip be reminded of the importance the river industry has upon our lives.  Paducah is very fortunate to have such an outstanding organization!
River Discovery Center	36663	5	/users/profile/37451	renewb3	Volunteer	5	04/23/2010	I am a student at the University of Kentucky, and was recently assigned a class project that required me to make a cultural contribution to either the community of Lexington or to my hometown. As a native of Paducah, I really wanted to give back to my city. I reached out to Julie Harris (the Executive Director of the RDC) about a collaboration project. Never have I received such positive feedback and kindness from a stranger.Julie worked with me to bring an art exhibit to the River Discovery Center. She made me feel very comfortable working on something I had no experience in. We secured the exhibit (to be shown in November) and a space for the show (Maiden Ally Cinema). This experience gave me a huge appreciation for the River Discovery Center and its mission of community enrichment through the historical and scientific education on rivers. I consider the Center to be a jewel in downtown Paducah. The building is a beautifully restored historical site of interest and the interior allows for interactive learning on waterways. This is all the more important due to Paducah's history of being a river town.I have had a wonderfully positive experience with the River Discovery Center and its directors Julie Harris and EJ Abell. I would be very willing to work with the RDC in the future as a volunteer and speak highly of the organization.

Green Cameroon	235943	1	/users/profile/319651	Sarah226	Volunteer	4	12/26/2014	Green Cameroon is a NGO that is fighting for environmental protection in Cameroon. I had the opportunity to volunteer for Green Cameroon for 3 months. My main field of work in the NGO was the Green Orphanage project. The aim of the project is to create an awareness of environmental issues and the importance of nature protection through environmental education in orphanages. We taught the children about nature processes as well as about how they can have an influence on environmental issues. Besides, Green Cameroon is in the process of publishing a guide book about environmental education which shall be distributed to many orphanages in Cameroon.  Apart from the Green Orphanage project there are many other projects going on. They are mostly in cooperation with schools, orphanages or local communities and try to improve nature protection through education and a sustainable development. Green Cameroon is a trustful NGO that is making a change in Cameroon. 
Green Cameroon	217158	1	/users/profile/280680	Johannes1	Volunteer	4	09/25/2014	Volunteered in Green Cameroon for nearly three months through the GLEN project. It was a very interesting experience. The head of the organization, Masango, was there when needed - also in private life, when helping arrange accommodation or showing around in town etc.  The project we carried out was called Green Orphanages and we, with another volunteer, were given the chance to spearhead the project, so that we could mold it the way we wanted, almost every aspect of it. Ofcourse, when we asked advice from Masango, he was readily giving it.  The only problem we faced were financial issues because the organization does not really have any steady funding. The quality of our project might have suffered a bit at some points, so we had to make it up for with being clever in our activities and using what we got.  All in all, the organization has its values and goals in place - it exist out of the need to make a change in Cameroon, I would recommend it for an challenging experience in a nice atmosphere :)

I was able to meet and work with enthusiastic and knowledgeable Green Cameroon staff and volunteers.  Green Cameroon is a grass roots organization that really believes in the value of environmental education.  
Green Cameroon	200182	1	/users/profile/261321	antoniamorzenti	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/13/2014	Buea, where this NGO is located, is wonderful! I felt safe walking around town at all time during the day and night. I wasn't doing much field work and spent most of my working days in the office researching partnerships, grants and trying to increase our volunteer platform. Masango, the director of the NGO is very open and transparent with all documents relevant to the NGO. Masango and his family are very welcoming people looking for all the help they can get with Green Cameroon. If you contribute to the NGO you have a say in what happens which is hard to come across in grassroots NGO - usually its a one man show were the communication comes from the top down only. He is very open to new ideas from volunteers and will help out in any and all ways possible. I would recommend this NGO to anyone looking to donate their time, money and/or in-kind resources. This is an NGO that is doing real things and impacting their community. The only set back is consistent funding.

Northern Kentucky Childrens Law Center Inc	171752	1	/users/profile/227398	psychologist	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/25/2013	I am a clinical psychologist who works in the family court system on a regular basis.   Some of my cases are the most heart wrenching, undercarriages of justice imaginable.  When children are abused, our society MUST act to protect them and give them a shot at a better life.  Time and time again, I have seen the very systems designed to help children, hurt them.  Time and time again, there has been no justice in our justice system for children. In these cases and in the most intractable situations, helping professionals become fatigued, frustrated and then, sadly, lose hope that anything can or will change.  There is nothing more demoralizing than having to sit with a child and tell him/her that there is nothing left that anyone can do to help. Such despair and injustice is thankfully never faced by the children represented by the Children's Law Center.  The legal team at CLC stops at nothing to ensure the rights of their young clients.  The staff at the Children's Law Center go above and beyond in their work.  They make a personal investment in the life of each child passing through their doors.    Through direct advocacy and policy level change, the Children's Law Center promote the idea that every child is a wonderful gift to cherish.  In turn, the Children's Law Center is also a wonderful gift to cherish, now and for many years to come.

It allowed me to feel like I could be a part of making a difference in the lives of children, help be a voice for those who don't have one, and work with an amazing group of people.  The staff at Children's Law Center is so personable and caring.  Children's Law Center offers a wide variety of ways to volunteer.

The Center engages in addressing systemic problems inherent in the application of laws affecting juveniles in our region. The staff is highly knowledgable, trained and fearless when tackling tough juvenile justice issues. The Center offers practicing attorneys valuable training for improving the delivery of defense services to juveniles. Center staff is always available to answer questions and offer real solutions to problematic and complex juvenile justice issues.I highly recommend their services to all (including children, parents, courts, caseworkers and attorneys) who are devoted to protecting the legal rights of children.

During this trip my heart was truly touched, and on this trip I made a decision to always give and be apart of the Haitian mission. During this time I had a chance to visit an orphanage, and a small church where we distributed items to the church. I was so blessed on this trip, and look forward to going again.

Pawsibilities Unleashed Pet Therapy Of Kentucky	313373		/users/profile/404745	Lukas P.	Client Served	5	10/22/2016	It took me 5 years to find an SD program that I could manage.  Most programs cost a fortune or required a great deal of travel and expense.  I stumbled upon PUPT and they literally created a program to help me find a K9 partner.  They worked with me in multiple ways and helped me achieve this goal.  Today, a year after I took on a PUPT K9 partner, my life has completely turned around in a positive direction.  My little copilot goes everywhere with me, doctors appointments, school, concerts, restaurants, and is extremely talented, well trained, well behaved, and impresses everyone she meets.  She quite possibly saved my life this spring by doing her job very well.  I support and recommend PUPT highly!  Remember this, receiving a service dog is forming a working partnership, it takes two.... the handler needs to be just as attentive to the needs of the dog as the dog is to the handler.

Pawsibilities Unleashed Pet Therapy Of Kentucky	299447	1	/users/profile/390362	lpnort	Client Served	1	08/06/2016	We were taken by this organization 2 weeks ago. We fill ed out the application, they never checked our references. We paid $850 for a mini ausiedoodle, they gave us her records (altered name saying the vet screwed up) We got her home and checked out by a vet. The microchip number they gave us didn't match our dog because there was NO microchip (as part of our adoption fee) Our puppy also had a heart arrhythmia, which would have been easily detected as part of her spaying a week earlier. We notified them and told them we have bonded and we expected to be reimbursed for the lack of microchip and for an appt to a cardio specialist. We were going to swallow the rest of the fees!!!!!!! They sent the rabies tag, the age was listed as 12 months or above (she's 6). Spoke to their vet and found that she was part of a large filthy litter that was given to this group. They turned around and charged $850, pure profit. Their website claims they don't take dogs with hookworms, guess what. Ours had them!!!! Another fee we have to swallow to get her retested. Their only response is to return her, and we believe they will euthanize her. Drive 12 hours round trip and additional costs. They don't care about the dog they placed or the family that has taken her in and given her a chance at a wonderful life. They are for profit only. We are putting together a BBB complaint with pages of evidence. PLEASE DO NOT BUY FROM THIS GROUP, THEY ARE MOTIVATED BY PROFIT ONLY and are placing unhealthy dogs and charging top dollar.
Terf Inc	153725		/users/profile/204541	April27	Volunteer	5	04/09/2013	Initially when I was introduced to TERF Foundation my intent was to tutor a few kids and possibly bake a few cupcakes.  Several months later I continue to have a dual relationship with the foundation.  TERF has no agenda other than to offer continuous improvement to the youth in our community that expands daily.  The value that TERF provides to participants allows them to know they are cared for, their struggles are recognized, and every possible consideration that can be given to offer the comfort of being supported.  I have served as a point of contact between sponsors and their child being sponsored and have recognized the benefits in the process.  Simplicity that we take for granted every day may be a luxury in some lives such as, hygiene product, a kind word, socks, or a gift certificate to lunch.  The principle of TERF  recognize the serious impact to give consideration to others.
Terf Inc	151686		/users/profile/202545	Phyllis13	Volunteer	5	03/27/2013	What can be said for this organization? A LOT! The TERF Project is the most amazing non-profit organization and I am lucky to be involved with it. I work with the facilitator of this organization through volunteer work for my classes. It helps the children and their families in our small community. Programs such as the WOW PAL program, which sponsors "adopt" a child and get them the things that they may need that month or a special something for the holiday or their birthday. Whether the things the need are school supplies, clothing,food or hygiene products that they have ran out of. These children love receiving their gifts but what gets them the most is the letters they receive from their sponsor. I have seen the many things that this organization stands for and sees through for each child and their family. It is definitely and honor to work closely with the fantastic volunteers that I have worked with. This organization is a godsend to our children and our community. GOD bless this organization.

Methodist Home Of Kentucky	172920		/users/profile/228919	Don Pat R.	Donor	5	10/02/2013	I served as Executive Director of the Methodist Home from 1999-2002. Before that, I served on the Board of Trustees for eight years. I saw the Home reach young people, change lives, restore confidence, and make families whole. I saw families adopt children through a thoroughly vetted process that placed the child with the right family. I saw teenagers aging out of the traditional 12-18 years old  program and enter a new initiative called Transitional Care for youth 18-21, in which they learned life skills, job management skills, and coping skills. In a word,I witnessed abandoned and abused young people being loved and renewed by a skilled, underpaid staff of caring professionals. The Methodist Home of Kentucky reaches out to kids who often literally have no where else to go. I have seen miracles of compassion and restoration of hope.
Methodist Home Of Kentucky	172764		/users/profile/228744	Charles F. Langford	Volunteer	5	10/02/2013	I have been on the Board of Friends of the Children at the Ky Methodist Home for Children and Youth for several years now.  Recently I was elected as Co-Presendnt of Friends of the Children.  I have been a supporter as long as I can remember.  I became involved because my mother had a wonderful experience at the Home before I was born.  She was visiting the home when one of the children engaged a conversation with her, it broke her heart to know a child had no family.  The child was thankful for the home.  My mother died of a heart attack in 2005 and one of the last things she related to me before she died in the hospital was retelling me the story of that visit many years ago.  Growing up a Methodist I have always supported the Methodist Home finically each fifth Sunday.  In the past several years I have become even more involved beyond just finical support.  I have witnessed first hand how wonderful the staff is and what a great job they all do.  The most impelling part is listening to the youth tell how the people at the Methodist Home has impacted them in such positive ways.  When they explain how  it has been like a life saver for them being at or have been at the facility I know beyond a shadow of a doubt  that I can not do enough to help in any possible.  I can not think of any where that I believe makes a difference in the youth lives more than the Ky Methodist Home in Versailles, Ky.

Nami Lexington Ky Inc	150643	1	/users/profile/200881	Marcie T.	Board Member	5	03/06/2013	NAMI Lexington has many projects underway in the community. From getting people together to decriminalize mental illness to making sure people with illness know they aren't alone, NAMI Lexington is stretching the spectrum of advocacy, education, family support, and peer support in ways no other organization has before.  I truly believe they do the best they can with the least amount of funding. Donations to this organization go directly to participants in their many programs, to materials for those programs, or to fuel innovative initiatives. They literally save lives every day; they're not just saving the lives of individuals with mental illness, but also those of family members, church family members, and community members.

It was a small group but it was a beginning for us to learn how to support my brother and take care of ourselves. It has been a long but successful road for personal healing.  I have had the opportunity to experience the dynamic growth of a small local NAMI support group to become a large compassionate and efficient  organization  offering more opportunities for support, education and advocacy than I ever imagined.   I have spent the last 22 years being blessed by NAMI Lexington to have been a family member, consumer, officer, board member, advocate and volunteer.   The personally difficult years are now behind me but I continue to witness and share in the joy of so many people whose needs are being met by NAMI Lexington.  I am so proud to be a part of such a successful non-profit orgaizatiion.  NAMI Lexington is an outstanding model for what a non-profit should be.

I have learned so much from so many wonderful people.  They bring the gift of theatre to our community and do an awesome job with classes, performances, art gallaries and more!  Schools from all over Kentucky venture to "PTK" for field trips that go along with what the students are learning in class.  Public Theatre of Kentucky is cornerstone for performing and visual arts for our region.  I am so glad they are there!

Rapha Ministries	90890		/users/profile/103815	rowady	Volunteer	5	06/15/2011	My neighbor started Rapha Ministries which is a free medical clinic for residents of Clark County, Kentucky.  I believe that everyone should have the ability to receive medical care when needed so have volunteered from the first day they have opened.  I also believe strongly that there are many people that have never been told or believe that God loves them and the ministry that is available at Rapha proves this and has helped many of our clients.
Rapha Ministries	90857		/users/profile/103774	catesandcompany	General Member of the Public	3	06/14/2011	My view of Ralpha: It"s a true asset to our local community providing outreach and meeting the health needs of our rural community.  It is through the volunteers and the compassion of those willing to serve that enables those who are less fortunate to survive with dignity through the healthcare and counseling Ralpha provides.  Many local citizens are unaware of this healthcare facility and my personal hope is that somehow Ralpha can encompass the community through this and other media resources.
Rapha Ministries	90745		/users/profile/103612	jhsapp	Volunteer	5	06/14/2011	For the past twenty three years I have lived and worked in the Winchester Community.   I have known Dr. Scott Baker and his wife, Stacy, since they arrived in our community to establish a family practice for medicine.  However, due to Scott's illness he had to cease his practice of medicine and this greatly distressed all of us who were his patients and friends.   Although Scott could no longer practice medicine, Scott and Stacy felt a sincere desire to help the citizens of Clark County who could not afford medical treatment.  This led to the establishment of the Rapha Clinic.  These two young individuals, though facing hardships of their own, were determined to establish a Christian based medical clinic where people could come to obtain medical treatment and Christian counseling.  After many years of planning and hard work, the Rapha Clinic opened their doors.   I have been a part of the volunteer staff of the clinic since the first patient was seem.  I transcribe the medical notes for the records of the Rapha Clinic.  The clinic is run by one paid individual and the remainder of the operation is dependent on volunteers.  I have typed the notes of the patients of the Rapha Clinic, and witnessed first hand the loving care given by the doctors and nurses, and the follow-up of medical problems by various other organizations in the community in relation to the Rapha Clinic.   I have recorded the patient care, how the doctor's treat the patients and the concerns of the staff.  These patients are not just names on a piece of paper, they are people with problems served by volunteers who truly want to help.  I have heard their testimonies and seen the results of good patient care.       I am proud to be a part of the Rapha Clinic Staff.

Parkinson Support Center of Kentuckiana Inc	147801	1	/users/profile/195559	bloomoh	Client Served	5	01/08/2013	When you first hear those words from your physician, "You have Parkinson's Disease",  it can be stunning! I know myself, that when I received "the word", all I heard for the rest of the visit was a dull buzzing sound in my ears and flashes of what my life would become shooting through my brain.Luckily, my wonderful wife was along for the diagnosis and she sprang into action almost immediately. She arranged for the two of us to meet with Adina at PSCKY, and it was such an informative and uplifting session that I agreed to attend the PD 101 session she was presenting. You cannot believe how prepared I left that session to fight the effects of PD, talk with my physician, medicate and exercise my way to a fuller life. Since those first sessions, we have participated in exercise classes, workshops on medications, and of course the yearly Symposium which puts just about everything a Parkinson's patient could or would need under one roof.  I am sure that there are larger and better funded non-profit organizations, but when it comes to patient programs, caring and helpful staff, providing useful resources for someone who suffers the ravages of Parkinson's disease, PSCKY cannot be topped. 
Parkinson Support Center of Kentuckiana Inc	124250		/users/profile/169078	bagel109	General Member of the Public	5	10/02/2012	PSCKY works with everyone, family members and the person who lives with this horrific disease. If you need support, interested in learning more about PD, or want to volunteer, I understand this is the only place to go in Kentucky or southern Indiana. They survive strictly on donations-no outside professional affiliation so every dollar that comes in focuses on people who live well with PD and to keeping the doors open.  If you have PD or a member of your family has it or even a friend, I can think of no better place to go for help than PSCKY. The only problem is getting the word out. I hope this helps!!
Parkinson Support Center of Kentuckiana Inc	46893	2	/users/profile/46617	pscky	Former staff	5	06/30/2010	There's something unique in receiving a diagnosis of a chronic illness, such as Parkinson's disease. In fact, PD is such a strange, complex and baffling disease that despite the many educational resources we can throw at it, each human's experience is so unique that the most common word I've heard to describe PD is "baffling."The Parkinson Support Center of Kentuckiana is in a class by itself. The informal motto "No one has to face Parkinson's alone" is bolstered by an incredible base of volunteers, staff and board members who uniquely understands *just* what those words mean. Facing grief, facing physical and sometimes cognitive impairment, facing conflicting information...PSCKY stands firm in ensuring that the person with PD (or someone who is a family member or friend) does not have to face that baffling road alone. The support groups, educational events, movement groups and information and personal counseling offered by PSCKY are extraordinary and infused with a personal concern, care and candor that bring light and hope to a diagnosis that can often be overwhelming.

My husband and I lost our kitty of 17 years to cancer jn March 2016, and I was just crushed.  We do not have children, so Noelle was truly our baby.  In August, my husband came across a picture of Sophie, a gorgeous 2 year old Tortie Siamese cat at Willow Creek.  He called about her, and we were instantly in love with her story.  The sanctuary is amazing, and Rebecca and volunteers are truly special.  Their genuine care for the well being of each animal is wonderful.  A volunteer drove her to us from Danville, KY to our home in WV.  Sophie is so special, and so is the Willowcreek Sanctuary.

Becky and the WCS volunteers are incredibly committed to the well-being and care of animals from the moment they meet, to their adoption day to their Forever Home, and throughout their entire lives! I live in Iowa now (yes, we adopted Rosie from Kentucky even with the distance!), and wish I were closer to WCS to support their work in a more consistent way. If you live or work nearby, please consider donating your time, your heart, or maybe even your home to the animals of WCS!

Thinking I was retiring, to travel and do things at home that I had always put off. God had other plans (The Mission Field). I was with Missions of Love for 2 years before I traveled to Haiti with Dr. Bob and Betty Johnson. From the moment that I stepped off the plane, I knew it would not be the last time I would visit Haiti. As secretary I already knew a lot about Jolivert , Haiti,( Clinque Jolivert), but to see the progress of the last 20 years + was amazing. At Jolivert there is something for everyone, whether you are medical or ministry or just like to help build and repair, God will use you in the right place, it could be as simple as holding a child while the nurse or doctor examine them. I would highly recommend Missions of Love for your first mission trip.Pat DuarteMissions of Love Inc.www.missionsoflove.org

We have watched TCA grow over the years and set the standards and raise the bar for improving the lives of Thoroughbred racehorses, ex-racehorses and the people who care for them. They have the love of the Thoroughbred and the people who work with them at the forefront of their charitable platform. As a grant recipient, I can say that they have helped Bright Futures Farm greatly improve the lives of many of the elder, retired Thoroughbreds in our sanctuary as well as several that needed special care before they could be considered adoptable.  "TCA" is a fantastic organization that works very hard for Thoroughbred horses, backstretch employees and rescue and rehabilitation programs such as ours.

When they got old ehough to be spayed/neutered I couldn't afford to have them taken care of at the vet's (I have other children to feed - the four legged ones).  I contacted Janie Robinson and she was wonderful about getting 3 girls taken care of one month and the other 2 the next month.  The ladies who got the animals ready to go were great!  I did let them clip my kittens ears as it was a little cheaper to go that route.  Ciipping the ear of each kitten didn't bother them at all and their recovery was excellent from their surgery.  I would highly recommend Spay a Stray if you can't afford a vet's bill to spay/neuter your animal.  Way too many animals are put to sleep in shelters.  Please be a responsible pet owner.  The ladies at Spay a Stray will help you.  They do a great service to our pets.

In addition, Lighthouse meets all 20/20 Better Business Bureau Charity Accountability Standards.  All our programs serve students at NO CHARGE! The Lighthouse Community Center, a 501 (c) (3) organization provides an after-school tutoring program for at-risk youth in the Newburg neighborhood of Louisville, KY. This program offers homework assistance four nights a week with special emphasis on Reading, and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math skills).   We also are focusing on the goals of the USDE for College and Career Readiness. Lighthouse has been selected as an Endorsed Learning Place by JCPS which incorporates Every 1 Reads program along with STEM learning curriculum as well as technology.  We have exceeded the Metro Louisville Out of School Time Quality Standards and were selected to serve on their pilot program for these standards. Lighthouse received the Making a Difference Award by JCPS, Metro United Way, and Metro Louisville for our work with the Every 1 Reads Program.  It has been proven that by the time a child reaches 3rd Grade, their reading score predicts whether or not they will drop out of high school.  Every 1 Reads focuses on these students to improve their grades, help them succeed in school, decreasing their chance for dropping out.  Our program is coordinated with each childs public school teacher to ensure help and remediation in their needed academic areas. During these evenings we also offer enrichment activities such as dance training, piano-keyboard-violin lessons, drama, art instruction, Karate, puppetry, photography, etc. The fifth evening and weekends are set aside for special events and field trips. Nearly 50% of the Newburg children live in single parent homes below the poverty level. (Currently Lighthouse enrolls 99 percent Jefferson County Public School Free/Reduced lunch students and 98 percent of our students live in a single parent home, foster care, or being raised by a grandparent).  Lighthouse focuses on working with the achievement  Gap kids.   This is a high crime area with drugs, gangs, vandalism, bullies, and shootings are an everyday occurrence. During each fiscal year, over 2,000 individuals released from the Metro Department of Corrections return to Newburg to reside. Consequently, the neighborhood where Lighthouse resides is full of horror.  Lighthouse offers refuge from this fright while educating and instilling a sense of pride and self worth into our students.
Leadership Kentucky Foundation Inc	109731		/users/profile/149490	Teresa Hail	Board Member	5	04/12/2012	Since 1984, Leadership Kentucky has assembled diverse groups of professionals at various locations across the Commonwealth for the purpose of discussing major issues facing the state.  Through these discussions and the network built by this assembly, those involved become informed and prepared to take ideas back to their communities and places of work.   As a result, businesses and communities benefit individually and the Commonwealth benefits as a whole.  I believe the Leadership Kentucky program is an excellent investment in Kentuckys future.   As a graduate and board member, I give this program my highest endorsement.  
Leadership Kentucky Foundation Inc	104738		/users/profile/140515	LauraLeigh Goins	Donor	5	01/27/2012	The Leadership Kentucky Foundation provides an excellent opportunity for our organization, the Kentucky Retail Federation, to reach an audience of emerging and existing leaders from throughout the Commonwealth. As a graduate, I can personally attest to the quality of the education and development opportunities available to participants. Even today, years later, I find myself calling on my Leadership Kentucky classmates and connections for both professional and personal purposes. I'm honored and proud to support Leadership Kentucky.
Ashland Hospital Corporation	192403		/users/profile/251213	big_Jim	Client Served	2	01/10/2014	This hospital for the last 4 years between oct and dec every year laid off 5% of the work force.  and as always the employees with a more than a few years of experience (like 7-12 years) are the one let go. Then a month later here they are advertising for more people and how great of a place it is to work. Of  course the new people are always paid less and every year the administration gets more money for this yearly stunt. so now the over all payroll is VERY top heavy.  At some point patients will not come here like they did in the past.   a month ago the president has stepped down or retired?.   In time we will see if all of the blood sucking fleas have left the dog. 
Ashland Hospital Corporation	115178	1	/users/profile/156897	david morse	General Member of the Public	3	06/14/2012	This purely public charity has the TVs locked on political channel FOX NEWS and will not permit the channel to be changed to a health or cartoon channel. I asked to have it changed & was told because they were so concerned over children seeing inappropriate programs on all the cartoon channels they could not change the channel. It warmed my heart to learn how concerned they were about insuring the viewers were indocrinated to their political views and not exposing children to the lewd cartoon channels. Can purely public charities engage in partisan political action like this?

COMMUNITY ARTS CENTER INC	128941		/users/profile/174242	steve.hoffman10	Board Member	5	10/25/2012	The Community Arts Center provides an abundance of arts programming to its members within Boyle County and beyond.  The Center provides excellent rotating visual exhibitions that feature local, regional and national artists.  A themed blockbuster event is also developed annually that integrates the arts, sciences and humanities.  There are many rooms where independent instructors provide individual and group instruction from dance to music to visual arts.  The Center also has a very popular program, Starry Night Studio, where each month people register for a single class led by an artist to paint either a classic or new work (selected in advance).  I brought my entire staff for a private class last year for the holidays and we had an amazing time together doing something fun.  While the painting was the same, each of our interpretations reminded us as co-workers that we all have a common goal but see and do things differently.  Staff instantly wanted to return as the holiday staff gathering the next year.  What a great way to spend time together, be creative and everyone take home a piece of art.
COMMUNITY ARTS CENTER INC	128706		/users/profile/173923	Sternballerina	Volunteer	5	10/25/2012	I volunteered for the Community Arts Center during their spring exhibit in 2011 called All Aboard! which was an exhibit for children and families all about trains. I got to be part of their live storytelling exhibit, which featured various hoboes and their stories. I was given training by the program director, Brandon Long, about the basic facts that should be relayed in each presentation, but was given creative license with my costume, name, and particular brand of storytelling. Each week, I went into the basement of the Arts Center and sat around a fake fire in a dark room, telling hobo tall-tales and sharing secrets about the hobo code and culture with children and adults. It was an amazing experience to see children learning before my very eyes! I had a great time and learned about hobos in the process--the Arts Center does great work year-round, and their blockbuster exhibits each spring are no exception.

Boone County Pee-Wee Football Boosters Club Inc	310719	1	/users/profile/402061	Tracy119	Volunteer	1	10/14/2016	This league is a joke! I have been a paying parent for the last 2 years and the favoritism and just lack of respect for other coaches, players, parents and teams is disgusting. There are a few coaches that are just expected to win, regardless of the teams actual record. Rules change mid sentence, if need be, to accommodate certain coaches and league officials. Right now, teams are being cheated out of their hard work just so certain teams can play each other in the Super Bowl. It is getting to the point to where these elected officials do not even care who knows...the league President just said "don't vote me back next year". Cheating is ok with this group of guys and the kids lose out in the end. 
Boone County Pee-Wee Football Boosters Club Inc	257784	1	/users/profile/346253	ConcernedParent1974	Volunteer	1	09/16/2015	First, as a parent we are made to buy merchandise with "Boone County Pee-Wee Football LEAGUE"...NOT Boosters Club, Inc?  It took me a while to find it because of that reason.My family has been volunteering our time to the BCPFL for over 9 years.  My husband was volunteering his time even before we had children involved in the league.  He wanted to get into the league so that when it was time for our kids to play, he would be in a position to coach him.Finally, by God's grace, the Head Coach position became open.  In the past, a vote has not been necessary for a coach to be moved up to the Head Coach's position.  But, in my Husbands case, the said a vote was necessary.  Why?  My husband is only 1 of 3 African American Coaches in a league of over 23 Teams.  In the past there have been other African American Coaches that have asked for a team and have been turned down.This past Saturday, September 05, 2015, the league released my Husband in the Middle of the Football Season.  Never in the history of the league has a coach been let go in mid season.As a family we wanted to know why.  We were told many "little" reasons, but nothing that any other coach doesn't deal with.  As a mother of 2 children in the league I felt betrayed and disrespected.  They didn't give consideration for the time and love we have put into that league as volunteers.As a paying parent, there have been times when I have worked the concession stand and have witnessed the President's family come into the area and take what ever they want, as many times as they please.  I would think that this activity is against all non-profit rules.  It is not there field to have for personal use.For the past 3-4 years that have been MULTIPLE accusations stated by League Officials that "Someone" is/was stealing money.  This is proved how?  The officials can say everyone is stealing so they can keep the money to themselves.  I believe they should go through a IRS Tax Audit.  For some reason they were up for an audit and it got cancelled?Also, on the Tax form for this organization only has 4 Officers listed on the tax form, yet when they make "Executive Board Decisions" there are at least double that amount of "friends" at the table.  Why, and is this legal?This "Boosters Club" is a money making machine but if you see the Form 990, you wouldn't be able to tell.  Just take a glance and you will notice all the things this Boosters Club did not want to disclose in the forms.
Orphan Care Alliance	199201		/users/profile/260100	Bruce Z.	Board Member	5	04/29/2014	I am very appreciative for the H3 conference (Hope, Help, Heal) that was hosted the fall of 2013. It was very helpful with understanding special parenting issues and skills that are often associated with adoption. I am very pleased that OCA will be offering this conference again this fall. With these type of events being offered free to the community many more families will be blessed in the coming years.
Orphan Care Alliance	199179		/users/profile/260073	karen_b	Volunteer	5	04/29/2014	I first encountered Orphan Care Alliance (OCA) after attending an adoption/foster care seminar in Louisville, KY. The seminar was helpful, informative and well done.  Since then I have served as a seminar speaker and now as a hub coordinator for a new Lexington area hub of this nonprofit.  In addition to partnering with churches and engaging volunteers, the organization has done the hard work of starting a Safe Families for Children program in Kentucky - an awesome ministry that serves families in crisis and prevents children from entering foster care.  They are supportive of and have a good working relationship with state foster care system workers, and aim to work in partnership (not competition) with area churches, businesses and individuals.  Their life coaching ministry reaches older foster youth who often age out without supportive adults in their lives and their family support and advocacy programs encourage people to consider adoption and foster care, and then OCA supports them along the way. I would highly recommend supporting the work of OCA!

Their current goal is to expand to Eastern Kentucky by 2015. Out of all it's listeners 78% of them are over age 65 and 75% of those listeners make incomes less than 32,000 a year. They provide a service to the community and operate  by utilizing over 200 volunteers in a year who donate over 8,300 hours of their time! Radio Eye has been in operation since 1990 and have accumulated over 23 years of community service. If this is not a great non-profit; then I don't know what one is.

For the past three years, I have served as an on-air reader of books, magazine articles, newspapers, health reports, and even grocery store ads! I also act as their computer repair person, go-to man for hard-to-find replacement parts for our studios, furniture mover, and, yes, even envelope stuffer! I have also donated money and stationery supplies! I have worked harder at this job than in some in my own profession! I have enjoyed every minute of it, and, after having heard from a few of our listeners, I know that I am helping others with just my voice! Sometimes, the best jobs are the ones that don't pay anything at all, yet give so much to the community! I am very happy with my experience with CKRE, and hope to continue it for years to come!

The shows are affordable, but the greatest value is the work it does to introduce theatre to young audiences and energize that next generation of art consumers.   Through visionary leadership Stage One Family Theatre has transformed its business model to attract more community support and provide FREE TICKETS to classrooms of students (K-6th grade) in a 21 county area.   I've served on the board in a variety of capacities for the last 6 years.  It's an organization that continues to evolve with the times and make me proud. 
Stage One The Louisville Childrens Theatre Inc	121770		/users/profile/165687	Nicole32	Board Member	5	08/31/2012	My family has been enjoying StageOne productions for years. The shows are high-quality, professional performances at ticket prices that are affordable to the average family of four. Of course, those two points alone aren't enough to encourage me to go to the theater-- I love StageOne plays because they present performances that are educational, engaging, and entertaining to children and adults alike. In addition to educating and entertaining my family, I know that my patronage of StageOne supports the Play it Forward program, which allows school children to see live theater performances at no ticket charge. There are so many students in my son's school who would never have the opportunity to see a live play if not for the Play it Forward program; I love visiting his class after they have been to the theater. You can really see how the experience changes their lives.

They rescued and nurtured my future best friend Chester, and for that one kindness alone, I owe them everything. I took one look at Chester on a picture on their website, and he connected a message with me more powerful that anything I've ever read in any literature or heard in human speech.  And when I met him at his temporary home, all the guardians there poured  out of their offices and openly wept at Chester's departure, an unforgetable moment in my life. I was overwhelmed by the depth of love I witnessed there for Chester, and when I visited the other rescues,  I noticed that the animals all carried a radiance about them, no doubt in my mind, due to the love their guardians have fastend on every creature.  I now pray every day the world would follow the example of the mission fo the KY Humane Society. - Reiner Goldring

Water With Blessings	138502	1	/users/profile/184569	aclemay	Board Member	5	11/13/2012	Water with Blessings is a non-denominational faith based ministry established for the purpose of providing in-home safe and clean drinking water to women and children in developing nation communities. Women are trained as "water teachers" who educate other users and then distribute simple, effective, and long lasting sub-micron efficiency filtration units that can provide twenty or more gallons of safe drinking water per hour.  Ministry women share the life sustaining clean water with at least two other families in their own communities, thereby expanding the ministry  impact and building community.  Women are empowered as the educated responsible exclusive owners of the systems and become better able to care for their family and community.  Mothers of small children understand the value of clean water and have proven to be very responsible and committed to helping others become a part of this ministry.  Water With Blessings works with churches, missions teams, and others seeking  simple long lasting solutions to drinking water needs around the world.  Thank You.

Coalition for The Homeless	23402	1	/users/profile/24496	sward	Professional with expertise in this field	4	12/04/2009	The Coalition for the Homeless has been working with local shelters and other agencies in the Louisville area since 1986, when the community saw a need to better address the issues of homelessness.  As an advocacy/education agency, The Coalition is able to build collaborations between key partners to establish programming that has a wide impact across Kentucky.  While the shelters and other service providers must address daily crises, The Coalition is able to bring together groups of people to plan long-term initiatives such as our 10-year Blueprint to alleviate and end chronic homelessness and our Cost of Homelessness Study.  We also directly assist people who are looking for information about a place to stay, or how to get housing, food, clothing, etc.  We receive hundreds of calls from people needing help and numerous walk-ins from people living on the streets looking for blankets, clothing or some other type of assistance.  The Coalition serves as a voice for disenfranchised individuals and for those who have been impacted by the recent economic downturn which has led to high rates of unemployment and foreclosure.  This rising population needs to be heard at every level of government and in the business community.
Refuge Ridge Inc	97380	1	/users/profile/114261	Riley58	Volunteer	5	09/12/2011	Refuge Ridge is truly a refuge for both the animals that live there and the children that go to the adventure based camps there. Many of the children come from circumstances including domestic violence and drug abuse in the homes. At the camps they learn about team work and making good decisions. Their work with some of the animal rescues provides humane education aimed at breaking generational cycles of both animal and child abuse. I cannot recommend this organziationally highly enough. Through the generosity of the Sherman's next May there will be a wonderful new learning center for much of the activity to take place in. Please visit their refugeridge.org web site.

Hildegard House	286810	1	/users/profile/376880	Carl_L	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	Dying with DignityThe initial compelling factor in my becoming involved in this particular charity was the location.  I grew up in the Butchertown neighborhood of Louisville where I attended St. Joseph School.  The parish and the Butchertown neighborhood have always been important to me.  I was involved in several projects in that area in the past. Recently I was asked to attend a planning meeting at a facility known as Hildegard House.  The mission of Hildegard House is stated on their web page as:       Louisvilles First and Only Comfort Care HomeWe provide a final place, a loving place, they can call home. A place where compassion, companionship, peace and dignity await them in their final stage of life.We believe life is a gift from God. Such a gift makes all life precious even to the end. Our goal is to provide hospitality to people at the end of life who have no loved ones or home.Having been interested in the plight of homeless veterans everywhere, it occurred to me that many veterans were likely to be in this group of homeless.After meeting Karen Cassidy, the director of Hildegard House, it was obvious that she not only had a wonderful concept but also the vision, experience, and drive to make this a reality.The final and most compelling factor for becoming involved with both time and treasure in the Hildegard House charity was an incident that my wife and I had experienced many years earlier.  The phrase death with dignity brought to mind an acquaintance who lived alone and died alone.  He had been dead for at least three days when he was found in his apartment with his dogs.  Being animals, they had begun to use their loyal owner as food.  If there is an antithesis to dying with dignity, this is it. It was time to help do all I could to make this charity a success!Hildegard House will be housed in the former convent of St. Joseph Church.  It is a perfect structure for this endeavor, but renovations are necessary to make it work for its new purpose.  Many volunteers have been helping in various ways to prepare the house for its grand opening in January, 2016, and it is beginning to take shape, but there is much more work to be done, and much more money needed for renovations as well as operating expenses.All of the above factors have compelled me to get involved in Hildegard House.  We look forward to our opening in January 2016! 
Blue Grass Farms Charities Inc	194830		/users/profile/254632	thoroughbredchick	Client Served	5	02/25/2014	My manager referred me to this organization when I was injured from a car accident.  I felt funny going somewhere for help, but as soon as I talked with the director I was at ease.  She helped me see that this was not like welfare, but just good people helping others when they're having a hard time.  They paid my electric bill, gave me food and even laundry detergent.  The director also helped me with some of my medicine costs.  I love this organization and I hope to someday be able to give back.

SARAHS PLACE WOMENS RESOURCE CENTER INC	162672		/users/profile/215902	Anastasia L	Client Served	5	07/15/2013	"I am from a family with limited means. I was raised by a single mother. Growing up, I often didn't get to participate in all of the extras because it just wasn't in the budget. My mother worked, but because of her lack of education, she never qualified for a higher paying job. Now I am a single mother and I worried that the cycle would repeat itself for my children. I saw an article in the paper and applied for the Certified Nurse Aide class at Sarah's Place . I  even qualified for a scholarship. I was ecstatic! The idea of getting a career in the  growing field of health care sounded just like the thing needed to break the cycle. I can't begin to express how truly grateful I am for this opportunity  for me and my two wonderful daughters"  Anastasia

Children's Home of Northern Kentucky	297398		/users/profile/388189	A_Chaser0808	Donor	5	07/20/2016	Children's Home of Northern Kentucky has a long-running history of providing critically needed services to children across the state, but gone are the days of it simply operating as an orphanage. I had helped with a holiday project to benefit the Home many years ago, but it had fallen off my radar until just recently. The programs they offer now are some of the most sophisticated in the Commonwealth, and most certainly the NKY/Greater Cincinnati area. Under the leadership of the agency's current CEO, everything has transformed for the better - the programs, the staff, even the physical buildings (both inside and out). I'm proud to support CHNK as a donor; I know my money is being put to great use to treat kids in need, and I can't wait to see how the Home continues to transform itself and our community!

Forest Park Community Church Inc	96704		/users/profile/112953	Terry S.	Volunteer	5	08/27/2011	We have been doing mission trips since 1999, setting up clinics in local churches and prisons in Central America for a week at a time. We will commonly take $50,000 to $100,000 worth of medicines with us each trip along with 100's of pairs of glasses, Doctors Nurses, a pharmacist and an optometrist. We always hire a local physician to work in the clinic with us so patients that require ongoing treatment have a resource for treatment once we leave. For the week before we arrive a local church will give out tickets in their community to be seen in the clinic. This assures we will be able to treat the maximum number of patients (although we have never turned anyone away). It is not uncommon for us to treat 1000 people during the clinic. While patients are waiting to be seen, others entertain the children, present the gospel to the adults and are introduced to local pastors working with us. Our host missionaries operate a feeding center and have access to school supplies, toiletries and other staples useful to many of the very poor. When we leave, any supplies and medicines left over are left with the local doctor to help with ongoing needs. Consider signing up to go with us as well as making a donation. We need help of all kinds and it will be a great blessing to you as well. Visit our website and drop us an email. We'd love to talk to you.

HUMANE SOCIETY OF MARSHALL COUNTY INC	137874		/users/profile/183894	So Greatful	Client Served	5	11/13/2012	The Benton Marshall County Humane Society is one of the best shelters in this area. This year I had an issue with a dog of mine and needed to find a home for her. She was a sweety, but my husband had decided that it was time for her to go. I called the friendly people at the Benton Marshall County Humane Society and they said to bring her over right away and that they would find her a home. I felt ok about doing this because I knew how much time they spend in promoting and trying diligently to find homes for all of their fur babies. For the next week of so I watched the site to see if they would post a picture of my dog and her new owner. Sure enough in just a few short days...the picture was posted and she now has a Furever home!!!  Thank you again for all your help!!! 
Big Brothers Big Sisters Of Kentuckiana Inc	52055	1	/users/profile/52860	richard21	Volunteer	5	09/09/2010	Most of the time, I have been in the site-based match.  That means I spend about one hour per week with my little brother at his school throughout the school year. I enjoy every aspect of the program and feel that my mentoring and friendship provides benefit to each of the three littles with whom I have been matched.  This time affords littles the opportunity to feel special (e.g. we read books, play board games and sports together).  In addition my little brother has a one on one opportunity to discuss school, friends and other topics.  Each visit provides an opportunity to bolster self esteem, discuss the right way to play with friends and/or nuture an interest in reading, etc.  I find the experience to be very rewarding and anticipate being a big brother and donor for years to come.  Finally, I have also participated in the traditional program which generally entail visiting with my little once a month for several hours.  There are lots of fun things to do like riding bikes, visiting the zoo, children's museum or going to the movies.

South Eastern Water Assoc Inc	202177		/users/profile/263756	tammybastin72	Client Served	1	06/07/2014	This water district is a disgrace to the state of Kentucky. My parents who are elderly applied for water when this grant was first written and approved in 2001. They paid $700.00 for their meter to be installed. They were then told they had to pay for two meters for one residence. So they paid anothe $700.00 . The pipes were laid alone the road to their home. Then suddently taken up and hauled away. That was 13 years ago. The water districk has not put in water nor have they reurned the $1,400.00 dollars they took from my parents. Thjis issue is indirectly related to our state representive which is related to my family and holds a personal grudge against my father. So we have had to purchase drinking water for my parents for years becasue the water they have is surface water and dangerous for consumption.

What a difference between the two organisations - from the moment I walked in it was noticeably different,  the humble office walls were adorned with snapshots of 'their' children, the computers old, desks make do - it was obvious after my month there that the focus and resources was on the kids.  When it came to going out and working in the orphanages and health centers that Orphan Voice both funds & runs I couldn't help  be moved by the professionalism, humbleness and genuineness of all those who OV employ. May I encourage you to help OV in whatever way you can whether it be financially, materially or personally as they continue to  serve the poor, marginalized & disabled children of central Viet Nam For further details on my experiences with OV feel free to contact me directly at chris@sixsparrows.com Orphan Voice - Making a world of difference

Kidney Health Alliance of Kentcky Inc	43530	7	/users/profile/44403	schultzleona	Board Member	5	06/10/2010	During a recent kidney screening (dipping urine) a community member came and had her urine tested she explained that she felt fine but what the heck it was free. Since our test is not a diagnosis and we are not physicians  I explained to her the results of her test, which were seriously abnormal, and gently advised her to take the results to her physician when she had a chance within the next week or so trying to stress the urgency without causing her stress or fear. She did this within the week and our office received a letter from her thanking us it turned out that this woman who had no symptoms of kidney disease had cancer of the kidney and thanks to the test that we performed she was encouraged to see her family physician and was diagnosed early enough to save her life. She is currenlty receiving treatment. I have had so many wonderfully rewarding encounters while working with KHAKY. It is a wonderful organization and is the last organization that really concentrates on workign directly with the patient and their families. I want the word to get out about KHAKY we are a small organization but we serve a large area in Kentucky.

Hopkins County Humane Society Inc	128315	1	/users/profile/173466	Melissa91	Client Served	2	10/24/2012	I have to say I was very disappointed with the Hopkins County Humane Society. I recently adopted a mixed dog who had been shot in the leg when she was picked up. The leg was healed up just fine, but when I picked her up I was shocked to find out that the only other care she had gotten was a rabies vaccine, despite being there over 3 months (according to the petfinder ad). They also told me she was 7 months old, when both the vet records I got from them AND a personal vet at my home told me she was a year and a half and therefore should have been spayed when she got in. They only gave me 50 dollars toward a spay that was obviously much more expensive, and if she received any medical care it was horribly done--she had no vaccines, no heartworm prevention, and she was laced with hookworm. If I hadn't adopted her, she probably would have starved to death due to the worms since she wasn't eating. She is a FANTASTIC dog and I feel extremely blessed that I was able to save her from such a place. I wouldn't recommend donating to this organization since they aren't willing to spring for the necessary care neededfor their dogs, but I'd encourage those who are willing to put in a bit of money to help an injured, starving animal to adopt from there and get them out!!

Hospice Of Lake Cumberland Inc	202116		/users/profile/263756	tammybastin72	Professional with expertise in this field	1	06/07/2014	Be aware of making private donations to a "non profit" agency such as this. On the fiancials it is listed that the board of directors work from 2-4 hours pre week. Please ask yourself how much they are paid to be a board member. And the salary listed for the executive director. Also remember that only those who make over $100.000 a year is required to be listed. Sometimes non profit is absolutely profit depending on who is making the profit form a organization such as this. Also it was my experience with this Hospice that there is no patient fund to help purchase items needed for patienst. I do succeed that a organization such as this is a neccesssity for many however be very casusious when donating money that you specifically earmark what you wish your donatiopn to be used for. it may go to increase a already over paid director's salary.

Another thing that makes the Nest so unique is the passion to serve their clients that is evident among the staff. I hope to stay involved at the Nest. It was a great experience!

Their work was cutting edge.  They searched through many European archives and libraries to rescue some very rare scores and bring them to the light of day.  ARS Femina has made some wonderful editions and collections of music by women composers available to the world.  Without their diligent research, editions, performances and recordings, this precious music would still be hidden and locked away.  As the Artistic Director and Conductor of the Four Seasons Orchestra of Scottsdale, Arizona, I would like to thank ARS Femina for their efforts on behalf of all women composers, and on behalf of all musicians.  I have performed many of their editions with orchestra and as a viola soloist.  Each piece is a beautiful treasure that needs to be enjoyed by all who love music.

Pioneer School Of Drama Pioneer Playhouse	221148		/users/profile/284860	AKentuckyPlaywright	Professional with expertise in this field	4	10/09/2014	I am a playwright and an advocate for Kentucky playwrights. I have been involved in theatre in some way, as an actor, director, producer, stage, manager, props, etc. for 48 years. My first trip to Danville and Pioneer Playhouse was back in the late 1960s. Most recently, I attended two shows this past, 2014 summer season. The quality of the shows is always high. The acting almost always superb. Yet, what I go for is to see the production of new plays by Kentucky playwrights. Those I always enjoy. Since Kentucky Repertory Theatre closed a couple of years ago venues for Kentucky playwrights have constricted. There are still new plays being produced. But Pioneer Playhouse's Kentucky Voices series is important. It is not that other venues don't do a good job (they almost always do), but that they do not have the visibility of Pioneer Playhouse. Pioneer Playhouse nearly always sells out every night of its shows. Over the years I have been to shows virtually every night that they have been producing. Sometimes a Wednesday or Thursday or Sunday as well as (for me) the better nights of Friday and Saturday. I don't recall being to a show on a weekend that didn't exceed 85% full; earlier in the week shows seem to always exceed 70%. That is remarkable for an outdoor theatre. They have moved into other projects-- at the nearby prison and providing programs for grade school and high school students as well.  But what brings me back year in and year out is the new plays by Kentucky playwrights. And those they get right: time after time.
New Beginnings Therapeutic Riding Inc	93359	2	/users/profile/107323	Pam Pannell	Volunteer	5	07/03/2011	New Beginnings Therapeutic Riding, Inc. is an amazing program. Some think of it as a pony ride for people with didabilities, but it is so much more. This organization is giving individuales the opportunity to develop a sense of pride and gaining confidence as they learn the fundamentals of riding. All the while they are stretching and working muscles and parts of their bodied that traditional therapy seem to miss.  As for the participants that have mental or behavioral disabilities, they are learning to communicate in a whole new way. They, too are finding that working with the horse they are developing a new sense of convidence and pride like nothing they have ever experienced before. I have witnessed first words ever spoken by a student while on horseback. I have seen walls come tumbling down as a deviant teen learns to trust and open her heart as she learns to care for her horse. I have watched a disengaged autistic smile the biggest smile I have ever seen when he realizes he just made the horse walk!! All of these milestones were made possible because of a group of people giving from their heart. Along with the greatest animals ever, the powerful, but gentle horse.

Bluegrass Youth Ballet Inc	86687		/users/profile/97130	kfeeback	Volunteer	5	04/21/2011	My daughter joined Bluegrass Youth Ballet at the age of 5.  Her first performance was for The Nutcracker just four months after beginning ballet.  I was so nervous.  What if she falls off the stage?  What if she forgets?  What if she won't go onstage?  Maybe she needs more time.  But as I was watching the first rehearsal, I realized the instructor had captured the heart of my little girl and the hearts of fifteen other little girls in the class.  They were focused on her every word, they simply absorbed every bit of what she was saying.  After rehearsal, the children stormed out of the studio door shouting to their parents "Did you see me!".  It was just a rehearsal but it was exhilarating!  The show was beautiful and by the end of the evening all of my fears had been washed away with my tears of joy.  Its been four years and I still cry after every performance, my daughter and her fifteen friends still storm the door after rehearsal (and class).  The  good will and gentle nature of Bluegrass  Youth Ballet and their instructors has rubbed off on each of the 200 students they teach and each of the parents volunteers who make this the Greatest NonProfit!

Buckland Equine Rescue Inc	235839		/users/profile/319560	kimlibell5	Volunteer	1	12/23/2014	    Rate Buckland Equine Rescue ZERO. OUR HORSE WAS POISONED AND DIED AT THIS RESCUE. EIGHT OTHERS WERE POISONED THE NEXT DAY Background:  We boarded our horse here for four years.  Over the past summer, 2014, the owner of Buckland stopped taking care of the horses.  We would visit our horse out in the field where he grazed and didn't go to the barn from may through July.  We live far from the farm so we only got to visit our horse once a week to twice a month.  This was a full-care facility. There is now a CRIMINAL case against Buckland. The owner of Buckland texted me that my horse died.  AFTER the horse died.  He said that my horse died quickly and peacefully of cancer. Cancer?  My horse had just had a full physical 5 weeks earlier and was somewhat underweight but otherwise healthy.  Then we talked to the vet who was present when our horse died and she said that our horse was in extreme pain, very agitated, and shaking.  He collapsed to the ground dying in pain.   The next day we went to pick up our horse's body and 8 other horses were very ill with the same symptoms our horse had before he died.  They were in agonizing pain.  Three other veterinarians and the sheriff had already been to the farm earlier and were trying to treat the horses.  Our vet said that the horses, including our horse, had all ingested a toxin.  As of now 8 days later they know the horses were poisoned.  Our horse died but the others are still alive, but ill. We had told the owner that we were going to move our horse five weeks earlier.  We had a new place already and a week later we had a trailer to pick our horse up and the owner of Buckland refused to allow us on the property.  He told us if we came on the property he would have the sheriff arrest us.  He claimed he had papers stating that our horse was HIS horse and we couldn't prove otherwise.   We were shocked.  We never got to see our horse alive again.     What transpired before our horse was poisoned to death at Buckland Horse rescue: When we went up to the barn in late July, we were horrified at the conditions of the stalls, feed room, and entryway.  Three of the stalls were flooded with water.  All the stalls were full of manure one foot deep.  The feed buckets for the horses had cobwebs in them; there were cobwebs between the rails on the stall gates; there were cobwebs from the stall gates to the wooden doorway.  Clearly the horses had not been fed nor had the stall gates been open for a long time.   We went into the feed room which was so full of trash and filth we could barely get into it.  There were cobwebs connecting the feed barrels to each other which meant that the feed barrels had not been open for a long time.  When we opened them all four were almost completely empty.  One barrel had just enough pellets to cover the bottom of the barrel.  There was one bag of  open feed that was molded.   We were very calm with the owner and encouraged him to get the barn ready for winter.  We paid to have the roof repaired at the back of the barn where water was coming in.  We hired a man with a bobcat to scrape manure out of the barn (the back part was open so he could do that).  We hired a crew to shovel out manure from the stalls.  In one stall the manure/mud mixture was over two feet deep.  We cleaned the feed room and found all kinds of horse supplements on the floor under floor boards, in filthy black dirt.  We reorganized everything.   Rather than be grateful, all of us who helped him clean up the barn noticed that he got very hostile.  He accused us of attacking him.  His wife did the same.  They did NOT want us to move our horse claiming that the owner had sat up all night with our horse when he was very ill.  That was FOUR years ago.  WE were up all night with our horse that night too. But according to the wife, we had no right to move our horse to another farm " because no one would take care of him as well as her husband would."  She accused me of being very angry and of attacking her when I said that we were trying to get the barn ready for winter so that the horses would have shelter and food.  She implied that the owner was doing an excellent job of taking care of those horses and he was under no obligation to feed the horses or take care of them any more than he was doing right now.  She claimed that we should not move him because her husband sat up all night one night four years ago with our horse and no one else would ever do that.  She forgot to say that we had sat up all night with our horse that same night.  She insinuated that one night four years ago made up for not feeding our horse now. The wife and the owner both told us that our horse was the "alpha" and if we moved him from their farm, he would get severely depressed and die of depression.   Summary:  We told the owner of Buckland that we were going to move our horse.  When we brought the trailer to move him, the owner would not allow us on the property claiming our horse was his.  WE NEVER SAW HIM ALIVE AGAIN.  Now four weeks later our HORSE WAS POISONED TO DEATH AND DIED IN EXCRUCIATING PAIN.

Kebirgo Community Resource Centre	53418	1	/users/profile/54555	morara	Volunteer	5	09/27/2010	Currently KCRC is in the process of doing many things for the community, including becoming a microfinance institution. Robert Kiriago Obanyi is passionate about helping the community, and has made it his lifes work. Having grown up in the area and being educated there and in Nairobi, few people know the people as well as he, or have the ability to help them like he does.I worked for the Kebirigo Community Resource Center (KCRC) under the coordinator Robert Obanyi during the summer of 2008. The goals of KCRC are broad in scope and luckily I was able to contribute to some of its missions. Our primary goal there was to establish ourselves with as many of the hundreds of Community Based Organizations (CBOs) in the Nyamira District as we were able to. The ultimate intention is to have a complete network at our disposal so we can find ways to connect groups together and find larger sources of help for groups with similar purposes (e.g. find donors in HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment foundation for the many groups who want to spread such help through their communities). The network was extremely limited when I got there, and so most of my work consisted of arranging appointments with our groups and trying to attract new groups. I would go to visit the CBOs with Robert and/or another helper we had, viz. Aloys Mecha, who helped me communicate with the CBOs that had English difficulties. We interviewed them, tried to find the problems they were having, and offered any advice we could. After each group I transcribed data from the meeting onto a database for future reference. Many are interested in keeping zero grazing animals and beekeeping, so we eventually want to hold information seminars on those things. I compiled lists of interested groups and Robert is in the process of organizing those seminars. I also helped organize books donated to us by various organizations and incorporate them into our small but growing library, which I then created a simple digital catalogue for. I educated a Form 4 graduate how to use a computer, and in return he kept our physical premises open while I was busy with other things. I went to two schools and gave talks on KCRC, HIV/AIDS, Alcohol Abuse (which is a rampant problem among Kisii men), and on how to study in the United States. Obviously the students took most interest in the latter topic, and I did a lot of research on international applicants and financial aid. I also began relationships between several local banks and KCRC so they might be able to more easily give micro loans to our CBOs. I believe KCRC is capable of great things, and look forward to continuing to help it in any way I can.

Joshuas Dream Foundation Inc	93665		/users/profile/107883	Jacqueline	Client Served	5	07/09/2011	My name is Jacqueline Hare (Formally known as Jacqueline Hutton) and both my husband at the time and I were residents at Joshua's Dream Foundation. We encountered two times the heart ache of drug addiction, because we were both at rock bottom. We were addicted to oxycontin, a prescribed pain killer. Without even realizing what had happened, that small pill took everything that we had worked for. Our home, cars, and most importantly our daughter. We checked into Joshua's Dream the same day and left on the same day as well. I am not able to say that our marriage lasted because of the situation that I was ready to change my life and he was not, but I made a bold move and divorced my husband whom I married at 15 years old. He is currently in jail, where he has been for over five years now due to his addiction.  Me, I am almost finished with College, graduating with my nursing degree. I have married again, and have since had a son with my new husband. I am also currently going to court to gain custody of my daughter back. I am proud to say that I am drug free and Joshua's Dream Foundation had a huge hand in that. I want to thank everyone that had a part in their services. Although tough at times, I made it 8 monthes at the facility and would love to visit again sometime if it is still open. I was one of those residents that went to the courthouse for funding, when it made the front page on the local newspaper. I still back up the words I spoke then. With God in your life all things are possible. Thank you everyone who ever prayed one time for me. It was greatly appreciated.  Oh and by the way I would not be able to say that I am about to graduate College without Joshua's Dream. It was there that I earned my GED and even got to graduate at the local Community College where Donnie and Jeff arranged for me to go. THANK YOU, I CAN BREATH AGAIN.

Arts Alive Ky Inc	247676		/users/profile/335268	HALEYA	Client Served	5	07/07/2015	My daughter participated in this summer. It will be some of her best memories! She enjoyed the group of kids she got to know, grew in her acting skills and as a Christian. This is a great organization with dedicated leaders.
Prater Creek Food Pantry Inc	286772		/users/profile/376842	Joanna_B2	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	A Life of Satisfactionhttps://www.facebook.com/pratercreekfoodpantry/?ref=aymt_homepage_panel Imagine this, you are volunteering at a food bank and an elderly woman slowly approaches you with tears running down her cheeks. She gives you the gentlest hug and says, 'Thank you so much, if it weren't for the food pantry, the two grandchildren I am raising and I, would have only had crackers to eat for dinner tonight.'      Hearing this lady's story inspired my family, friends, and I to open a local food pantry in a small town in Eastern Kentucky. It took a lot of work, and a lot of waiting but after so many months (18 to be exact), we were approved and we were so happy!  Every month, the number of families we feed grows. It feels so good to be able to send food home to families in need knowing that they won't have to struggle as hard to make ends meet, and knowing their hunger pains are satisfied.      A lot of people say isn't that a waste of time? It's not worth the effort. To me, it's not about how much time or effort is put into it.  What does matter is that I am helping people in need, they are going home to be able to put food on their table, and every second and every drop of sweat is worth having that satisfaction of knowing people are being taken care of.      I gave my heart to this organization. I also gave my time, sweat, money, hard work, dedication, tears, and a sore back (ha-ha). I keep the elderly lady's story close to my heart, and always remind myself that this is what I am giving for. Helping people is what inspires me to give.
Interlink Counseling Services Inc	243281		/users/profile/329934	Sandy93	Volunteer	5	05/19/2015	Interlink Counseling Services is a homeless veterans rehabilitation center. My husband came here in 2007. His addiction was crack cocaine. At Interlink he got the education, counseling and structure and the acknowledgement of God's strength. He is a new man now for over 7 years. I pray everyday for God's wisdom in this program because the veteran's need this to help find themselves and learn how to deal with life passed addiction, depression, anger and so on. If you know someone who needs this help, Interlink Counseling is waiting to help. No fingers pointed, just helping them look ahead to a future to once again be productive citizens, good fathers, good husbands and the man God has made them to be. Thanks, Interlink.
Hand-In-Paw Rescue	286752		/users/profile/376822	Antonia_G	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	'A picture is worth a thousand words.' We've heard this saying many times, but in the case of animal rescue it speaks volumes. My husband and I have spent many years volunteering with various animal rescue organizations, providing transport, graphic design services, fostering and event support. However, what we have seen that makes the most difference has been the photography we provide. Photography captures a moment in time that shows the world the personality and beauty of a pet. We can show the dramatic transformation that a loving foster home affords. We can show the nurturing of a mother to her puppies. We can show the playfulness that a 7-year-old still exudes. We can show the puppy personality in a young dog that's only known the life of being a breeder dog.The rescue that we support and nominate is Hand-In-Paw Rescue (http://handinpawrescue.org), a foster-based rescue in Louisville, Ky., that pulls pregnant and lactating mother dogs, as well as orphaned puppies from the high-kill shelters in the area and the state. Hand-In-Paw (HIP), while rescuing any breed of dog, has ended up with many pit bulls. One of their most recent pregnant dogs was a pit bull who gave birth to 18 healthy puppies. The organization advocates for spay/neuter, especially with pit bulls. We are proud to be able to photograph the many dogs that they rescue.The photograph is of Clover and a few of her puppies. Clover is the pit bull who gave birth to 18 puppies (lovingly nicknamed The Roots). She and her litter were highlighted in a local magazine (Louisville Magazine).
Cedaridge Inc	238185		/users/profile/323290	the-preacher	Volunteer	5	02/18/2015	A great place to volunteer in helping the needy and homeless.  A great place to help in handing out food, clothing, bibles, and many more items.  I would encourage all who would like to support a great nonprofit to help this ministry who has been serving the people of Whitley and surrounding counties for over 24 years.  It has also been cleared as a red cross diaster relief shelter.
Faith Baptist Church	234542		/users/profile/300222	catfan	General Member of the Public	1	11/27/2014	This church does not have non profit status.  They have never incorporated.  They have no license.  Any gifts given to this church are not tax deductible under IRS laws. The pastor will marry people without a marriage license.  What other laws does this church and pastor break?  The pastor inherited the church from his dad.   My experience with this church has been that they have no regard for the government or KY laws.   They are an independent church with no accountability or commitment to any body or any one.  This is the kind of church that gives the honorable ones a bad name. 
Kentucky Off-Roaders	286830		/users/profile/376900	Jill_a	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	Keeping Respect in Kentucky Coal Mine LandI have given the better part of the past two years of my life to the non profit group, KY Off-Roaders. This group's mission is to prevent trail riding from becoming a forgotten recreation. In KY, much of the land is rural, dormant coal mines. This group strives to support the economies of trail parks throughout the state by forestry regeneration, clean up days, benefit rides and familiy gatherings. I left home at 15; these members of this group have claimed me as a sibling, and I them. Last month I donated several hours to collecting items for a live auction to donate to the groups last benefit ride. Over 200 riders participated and with the items we collected for donation, they gave Camp Quality, a camp for kids with cancer, over $2,000.00 for sponsorships allowing kids to attend the camp for free next year. The simple Facebook group page runs 24/7 assisting members in finding great trails to take their families horseback riding, kayaking, trailing, boating or just a good camping trip in our great state.The Kentucky Off-roaders help other people love Kentucky. They deserve this praise, please.
House Of Prayer Inc	299938		/users/profile/390754	RowanResident	Client Served	1	08/09/2016	This organization claims to be an inclusive and Christian organization, but they have consistently bashed the LGBTQ community in Morehead, KY. They have no qualms about expressing their hate and bigotry for LGBTQ people on their church signs. Members have harassed us when driving past our property, and for some reason, they never seem to be able to understand that their church is on a street with children and small animals as they routinely speed down the road without any care at all. If you are looking to donate or attend a religious organization that espouses benevolence, this isn't it.
Planned Parenthood Of The Bluegrass Inc	151229	1	/users/profile/201835	sarahmm3	Client Served	5	03/18/2013	I have been coming to Planned Parenthood for four years now. As a low-income young female, it is the only place in town where I can go for quality, affordable reproductive care. The staff is always incredibly helpful, friendly, accommodating and understanding. I always leave feeling empowered to make my own choices, and financially empowered as well. What a wonderful thing to be able to afford quality healthcare! I owe alot to Planned Parenthood.  Because of this feeling of owing so much, I have been volunteering at Planned Parenthood for the past month. I find behind-the-scenes to be as welcoming and warm and atmosphere as it ever seemed when I was a patient. The staff genuinely care about their patients and are here simply to help them in any way possible.  I am so thankful that this organization is here to serve Lexington.

LIFE IN ABUNDANCE INTERNATIONAL	94169		/users/profile/108780	Craig P.

I've been to some of their projects in Ethiopia and Kenya and the work and enthusiasm of the people is amazing.
