The school was named after Theo Van Gogh, the brother of Vincent Van Gogh, because Theo encouraged Vincent to pursue his dream of art, and supported him financially through his years as an artist.   Theo Art School also encourages students to pursue their dreams of art and offers financial help to those in need. We believe every child should have the advantage of a quality fine art education. We keep our tuition as low as possible and we offer full scholarships. There are no additional charges to tuition, and all art supplies are included.   Whether you're interested in Art Classes for Kids, Art Classes for Adults, Summer Art Camps, or just looking for a new hobby, Theo is the place for you. We are open all-year around. Our studios are located at Frances Leach High Prairie Arts and Science Complex. With ample parking lot and a very safe environment, parents and students get a great Art experience.  Theo Art School enjoys an educational partnership with many local elementary schools offering after-school classes at schools in both Bismarck and Mandan for the last 11 years.  After school art programs are a great way for children to further their artistic expression outside of public/private school. Children who learn to work with their hands are more likely to do better in other academic programs by achieving problem solving skills applicable to other areas of their education.   Recent registrations for our classes and camps showed that a quite number of students that attended our classes and camps this year have the ability to speak a foreign language. Because art programs involve communication, interpretation and understanding of complex symbols similar to mathematics and foreign languages, our programs often help children with these subjects. Learning these skills helps to develop high order analytical skills as well as skills of evaluation and synthesis. Over 560 Kids attended our Summer Camps this Summer!   Fall is here and at this time, we are offering after school art classes at seven Bismarck's public schools, and now Saint Anne Grade School as well. We are in the process of creating our after school art classes at our studios. No other fine arts organization offers year-round arts classes. No other fine arts organization offers free classes and full scholarships. We are part of the Community, and we are very humble to be able to Share the Love of Art.   ~Liliana~  Please visit our website, and do not hesitate to stop by Theo anytime.

Children who learn to work with their hands are more likely to do better in other academic programs by achieving problem solving skills applicable to other areas of their education.   Recent registrations for our classes and camps showed that a quite number of students that attended our classes and camps this year have the ability to speak a foreign language. Because art programs involve communication, interpretation and understanding of complex symbols similar to mathematics and foreign languages, our programs often help children with these subjects. Learning these skills helps to develop high order analytical skills as well as skills of evaluation and synthesis. Over 560 Kids attended our Summer Camps this Summer!   Fall is here and at this time, we are offering after school art classes at seven Bismarck's public schools, and now Saint Anne Grade School as well. We are in the process of creating our after school art classes at our studios. No other fine arts organization offers year-round arts classes. No other fine arts organization offers free classes and full scholarships. We are part of the Community, and we are very humble to be able to Share the Love of Art.   ~Liliana~  Please visit our website, and do not hesitate to stop by Theo anytime. Where you will always find me Sharing My Love for Art. I am very grateful to my family for allowing me to continue this journey!  Our studios are always open!

Most widely recognized was the "spread the word to end the word" campaign.   competition and training is the vehicle widely used to provide people with intellectual disabilities opportunities for fitness, inclusion, acceptance and leadership. 1,464 people in north dakota participated in either a sanctioned training or competition event sponsored by sond and supported by 317 volunteer coaches. The power of sport shifts focus to what our participants can do, not what they cant. Attention to disabilities fades away. Instead, we see our athletes talents and abilities. Our sports and competition events, 59 held in 2014, brought together a large and inclusive community of athletes, supporters and families, coaches, volunteers and many others. At each of these events, the experiences demonstrate purity of sports and real athletic pursuits all based upon true olympic ideals. Sond provides year-round training and competition in 15 official sports. A total of 2,368 athletes participated in sports such as: 220 in soccer, 193 in bocce, 593 in bowling, 400 in basketball, 4 in down-hill and cross-country skiing, figure and speed skating, 19 in snow shoeing, 66 in swimming, gymnastics, 31 in power lifting, 231 in volleyball and 296 in track and field. Unified competition was offered in the sports of bocce, soccer and volleyball. Unified sports combine people with and without intellectual disabilities on the same team. Special olympics north dakota set a delegation of 44 athletes and partner volunteers to represent north dakota at the special olympics usa (national) games in new jersey. The team took home 9 gold medals, 4 silver medals and 7 bronze medals.   sond offers healthy athlete initiatives dedicated to providing health services and education to special olympics athletes, and changing the way health systems interact with people with intellectual disabilities. Through free health screenings, training for healthcare professionals, and evaluation of the health status of people with intellectual disabilities, healthy athletes has become a powerful public health organization. Since 2003, 975 athletes have been screened in opening eyes, special smiles, and fun fitness and health promotion.

For fiscal year ended june 30, 2015 service dogs for america has placed 5 ptsd (post traumatic stress disorder) service dogs; 1 seizure alert dog; and 1 ptsd/emergency medical response dog/mobility assist dogs. Service dogs for america has placed services dogs in several us states this fiscal year. As evidenced by the number of dogs placed, one of the newest and most successful programs service dogs for america currently has is the ptsd service dog program. All 5 ptsd service dos placed in this fiscal year were teamed with combat-connected disabled veterans. One thing that differentiates service dogs for america from many other training facilities is the fact that we place ptsd dogs with civilian clients as well as veterans. A lot of the programs are limited strictly to veterans. Another new program that has been developed and put into place this fiscal year is the diabetic alert (emergency medical response dog). There has been a fair amount of interest in the program from potential clients. It has also been a wonderful volunteer opportunity for us as we have many individuals in a 50 mile radius who collect and donate saliva samples for the program -which are used for "scenting" training for the dogs. We have expanded our inmate canine assistance programs (icap) this fiscal year. We started our flagship icap program in jamestown (james river correctional center) in 2008. In june 2015, we expanded into the bismarck region by adding a prison puppy program at missouri river correctional center (mrcc). With this program, our certified trainers instruct inmates on our dog training techniques and the inmates work to teach the dogs their basic 5 commands (sit, stay, down, heel, come) and some advanced service dog behaviors (alert, block, etc). The ultimate goals of this program are to offer inmates a useful job skill which will assist them in their transition back into society and to collaborate with a dog rescue organizations in the region to obtain dogs. The dogs will be trained by the inmates. After passing their canine good citizen test, the dogs will be temperament-tested by the master trainer & animal behaviorist on staff at service dogs for america. If sda's master trainer feel the dog has the characteristics of a good service dog, sda would take the dog into our program. If the dog doesn't meet the criteria for a service dog, the rescue organization will get the dog back and will be able to adopt out a well-trained dog. We feel it will be a beneficial endeavor for all involved, as lack of obedience is a main reason a lot of shelter pets are abandoned or returned. Sda has started laying the groundwork for a courthouse dogs (victims' advocacy) program since late last fall. This program would allow dogs to provide comfort and assistance to victims in every aspect of court proceedings (interviews, testimony, questioning, etc. ). The program planning is in its infancy, but should be in full swing by 2016.

Infants - the infant community accepts children at six weeks of age. They are free to grow and develop at their own pace, in calm, serene environment. Most parents sense that the montessori infant community provides their child something special. Toddlers - for nearly a century montessori teachers have been observing toddlers and creating a learning environment that responds to the developmental needs of early childhood with the benefit of a caring nurturing environment. Toddlers learn faster than most at any other time in their life. The toddler community respects this time in a child's life and offers group activities, as well as independent work periods. Pre-primary - the pre-primary community is primarily focused on five areas practical life, seasonal, language, math and cultural studies. The emphasis is on individual learning, though there are daily group lessons and social interactions. The pre-primary children make choices in areas that are of the greatest interest to them. Once the activity is introduced, the teacher is able to withdraw and the child is able to work independently. The love of learning is fostered each day and a sprint of respect and cooperation is developed. Elementary - the montessori elementary experience responds to the child's expanding view of the universe. Many new materials are introduced as the child enters into more abstract thinking. Their developing imagination embraces concepts larger than their immediate environment. The elementary curriculum is interdisciplinary, allowing science, social studies, the arts, language, math and foreign language converging in studies guided by the child's own questions. Emphasis is placed on the connections between the different areas of study, not on the mere presentations of detail.
