Solace for the Children	http://www.s4tc.org	704-657-2374	EIN 56-2078031	PO Box 5129	Mooresville	NC	28117	USA	International, International Relief	Building peace on a foundation of health!  Solace for the Children is building peace on a foundation of health by establishing international partnerships providing medical care, education and leadership development for the children of war-torn countries.  Currently we direct our services to the children of Afghanistan.	While we can point to great results for Solace programs through data as seen below, keep reading below to learn about the real impact of Solace...  	Solace currently serves children in 25 of the 34 Afghan provinces with a goal of serving children in 100% of Afghanistans provinces.   	In 2012, Solace was certified as an official Afghan Non-Governmental Organization (NGO)  	About 150 Afghan children have received medical treatment as participates in Solace medical programs with at least 150 more children receiving support through in country treatment, over-the-counter medical bags packed by volunteers and distributed by returning children, and receiving educational support.    Personal impact results:  Zaman Rashid, Solace Summer Program 2007 - Today I am alive because of Solace for the Children. By offering me my health and an education I could never get, Solace has broken the thick walls of illness, hopelessness, faithlessness, and other disasters that were surrounding me. Solace has made my life absolutely beautiful and peaceful. For these reasons, I truly would like to thank, Solace and its supporters.     Zaman arrived with the first group of children from Afghanistan.    Solace was the last hope of his family for their son to live to adulthood.  In a Solace Community, volunteer surgeons removed a tumor that gave Zaman back his health and his familys hope.  From that time to this, Zaman has dedicated his life to working toward bringing peace and prosperity to his beloved Afghanistan.  He finished his high school education in AFG, and accepted the first Solace Scholarship to a community college in the US in 2011.  Zaman is an honor student in college and for 2012-2013 serves as the President of his schools Phi Theta Kappa Chapter.  Zaman tells us that his goal now is to complete his education with a degree in international business and return to Afghanistan to establish group homes for hopeless Afghan children.  Mabobah, Solace Summer Program 2009 - I was so happy with my host family they wear very well. Sometime my family and friends ask me, did you like American? To I said no! I like American people. American people are very kind and good people I live them.  Solace for the Children can help with us very good, and the Afghanistan people need to help.  Mabobah arrived in June 2009 with multiple orthopedic problems caused by untreated polio from her infancy and undiagnosed skin problems.  While Mabobah will always need to walk with the aid of crutches, her skin problem was not so serious.  Physical therapy and braces gave her body far more function.  Typical ointment and intense laser treatments took care of her skin problems.  Her six weeks within a Solace Community made it clear to us that Mabobah had another very large obstacle in her life  lack of education.  With her health elevated and the blessings of family, Solace began to look for ways to begin and support Mabobahs education.  A school for girls was in her area; however, walking for a girl on two crutches was not a possibility.  We tried to provide transportation, yet that was unreliable and left her still with a path to travel to get to the road that was extremely difficult and dangerous.  Soon we found a teacher who would come to Mabobahs home and with the aid of a computer and various electronic classes, not only Mabobah began to learn, but her siblings, too!  While I was in Kabul in December 2011, Mabobah, her father and one brother traveled into the city to visit with me.  Very proudly she spoke with me in the English she is learning as she studies math and other subjects.  The note you see above is taken from a letter she wrote to me several weeks ago.    Abed Arian, Solace Extended Program Interpreter 2010 and 2011/2012  Solace for the Children has changed lives of many people, including my brother and my family.  The way we look at America is completely different.  Our friendship with Americans can and will change the public view about how Americans can work within Afghanistan.  My family has been involved with Solace and believes it is a program that opens doors for those who are suffering from war.  Solace shows us that together we can overcome the problems by building peace on a foundation of health.    Abeds introduction into the Solace Extended Program was as an interpreter for his young brother who was suffering from uncontrolled seizures.  At age 18, Abed bravely escorted his little brother to a Solace Community where he worked with medical specialists and physical and language therapists to identify the cause of the seizures and regulate medication to control them.  When Abeds brother arrived he could not dress himself, feed himself or speak in a way that could be understood.  When they returned to their family about 5 months later, Abeds little brother could do each of these successfully. Abed returned with instructions for his family concerning simple ways to continue to help their young son be all he could be.   In 2011, Abed returned with another boy in need of life-saving urological surgery.  His service to Solace comes from the heart in gratitude for the immense impact the volunteers of this organization have had on his entire family.	Innocent children of war ages 7 to 12	Any province of Afghanistan		Summer Program - Acting on the belief that a mutual understanding and shared acts of genuine compassion are the foundation for true and lasting peace, Solace brings Afghan children to live with American host families for six weeks during the summer months while they are treated for medical conditions unavailable to them in Afghanistan. As of the 2011 Summer Program, Solace Communities in 3 states have treated almost 150 Afghan children from 73% of Afghan provinces.   	Solace Extended Program  Recognizing the tremendous need for medical support of the Afghan children, Solace provides treatment for children whose conditions are too complex or urgent for placement in the Summer Program.  Examples: a 4 year old with bone infection complications of a club foot, 6 open heart surgeries, a boy with shrapnel embedded in his eye from a rocket attack, prosthetics to reclaim limbs lost in IED blasts, repair of bladder extrophy, and so much more.  Solace is thankful for the medical communities across the country who partner with Solace in this work.   	Solace Learn  We continue to follow Solace children when they return to Afghanistan. Returning healthy to Afghanistan, many of the children have the first opportunity to attend school.  Solace provides basic support to make this possible.  As children exhaust educational opportunities available in Afghanistan, Solace supports their efforts to continue an education outside the country.   	Solace Leadership Program  New in 2012, the Leadership Program is designed to provide training and opportunity for positive and productive leadership for the purpose of creating a more peaceful world.  Qualifying students will spend three years learning and practicing leadership skills through classroom training, working with mentors, and through practice experience with developing and carrying out Peace Projects in their own Afghan communities.	In these early years of service, we have grown significantly in the number of children who directly benefited from the efforts of Solace for the Children.  Beginning in 2007 with seven children treated.  By the end of 2012, Solace will have served more than 300 Afghan children through medical services both in the U.S and in AFG as well as by providing educational support.

NFWM was formed in response to that call and remains the national vehicle for people of faith and their institutions to respond to Chavez's vision of farm worker justice.  NFWM now works with three national farm worker organizations, the United Farm Workers (UFW), the Coalition of Immokalee Workers (CIW) and the Farm Labor Organizing Committee (FLOC); and with two state-based groups, Pineros y Campesinos del Noroeste (PCUN) in Oregon and the Farmworker Association of Florida. There are 2-3 million farm workers in the U.S.  Unfortunately, without consistent efforts on the part of farm workers and supporters, they and their problems are largely invisible in our society.  Public and consumer support makes the crucial difference between success and failure in achieving farm worker goals. Faith-based organizations in particular bring both a moral voice and the strength of an organized constituency to the struggle.   NFWM provides the leadership to maintain and grow that support on the national, state and local level.

The Higgins and Langley Memorial Fund has recognized international award recipients in a variety of categories or flood and swiftwater. The categories are:  Lifetime Achievement Award The Lifetime Achievement Award is reserved for those few individuals who make a significant, lasting and continuous impact in the field of swiftwater rescue. Consequently, Lifetime Achievement Awards are rarely awarded.  Program Development Award The Program Development Award recognizes agencies that make a significant commitment to swiftwater and flood rescue programs in their area. This award profiles the education, training and resources to develop a successful swiftwater and flood rescue program.  Incident Award Occasionally, a specific Incident is recognized that clearly demonstrates outstanding skill and preparedness in a swiftwater rescue.  Team Award Recognizing the importance of team dynamics in the field of Swiftwater Rescue, a Team Award is considered in cases of outstanding, group dynamics or achievement.  Special Commendation Award The Special Commendation Award recognizes the breadth of possible contribution in the field of swiftwater rescue. Awards of this type can be for media contribution, strategic planning, individual heroism or esprit de corps.     The Higgins and Langley Memorial Awards honor outstanding achievement in the technical rescue discipline of swiftwater and flood rescue. They are not heroism awards, but rather recognize preparedness, teamwork, and a job well done, often under extreme conditions, where training is vital to the success of rescue missions, as well as the safety of rescue personnel and the victims who are being rescued.  The awards were established in 1993 by members of the Swiftwater Rescue Committee of the National Association for Search and Rescue (NASAR) in honor of Earl Higgins, a writer and filmmaker who lost his life in 1980 while rescuing a child who was swept down the flood-swollen Los Angeles River, and Jeffrey Langley, a Los Angeles County Fire Department firefighter-paramedic, who lost his life in a helicopter incident in 1993.  Flooding is the leading cause of weather related death worldwide. Rescuers who lack proper swiftwater/flood rescue training and equipment are at risk of serious injury and loss of life. Every year, would-be rescuers, both citizens and professionals, die in swiftwater incidents. Although improvements in response capability are being made in many public safety agencies, others remain inadequately prepared to perform safe and effective swiftwater and flood rescues.  Higgins and Langley Memorial Awards have increased awareness about the need for specialized swiftwater and flood rescue training. As a result, worldwide training certifications have increased and agencies have been inspired to develop viable water rescue programs, both for the protection of the public, as well as the safety of their personnel.	water rescue responders and support their heroic efforts and educational outreach programs by honoring their achievements	the international water rescue community	Awards programs recognizing outstanding contributions to the field of flood and swiftwater rescue	Recognized over 100 water rescue professionals

HOOF is a nonprofit organization centered around education and providing a sanctuary for rescued, donated, and in-need farm animals.  Our mission is to provide continued care and a sanctuary to farm animals in need, educate children and adults by creating awareness of rescues and their needs, and demonstrate through animal rides and farm animal jobs how a rescues life can be re-purposed for good.  HOOF is a platform for the community to learn, grow, and volunteer.  Greenlands Farm started a rescue petting farm in 2011 with a vision to provide a sanctuary to farm animals and an educational platform for the community. Whether adopted from other rescue organizations, donated from owners, or taking in an animal because the farm could provide a good home, these animals are now a part of our farm and have a new life. Greenlands Farm friends established Helpers of Our Farm (HOOF), a not for profit organization that supports these rescued animals and the education and services they provide. We are Helpers of Our Farm not only because these animals depend on humans to help them, but also because these animals help us by teaching us how to love, care, and learn from them. They perform an important task of educating visitors during our tours, petting farm, and farm classes. The goal has always been to integrate education into the lives of our community through the lives of these animals.   Sanctuary Our sanctuary is located on Greenlands Farm and we provide a beautiful and peaceful home to many animals that have never been given the opportunity to experience loving care.  Each animal is provided with shelter, clean water, and plenty of room to roam free.  Education Our hope is to reduce farm animal abuse, neglect, and the need for rehoming by educating the public on the reality of care and ownership responsibility.  We believe the lives other farm animals will be changed if there is more awareness of these unsuspected animals in need.  A more educated society creates smarter choices and future advocates.  Rehabilitation The rehabilitation of animals is approached case by case.  Each animals basic needs for healthcare and medical treatment, nutrition and dietary needs, and careful handling and training will be met along with any individual needs on top of those.  We work with each animal to gain and grow trust and to build a healthy herd/companion environment.  Many of our animals are given jobs to help their mental health as well.  They are very similar to us in some ways, a working brain is a healthy brain.  Even if that just means greeting you!		farm animals in need of sanctuary, educate the society on rescue animals	Southeastern North Carolina	a farm animal sanctuary and educating the public on kindness, responsibility, and humane treatment of animals.	15 farm animals, educated visitors

Curethekids. Org and www. Rideforkids. Org - mailed 66,677 national newsletters and annual reports - sent 858,377 informational emails about our activities, programs and events. - provided funding to the central brain tumor registry of the united states, the brain tumor epidemiology consortium, and the scientific journal neuro-oncology- provided direct financial aid to families through our georgia chapter office - 175 families with $204k through 21 hospitals in 9 states. During the second year of our 2013-16 strategic plan, we made critical investments of financial and human capital to achieve six key objectives, including growing existing fundraising programs and creating new revenue sources to fund more research. We also intentionally invested in creating a network of local chapters to reach and serve more families affected by childhood brain tumors. To diversify revenue, we launched a new signature fundraising event, the starry night 8. 5k walk/run; established new corporate partnerships; created an annual and major giving program to increase non-event revenue; and introduced low-cost, efficient online fundraising pages for community members and endurance athletes. The ride for kids program worked with motorcycle industry experts to increase new and return participation; cross-promoted with the starry night program and added components to increase non-motorcycle participation. Our research investment strategy included establishing a framework for prioritizing funding; creating a research advisory network to provide highly informed perspectives on the biomedical research enterprise; and broadening the scope of our research funding and expertise. We began to expand our family support program offerings, including hosting our first educational conference for survivors and parents. On the organizational side, we recruited new board members from the legal, financial services, insurance marketing and hospitality industries; increased board involvement in fundraising and established chapter offices in georgia and illinois. In 2014 we created an integrated marketing and communications plan; established stronger brand identity by developing branded websites, fundraising events and educational literature; and expanded communications resources to support new programs and initiatives such as chapters and online fundraising. We increased our use of social media to communicate mission-driven stories and we developed new and updated educational resources for families.

(Hopscotch) is a not for profit, international adoption agency authorized in New York and licensed in North Carolina as a child-placement agency. Hopscotch is dedicated to helping children in need of families, through both humanitarian efforts and through adoption into permanent, loving homes. Hopscotch was accredited by the Council on Accreditation as a Hague Accredited agency in February 2008, and thus follows both U.S. and Hague Convention policies and regulations regarding international adoption.  The fundamental belief of Hopscotch is that each child has the right to a lifelong, loving family. We recognize and support efforts that can allow children to safely remain in their original families and, where this is not possible, to be adopted in their countries of birth. When these options are not available, however, we believe that children should be placed internationally with adoptive parents who can provide a nurturing and stable permanent family. Sometimes, sadly, children do not meet the legal standards for international adoption and are subject to institutional life. In these cases, Hopscotch supports their needs through directed humanitarian assistance that improves their quality of life. It is these children and these adoptive parents that Hopscotch serves.  For parents who are interested in adopting a child through Hopscotch, we are a comprehensive and caring guide through what is, under even the best of circumstances, a challenging and stressful process. We facilitate the adoption of infants and toddlers, as well as older children and children with special needs (often easily correctable here in the US). Currently, Hopscotch specializes in adoptions from the Republics of Armenia and Georgia with new but highly experienced programs in Bulgaria, Ghana and Morocco.  Hopscotch is committed to working closely with prospective adoptive families starting from the first telephone call or email. Hopscotch provides personal assistance to families with paperwork and other demonstrations of compliance for the sending country, through preparation to become an adoptive parent, to international legal work in country and travel to meet your child, and then post adoption support when you come home.  Hopscotchs leadership teams in the U.S., Armenia, Georgia, and now, Bulgaria, Ghana and Morocco have had many years of successful experience with international adoption. We have strong working relationships with in-country governments, and with the US embassies and consulates. This experience and these relationships allow us to help our families navigate through the expected and most importantly, the unexpected, steps in adopting a child internationally.  For children who remain in orphanages in Armenia, Bulgaria, Georgia, Ghana and Morocco as well as other countries where we work, Hopscotch is active in spearheading projects which strive to improve both the physical environments of the institutions where children are being cared for and the physical and emotional health for these children without families. We believe in the virtuous circle of adoption and humanitarian aid, and we are grateful to our families for their continual dedication to the children of the countries where we serve.		25-55, married or single families, of moderate income, interested in world events, open to possibilities, mature, stable and prepared to parent.

After successfully completing Mainstage productions of Oliver, and Annie,  in addition to children's productions of You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown, Pinocchio and Snow White Goes West,  together under the name Lake Lynn Players & Children's Theatre, this troupe of thespians decided more class and production time was needed. After the completion of Annie, which had a total of 65 cast members, including two or more representatives of 11 different families,  the troupe was bursting at the seams with no additional growth possible.As generous as the Lake Lynn Community Center could be with time and space for this program, more was desired by this group of actors/parents who had been watching this program, and their children,  blossom under their eyes in 18 months.There is so much talent in this community. We are finding some wonderful performers whether on stage, technically or musically that are allowing us to build a fundamental community theatre to rival the very best anywhere. We are a family-oriented theatre that is relaxed yet demanding. Yes, we demand quality in all we do, but we achieve quality in a fun, relaxed atmosphere.As a complete teaching theatre, NRACT requires no previous experience or training for participation in class or performance programs. In fact, of the 65 cast members in Annie, over 30 were enjoying their first stage experience. NRACT hopes to reach its goal of providing a performing arts outlet or first-time experience to a wide-range of community participants. Audition calls for Children's and Mainstage shows are open to everyone.Special programs include a performing adult Improv comedy troupe "The Raleigh Village Idiots," the "Children Performing for Children" series, Mainstage productions, and Summer camps

Winston-Salem is a medical community with two nationally ranked medical centers and limited affordable lodging for adult patients and their families.

Approximately 400 families of inpatients from both hospitals require lodging each night.  In addition, dozens of outpatients with serious conditions and their caregivers need accommodations.  SECU Family House will help alleviate this huge need for affordable, comfortable lodging.

Girl scouts is the world's preeminent organization dedicated solely to girls where, in an accepting and nurturing environment, girls build character and skills for success in the real world. In partnership with committed adults, girls develop qualities that will serve them all their lives: strong values, social conscience, and conviction of their own self-worth. In 2014, the council served 14,000 girls in our area.				Program: the girl scout experience is a leadership development program. One way girls develop numerous leadership skills is through our annual cookie program. Girls learn to work as a team, set goals, manage money, and gain public speaking confidence. In 2014, 9,200 girls participated, selling over one million boxes of cookies. This generated $2. 5million that will be used by the council to further the mission of girl scouting through programs and services. Another $600,000 was earned by the troops and used by the girls in our community to pay for girl scout programs, camps, and to enhance their community service projects. Our community outreach program, girls go beyond, served 2,300 girls via programming and financial assistance in 2014. We also have several focus areas to ensure a relevant and balanced program for girls. Our focus on healthy living reached over 1,100 girls through programs such as scouting for the cure. Stem programming reached 665 girls through multiple programs including discovery after dark and cybergirl tech camp. Over 500 girls participated in our environmental leadership & outdoor adventure focus area in programs including earth day and haunted adventure weekend/fall festival. Over 130 girls participated in financial literacy & entrepreneurship programs.   membership engagement: girl scouts helps girls discover themselves, connect with others, and take action to make the world a better place. During 2014, thanks to our dedicated 5,700 adult members, we served 14,000 girls and 17% of our membership represented girls from underserved and/or fragile communities served through our community outreach program. Volunteers work in close partnership with our membership team which organizes troops, recruits volunteer troop leaders, supports the volunteer structure that oversees volunteer-led troops, conducts background checks on volunteers working with girls, and delivers numerous training courses. During 2014, we had 3,000 adult participants in all of our required and enrichment trainings.   camp & camp properties: the outdoor experience is a critical component of the girl scout program. We have five exciting properties for girls to explore. Most of our properties were in use during 2014 with over 6,600 people participating in activities throughout the year at one of the properties. When visiting one of our properties, girls can take advantage of the many opportunities offered such as archery, team building activities, high challenge course elements, and climbing and bouldering walls. At our newest property, the 700-acre dale earnhardt environmental leadership campus at oak springs, 2014 marked the completion of softball and multi-purpose fields thanks to a generous donation from snyder's lance. In 2014 we marked the end of an 18 month endeavor when the gates on the dam were closed to fill the lake. Girls can now broaden their outdoor adventure with canoeing, swimming, kayaking, and more. We welcomed approximately 2,800 overnight guests at this property in 2014.

For over thirty years, we have worked in Latin America, the Caribbean, and Africa to alleviate suffering from treatable and preventable causes. Our past and current projects in Guatemala, Haiti, and Liberia have served communities with some of the highest child and maternal mortality rates in the world, confronting conditions that include malnutrition, pneumonia, malaria, and complications from child birth. We believe passionately in the community and family foundations of health. Our projects build the capacity of communities and families to improve their own health.  Therefore, our projects always empower women and girls, recognizing that a mother is the childs first doctor, and the surest predictor of a childs health is the education level of his/her mother.  Curamericas Global utilizes community-based education and prevention interventions in order to address different health problems relating to maternal and child health in underserved communities in Latin America and West Africa, and delivers these strategies using Curamericas Community-Based, Impact-Oriented (CBIO) model in combination with the Care Group and Positive Deviance methodologies.   The CBIO approach involves: (a) Community mobilization to cement good relations and secure community buy-in and ownership; (b) Conducting a census and health assessment of each community; (c) drawing maps, enumerating households, and creating a Community Register of every beneficiary by household; (d) establishing Community Health Committees (CHCs) and helping the CHCs develop a Community Diagnosis describing the communitys health challenges and a Community Health Plan describing how the project and the community will work based on both epidemiologically-driven health objectives and community perceived health priorities; (e) using the Community Registers to monitor coverage of key services to ensure equitable services to all and that those most in need are served; (f) methodically locating and making targeted home visits through Routine Home Visitation (RHV) to those most in need; and (g) utilizing a continuous health surveillance system that allows staff to tailor service delivery and engage in continuous quality improvement. This involves the capturing of vital events  new pregnancies, births, and deaths - that give us the unique capacity to track and detect actual project impact and measure changes in maternal and child mortality rather than a sample.  The Care Group methodology involves recruiting and training mother peer educators called Care Group Volunteers. Each Care Group Volunteer is assigned eight to twelve neighboring households and brings to these households, via group meetings or home visitation, life-saving Behavior Change Communication (BCC) delivered in the local language and utilizing proven methods of adult education for non- or semi-literate audiences. Subjects covered include, but are not limited to the importance of antenatal and post-partum care and health facility deliveries; recognizing and responding to danger signs in pregnancy, delivery, and post-partum; prevention and care-seeking for malaria, diarrhea, and pneumonia; and proper nutrition for pregnant women and children, as well as immunization adherence. In this manner, health education penetrates to every household. In addition, the CGVs are the projects eyes and ears and report to project staff vital events so field staff can respond with timely services and to enable the unique surveillance capability described above.  The Positive Deviance model identifies healthy children (positive deviants). The mothers of these children are then interviewed in order to find out how better health was achieved, and thereby what locally available and affordable foods can be used.

They have study rooms, computers; in a sanitary kitchen they help prepare healthy food. And we will have room for some 80 girls in addition. At solabasti, in assam, in the northeast of india, we completed construction of an orphanage/hostel/training centre that will transform the life of this poor tea-growing village.

Now, orphaned and neglected girls have a home and villagers the opportunity to learn skills that will lift them out of poverty. In kokrajhar, also in assam, ethnic fighting and extreme poverty have been especially hard on girls they are the most vulnerable. Some are orphaned, others abandoned, others suffer extreme neglect.

We held two education summits in summer, 2014 that extended thinking schools to a total of 18 schools. We are demonstrating that it can be the model for education throughout india and in other developing countries.

Our vision is for every believing community, effective leaders; for every leader, an effective christ-like mentor. The present problem which mentorlink is addressing is the global shortfall of christ-like leaders. Church planting movements are multiplying churches exponentially. These new flocks urgently need leaders to shepherd them. Traditional leadership development models are based on knowledge and skills training. These models assume you can mass produce leaders through content and skills transfer. The solution to this problem is exponential growth through jesus' mentoring model. Jesus' model focused on character transformation through mentoring relationships. He demonstrated it daily with his disciples and changed them from the inside out. The result: exponential growth in kingdom leaders for an expanding kingdom movement.				Continued catalyzing national movements to develop christ-centered leaders through mentoring in latin america, asia, europe and africa. At the end of 2014, mentorlink was engaged with leaders from 60 nations. Continued developing new ministry delivery partnerships in latin america, asia, europe and africa for the production and delivery of the video based discipleship program titled "40 days with jesus".

Parents have received guidance for parenting their teenagers while, on the other side of the coin, the teens have a connect group with mentors where they can engage in discussion about issues with which they are struggling. Youth have received mentoring and connection in a healthy, safe environment, learning how to cope with issues of life. People have been helped to move through grief at their own pace, without pressure, but with loving support. Parents and loved ones of those involved in addiction, have grown, supporting each other through the tough process of loving, but not enabling.

Grocery product collection and distribution:overall product distribution: second harvest food bank of metrolina (shfbm)received 46,424,032 pounds of grocery and household products from almost 500 local donors, national sources coordinated by feeding america, usda commodities, and purchases in 2013-2014. We distributed 45,348,523 pounds of this product to almost 600 partner agencies throughout our 19 county service region of north and south carolina and to other food banks in the carolinas in 2013-2014. Government commodities and state nutrition assistance program (snap): while the majority of our food bank's products are donated by wholesalers, retailers, and the general public, 6,643,291 pounds came from government commodities and snap. Government commodities come from the department of agriculture in north carolina and from the department of social services in south carolina. These commodities are distributed to agencies based on the poverty levels in each county. Snap funds come from the north carolina legislature. These funds are given in equal amounts to each of the six north carolina food banks. With our share of snap ($500,001) we purchased highly nutritious food from north carolina businesses for distribution to emergency pantries in the 14 counties we serve in north carolina. Salvage: at the main warehouse of shfbm in charlotte, nonperishable foods and non-food items donated from food drives and salvage centers are inspected, sorted, and packaged for distribution to our partner agencies. This project is one of our most popular volunteer activities. A total of 5,350,723 pounds were processed during the fiscal year. Purchased: in addition to the snap purchases outlined above, in 2013-2014 shrbm received $1,676,762 in grants and donations restricted for food purchase. These gifts enabled the food bank to secure highly nutritious products that are rarely donated. Food drives: each year, hundreds of local businesses, churches, neighborhoods, and service groups hold food drives for shfbm. This past year over 4,997,871 pounds were collected in local food drives. Our partner agencies: in the past year, shfbm supported almost 600 partner agencies feeding the hungry in our 19 county service region of north and south carolina. These agencies include emergency pantries, soup kitchens, homeless shelters, low income daycares, and senior programs. Volunteerism:volunteers from all segments of our community (individuals, corporations, faith-based groups, schools, community service workers and others) make a huge contribution to shfbm. In 2013-2014, volunteers donated 133,180 hours to shfbm. Collectively the financial impact of these volunteer efforts was over two million dollars calculated at $22. 14 per hour. This hourly amount is set by independent sector, a leadership forum for charities around the world. Ending child and senior hunger:shfbm believes that no child or senior should ever go hungry. Two of our major goals are to implement programs that help us end child and senior hunger in our regions. These programs include:kids cafe: this program partners shfbm with partner agencies that serve at-risk children. Examples include: boys and girls clubs, communities in schools, and low-income daycares. The food bank makes it possible for these agencies to add a feeding component so that at-risk children can have access to nutritious meals and snacks. As of the end of 2013-2014, shfbm had 45 kids cafe sites in twelve different counties. Backpack program: this program provides backpacks full of nutritious ready to eat foods on weekends and holidays when school meals are not available. As of the end of 2013-2014, shfbm had 116 backpack sites in sixteen different counties. Second helping program: this program provides monthly food boxes to homebound seniors in eight counties in our region. Boxes are delivered by our agency partners on regular meals on wheels routes and are helping seniors remain in their homes longer.   distribution of nutritional foods:community food rescue (cfr): crf gathers and distributes perishable foods such as produce, dairy, restaurant, and bakery items that might otherwise be thrown away. The food is picked up daily and delivered at no cost on the same day to agencies that feed on-site. This program annually saves almost 6 million pounds of food. Almost 50 agencies in mecklenburg and iredell counties are served by cfr. Distribution of produce, meat, seafood and dairy: shfbm places a special emphasis on soliciting and distributing highly nutritious foods including produce, meats, dairy and seafood, needed for balanced and healthy diets. These are often the foods that people living in poverty can least afford. In 2013-2014, shfbm distributed 16,077,566 pounds in these categories.

Since 1970, Samaritan's Purse has helped meet needs of people who are victims of war, poverty, natural disasters, disease, and famine with the purpose of sharing Gods love through His son, Jesus Christ.  The organization serves the church worldwide to promote the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.				Operation christmas child: this is a project of samaritan's purse that collects and delivers gift-filled shoeboxes to millions of hurting children around the world. We do this to demonstrate god's love, prepare the way for the gospel, and share the true meaning of christmas--the birth of jesus christ, our lord and savior. Jesus told us, "go therefore and make disciples of all nations" (matthew 28:18). In 2014, operation christmas child reached boys and girls in 114 nations with a record 10,440,333 shoebox gifts collected worldwide, including 7,991,643 in the u. S. Since 1993, operation christmas child has handed out 124 million shoebox gifts in 159 countries and territories. The 2015 national collection week will be november 16-23 at more than 4,000 locations across the u. S.   south sudan relief: samaritan's purse has been working in south sudan for more than 20 years--long before the nation gained independence in 2011. The humanitarian crisis escalated in 2014 because of political instability and fighting. Working in the name of jesus, we provide food, water, and other essentials to 200,000 people who have been displaced from their homes and farms. Samaritan's purse operates the only surgical hospital in maban county, as well as a nutrition center and five mobile clinics to care for malnourished infants. Our international medical teams have provided cleft- lip surgery for over 260 children and adults since 2011. Hundreds of churches built by samaritan's purse over the past 10 years are involved in concerted prayer for peace and the future of their nation.   liberia relief: samaritan's purse was at the forefront of efforts to fight the ebola outbreak in western africa in 2014. We praise god for halting the epidemic and sparing so many lives, including dr. Kent brantly and nancy writebol after they contracted ebola while caring for patients. Samaritan's purse operated three facilities to provide medical and spiritual care for the sick, supplied 66,000 households with infection prevention kits, and reached 1. 6 million people with ways to avoid the virus. At the height of the epidemic, when commercial flights were cancelled, we chartered two jumbo jets to deliver desperately needed medicines and supplies. Through our ebola ministry, over 1,200 liberians trusted jesus christ as their lord and savior.   the mission of samaritan's purse is to obediently serve the lord jesus christ. At the core of our ministry is the belief that mankind has been separated from god by sin and our only hope of salvation comes from the atoning sacrifice of god's son, jesus christ. "if you confess with your mouth the lord jesus and believe in your heart that god has raised him from the dead, you will be saved" (romans 10:9). Many claim to behave mercifully toward their neighbors out of a sense of social consciousness. At samaritan's purse, we take our name and mandate from christ's instruction that we should first love the lord with our hearts, souls, minds, and strength. Caring for our neighbors then flows from our deep love for god. This command is illustrated in the parable of the good samaritan as told by jesus and recorded in luke 10:25-37 (new king james version): and behold, a certain lawyer stood up and tested him, saying, "teacher, what shall i do to inherit eternal life? " he said to him, "what is written in the law? What is your reading of it? " so he answered and said, "'you shall love the lord your god with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind,' and 'your neighbor as yourself. '" and he said to him, "you have answered rightly; do this and you will live. " but he, wanting to justify himself, said to jesus, "and who is my neighbor? " then jesus answered and said: "a certain man went down from jerusalem to jericho, and fell among thieves, who stripped him of his clothing, wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead. Now by chance a certain priest came down that road. And when he saw him, he passed by on the other side. Likewise a levite, when he arrived at the place, came and looked, and passed by on the other side. But a certain samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was. And when he saw him, he had compassion. So he went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine; and he set him on his own animal, brought him to an inn, and took care of him. On the next day, when he departed, he took out two denarii, gave them to the innkeeper, and said to him, 'take care of him; and whatever more you spend, when i come again, i will repay you. ' so which of these three do you think was neighbor to him who fell among the thieves? " and he said, "he who showed mercy on him. " then jesus said to him, "go and do likewise. " at samaritan's purse, we are responding to christ's command to do likewise as we minister to those suffering from the results of sin in our world: war, poverty, disaster, disease, and famine. The bible tells us, "the heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked; who can know it? " (jeremiah 17:9). In the new testament, we read that "the wages of sin is death" (romans 6:23). Because of adam and eve's disobedience, every human being is born with the stain of sin, which, without the cleansing blood of jesus christ, ultimately leads to physical and spiritual death. The lord, in his mercy, sent his beloved son, jesus christ, from heaven to this earth on a rescue mission. John 3:16 says, "for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. " jesus took our sins upon himself, suffering and dying on a roman cross. He took our sins to the grave, and on the third day, he arose again. Through his death and resurrection, jesus became the way for us to be reconciled to god. He said, "i am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the father except through me" (john 14:6). If you choose to remain in your sins, you will be separated from god forever. But, if you place your faith and trust in what jesus has done, you will be saved by god's grace. This is the good news: "he who believes in him is not condemned; but he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten son of god" (john 3:18). If you want to receive god's free gift of salvation, you can pray a simple prayer like this one: dear god, i am a sinner. I am sorry for my sins. Please forgive me. Help me to turn from my sinful life. I believe by faith that jesus christ is your son who died for my sins, and whom you have raised to life. I want to trust jesus as my savior and follow him as my lord from this day forward and forevermore. Amen. If you have prayed this, or would like some spiritual help, please call the following number to speak with a counselor: 1-800-247-2426. You can trust these words are true: "for by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of god, not of works, lest anyone should boast" (ephesians 2:8-9). At samaritan's purse, we take prayer seriously. Thanks to what jesus christ has done, we can take our prayer concerns directly to our god in heaven. We can ask him to intervene immediately on behalf of those whose lives are in danger, and we trust him to provide the resources for us to swiftly accomplish his work and his will. The quarterly magazine of samaritan's purse, prayerpoint, is devoted entirely to prayer for our projects around the world. We trust that as god answers prayers, he will meet the needs of his people. In addition to the ministries listed in part iii, the following ministries are our response to the effects of sin on humanity and the natural world. Our mission is to bring god's love, healing and compassion to those who are hurting or lost. North american ministries: samaritan's purse has helped over 31,000 families in 35 states recover from tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, wildfires, and other disasters since 1998. We operate five disaster relief units that carry everything needed to make emergency repairs and support the work of our national network of volunteers (5,537 at 13 locations in 2014). In 2014, samaritan's purse rebuilt 50 homes for disaster survivors who lacked the means to build on their own. At every home where we work, our volunteers offer to pray with the residents and leave each household with a signed copy of the bible. Volunteers mark comforting verses, such as psalm 46:1: "god is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. " world medical mission (wmm): the medical arm of samaritan's purse helped staff 39 mission hospitals in 37 countries in 2014. World medical mission arranged 688 short-term trips for christian doctors, dentists, and other medical professionals who served short-term assignments overseas. Another 47 doctors in 17 countries were serving two-year assignments with wmm's post-residency program, which is designed to prepare them to become career medical missionaries. Our medical warehouse shipped over 6. 8 million in donated equipment and supplies to mission hospitals in 17 countries. We praise god for how he uses these physicians and hospitals to save lives and earn a hearing for the gospel of jesus christ, the great physician. Philippines relief: for the second straight year, the eastern island of samar was devastated by a typhoon. Samaritan's purse provided emergency shelter to 2,500 families following typhoon hagupit, as well as over 16,000 households following typhoon haiyan in late 2013. We also supplied food, water, and other assistance, distributed 2,000 bibles, and enrolled 16,000 children in classes that focus on hygiene as well as evangelism. After all they have been through, we want them to know they can trust the lord as "a refuge from the storm" (isaiah 25:4). The greatest journey: the greatest journey is a discipleship program developed by samaritan's purse for children who receive shoebox gifts from operation christmas child. The goals are effective evangelism, discipleship, and purposeful multiplication of the gospel. We provide lesson books and bibles in 66 languages. In 2014, over 1. 8 million children enrolled, 988,000 made decisions to trust jesus christ as their lord and savior, and 1 million committed to pray for and share their faith with family and friends. Since 2009, 4. 7 million have enrolled and 2. 1 million have come to faith. "so shall my word be that goes forth from my mouth; it shall not return to me void, but it shall accomplish what i please, and it shall prosper in the thing for which i sent it" (isaiah 55:11). Northern iraq relief: over 800,000 muslims, yazidis, and christians who fled isis terrorism have settled in the kurdish regions of northern iraq. Samaritan's purse organized three airlifts to iraq in 2014 and distributed 3,500 kerosene heaters, 46,000 coats, 30,000 blankets, and over 400,000 pairs of shoes, plus 75,000 gift-filled shoeboxes from operation christmas child. We built a water system for 4,000 displaced yazidis and set up centers to provide safe places for hundreds of children to play, learn, and discover god's love. Haiti relief: over 115 children, including 70 residents, completed the second full year of classes at the greta home and academy, operated by samaritan's purse and named for fox news journalist greta
