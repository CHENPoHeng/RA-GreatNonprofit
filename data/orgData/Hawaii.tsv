The health center is a learning center that offers health career training to ensure a better future for our community. The health center is also an innovator, using leading edge technology to deliver the highest quality of health care services.					Medical care: primary care medical services (pediatrics, women's, adult medicine and internal medicine) are provided through a main clinic site and four satellite clinics serving the leeward area on the island of oahu. For additional information see schedule o.   emergency medical services: twenty-four hour emergency medical services are provided to the community through the health center's main clinic site on the waianae coast. For additional information see schedule o.   pharmacy: the health center operates two 340b pharmacies on site which reduces the barriers for patients without drug coverage benefits or having to make an additional stop at an off-site pharmacy to pick up a prescription. The pharmacies are located at the main health center in waianae and the kapolei health care center in kapolei.   the waianae coast comprehensive health center serves the medically underserved and economically disadvantaged community of waianae and surrounding communities in the leeward area on the island of oahu in the state of hawaii. Serving the community since 1972, the health center celebrated its 40th anniversary in 2012. From its start as a one doctor office, the health center is the largest, and oldest, of the fourteen community health centers in the state of hawaii. The strength of the health center lies in the strong foundation set by its founders, the vision and expertise of its board of directors, the sense of ownership by its staff, patients and community, the years of service and commitment of its management team, and the relationships forged at the community, state and national level. In 2014, the health center served 34,781 patients, the majority being native hawaiian (49%), followed by asian & other pacific islanders (27%), and caucasians (17%). Data shows 70% of patients are at 100% of the federal poverty level or below, 11% are uninsured, and 58% are receiving coverage under quest, the state of hawaii's medicaid program. The waianae coast is an economically distressed community with a population of 48,519. Almost 19% of the population has annual income less than 100% of the federal poverty level, which is the highest level in the city and county of honolulu and the third highest in the state of hawaii. Twenty-nine percent of waianae coast households are receiving snap/cash or other forms of public assistance. This is the highest rate in the city and county of honolulu and the state of hawaii. The average per capita income is $17,300 making it the lowest in the city and county of honolulu and the state of hawaii. Almost 9% of the population is unemployed, the highest in the city and county of honolulu and third highest in the state. The health statistics of the waianae coast parallel the economic situation in the community. The infant mortality rate in waianae is the highest in the city and county of honolulu and second highest in the state. Teen births are also the highest in the city and county of honolulu and third highest in the state. Morbidity and mortality indicators show that the waianae coast ranks highest in the city and county of honolulu and in the state for obesity (43. 5%); adults who smoke (26%); adults with diabetes (13. 7%); diseases of the heart (260. 4 deaths per 100,000); and cancer (197 per 100,000). The health center achieves its mission by not only serving patients who seek services, but also by incorporating the goal of improving the overall health status of the community it serves. The vision of the founders to offer comprehensive health services has guided the development of services and activities of our patient centered health care home, which includes:- adult day care - behavioral health - case management- chronic disease management (diabetes education, asthma education, smoking cessation, etc. )- dental - emergency room services (24 hours, 365 days/year)- exercise classes, fitness training & walking trails- family planning- health education- health emergency liaison program- homeless outreach- institutional review board for research- laboratory- native hawaiian healing (lomilomi, ho'oponopono, la'au lapa'au, pale keiki, ha ha)- nutrition counseling- patient eligibility services- pharmacy - primary care clinics (adult medicine, pediatrics, women's health) - radiology/mammography/bone density screening- restaurant- specialists (general surgery, optometry, obstetrics/gynecology, orthopedics, podiatry, psychiatry, psychology, dermatology, and chronic pain management)- substance abuse treatment- transportation- health career training/health care professional training- women, infant, children program (wic) the health center is a major economic provider in the community, employing 600 individuals, the majority of whom reside on the waianae coast. The health center is governed and guided by a board of directors that includes 10 members elected from the waianae community, and 10 members appointed for expertise in business, medicine, law, or community affairs, with two representing the service areas of waipahu and kapolei. The health center has maintained a positive financial position by continuously increasing productivity, developing revenue generating services, initiating technological innovations and promoting community involvement. The health center's full array of primary health care services is designed to meet the needs of the target population. Much attention has been paid into placing clinics that are strategically located along bus routes that are visible to the community. The hours of operation at all sites represent a commitment to meet the needs of patients and their personal situations. Clinics are open weekdays as early as 7:00 am and stay open, at the latest, till 8:00 pm. Clinics are also open on saturdays and a walk-in clinic is available at one of the satellite clinics for urgent care. The health center's emergency room is available 24 hours, 365 days a year. Primary, preventive, and enabling services are available and accessible to all life cycles regardless of ability to pay for services. Specific preventive (chronic disease management; health education - diabetes, asthma, nutrition, exercise/fitness; and smoking cessation) and enabling services (case management, eligibility assistance) are integrated with primary care. The health center completed construction of its two-story adult medical and pharmacy building in the spring of 2013. The health center will start construction of a new 2-story emergency medical services building in 2015. A key initiative for the health center continues to be developing a "primary care health care home" that fits the model of care that meets the broad health care needs of our patients. The health center continues to grow its partnership through aharo (accountable healthcare alliance of rural oahu) which includes health centers on oahu and the big island whose mission is "promoting access, quality, and cost effectiveness in healthcare by empowering consumers to evaluate the performance of healthcare agencies that serve them.

Since 1960, the east-west center (center) has been promoting better relations and understanding among the people and nations of the united states, asia, and the pacific through cooperative study, research, and dialogue. The center serves as a resource for information and analysis on critical issues of common concern, bringing people together to exchange views, build expertise, and develop policy options. As a national, public diplomacy institution, the center works in partnership with more than 1,059 organizations throughout the united states (u. S. ) and in the region. The collaborative research, education, seminars and outreach, and other programs bring together americans and counterparts from asia and the pacific to work in an atmosphere of academic freedom on issues of mutual importance. The center's exchange and dialogue programs involve multi-country, region-wide activities involving everyone as full participants. In his speech at the center, u. S. Secretary of state john kerry delivered a policy speech in which he outlined what he termed the united states "ambitious agenda" of long-term engagement in asia and the pacific and the support for the center's mission. "we know that america's security and prosperity are closely and increasingly linked to the asia pacific," kerry said, adding that "president obama and i strongly support your (east-west center) mission of bringing people together to think creatively about the future of our role in the region. " this past year, 4,088 participants from 79 countries and territories took part in center activities throughout the region. While more information on the center and its programs may be found at our website (www. Eastwestcenter. Org), the following is a highlight of the program activities during the year. Education program: the center is at the forefront of educating people of the asia pacific region to meet the evolving demands of global change. The program focuses on community building at the campus level as a stepping-stone to community building at the regional level. The participant's experience is one of grassroots relationship building, cultural exchange, shared experiences, and communal preparation for future leadership roles throughout the region. The program offers educational opportunities for future leaders in the asia pacific region and the u. S. In an era of increased social, economic and technological interdependence. Graduate degree scholarships and certificate programs prepare students and professionals to address the challenges and complexities of the world's most dynamic region. Undergraduate degree scholarships build and strengthen the base of future leaders in the south pacific. The program also provided professional development programs for educators to strengthen the capacity of individuals and institutions to cultivate in their students an appreciation and understanding of the histories, cultures, and contemporary issues of the asia pacific. The program accomplishments include continued training of future leaders in the southeast asia youth leadership program, asia pacific leadership program (aplp), and college and k-12 educators through the asiapacificed program and the asian studies development program (asdp). Other programs focused on the pacific islands women in leadership, study of the u. S. Institutes (susi) for student leaders on global environmental issues, and the brunei-u. S. English language enrichment program for asean aimed at raising the level of english language skills in the region. In fy 2014, 442 students from 53 countries and territories participated in the center's undergraduate and graduate training and scholarship program that is unlike individual scholarship programs, since these students are instilled with a common learning experience centered on u. S. -asia pacific issues and community service.   research program: the east-west center's research program supports the center's mission by engaging the research and policy communities in the asia pacific region on issues of shared concern. Researchers contribute expertise to broad and well-established networks of specialists and institutional partners, leading collaborative and interdisciplinary research on the evolving challenges of a dynamic region. They also provide insights and analysis to the center's professional exchange, education, and public outreach programs, including its work with the media. The pacific regional integrated science and assessment program supports integrated research across the social and physical sciences to expand the options of decision-makers, including the pacific community leaders and members of the u. S. Congress to assist them in coping with climate change and its impact to the region. Center scholars conduct collaborative research on economic development and environmental change in south and southeast asia, including comparing the social and environmental impact of rapid urban growth in india and pakistan and the impact of expanding rubber cultivation in the uplands of cambodia, laos, burma, thailand, vietnam, and china yunnan province. Center researchers continue to conduct policy analysis, research, and training on the hiv epidemic in asia. The asian epidemic model, a computer modeling software enables asian nations and countries around the world to understand the dynamics of the hiv epidemic and how best to allocate resources to maximize cost effective interventions. Researchers examine how the globalization of innovation is transforming relationships between the us and asia to provide informed policy suggestions on how to minimize negative effects on economic growth and employment and how to share the benefits of science, technology, and other innovation through enhanced us-asian cooperative agreements. The asian international justice initiative (aiji) is a collaborative project to promote capacity-building relating to international justice, judicial reform, and the human rights sector focusing on southeast asia. Aiji has continued monitoring and outreach efforts at the khmer rouge tribunal in cambodia with weekly television and radio broadcasts aired nationwide by locally-owned broadcasters and has recently established a presence in dhaka, bangladesh, to observe and report on criminal trial proceedings at the international crimes tribunal of bangladesh. The seventh annual summer institute for international humanitarian law and human rights, "combatting violence against women and children in conflict situations and beyond" was held for professionals from the region to focus on human rights and business including the issues of corporate responsibility in the region. The asia-pacific governance and democracy initiative is a multi-year project that undertakes policy relevant research, organizes capacity development and leadership workshops and senior level dialogues among scholars and policymakers, and publishes books and policy briefs on important governance and democracy topics in the region.   seminars and outreach programs: the center has developed the most extensive program of trans-pacific journalist and editor exchanges in the region, with exchanges for the asia pacific region as a whole (jefferson fellows), policy-oriented seminars and capacity-building seminars (the senior policy seminar), and other seminars for health journalists, and bilateral programs with japanese, korean, and chinese journalists. The center also offers short-term policy seminars where senior and emerging leaders and business people from a variety of sectors focus on issues of regional concern. The program is developed around a thematic focus and provides participants with an opportunity to strengthen their understanding of asia pacific-u. S. Developments and challenges, build a regional network and to become leaders with a more international perspective. Jefferson fellows journalists traveled to hawaii, indonesia, and myanmar included 15 journalists from ten countries examining the "challenges of democratic transition" of two asian countries, indonesia and myanmar that are in the midst of democratic transition. East-west center in washington supports the center's mission through direct work with u. S. Policymakers and opinion leaders in the nation's capital. It facilitates understanding of the u. S. Policy process by its asia pacific participants through direct interaction with u. S. Policymakers. It also continues the successful asia matters for america/america matters for asia initiative to organize and disseminate information, data, and analysis on the u. S. -asia interactions.   other programs: other programs include the pacific islands development program (pidp), the china-us strategic philanthropy partnership (cusp) and auxiliary enterprise services. Pidp is an enduring partnership between the center and twenty-two island governments. It is the only program of its kind based in the united states, bringing together heads of government from an area that spans one-third of the globe. Pidp's role as a regional organization includes the five major activity areas: secretariat for the pacific islands conference leaders, secretariat for the united state/pacific island nations joint commercial commission, research & dialogue, education & training, and pacific island news. Cusp is a growing initiative to promote communication, exchange and collaboration between the philanthropic sectors of china and the u. S. In order to ensure the best use of resources and maximize the benefits to society as a whole. The first east-west philanthropist summit was held in 2014 with 70 representatives of the philanthropic sector in china and the us gathering to share their vision on critical issues such as environment, education, health and social innovation. Auxiliary enterprises provide conference facilities and dormitory housing for students and conference participants that participate in the center's programs.

Follow the journey of resurrection, life reborn, from the eyes and hands of native Hawaiians as we revive the traditional practices of surfing with the construction of Olo (longest) and kiko`o (averaging about 3.3m), alaia (shortboard) surfboards, and the making of the papaholua (Hawaiian sleds) for competition for the first time in nearly two centuries as we honor the Hawaiian people and their culture, nearly vanished. Traditionally the process begins with the giving of the koko (blood) - to its bonding with sea and land  to the finished implement (using traditional methods of preservation) - to sliding across the face of a mountain and wave.

My testimonial will hopefully help many when they read my book which is now available at Barnes and Noble, Amazon.com and Authorhouse Publishing.

Polynesian Cultural Center	http://polynesia.com	(808) 293-3005	EIN 99-0109908	55-370 Kamehameha Hwy	Laie	HI	96762	USA	Arts & Culture, Cultural & Ethnic Awareness	Educational & cultural museum					The polynesian cultural center (the center) and its next door neighbor, brigham young university hawaii(byuh), both were established and are wholly controlled by the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints (the church). The polynesian people have special significance in the church doctrine, and the church has been active in the polynesian islands since very soon after its establishment in the united states in the 1830s. It conducts many activities in polynesia intended to improve, both spiritually and economically, the lives of its members there, most of whom live in what are commonly termed "disadvantaged" communities and "underdeveloped" nations. (continued on schedule 0)one of the main thrusts of the church in polynesia is to educate its members to enable them and their communities to adapt to and be self-sufficient in the encroaching modern world and yet not to abandon or lose respect for their native cultures or themselves. In furtherance of this objective, the church has established byuh (initially known as church college of hawaii) and the center. Byuh was opened in 1955. Its primary purpose is to provide a college education for polynesian students who would not otherwise have that opportunity. Byuh and the church actively recruit polynesian high school students with college potential to attend byuh, obtain an education and then return to their home nations and communities and help improve them, economically and otherwise. The church substantially subsidizes byuh, which charges tuition far below that charged by most private colleges. Nevertheless, most of the students have no money to pay living expenses, transportation or tuition, however low. Most of the students lack job experience and skills and do not speak english fluently when they first enroll. The center was opened in 1963 as an integral part of the overall church program in polynesia and specifically as an adjunct to byuh. The center operates an authentic living museum of the native cultures of seven major polynesian islands samoa, fiji, new zealand (maori), tahiti, marquesas, tonga and hawaii. It provides continual opportunities for hundreds of byuh students from these islands to work in all aspects of the centers operations. This is intended to, and does, accomplish the following with respect to such students: teaching them the traditions of their native cultures which are threatened by modernization. Instilling in them pride and respect for their own cultures (and themselves) and respect for other cultures. Giving them a first job experience and on-the-job training. Giving them an experience in sustaining themselves in the modern western world. Enabling them to work their way through college. In addition, the broader cultural and educational functions performed by the center include the preservation and exhibition to the visiting public of important aspects of each of the polynesian cultures represented, including: authentic replicas of representative village structures in typical settings, daily living activities such as cooking, agriculture, artifacts, arts and crafts (both the objects themselves and the skills), costumes, traditions, and songs and dances (which have a far more significant role in polynesian cultures than in most western cultures). The center also conducts, directly and indirectly, scholarly research necessary to assure the authenticity of the centers activities and to foster the preservation and appreciation of polynesian cultures. The revenues listed in part viii are generated primarily by admissions paid by visitors to the village complex. In addition, since many visitors spend most of the day and evening at the center and the location of the center is somewhat remote, cafeteria-style dining facilities and snack bars are provided for the convenience of the center's visitors. Approximately 664,634 guests visited the center in 2014.

Our mission is to support excellence in public education by creating, sustaining and leveraging the energy and resources of families and communities to improve student success.	In our short history, HEM volunteers have logged thousands of hours affecting change in local government in an arena many believed impenetrable.  Efforts during our first year (2009) were aimed at furlough resolution.  To accomplish this goal we focused on developing collaborative relationships with key stakeholders in education, including the DOE, BOE, legislators and union officials, to ensure that the parent voice would become a strong and constant presence in critical issues impacting public education. These key partnerships serve as the foundation of and future catalyst for change in our public education system.  With our first major milestone of furlough resolution (May 2010), we promised the community that our organization would remain as a voice for parent and families. As such, we formed a Board of Directors comprised of our organizations co-founders and education experts. In addition, we filed and received 501(c)3.  As a natural extension of our efforts, to keep more parents, families and the community abreast of developing education issues, we created an interactive Website where parents can share their stories, a Facebook page which is updated daily, and a quarterly newsletter.  Since organizing in fall of 2009, HEM has emerged as the go to voice for a parent perspective on education issues; has developed into a credible and sought after partner for parent engagement; and, has been active in schools and public policy.    Since the furlough resolution we have sought ways to continue to engage parents in education through various community outreach efforts, including: 1) organizing Open House events at various public schools to educate families about HEM (recruited over 100 new HEM friends, Fall 2010);  2) participating in planning and formation of Oahus first education coalition, Hui for Excellence in Education (HEE) , Summer 2010; 3) hosting a community screening of the education documentary Waiting for Superman for families and educators (recruited over 200 new HEM friends , Fall 2010); 4) collaborating with Our Public School, Kanu Hawaii, and HEE to organize an education Town Hall meeting entitled New Beginnings: Community Engagement in Public Education, attended by over 300 parents, educators, legislators and community members funded by Participant Media (Spring 2011); and 5) receiving funds from Participant Media to follow up with participants after the Town Hall event to host education talk story events (Spring 2011).  We have also worked to educate families about education policy by tracking & disseminating information on legislation related to mandatory instructional hours, and providing comprehensive, non-partisan information on all BOE, Gubernatorial candidates, and appointed v. elected BOE referendum (for 2010 election) to families and the community.  At the end of the 2011 Legislative session HEM was named, along with HEE and the Hawaii State Parent Teacher Association (HSPTSA), in a Concurrent Senate Resolution (SCR 145).  HEM, HEE, and the HSPTSA will collaborate with the BOE and DOE to craft statewide policies for family engagement in Hawaii's public schools.  Findings and recommendations will be made to the Senate and House Education Committees at the beginning of the 2012 legislative session.	Parents and families are a target for us because we provide better tools for them to support their childrens education.			Since its inception, HEM has worked to establish networks with various stakeholders in the education community, from community organizations to policy makers.  Through our focus on developing these relationships, we have leveraged these relationships to formalize the following partnerships and potential future resources.  Healthy Families, Healthy Schools aims to help parents create the link between a healthy lifestyle and student success.  Using the five pillars of the First Ladys Lets Move! Initiative, HEM will provide resources to families to support them in their endeavor to eat healthy and be active. a.	 Zamzee. This program is a partnership with Hope Lab, Kaiser Permanente, and HEM.  The aim of this program is to introduce stakeholders to a new technology researched and developed by Hope Lab with support from Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Zamzee. This device and its online reward program target the sedentary behavior of tweens, 11  14 years old.  The intent is to find innovative ways to leverage tweens fascination with technology to encourage healthier lifestyle choices.  At present, HEM is the fiscal agent for this demonstration grant.  HEMs role will expand as this program is rolled out to the community. b.	Kokua Hawaii Foundation. HEM will partner this fall with Kokua Hawaii Foundation to present Two Angry Moms.  This documentary film outlines two moms journey to bring healthy food choices to and make sustainable changes at their childrens school cafeteria. HEM and Kokua will host a gathering of parents at school cafeterias to discuss current DOE Food Service offerings, procurement procedures, and how parents can be instrumental in bringing change to their school cafeteria.  Segments of the film will be shown and a panel presentation will guide the discussion.  The expected outcome of these events is to engage parents who want to make change in their school cafeteria, and provide them necessary support and resources throughout the process. 2.	Education House Parties With a grant from Participant Media, HEM, Our Public School (OPS), Hui for Excellence in Education (HEE), and Kanu partnered to bring the community a Town Hall discussion (May 2011) that centered around community engagement in education.  Clips from the education documentary, Waiting for Superman, and short videos produced by Our Public School were shown and used to build on the power of the documentary by engaging key stakeholders in a critical conversation around education reform.  Specifically, local leaders, policymakers, educators, parents, students and other key stakeholders were engaged in a dynamic discussion on key issues impacting our current education system.  This Town Hall created a venue for interested citizens to learn and share information, and ultimately inspire action around public education in our communities.   HEM was awarded remaining grant funds from this event. These monies will be used to convene education house parties. Residents will connect with others in their neighborhood to continue the dialogue from the Town Hall event.  3.	Come with Me! is a partnership between the YMCA, Family Hui, KCC Applied Nutrition Program, and HEM.  Come with Me! seeks to provide targeted parenting classes for families with children 4-5 years old that will assist them in preparing their child for Kindergarten.   HEM will develop and implement curriculum for parents that focuses on preparing parents for entering the DOE system.  We will provide information and guidance on topics such as how to effectively communicate with your childs teachers, how to engage in your childs school, etc.  All materials developed (e.g. home to school curriculum alignment) will reside under the Parent Academy.   4.	Kailua/Kalaheo Complex Family Academy  The purpose of this program is to collaborate with the Kailua/Kalaheo Complex Area Superintendent (CAS), principals, teachers and family members in the development of a complex wide vision, protocols, and model for effective family engagement.

Building on our previous experience and knowledge, our whole foods nutrition program provides our students with free breakfast, snack and lunch each day to prepare them for a day of learning and high performance. Students participate in the planning, preparation and cleanup of their meals, practice table manners and etiquette, and reflect on learning. Simultaneously, students learn about nutrition, budgeting, and environmental sustainability, so that they can analyze the costs and benefits of locally grown food versus imported food from a financial, social, cultural, health, and environmental perspective. Students also plan, develop and maintain a garden to produce vegetables and fruits for meals. Students build on their school experiences by visiting local growers and identifying where locally grown food is sold. As a final project, students create and disseminate a community educational campaign about the connection between food, culture, health, and the environment, what foods are grown on maui, and where they can be purchased.   employer mentor program - the goal of the employer mentor program is to partner with maui business leaders and community members to create community venues to highlight hui malama learning center (hmlc) student learning in the areas of science, technology, engineering and math(stem) as they relate to sustainable living on maui.

Finally, the ultimate goal of our employer mentoring program is to recruit employer mentors who provide students with knowledge and insight into tomorrow's workforce.
