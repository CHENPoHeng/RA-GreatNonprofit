HCPAP is not a shelter but a foster organization. Founded on October 1, 1999, we have specialized in dog rescue, however, we rescue cats sometimes, too.   Our mission and purpose is to rescue pets that need help. These pets may be homeless, unwanted or neglected. We then provide them with veterinary care, proper nutrition, socialization, training and love. Ultimately, it is our goal to find a great home for every pet that comes our way.					
Tri-County Ymca Inc	http://www.tri-countyymca.org	(304) 757-0016	EIN 55-0702900	Po Box 737	Scott Depot	WV	25560	USA	Human Services, Physical Fitness & Community Recreational Facilities, Religion, Religion-Related, Sports, Young Mens or Womens Associations	The tri-county ymca's mission is to put christian principles into practice through programs that build healthy spirit, mind and body for all.		Health enhancement and well- being for all - the y is a leading voice on health and well-being. We bring families closer together, encourage good health, and foster communication through fitness, sports, fun, and shared interests. We offer a welcoming atmosphere where participants feel comfortable engaging in various activities. As a result in 2014, 16,028 individuals in our community are receiving the support, guidance, and resources they need to achieve greater health in spirit, mind, and body. This is particularly important as our nation struggles with an obesity crisis, families struggle with work/life balance, and individuals search for personal fulfillment. Our programs are accessible, affordable, and open to all faiths, backgrounds, abilities, and income levels. Financial assistance is available for those who cannot afford full fees.   child care and summer day camp - the y offers state licensed, quality childcare that is committed to nurturing the potential of every child and youth. We believe that all kids deserve the opportunity to discover who they are and what they can achieve. Thats why we help young people cultivate the values, skills, and relationships that lead to positive behaviors, better health, and educational achievement. Our programs such as after school care, vacation day care, and summer day camp, offer a range of experiences that enrich cognitive, social, physical, and emotional growth. Our programs provide learning activities that provide challenges, education, self-respect, and spiritual awareness. Our day camp program provides a reverence for nature and respect for the inter-relatedness of all living things on earth. Our programs are open to all, regardless of income, abilities, or background so that children appreciate diversity and develop lifelong values and respect for all individuals. Financial assistance is available for those who cannot afford full fees. In 2014, 963 youth between the ages of four to 14 years of age benefited from these programs. Our organization received a fair market value $101,084 of contributed rent for the use of school buildings for the after school program and storage.   youth instructional and sports programs- the ymca's philosophy is that everyone participates and that fun and fair play are a priority. Our programs help develop self-esteem and the core values of caring, respect, responsibility, and honesty. Youth gain specific skills and acquire new knowledge, as well as a sense of belonging. Our programs promote teamwork, interaction, and the development of social and physical skills. In providing these types of programs, tri-county ymca realized that there was an audience in our service area which lacked programs of this nature. We now offer our challenger sports programs for children and young adults with physical, developmental, and intellectual disabilities. Challenger programs provide the opportunity to these individuals to learn, grow, and thrive through recreational and social opportunities. Challenger programs are an opportunity for children with special needs to play organized activities, learn new skills, and be on a team where everyone is accepted. All youth are welcome to participate in any of our youth instructional and sports programs regardless of their income, abilities, or background. Financial assistance is available for those who cannot afford full fees. In 2014, 1,686 children and young adults participated in these programs.   day care and various miscellaneous programs

Box 659	Charles Town	WV	25414	USA	International, International Agricultural Development, International Cultural Exchange, International Exchange, International Relief	The mission of Children of Uganda is to support and empower hundreds of orphans and vulnerable children in Uganda to lead successful and productive lives.  Our vision is that all children in Uganda receive an education to become healthy, productive members of their community who assume leadership roles and positively impact Ugandan society.	Rakai, Mukono and Kampala districts of Uganda.	Orphans and vulnerable children from the Rakai, Mukono and Kampala districts of Uganda are provided with school fees, clothing, meals and access to basic medical care.  Students are supported at the primary (elementary), secondary (middle and high school), as well as vocational (trade school) level. Philip's House in the Mukono district provides basic living requirements, health services, physiotherapy and education to young adults with varied mental and physical disabilities. In 2012, COU initiated the Family Empowerment Program with the aim of assisting child guardians with knowledge and skills training, Income Generating Projects (IGPs), as well as counseling and psycho-social support. Every few years, the Tour of Light brings talented children to perform across America.  Through music, drum and dance, they share their beautiful culture, raise global awareness of the effects of AIDS and to advocate for international aid on behalf of their fellow brothers and sisters in Uganda.	Over the past 18 years, Children of Uganda has provided education, clothing, food, shelter and support to thousands of Uganda's most vulnerable children, teens and young adults.    In its first year, our new Family Empowerment Program benefited a total of 52 people including 11 female caretakers (all women who were carefully selected based on their vulnerability, health condition, age and the number of orphaned children in their care) and their children.  The program also helped grow small businesses in the following industries: grocery, food vending, agriculture (tomatoes, maize and soybeans), mushroom growing, retail shops, a piggery project and a charcoal and firewood business.  The groundwork for the program has been set, but we are seeking additional funding to expand its services to benefit more families in the coming year.  In 2012, we spend a lot of energy and resources to revive our Tour of Light - a music, dance and drumming tour of America that raises much needed funds for the organization's programs and awareness of HIV/AIDs, poverty and Uganda's orphan crisis.  It was a great success as our troupe performed throughout twelve states for eight weeks.  Highlights included performances at Googleplex (Corporate Headquarters of Google, Inc.), Agape International Spiritual Center, The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts at Millennium Stage, and a joint performance with the Chicago Childrens Choir.  Even more so, the children engaged in cultural exchange programs and put on spectacular performances at churches, schools, universities and community centers across the United States.	We support orphan and vulnerable youth, as well as their families.	Direct beneficiaries include children, teens and young adults who are sponsored by individuals or groups through Children of Uganda.

The organization seeks to help youth develop leadership and citizenship skills for a lifelong commitment to service through character building programs for all that strengthen spirit, mind, and body.  The organization strives to extend HI-Y (High School YMCA) into every Ohio and West Virginia Community and for HI-Y to be a national leader in helping youth develop into lifelong good citizens of the community who work to create better futures for all.  Among the YMCA's objectives are: to prepare a new generation of leaders dedicated to service; to strengthen the leadership available to local communities; to enable people to direct their lives to success and service to others; to work to change conditions so youth, families, schools, and communities can succeed; and to speak on behalf of children and youth.		Local yla (youth leadership association) youth groups engage teens in a process of civic leadership development through service. Teens assess the strengths and area of need in their school and community, identify the kind of school and community they want, create and carry out programs and service initiatives to achieve their vision, and reflect on their work to strengthen future action. Most ylas are school based. Others are community based. Yla welcomes participation from every community. Other youth groups may join yla to expand their program while keeping their own name and organization. Youth wanting their own youth group create yla groups. A local yla experience is enhanced as teens participate away from home in state and regional yla program conferences, youth in government three-day student legislature and supreme court, youth in government seminars at the state capitol, and model united nations three-day assemblies. These experiences help teens apply classroom lessons of research, writing, public speaking, parliamentary procedure, debate, consensus building, making decisions, and working with others to state issues in youth in government and international issues in model united nations.   horseshoe, our residential camp in west virginia, offers teen entrepreneurship and leadership-service camps designed to engage, challenge, prepare, and motivate youth to return home more focused on achievement and helping others.

Working in a state where nearly 20% of the residents live in Poverty makes the effort to save horses in conditions, we believe, could be the worst in the USA quite the daunting task. Yet, day in and out, we are seeing success with support across the county for the horses of Appalachia. We worked for quite a few years as West Virginia's only 501(c)3 non-profit equine rescue and still stand as the state's largest, most effective equine rescue organization working state-wide.
