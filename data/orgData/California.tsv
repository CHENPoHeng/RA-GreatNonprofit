California Shakespeare Theater	http://www.calshakes.org	510-548-3422	EIN 51-0169452	701 Heinz Ave	Berkeley	CA	94710	USA	Arts & Culture, Arts Education, Performing Arts, Theater	We strive for everyone, regardless of age, circumstance, or background, to discover and express the relevance of Shakespeare and the classics in their lives. **** We make boldly imagined and deeply entertaining interpretations of Shakespeare and the classics. **** We provide in-depth, far-reaching artistic learning programs for learners of all ages and circumstances. **** We bring disparate communities together around the creation of new American plays that reflect the cultural diversity of the Bay Area.	Founded in 1973, California Shakespeare Theater (Cal Shakes) is an award-winning, nationally recognized regional theater dedicated to the classics, with year-round artistic and educational programming. Under the leadership of Artistic Director Jonathan Moscone since 2000, Cal Shakes has earned a national reputation for creating immediate and revelatory responses to Shakespeare and the classics. Through our various programs, we expand access to the arts, and build diverse community ownership of our cultural vitality by fostering participatory approaches to the artistic process and arts education. * Our performance venue is situated in the stunning natural environment of protected open space in the hills between Berkeley and Orinda, CA. We produce four plays annually from June through late October. Under the leadership of Artistic Director Jonathan Moscone, we engage the most daring and unconventional artists from around the country to investigate and reveal great works of literature with an innovation and immediacy borne of theatrical innovation, intellectual rigor, and emotional honesty. * Cal Shakes' Artistic Learning (AL) program was formally established in 2001 to make our educational efforts accessible to students from ethnically, economically, and geographically diverse communities in Alameda and Contra Costa Counties. AL builds upon our 25 years of in-school and community-based theater training and educational activities, with a vision to create a culture of life-long learners, nourishing the imaginations of young people in preparation for the work of life. In 2007, we served over 5,400 young people from ethnically and economically diverse Bay Area communities, providing a continuum of learning opportunities in local schools, at our amphitheater, and through summer theater training camps. Our school residencies served 1,394 East Bay students. Our Student Discovery matinee program served 3,675 elementary, middle, and high school students from both urban and suburban/rural counties. More than 42% were underserved students from school in low-income communities. Our two- and five-week summer camps grew by 29%, augmented in part by the expansion of our two-week camp program into a new site in Oakland. * Launched in 2003, our New Works/New Communities program brings disparate community members together to participate as co-creators with our artists and theater partners in the development of new works of theater inspired by classic literature. In partnership with other arts and community-based organizations, we aim to make concrete connections between the work of classical writers and marginalized communities that for many reasons do not see themselves reflected in those plays. Through these collaborations, we aim to create sustainable relationships with diverse communities, contributing to a more vibrant, inclusive cultural ecosystem. Our first project, HAMLET: BLOOD IN THE BRAIN, by Naomi Iizuka, was a new play inspired by Shakespeare's masterpiece that relocates Elsinore to the drug-ravaged world of East and West Oakland in the late 1980s. Along with project partner Intersection for the Arts + Campo Santo, we engaged multiple generations of Oakland residents in a participatory, grassroots process of new play development over three years. In our second New Works project, KING OF SHADOWS, playwright Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa re-imagined Shakespeare's "A Midsummer Night's Dream", exploring themes of transformation from the perspective of marginalized and homeless gay youth and engaging transient, outcast young people in the playwrighting process. Our current project, an adaptation of John Steinbeck's collection of Depression-era short stories THE PASTURES OF HEAVEN, partners San Francisco-based playwright Octavio Solis and the Word for Word Performing Arts Company with community organizations in and around Salinas, California.		In 2008: 46,035 people attended our performances. Of these, 3,147 were students who attended our special Student Discovery Matinees. Of these, 1,206 were students from low-income communities.

The foundation aims to empower, educate, and collaborate with people and projects to positively impact the planet and its creatures.	Grants program - the isf emergency medical care grant for animals was established in february of 2014. The grant provides financial assistance to animal welfare organizations, agencies, and individual rescuers responsible for the care of animals recovering from abuse, neglect, injuries suffered from a traumatic event, or other illness. The purpose of this grant is to provide animal victims a second chance by alleviating their rescuers of the financial stress of treatment so they can focus on facilitating the animal's adoption into a permanent, loving home. In 2014, isf granted $75,000. 00 helping 204 creatures, including dogs, cats, horses, and other farm, exotic, and wildlife animals. Each animal's journey showed us the true meaning of strength, love, and will, for both man and animal. Individual grants - isf granted $5000. 00 to the savory institute in support of its charitable mission to promote large-scale restoration of the world's grasslands through holistic management using properly managed livestock to heal the land and empower others to do the same. The savory institute seeks to remove barriers on the path to large-scale success through activities such as conducting research, creating market incentives, and raising public awareness.   public outreah & education - provides information to educate and engage supporters and to create public awareness of issues that are vital to isf's charitable mission.

The isf website currently provides information, educational content, and assistance, including 15 to 20 new articles per month, creative supporter challenges, and access to isf's grant programs. Isf also began an extensive redesign of its website in 2014 which will allow it to deliver even more program content in a user-friendly way. Isf volunteer and internship opportunities allowed supporters to gain hands-on experience and isf booths at events across the country allowed for valuable in-person outreach. Isf efforts further included strategic partnerships, celebrity engagement, cause marketing, traditional media relations, and campaigns including coal sucks, plastic straws can suck it, green your thirst, and #istandfor. Isf collaborated with and granted $3000. 00 to connecther in support of the girls impact the world film festival and the green is award in which high school and undergraduate college students submit three- to five-minute short films that either propose solutions to environmental issues that impact women and girls or create awareness about environmental issues that impact women and girls. Topics included climate change; green energy; water; pollution, garbage, and waste reduction; bio-diversity; and other issues. One of the 2014 green is award winning filmmakers has gone on to screen her film about the health complications related to excessive use of chemical pesticides and the importance of organic farming for lawmakers across the middle east, triggering the introduction of new laws to stop the use of harmful pesticides. Isf's president and co-founder, ian somerhalder was designated as a united nations environment programme goodwill ambassador. Ian, in his role as a unep ambassador and as isf's president, collaborated with isf to "connect to go greener", with a specific call for communities - including businesses, organizations, schools and individuals - to connect their resources and skills for a more sustainable, resource-efficient way of living. As president of isf, ian somerhalder appeared before the u. S. House of representatives committee on natural resources, where he testified in support of the u. S. Fish and wildlife service's plan for a ban on commercial trade in elephant ivory. He also emphasized the importance of the multinational species conservation funds (mscf), established by congress to provide support for the protection of elephants, rhinos, tigers, and other species. Ian encouraged the subcommittee to extend the mscf semipostal stamp, which raises critical funding for anti-poaching activities through purchases of the stamp by the public.   creatures division program - missisnip'n spay and neuter clinic - isf went to tylertown, mississippi, and, in collaboration with st. Francis animal sanctuary, performed over 100 spay and neuter procedures in addition to general exams and rabies vaccinations. Isf provided both funding, via a $5,000 grant, and volunteer medical services. Spay/neuter services not only serve to control animal overpopulation, but also are often medically beneficial for animals placing them at lower risk for infection and disease. Providing free and/or affordable spaying and neutering plays an important role in our efforts to end euthanasia and animal homelessness. Creatures division campaigns - isf's #time4thetalk campaign launched with a hilarious and informative video crafted to get people talking about the birds and the bees as pollinators. #time4thetalk followed up with monthly articles and a milk seed giveaway helping to spread the word about how important pollinators are to the survival of all creatures. The overconsumption of meat and its dangers to animals, our health, and the environment was highlighted via the meatless monday campaign. Isf asked people to think twice about wearing someone else's skin in the don't hide campaign focusing on conscious consumerism and why we should avoid leather, fur, and other hide-based industries. We explored the environmental hazards that come from the tanning process as well as uncovered some of the animal cruelty that is often involved in the making of these products.

Multidisciplinary Association For Psychedelic Studies	http://maps.org	831-429-6362	EIN 59-2751953	1215 Mission Street	Santa Cruz	CA	95060	USA	Government & Public Administration, Health, Medical Research, Mental Health, Mental Health Treatment	Founded in 1986, the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit research and educational organization that develops medical, legal, and cultural contexts for people to benefit from the careful uses of psychedelics and marijuana.  MAPS furthers its mission by:  -Developing psychedelics and marijuana into prescription medicines -Training therapists and working to establish a network of treatment centers -Supporting scientific research into spirituality, creativity, and neuroscience -Educating the public honestly about the risks and benefits of psychedelics and marijuana  MAPS envisions a world where psychedelics and marijuana are safely and legally available for beneficial uses, and where research is governed by rigorous scientific evaluation of their risks and benefits.	Maps' primary focus is research into mdma-assisted psychotherapy ($1,094,575), especially phase 2 research into mdma-assisted psychotherapy in subjects with chronic, treatment-resistant ptsd. In this fiscal year, maps treated the 18th subject in our charleston, south carolina mdma/ptsd study in 24 veterans, firefighters and police officers. An 8th subject was treated in our study in boulder, colorado for people suffering from ptsd from any source, a fourth subject was treated in our mdma/ptsd study in beer yaakov, israel, and an irb approved the amendments for our mdma/ptsd study in vancouver, canada. A 7th therapist participated in our mdma-assisted psychotherapy therapist training study. In addition to our core clinical research, this fiscal year we began planning a series of studies in collaboration with researchers who work with the u. S. Department of veterans affairs' national center for ptsd. We'll be exploring the use of mdma along with more traditional psychotherapeutic methods for treating ptsd including cognitive-behavioral conjoint therapy, cognitive processing therapy, and prolonged exposure therapy. We also began our study looking at the safety and efficacy of using mdma-assisted therapy for anxiety in adults on the autism spectrum and began preparations for a study of mdma-assisted psychotherapy for end-of-life anxiety. These studies will grow significantly in the coming year. Mdma-study related program expenses include costs of video data storage and streaming systems development, budgeting, contracting, and meetings; the costs of developing the treatment manual; training therapists; blinded therapist adherence training; and costs of reviewing and documenting all published mdma literature. There are also mdma-study related supervision of therapists, presentation of our data at professional conferences, and costs to manage the mdma purchased early in our work and to secure the drug for phase 3 trials expected to begin in 2016. Clinical research general costs cover the development of the infrastructure needed for our mdma clinical trials, including work with communications and fundraising departments, staff professional development and conferences, and video streaming and statistical software. Most of the clinical research expenses are personnel, including personnel at each study site: principal investigators, co-investigators, independent raters, overnight physicians, attendant, and study coordinators, as well as maps' internal staff: the clinical director, research associates, information specials, data coordinators and statistical consultants. Ibogaine research expenses were dedicated to completing our studies in mexico ($3,816), and new zealand ($6,329). Lsd research expenses ($12,185) were primarily used for the march 2014 publication of our lsd end-of-life anxiety article in the journal of nervous and mental disease. Marijuana research ($14,905) covered the costs of developing the protocol for a pilot study in which marijuana will be tested to manage symptoms in 76 veterans with chronic, treatment-resistant ptsd, and our efforts to end the public health service (phs) review and the national institute of drug abuse (nida) monopoly of the sale of marijuana for clinical research.   education expenses include harm reduction, events, publications and communications programs. Our zendo project provides a supportive space for people undergoing difficult psychedelic experiences in order to help turn those experiences into opportunities for learning and personal growth, and to reduce the number of drug-related psychiatric hospitalizations and arrests. Services were provided at five major events in fiscal year 2014: burning man (black rock city, nv), envision (costa rica), afrikaburn (south africa), bicycle day (san francisco, ca), and lightning in a bottle (bradley, ca). In order to share recent findings and to inspire existing and new support, maps produced events on psychedelic and marijuana research in colorado, vancouver and santa cruz; and attended more than 17 events that others produced, providing speakers, exhibits, sales of books and maps bulletins, and free distribution of clinical protocols and articles from peer-reviewed journals. Communications included publishing three maps bulletins, and 12 email newsletters, maintaining maps. Org, mdmaptsd. Org, mapscanada. Org, psychedelicscience. Org, and launching mdma-autism. Org. Maps produced "manifesting minds," with north atlantic books, reprinted albert hofmann's "lsd: my problem child," and began work with stanislav grof on his new book, "the visionary world of h. R. Giger. " in spring 2014, maps offered its first webinar, "psychedelic science," in collaboration with evolver learning labs. Maps saw significant growth in coverage of its work in social, online, and traditional media. Maps. Org had 511,449 unique visits and 1,809,246 page views. Facebook likes more than doubled to 89,282. Twitter followers increased 140%, to 17,099. Youtube subscriptions increased 256% to 5,313. Maps received 344 unique media mentions from online and print publications with significant reach. Media outlets include the los angeles times, the new york times, the san francisco chronicle, reason, scientific american, cnn, usa today, msnbc, time, associated press, fox news, forbes, nbc news, playboy, santa cruz sentinel, tricycle, business insider, npr, vice, and southern california public radio (kpcc).   this year, maps operationalized its long-running fiscal sponsorship program, clarifying and updating contracts, process, and structure. This program supports projects that are in alignment with maps mission and vision by offering donors a way to give to a 501(c) 3 nonprofit organization. Maps monitors the project budget, takes a small fee, and sends the donor a receipt for their contribution.	Any person whose life may be aided by the transformative nature of psychedelic psychotherapy		Worldwide	MAPS has completed two Phase 2 FDA studies using MDMA-assisted psychotherapy to treat PTSD, and is in the process of four other similar studies. MAPS also has a study looking at LSD-assisted psychotherapy for treating end-of-life anxiety, an outcome study of the benefits of ibogaine for opiate dependence, and a protocol to investigate medical marijuana to relieve symptoms of PTSD.

Because some officers are required to purchase their own safety equipment and often times lack the funding, they risk not having adequate protection. Due to budget cuts, some police agencies do not have the necessary tools to provide appropriate training, which directly impacts the community.

Injured Marine Semper Fi Fund	http://www.SemperFiFund.org	(760) 725-3680	EIN 26-0086305	825 College Blvd Ste 102, PMB 609	Oceanside	CA	92057	USA	Health, Military & Veterans Organizations, Patient & Family Support, Veterans	Marines and Sailors, along with members of the other service branches, who are attached to Marine units, are deployed all over the world protecting and preserving our freedom.  As a result, many are injured in combat operations and in training accidents, or face life threatening illness.         Injury to a service member causes an immediate crisis for his or her entire family; not just emotionally, but also financially.  Depending on the type of injury, recovery can take many months, and rehabilitative care can take years, often in hospitals far from loved ones.  Airplane tickets, food, lodging, car rental, phone bills and lost wages are some of the things that can create an unexpected financial hardship during what is already a very stressful time.	Transitional and long-term assistance - transitional assistance covers many areas that support service members and their spouses, children and caregivers. We provide funds for education and career transition, mentoring (through the veterans 2 veterans program), mentoring for children (semper fi fund kids camp) and other similar programs. We also provide financial assistance during the transition from military to civilian life to cover unexpected costs such as home and car repairs. Long-term support includes a variety of programs and services to address the long-term and sometimes lifelong effects of the service member's injuries. In fiscal year 2015, the semper fi fund provided transitional and long-term assistance grants to approximately 3,000 recipients. For service members with severe injuries such as lost limbs and paralysis, there are a wide range of needs that are required to be able to live with such disabilities. The semper fi fund provides support for specially modified vehicles, specially adapted homes (with features such as roll-in showers, ada-compliant appliances and voice-activated controls for lights and doors) and specialized and adaptive equipment (such as visual enhancement devices for the visually impaired, software programs for those who cannot type, specialized wheelchairs for those who are unable to ambulate and therapeutic mattresses for those with multiple injuries and burns). The semper fi fund also provides service and therapy dogs, paying for the initial acquisition and training and also paying for ongoing and often significant costs such as veterinarian bills and travel costs to allow the dog to travel with the service member. Many returning service members suffer from post-traumatic stress (pts) and traumatic brain injury (tbi), a consequence of exposure to blasts and explosions during deployment. Tbi is now so common that it has been labeled a hallmark of the conflicts in iraq and afghanistan. We recognized the need for specialized assistance for these service members and implemented ptsd and tbi support such as medical equipment (to alleviate some of the symptoms of their injuries), computer tablets (to allow them to more easily keep track of family and medical appointments) and counseling (to aid them in dealing with these invisible injuries).   family assistance - we help hospitalized service members by making sure their family members can be by the bedside to help facilitate recovery. This means covering expenses such as the loss of income for family members, childcare expenses, travel costs and many other needs. By reducing the burden of financial worry for our service members and their families, we allow them to place their energy and focus where it's most needed: on the recovery process. The semper fi fund also provides family assistance when a service member or his or her spouse or child is struggling with a critical, life-threatening illness or injury. In fiscal year 2015, the semper fi fund provided family assistance grants to approximately 3,100 recipients. Family assistance grants also cover times when a service member is back home but suffers a recovery setback that means a return to the hospital. This often occurs due to severe and multiple injuries and can cause short-term financial difficulties due to travel costs, lost income if a spouse or family member needs to be bedside with the service member, childcare costs while the spouse is away, boarding costs for the service member's service dog and many other costs that can quickly become significant. By assisting with such costs, the semper fi fund allows the service member to stay on track with the transition out of the military and back into civilian life and the community. The semper fi fund also provides family assistance when a service member or his or her spouse or child is struggling with a critical, life-threatening illness or injury.   recovery through sport - through team semper fi and team america's fund, the semper fi fund provides encouragement and motivation for service members to establish and achieve individual goals through a wide range of recreational sports and competitive events. These programs provide an exciting outlet and powerful peer support for our wounded service members and their families. In fiscal year 2015, the semper fi fund provided recovery through sport grants to approximately 750 service members. We provide coaches, specialized sporting equipment, team uniforms, entry fees and travel expenses for the injured team members to compete in events across the country and around the world. Team members are also given the opportunity to receive high-level training from former and current olympic and paralympic athletes through a partnership with u. S. Paralympics. Sports and competition programs also give service members a ready-made peer group with a similar background (military service), similar life circumstances (wounded, injured or critical illness) and similar interests (athletics). As service members recover from both physical and mental traumas, peer support and relationships are critical to making healthy progress.

The film is offered for free viewing on youtube. In 2012, living waters release a new documentary called "genius," which used discussion of the lives and statements of the beatles as a backdrop for exploration of people's attitudes toward commission of crimes all as commentary for the condition of man and his sinful nature, and the dire consequences of dying without christ's payment for your sin.

In 2014, we continued to see the popularity of the program grow in our archived youtube viewing (between 4 thousand and 10 thousand per program). We continue to look for more internet media outlets through which to help christians learn to share their faith, and continue looking to take the program to television. The program took a hiatus at the close of 2014, so that we could focus our efforts on our new film project audacity. The comfort zone should resume programming toward the end of 2015.   spanish language outreach (program expenditures - $195,650. 55)this program serves as a means for supporters of the organization to partner with us to have certain evangelistic teaching and resource materials translated in different languages. While we are actively translating some of our simple messages and resources to accessible digital resources, our primary focus remains on translating a wide variety of resources to the spanish language, as is befitting our current area demographic and the explosion of growth in the christian body in latin america. We continue to build our spanish web and television broadcast presence through continued engagement with various broadcast companies. In 2014, living waters continued to work with international broadcasters and supplied them with our current line of spanish language resources. Stations have been added domestically and in southern and central america. We continue to team up with organizations which are able to print and supply our resources locally to people in latin america, so the cost is feasible for the people in those locales. In 2014, the spanish dubbed version of season 3 of our way of the master television program was released, as well as evolution vs god, and two different gospel tracts. The dubbed versions of two more of our films are pending for 2015.

In OneSky's preschools, OneSky-trained teachers use a unique and progressive curriculum that blends principles of the Reggio Emilia approach to early childhood education with contemporary Chinese teaching methods. The program is designed not only to prepare the children (2-7yrs) to succeed in Chinese schools, but also to help develop the 'whole child', to help her attain the positive sense of self so often missing in institutionalized children. OneSky also provides permanent foster families for disabled orphans on or adjacent to orphanage grounds. This project enables children who will never be adopted to grow up knowing the love of a family while also receiving the support services that the welfare institution and OneSky programs provide. In 2015 OneSky launched its Village Model to serve left-behind children 0-6 years old. It's programs include:   Parenting skills and responsive care training, benefitting infants, toddlers, and their preschool-aged siblings, which is delivered to primary caregivers through group trainings at the OneSky Family Center and via weekly home visits. The focus is on providing nurturing care in daily life, with an emphasis on attachment and bonding, brain development and stimulation, and on fostering early communication. The establishment of an early learning center provided for all children in the village, ages 3-6, irrespective of the familys ability to pay. The child-centered curriculum emphasizes using responsive care to improve cognitive, social, emotional development and school readiness. Community engagement geared toward strengthening now disintegrating rural communities and providing a nurturing home for young children despite parental absence by offering trainer-facilitated village gatherings, monthly community projects and cooperative childcare.				We have directly transformed the lives of 126,000 orphaned and abandoned children and trained 13,000 caregivers. Our model has become Chinas national standard for orphan care.

For example, a 21-year-old woman was forced to provide foster care for her newborn niece who was removed from the custody of her mother at birth by authorities because she was born addicted to drugs. With the support of therapy, she was able to cope with the responsibility and provide for her niece emotionally, physically, and financially, and eventually she found an appropriate adoptive home for the child.  Each case management session addressed mental health risk factors while validating parents and providing them with referrals to help them to meet their needs. Case management addressed the mental health of members through counseling, education on community resources, and even long term planning. Case management topics that most frequently reflected member needs include therapy (group and individual) both for members and their children, finances, education, employment, food and housing security, clothing, legal assistance, childcare, domestic violence, and medical care. For new members, referrals were provided as follows:  Childcare: 58 Clothing: 166 Education: 59  Finances: 85 Food: 69 Programs: 166 Medical: 26 Housing: 58  Jobs: 81 Legal: 32

The Choir enriches the cultural fabric of San Diego County through the transformative power of music.	All ensembles perform in two capstone concerts per year at such professional venues as Jacobs Music Center's Copley Symphony Hall and Spreckels Theatre. The choir frequently prepares choristers as vocal soloists for other professional music groups. In recent years our summer touring destinations have included Australia, England/Wales, Germany, Canada/Pacific Northwest, France,and Italy. This performance record is evidence of the quality of the Choir's music education and its artistic excellence.	At San Diego Children's Choir, we believe all children, regardless of circumstances, can benefit from music education, working in a team environment and learning to be goal-oriented. The choir recognizes the importance of music education as it increases literacy, self-esteem and sparks creativity. Our music education programs nurture new ways of thinking, communicating Evaluation and problem solving, which are all acquired skills that researchers have shown can lead to academic and professional success. As more and more schools experience budget cuts and discontinue chorale and music programs, children have nowhere to turn for this important element of their education. SDCC fills this gap. Through our Ensembles, Neighborhood Choir, and Early Years programs, more than 300 children, age four-18, experience the joys of singing each year, and no child is turned away due to financial limitations. In fact, each year 30% of choristers benefit from low to no cost programming through the public support of individuals, corporations and foundations.	Last year, we directly helped more than 300 children, ages four through 18, at sites located throughout San Diego County through early age programming for four and five-year-olds, after-school programs in underserved communities, and core choir programming with four age-based ensembles.	The San Diego Children's Choir is the area's only countywide provider of choral music education. It reaches over 300 children annually because weekly programming is offered at five strategically located sites that reflect San Diego's ethnic and cultural make-up. The choir brings together San Diego County choristers from over 130 schools and 67 zip codes to share in the joy of singing together. To attract children from culturally diverse populations, SDCC prepares and performs a wide crosssection of music for the young voice. Repertoire is selected from many languages, cultures, and periods of history, and represents styles from medieval to modern, classical, folk, and gospel.			
Solve Me Cfs Initiative Inc	http://www.solvecfs.org	(704) 364-0016	EIN 56-1683450	5455 Wilshire Blvd Ste 806	Los Angeles	CA	90036	USA	Health, Specifically Named Diseases, Voluntary Health Associations & Medical Disciplines	The mission of the cfids association of america is for me/cfs to be widely understood, diagnosable and treatable by: identifying safe and effective treatments for me/cfs; strengthening the me/cfs community by empowering patients and engaging greater numbers in our cause; and aggressively expanding funding for research that will lead to approved treatments and cures for me/cfs.	Research - the cfids association has worked over the past 5 years to invest our constituents' donations in our research institute without walls (riww). Our innovative riww continues to provide early funding to the most promising researchers, using our solvecfs biobank to put patients at the center of that research; pairing patient samples and clinical information with the brightest investigators from the best medical institutions in the world. The research institute without walls focuses on: identifying disease subtypes and biomarkers (45%), developing disease-modifying treatments (25%), defining me/cfs (20%) and software tools (10%). Identifying disease subtypes and biomarkers - me/cfs is a multifaceted and complex disease. To discover the cause and effective treatments we must break down the complexity and identify groups of patients that are similar to one another. How is that done? With blood and clinical information. Blood is a 'molecular biopsy' that can provide clues to biology from all parts of the body. The solvecfs biobank harnesses the power of patient information and patient samples. The biobank has attracted some of the brightest investigators from the best medical institutions including harvard, columbia, johns hopkins, university of alberta, nyu langone medical center and university of toronto. Developing disease-modifying treatment - while funding cutting edge research to identify a cause, we are also identifying treatments that can help restore function and alleviate symptoms of me/cfs. While we work towards a cure we must develop disease-modifying treatments. Defining me/cfs - diseases must be clearly and unambiguously defined so that causes, and the cures can be discovered. We partnered with lenny jason of depaul university to use the data from the solvecfs biobank to help refine how me/cfs is defined. This research will help identify the "core signs and symptoms" of me/cfs so that the disease can be measured the same way by all investigators. The cfids association of america is working on a partnership with a real-time online platform where people can connect with fellow patients and expand our capacity for patient centered outcomes research through their shared data. The data can help researchers better understand the nature of the illness, detect patterns, and develop more effective therapies. Partnering, combining,g and growing our community, we will create a big data set of "well-defined and reliable" patient-reported outcome measures to provide evidence of treatment benefit. Managing, understanding and using this kind of big me/cfs data will be key to innovating the effective treatment for me/cfs patients. Software tools - we have partnered with a biotech company to build a digital library - one centralized knowledge base - of all the me/cfs medical literature and all open source biological data sets. This digital library brings the information to one place and translates it into a standard form. Software is under development to integrate this knowledge in order to generate theories that can lead to therapies.   communications and engagement - the association knows that we can't achieve our goals without an informed and connected patient population. Patients are a key ingredient to making me/cfs understood, diagnosable and treatable. To that end, we are working to empower patients with more information through our catalyst cafs, e-newsletters, the solvecfs chronicle publication and online. More than a quarter of a million people visited the cfids association website last year, most searching for answers, looking for hope. The association holds the most extensive library of patient information and resources, reports on the latest updates and research opportunities and helps patients feel less alone. In an effort to make this information easier to find, readily share-able and more deeply engaging we launched a new web presence which replaces the solvecfs biobank micro-site, cfids. Org and the research1st blog with one synthesized online presence. The synergy achieved through www. Solvecfs. Org will reach more patients, engage more in the research process, and better involve all me/cfs stakeholders in the important work of the association. Early numbers tell us that people are staying on the site more than twice as long as they did on the old website - a key indicator that visitors are finding what they need in a more welcoming format. We continue to hold catalyst caf events across the us. Meeting in homes and offices, restaurants and community rooms, association staff members are bringing details about our research program and its impact to people who are most affected by me/cfs.				Since 1987, the Association has invested more than $30 million in programs to end the pain, disability and suffering caused by CFS.

Foundation For a Smokefree America	http://www.Anti-smoking.org		EIN 95-4223462	8117 W Manchester Ave Suite 500	Playa del Rey	CA	90293	USA	Children & Youth, Education, Health, Primary & Elementary Schools, Public Health, Youth Development Programs	Smoking is the single most preventable cause of death and disease. It causes over 390,000 US deaths each year. 90% of all smokers became addicted before reaching age 19. Chances are that most Americans have lost a close family member or friends because of tobacco. The initiation of smoking by young people, and the persistent conflict of interest between the health of Americans and the interests of the tobacco industry, are well-documented problems. The Foundation for a Smokefree America''s mission is to motivate youth to stay tobaccofree, and to empower smokers to quit successfully. The goals of the Foundation are to establish in-house programs to fight tobacco use at the local, regional and national levels, to prevent youth smoking through our websites and school-based educational programs, and to help empower those suffering from tobacco addiction to quit successfully, through our websites and other educational venues, and to enact peer teaching programs, empowering youth to defend themselves against the onslaught of tobacco advertising and peer pressure.	Thanks in part to a major gift from Patricia Henley of $100,000 grant, we were able to make a very significant increase in time and resources devoted to our programs and outreach.

Community Housing Partnership	http://www.chp-sf.org	415-852-5300	EIN 94-3112338	20 Jones Street, Suite 200	San Francisco	CA	94103	USA	Homeless & Housing, Homeless Shelters, Housing Development, Construction & Management, Human Services, Job Training, Vocational Rehabilitation	Community Housing Partnerships mission is to help homeless people secure housing and become self-sufficient.	CHPs integrated services include:  Permanently Affordable Housing: CHP owns and/or manages 11 housing sites in San Francisco with 785 units of housing for formerly homeless adults and children, and 265 new units in the development pipeline. All of CHPs buildings are safe, secure residences with on-site property management and support services that help residents maintain their housing while achieving their greatest potential.  Intensive Wraparound On-site Services: After moving into safe, secure housing, many formerly homeless people face daunting physical and emotional challenges, continuing to grapple with medical, mental health and substance abuse issues. CHPs professional on-site support services and intensive case management staff work to develop productive relationships with residents, and offer an array of services including crisis management, counseling, housing retention, and linkages to health services and community resources.   Treatment and Supportive Housing (TASH): Launched in October 2008, CHPs newest program provides outpatient substance abuse and mental health treatment. Created in response to resident-identified needs, TASHs six-month intensive treatment program integrates harm reduction groups, 12-step meetings, individual counseling, after-care and peer support. With housing retention as the first priority, clients work to identify and address the issues preventing them from achieving their personal goals.  Employment Opportunities: Community Housing Partnership operates job training programs that annually support over 250 residents in addressing barriers, from mental health issues to limited work histories, which stand between them and employment. Designed to prepare participants for realistic and attainable employment, the Maintenance Training Program and Desk Clerk Training Program prepare clients for basic maintenance, property management, and front desk staffing jobs. In addition to job training, we launched Community Housing Partnership Enterprises in 2007, a social enterprise that creates employment by placing graduates in outsourced front-desk staff and maintenance positions in other affordable housing sites within San Francisco.  Community Engagement: People who have been homeless often continue to feel disconnected from their community even after obtaining housing. To increase resident leadership and community engagement, the Community Housing Organizing Program (CHOP) offers internships, trainings and leadership development opportunities, encouraging residents to become active in the broader community while leading safe, healthy lives.	Community Housing Partnership serves people in San Francisco who have experienced homelessness.  All of CHPs residents have suffered homelessness. One hundred percent are extremely low-income, and 98% subsist on less than $15,000 per year. Residents range from infants to elders, and more than 75% are people of color. Four out of five residents have documented disabling conditions due to mental health issues, physical limitations, substance abuse, and/or HIV/AIDS. These health consequences often persist and need attention well after the individual obtains stable housing.			Founded in 1990, Community Housing Partnership (CHP) is the only San Francisco nonprofit organization exclusively dedicated to providing permanent, supportive housing to formerly homeless individuals and families. Community Housing Partnership now owns or manages eleven affordable residential properties comprising 785 units, with an additional 265 units in development. These supportive residences address the needs of seniors, families with young children, emancipating foster youth, and adults with physical or cognitive disorders.  We provide an essential and comprehensive network of services including employment training, job placement, a social enterprise, family and youth programs, substance abuse treatment and community organizing. These services annually impact the lives of 1,800 formerly homeless adults and children by supporting them in retaining their housing and leading stable, productive lives.  We believe that people who were once homeless are uniquely qualified to create solutions that help others break the cycle of homelessness and poverty. Four seats on our 20-member Board of Directors are held by current residents and program participants, and 50% of our over 200 employees were once homeless themselves.   For twenty years, CHP has demonstrated that permanent, supportive housing helps formerly homeless people to transform their lives and makes effective use of public resources. The daily cost for a unit of supportive housing run by CHP is approximately $34, half the $68 required to provide a unit of emergency shelter. Further, supportive housing provides opportunities for people to permanently exit life on the streets and achieve lasting change through accessing community engagement, educational and employment opportunities.  With children in particular, early intervention through stable housing and effective youth programs that build both academic ability and self-esteem services are vital.  Our successful model results in a 98% annual housing retention rate, the highest of any comparable organization in the country, the core metric for success in supportive housing, and the foundation from which individuals, families and San Franciscos most impoverished communities achieve long-term stability.

Hicaliber Horse Rescue Inc	http://www.hicaliber.org	(760) 443-9424	EIN 46-3960722	Po Box 462273	Escondido	CA	92046	USA	Animal Protection & Welfare, Animals	Hicaliber horse rescue is dedicated to the protection and rescue of abandoned and abused horses while emphasizing community education, encouraging compassion and supporting responsible owners.	The hicaliber horse rescue program consists of rescue, community education, and owner supportrescuehicaliber horse rescue saves horses from extreme neglect, horses in jeopardy, and those who are in need of an immediate safe haven when a financial or health crisis strikes their human counterpart. We rescue from auction/slaughter, in partnership with local shelters, off of craigslist postings, through owner surrenders and in partnership with other reputable rescue organizations. Community educationknowledge encourages responsible horse ownership. We are committed to educating the community on topics of compassionate care, horsemanship and training. We welcome debate and discussion on tough, often-avoided topics. Educational posts may be found on our facebook page or on "mc's memos," our founder's blog. Owner supporttransitional boardingone of the ways we fulfill our core value to "support responsible owners" while funding hicaliber horse rescue is by offering owner support to adopters of rescue horses. Many people who rescue, do so sight-unseen and need a little help with basic handling, husbandry, tune-ups, riding evaluations, vet care and/or temporary housing. By offering transitional board to fellow rescuers, we offer a helpful and encouraging environment for owners to get comfortable with their new addition. With on-site trainers, medical staff and our farrier who are readily available to assist where needed, we are able to help adopters establish successful relationships with their horses by working out the "kinks" before they take their animals home. We find that owners are far more confident and prepared after establishing an understanding of the horses needs, habits, and vices while here, where we can help walk them through it. So many times we find ourselves rescuing from the rescuers, and while it's a noble act to ask for help - we like to offer it as well. Horses are unique individuals who each have a history, many times not known to the adopter. More often than not, rescuers find that they got in over their head and don't know where to turn. Sometimes a little support and guidance can make or break a persons decision to keep their horse. If we can encourage long term retention via transitional boarding, the horses are less likely to be bumped around again. Re-homing assistance program there is a never-ending list of reasons a person may need to re-home their horse: the horse requires a higher level of skill than the owner has, behavioral or training issues, health or medical issues, changes in housing or financial crisis, and the list goes on. Horses suffer when they start getting tossed from home to home and can end up finding themselves at auction and facing slaughter. Hicaliber horse rescue offers a safe haven to the horse in need of a new forever home, and the owner who wants to do right by their horse but does not have the knowledge, skill or resources to properly re-home their horse without support. Through our re-homing assistance program, responsible owners surrender the care, custody and control of their horses to hicaliber horse rescue (or may elect for a consignment option). Upon arrival horses are evaluated to ensure they are physically sound and in good health (pain is often the root of many undesired behaviors) and over the course of the month their temperament and training is fully assessed. All horses that come through the re-homing assistance program stay with hicaliber a minimum of 30 days and often longer if needed. It is important that we allow the horses time to settle so that we can see their true personalities, as well as have time to test and train them on a variety of terrains and situations. In many cases, the horses will require training in order to better prepare them for their forever home. We believe seeking help to re-home their horse is the responsible act for many owners, and that responsibility continues through the sponsorship of the board, farrier or necessary medical expenses until the new adoption is finalized. Our hope in offering this unique program is to prevent horses from ending up on craigslist, at auction or given to "a friend of a friend" through traditional sale venues. If you know someone who needs to re-home their horse but doesn't have the time to commit to finding the perfect match, please feel free to refer them to us. We have great references from adopters and owners who have surrendered to us. All horses are placed under the same adoption contract as our rescues. With our prime location, round the clock staffing, liability insurance and amazing volunteers, it really is a win-win situation for all involved.

USA	Discovery Arts was created in 1993 by a group of dedicated arts and entertainment industry professionals who began volunteering their time and talents to bring dance, music, drama and art to children with cancer and serious blood disorders during their hospital stay.   For the first several years, Discovery Arts worked informally with the children hospitalized at Jonathan Jaques Childrens Cancer Center at Millers.  Based upon the success of our programs and the positive responses from the medical staff, the children and their families, Discovery Arts was formally incorporated as a 501(c)(3) non-profit agency in 1998 with a mission to expand the delivery of these experiences to many more children in hospitals throughout Southern California.  All of our programs are offered free of charge to the hospitals, patients and families. With support from individuals, corporations, foundations, a committed circle of monthly donors and an enthusiastic corps of volunteers, Discovery Arts now provides Arts Adventures programs to more than 3,500 critically ill children each year.  We currently deliver our "Arts Adventures" to the children at Mattel Childrens Hospital at UCLA, Millers Childrens Hospital Long Beach, Jonathan Jaques Childrens Cancer Center at Millers, CHOC Children's Hospital, Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical Center, CHOC at Mission and at Mercy Children's Hospital in Springfield, Mo.

Soi Dog Foundation USA	http://www.soidog.org	(415) 509-2972	EIN 27-1600444	2010 15th St	San Francisco	CA	94114	USA	Animal Protection & Welfare, Animals, Philanthropy, Public Foundations	Soi dog foundation usa supports the public education, animal protection and animal welfare efforts of the soi dog foundation a recognized charitable organization based in thailand. The purpose of soi dog foundation usa is to provide information and education to the american public on the plight of animals in and around thailand and the efforts of soi dog foundation to prevent and eliminate animal cruelty, provide medical care, sterilization (spay and neuter), end the dog meat trade and support the foundation's other animal care projects. In addition to providing information and education, soi dog foundation usa solicits financial donations from the american public that are forwarded to soi dog foundation thailand in support of their mission.	Soi dog foundation usa continued supporting soi dog foundation's ongoing animal welfare efforts in phuket and starting in 2012, bangkok. We solicited general (unrestricted) donations to support soi dog's mission and help fund their many ongoing animal care initiatives. For example, funds were used to increase the number of sterilizations in phuket to nearly 18,000 dogs from approximately 14,000 the year prior. At this rate, soi dog hopes to stabilize the street dog population in phuket by 2015. These funds were also used to provide medical care and treatment to stray and neglected dogs and cats, provide food for stray dogs and cats and to shelter to those dogs and cats that could not survive on the streets due to infirmity, illness or age. The funds were also used to provide ongoing support of soi dog's facilities and staff, to continue to combat distemper and other outbreaks, support the new cat hospital that was completed in 2012 where stray cats could be cared for separate from the dogs and to continue with shelter improvements such as the continued building out new dog runs where sheltered dogs could be better segregated by age, disposition and health - a particularly important development for sheltered puppies and older dogs. Finally, another major initiative was to help establish a fully operational soi dog clinic in bangkok. Having a clinic in bangkok not only allows soi dog to care for bangkok street dogs, but also provides a soi dog presence closer to the shelters being built to care for those dogs rescued from the dog meat trade.   another major area where soi dog foundation usa continued to support soi dog was in the ongoing care, treatment and feeding of the countless dogs and cats under soi dog's care in phuket and now bangkok. Donations were solicited to support these efforts through dog and cat sponsorships and a puppy care support sponsorship program. All solicited donations directly tied to these sponsorships were sent to soi dog in the form of block grants by type of sponsorship. Soi dog's efforts to care for the most neglected of animals in phuket and bangkok has made a huge difference in the quality of life of these dogs and cats. Through the ongoing sponsorship program that has nearly 800 active monthly donors in the us, these animals now have safe places to live and are provided with medical care, food and socialization. As a result, soi dog's ability to find forever homes through local and foreign adoptions has grown dramatically. None of this would not be possible without the generous financial support provided through the sponsorship programs.   a major focus for soi dog was combatting the horrific dog meat trade in northern thailand, vietnam and laos. First launched in 2012, soi dog's efforts have had a dramatic impact on this trade. To date, thousands of dogs have been rescued and the trade in the mekong river delta has effectively ceased. Additionally, soi dog in partnership with other animal groups successfully worked towards a regional agreement with se asian countries on rabies prevention that made it illegal to transport live dogs across borders. And while these results are impressive, the need is still great as the fear is that smugglers are finding other routes and/or are slaughtering dogs in thailand for export. In partnership with soi dog, donations were solicited to aid in their efforts. Block grants were made to help soi dog continue in with this vital work. General dog meat trade donations were used to continue to create worldwide awareness of this cruel and inhumane trade, work with local authorities and government officials to stop the dog smuggling and rescue dogs from the trade. An important development this past year to raise global awareness behind soi dog's efforts was the "i didn't know" campaign. Through this viral video and outreach, donations were solicited to purchase billboards in thailand to bring the issue of the dog meat trade to the forefront among thailand's population in the northern part of the country. This effort garnered incredible support and as a result of the poster campaign, awareness of the issue in thailand is at an all time high.

Kiva.org: Loans that Change Lives	http://www.kiva.org	(415)-358-7500	EIN 71-0992446	3180 18th Street Suite 201	San Francisco	CA	94110	USA	Economic Development, International, International Economic Development, Microfinance, Promotion of International Understanding	Kiva's mission is  to connect people through lending for the sake of alleviating poverty.  Kiva is the world's first person-to-person micro-lending website, empowering individuals to lend directly to unique entrepreneurs in the developing world.  The people you see on Kiva's site are real individuals in need of funding - not marketing material. When you browse entrepreneurs' profiles on the site, choose someone to lend to, and then make a loan, you are helping a real person make great strides towards economic independence and improve life for themselves, their family, and their community. Throughout the course of the loan (usually 6-12 months), you can receive email journal updates and track repayments. Then, when you get your loan money back, you can relend to someone else in need.  Kiva partners with existing expert microfinance institutions. In doing so, we gain access to outstanding entrepreneurs from impoverished communities world-wide. Our partners are experts in choosing qualified entrepreneurs. That said, they are usually short on funds. Through Kiva, our partners upload their entrepreneur profiles directly to the site so you can lend to them. When you do, not only do you get a unique experience connecting to a specific entrepreneur on the other side of the planet, but our microfinance partners can do more of what they do, more efficiently.  Kiva provides a data-rich, transparent lending platform. We are constantly working to make the system more transparent to show how money flows throughout the entire cycle, and what effect it has on the people and institutions lending it, borrowing it, and managing it along the way. To do this, we are using the power of the internet to facilitate one-to-one connections that were previously prohibitively expensive. Child sponsorship has always been a high overhead business. Kiva creates a similar interpersonal connection at much lower costs due to the instant, inexpensive nature of internet delivery. The individuals featured on our website are real people who need a loan and are waiting for socially-minded individuals like you to lend them money.	Kiva.org is the first person-to-person micro-lending Web site, creating a way for individuals to connect with and make personal loans to small businesses in developing countries.  Kiva.org partners with microfinance institutions across the globe, giving them access to Kiva.org's website to post their funding needs for loans to micro-entrepreneurs.  Individuals across the globe fund these loans by sending payment via PayPal.  Repaid loans are returned to individual lenders.

We are a non-profit organization devoted to finding loving new homes for unwanted and abandoned cats and kittens.   We are equally dedicated to giving the public vital information about responsible pet ownership, care of kittens and cats, managing feral cats, and most importantly, the importance of spaying and neutering. Our website at www.kittenrescue.org features information on cat rescue, care, and adoption for animal lovers all over the world.  The majority of our cats are cared for in foster homes until they are placed with adopters, who are screened carefully to ensure the stability and quality of an animal's new environment. Before going home, each cat or kitten is fixed, tested for Feline Leukemia and FIV, vaccinated, dewormed, treated for fleas and microchipped.  We also provide full medical care for the cats in our care until they are adopted.  In March 2006 Kitten Rescue purchased the Kitten Rescue Sanctuary, a private, no-kill shelter and boarding facility in Atwater Village, that can  house up to 150 cats. In 2016, we converted the front house of the Kitten Rescue Sanctuary to a full time Nursery, where we care for orphaned, unweaned kittens around the clock. Unweaned kittens brought into city shelters are euthanized within hours of intake if a foster home or rescue group cannot be found. The Nursery has increased our lifesaving ability tremendously.  Kitten Rescue is a member of NKLA (NO-KILL LOS ANGELES), an initiative led by Best Friends Animal Society, bringing together passionate individuals, city shelters and an entire coalition of animal welfare organizations to end the killing of pets in L.A. city shelters simply because they don't have safe places to call home.

Very often our support line is used as a safe space for survivors to openly share details of their lives including the abuse they survive. As peer counselors, our role is to support them. Many times a survivor just needs someone to listen without judging, to help them better understand their experience, and to validate their feelings and choices. During drop-in support times, survivors of domestic violence, their friends and/or their family members can meet with a trained advocate for in-person support. In this meeting, we provide peer counseling, safety planning, and referrals. Additionally, survivors, their friends and/or family can learn more about W.O.M.A.N., Inc. services. We offer both ongoing individual therapy and family therapy for survivors with their children. Therapy services are offered in English and Spanish and are provided by trained MFT Interns and Trainees who are supervised by a licensed psychotherapist. Low-cost weekly sessions are based on a sliding scale. Led by trained facilitators, our peer support groups offer a safe space for survivors of domestic violence to share their experience with and gain insight from each other. In these groups, survivors are invited to explore their feelings, receive and offer support, and gain important tools needed to heal from the effects of violent relationships. Our groups include practical information about the dynamics of abuse. We often use art and other expressive modalities in our groups. We also have a Latina Program which offers in-depth case management to Spanish-speaking survivors of domestic violence, and works to support survivors in a culturally appropriate setting. Working collaboratively with a team member, the survivor creates short and long-term goals designed to help overcome the obstacles preventing them from creating a life free of violence.

Kaeme	http://kaeme.org	(801) 971-2171	EIN 27-0833467	PO Box 1544	Palo Alto	CA	94302	USA	Children & Youth, Children & Youth Services, Human Service Organizations, International, International Relief, Youth Development Programs	Our mission is two-fold: to build families and protect vulnerable children by creating an Internet database of child profiles; and to provide service volunteers with a deeply meaningful experience that will remain with them for a lifetime.	Our Kaeme top priorities are to:      Reunify children with extended families whenever possible, through the use of information compiled in child profiles and the support of donor sponsorships.     Facilitate fostering or adoption when reunification is not possible.     When no family care option can be found for a child use donor sponsorships to otherwise support happy and healthy childhoods for children currently housed in orphanages.     Provide volunteers with the support and opportunities required to allow them to significantly impact the lives of vulnerable children.	UNICEF estimates that there are 1.1 million orphans living in Ghana along with thousands of vulnerable children. Many of these children live in poor conditions, deprived of the basic physical, emotional and intellectual support required for a healthy childhood.The Ghanaian Department of Social Welfare currently estimates that up to 80% of children living in institutions are there as a result of poverty and can be reunited with their families if appropriate support is provided. These are potential families in the making.However, many barriers stand in the way of building new families and reuniting existing families. Poor record-keeping, under-resourced welfare agencies and the logistical challenges inherent in matching a child to a family often prevent children from entering or returning to family-based care.  Kaeme works to reduce these barriers, offering more children the chance to grow up in a loving home.	Each year we build profiles on 200-400 children, providing social workers the information necessary to reunite these children with their families or place them in family-based care.	We work in Ghana, West Africa, where one of the most pressing concerns is the care of orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) within the country. Numerous factors, including the AIDS epidemic and the increasing social pressures of urbanization and modernization, have led to the growth of this at-risk population. This trend is expected to continue in the future, increasing the need to develop sustainable models for assisting these children.In Ghana, few of the 150+ orphanages have legally registered with the country's Department of Social Welfare, making it difficult to monitor the OVC population. A 2006 census conducted by the Ghanaian Department of Social Welfare into the number of children housed in institutions, the conditions in these homes, and the shortfalls of the existing care system.In face of an international recognition that institutionalized care fails to meet children's developmental needs, Ghana also passed the Orphan and Vulnerable Child Care Reform Initiative (CRI) in 2006. The DSW is charged with enforcing the CRI, which emphasizes that institutions should be temporary homes of last resort for children. Additionally, the CRI lays out a number of new regulations and guidelines for both institutional and foster care.	We have completed over 1,800 child profiles at 44 orphanages. 28 service volunteers have spent 2,900 man-hours working in Ghana.

At its heart is the belief that every individual, regardless of ability, can be a productive member of the community and benefit from the social support offered by one's peers.  We hope that someday people with special needs will be fully included in society, replacing social isolation, bullying, and loneliness with acceptance, participation, and friendship.   The Friendship Circle in San Diego held its first event in 2005, welcoming more than 20 program participants, their families and volunteers.  Since then, Friendship Circle has grown to over 200 teen volunteers, 30 college-age volunteers, and 100 professional adult volunteers and serves over 100 families who have members with special needs.   While medical research is finding cures for disease, the prevalence of disabilities is increasing. Society is struggling to accommodate the needs of people with disabilities and there has been real progress. The Americans with Disabilities Act, mainstreaming of students in classrooms, government agencies and national non-profit organizations are all working hard to level the playing field through legislation, funding, and health services. But friendship is not on their to do list. For The Friendship Circle, it is the ONLY thing on the to do list.

Today Kimberly Moore has adopted the wishes of over 35,000 children in the community surprising each one at their doorstep with food, groceries, clothing, furniture, school supplies, computers, educational scholarships and more.  Better Minds Through Reading - We believe that every child should have access to books and the opportunity to build their own home library.

Hope Ambassador program: The Kimberly Moore Foundation grooms a select group of teen leaders who wish to pay it forward to activate their own communities in making a difference.

Food First Programs: A Three-pronged Approach In an effort to integrate our work for food sovereignty across rural-urban and local-global arenas, nationally and internationally, Food First divides its work into three Program Areas:  1. Building Local Agri-Foods Systems  In the United States, the livelihood struggles of low-income, African-American, Native-American, Latino-American, Asian-American and immigrant communities are at the center of our programs for food justice and agricultural sustainability. Low-income people of color are mobilizing locally, forming national coalitions, drafting legislation, and reaching out internationally in their efforts to build healthy, equitable, food systems that contribute to the social and economic development of their communities. The main challenge to obtaining healthy affordable food in low-income communities is overcoming the ?industrial agri-foods divide? that separates sustainable producers from low-income consumers.  Food First?s ?added value? in this effort resides in our ability to produce information, analysis and learning materials that help people improve and control their own food systems. Our research informs and documents these experiences, contributing directly to the national and global debates on food and development. In Oakland, California, we are working closely with local food activists to establish a Food Policy Council. As part of this partnership, we will carry out a Market Gap Study in West Oakland, a study of Food Policy Councils: Lessons Learned, and an Assessment of Bay Area Food System Assessments. Nationally, Food First is participating in efforts to build a national coalition of urban communities of color for food security.  2. Farmers Forging Food Sovereignty  Dismantling the industrial agri-foods complex at the local food system level must be accompanied by the construction of alternatives that suit the needs of small-scale producers and low-income consumers, worldwide. Farmers Forging Food Sovereignty focuses on farmer alternatives to corporate control over production and consumption. The strategy is to help farmer movements for food sovereignty and sustainable agriculture document and share their alternatives among broad sectors of the rural and urban population to create political will and advance peasant-led food system alternatives. Our active projects in this program area include: The Campesino a Campesino GMO Education Project in Mexico and Central America, and our coalition work with Va Campesina.  3. Democratizing Development: Land, Resources and Markets  Social movements in the Global South are fighting for indigenous and peasant rights, land reform, sustainable agriculture, clean water, fair prices for agricultural goods, and freedom from foreign ?dumping? and GMO contamination.  This program area focuses on the structural causes of hunger and poverty, and bridges the gap between transnational advocacy and local control over food system resources. Like other program areas it links critiques of the corporate-dominated food systems with farmer and consumer-led alternatives that ensure justice, equity and ecological sustainability. Our projects include the campaign for African Alternatives to the Gates-Rockefeller Alliance for a Green Revolution, and No full tanks with Empty Bellies: The Food and Fuel Sovereignty Campaign, and El Camino del Migrante: Immigrants and the Struggle for Food Sovereignty.

Through programs that offer early intervention, education, recreation, and rehabilitation, Junior Blind helps thousands of infants, children, teens and adults learn essential skills to help them maximize their potential and achieve their goals.	Children's residential program - historically, junior blind's children's residential program serves as a home for 40 multi-disabled blind children, ages five to 21, whose severe special needs had proven to great for their families or caregivers. But, following a recent change in federal law mandating that all regional center-referred children move to smaller, single-family home settings, junior blind began strategizing ways to comply with this legislation, while continuing to serve children need through our on-campus, medically-supported residential building. Junior blind took this opportunity to fill a critical niche, and now uses its children's residential program facility to serve foster youth who are medically fragile, referred to junior blind by the department of children and family services, whose medical and emotional needs are not adequately being met by their biological or even foster families. Our children's residential program served 63 residents during the year. 80 percent of these residents demonstrated an increase in their educational performance and/or school attendance and 80 percent achieved at least 4 out of 5 of their individualized service plan goals.   group home residential program - in response to the aforementioned changes in federal mandates regarding regional center residential placements of individuals with moderate-to-severe disabilities, junior blind opened six group homes. Each single-family home houses up to six children or six young adults who are multi-disabled, offering them round the clock care. All of our group homes are conveniently located in our south los angeles neighborhood so that they are near enough to junior blind that young residents can benefit from attending our special education school and all residents may make use of our recreational facilities. The group homes residential program served 33 residents during the year. Further, residents will be close enough to campus to access our fully staffed 24-hour medical center in case of an emergency. Since moving to a home setting, 81 percent of residents demonstrated improved communication skills and a reduction in their negative behaviors.   special education school - junior blind's special education school offers children and youth, ages five to 21, who are visually impaired and/or have multiple disabilities a safe and positive environment for learning and growth. Teachers work with students to develop their communication, mobility and independent living skills. In the past year, our special education school served 54 children. Of these, 84 percent met their individualized goals in independent living skills and 82 met their goal in improved social interaction and behavior.

Each One Reach One	http://www.eoro.org		EIN 94-3374997	146 South Spruce Ave	South San Francisco	CA	94080	USA	Adult & Child Matching Programs, Arts & Culture, Arts, Culture & Humanities, Arts Education, Arts Services, Children & Youth	EORO was founded by Robin Sohnen to respond to her home county of San Mateo County''s lack of creative diversion programs for incarcerated youth. Our Legacy: Independence and Empowerment; transforming the lives of kids behind bars. Since 1997, EORO has offered artistic and educational opportunities inside juvenile detention facilities, pre-release and post-release planning, organized community participation in the juvenile justice system, and promoted collaboration among the system''s various components. Each One Reach One (EORO) believes that youth behind bars are kids, first and foremost; that one-on-one mentoring through the creative act of playwriting and academic tutoring provides the best way to positively influence the beliefs that incarcerated youth hold of themselves and that society holds of them. EORO believes that young people have the right to learn from their mistakes, that they need to be encouraged to take responsibility for building a better future for themselves, and that education is the tool that can transform their lives. We support their efforts to transform their lives through theatre arts experiences and academic tutoring; reinforcing their ability to develop into productive members of our community. EORO History - Each One Reach One (EORO) began in 1997, as an advocacy organization to divert incarcerated kids and kids on probation from a life in prison. Over the past decade, EORO has evolved into a unique non-profit that organizes the community to participate in diversion programs serving detained youth. EORO conducts artistic, literacy and post-release services programs inside juvenile detention facilities that annually engage over 100 community members in the juvenile justice system as individual mentors, educational tutors, paintersand actors while promoting cooperation and collaboration among the systems various components. In 1998, EORO began exploring the potential use of experiential arts programs as an intervention strategy for teenagers at the highest risk of spending their adult lives in prison and conducted our first Playwriting program in May, 1998. In 2000, EORO formed a Board of Directors and secured non-profit status. In 2002, EORO formed ADAPT (A Dream and A Plan for Tomorrow), a partnership that currently includes representatives of the San Mateo County Office of Education, the San Mateo Juvenile Probation Department, Youth Service Center staff, and JobTrain. In 2002, San Franciscos primary juvenile detention facility-the Juvenile Justice Center (JJC), contracted with EORO to conduct playwriting workshops. Soon afterwards, EORO began exploring ways to replicate ADAPT in San Francisco County. In 2004, EORO built a partnership with the San Francisco County Office of Educations Woodside Learning Center, the San Francisco Juvenile Probation Department, JJC staff and the University of San Francisco and the Youth Guidance Center Improvement Committee, which conducts an extensive post-release GED program. In 2005, we began conducting ADAPT at JJCs maximum-security boy''s unit. Since 1998, EORO''s programs have served almost1100 high-risk youth.	A Dream and A Plan for Tomorrow (ADAPT) attempts to reduce recidivism by addressing the academic needs of incarcerated youth and by providing post-release services that link youth to community resources that assist them to identify job training and employment opportunities before they are released. In ADAPT's tutoring component, the youth work one-on-one with academic tutors/mentors to pursue a General Education Diploma (GED). A GED can open the doors to educational and employment opportunities for youth who do not have the necessary credits to graduate from high school. Playwriting Workshops, where youth work one-on-one with a theater professional to write an original, one-act play. Through this creative process, youth examine their life choices as well as their attitudes, opinions and values. Each playwriting workshop concludes with a staged reading of the scripts by professional actors before a live audience comprising the youth's parents, peers, teachers, caseworkers and invited members of the public. These readings have proven to be transformative: for many of the youth, it is the first time they have experienced success or had their accomplishments publicly recognized. Healthy Choices Life-Skills Program for Girls is a new health education and life skills program for girls detained at the Youth Services Center in San Mateo. Facilitated by a case manager, the program consists of classes on topics such as self-esteem, employment, relationships and health. The Expressive Painting Program uses the power of arts to heal hearts and transform lives. We employ Process Oriented Painting which teaches youth to explore, process and express their emotions in constructive and creative ways.Each Painting Program concludes with a Art Show of the student's work inside the detention facility for an invited audience. The young girls at the Youth Services Center receive virtually no programming while detained. Advocacy and Collaboration: EORO advocates within and collaborates with the various components of the juvenile justice system, school districts and institutional staff to provide innovative programs that improve outcomes for detained youth and better coordination among the system's various components. EORO's submission of bill ideas to Assemblyman Mullin regarding the special academic need for older incarcerated youth resulted in the passage of Assembly Bill 622 in 2007. This Bill allows California's Counties Offices of Education to provide one hour of GED preparation classes each day during school hours to youth detained in juvenile and mental health institutions, who will not graduate from high school, and lowers the age that detained youth across the State can receive a GED certificate from 18 to 17. After two years of EORO campaigning and working closely with, the San Francisco Unified School District and the Juvenile Justice Center, we began GED testing on site for youth incarcerated at the JJC.

Community Alliance for Learning	http://www.writercoachconnection.org	510.280.5640	EIN 91-2144555	1191 Solano Avenue #6098	Albany	CA	94706	USA		Community Alliance for Learning (CAFL), through its WriterCoach Connection (WCC) program, helps public-school students develop their writing and critical thinking skills.  WCC mobilizes communities to support their public schools in this mission by recruiting and training community volunteers to work with middle- and high-school students one on one, in class, on their classroom writing assignments. We believe that clear writing and critical thinking are essential to students' success in school, in the workplace, and in life.	WriterCoach Connection,  the sole program of the nonprofit Community Alliance for Learning, trains community volunteers to work one-on-one with students, in class, on their teachers' writing assignments. Every student in a class we serve has an individual writer coach throughout the school year.	WCC helps middle school and high school students develop their writing and critical-thinking skills.	For 2013-14, 2,230 students at ten schools in four school districts raised their writing proficiency with 18,808 individual writing conferences delivered by 723 trained community-volunteer writer coaches. The program is serving additional students and teachers for 2014-15, with expansion to Kennedy High School in Richmond and within Berkeley High.	WCC serves 11 schools in four East Bay districts, working with students in Richmond, El Cerrito, Albany, Berkeley, and Oakland.	Founded in 2001 at Berkeley High School with 35 volunteer coaches serving 180 students, the program has expanded over the years and for 2014-15, 750 volunteer coaches are serving more than 2,000 students at 11 schools in four East Bay school districts.  WCC  has trained more than 2,500 community volunteers, serving more than 25,000 students with more than  175,000 individual writing conferences.   Year after year, WCC has improved the quality of student writing, increased students ability to complete state standards-based assignments,  helped raise students grades, helped teachers strengthen the writing curriculum, and given volunteers great satisfaction, according to systematic annual assessment surveys. (The 2013-14 WCC Assessment Report is available at writercoachconnection.org/results/html.)  These annual surveys of all the students, teachers, and volunteer coaches who participate in the program provide a benchmark for measuring success. The students' and teachers' surveys, all of which invite written comments as well as numerical ratings, are designed to monitor perceptions of the coaches' helpfulness in key areas, such as organizing ideas, understanding what's working, and understanding the assignment. The coaches' survey probes their degree of satisfaction with their coaching experience and their training, and encourages them to express any concern or discomfort. The Program Assessment Reports, tabulated and analyzed by schools as well as in the aggregate, are overseen by Research and Evaluation Consultant Krystal Dong, Ph.D. Site coordinators and trainers as well as program administrators use these reports to monitor the effectiveness of the program and to identify new challenges at new coaching sites.    These annual program assessments consistently demonstrate that WCC generates overwhelming support among students, teachers, and volunteers. Year after year, surveys show that WCC improves the quality of student writing, increases students ability to complete state standards-based assignments,  helps raise students grades, helps teachers strengthen the writing curriculum, and gives volunteers great satisfaction, In the most recent assessment surveys, 93% of students responded that coaching was helpful, and all teachers, without exception, reported that coaching was beneficial for their students. Teachers observe that the program helps all students to become better writers, and that it is especially helpful to struggling writers.   Wherever possible, WCC also compiles hard data, which demonstrates the program is helping to produce successful academic outcomes, from district-wide writing assessments,  WCC's own writing assessment tests, and standardized English Language Arts tests. The California High School Exit Exam (CAHSEE), which includes a separately scored essay component, provides a strong objective measure of students' writing skills.

MODEL Invisible Children focuses exclusively on the LRA conflict through an integrated four-part model that addresses the problem in its entirety: immediate needs and long-term effects.

Summer Search has a uniquely successful four-pronged approach that supports students so they finish high school and go to college, and then helps them be successful in the real world, while encouraging them to give back in the process. We hold our students accountable for themselves while supporting them for the long haul.  Our leadership program services include:  - Individual weekly mentoring sessions with highly trained staff mentors, from sophomore year to high school graduation. Students are expected to be in weekly contact with Summer Search.  - Full scholarships to two summer experiential education programs, after sophomore and junior years.

Summer Search students must demonstrate 1) reflection, an interest in learning about themselves, 2) altruism, a care and desire to help others and give back and 3) performance, a commitment to doing their best in school, in their family and community.

We strive to act in and advocate for the best interest of animals, and we respond to the individual needs of animals.  We work with passion and compassion, and we believe that animals should be treated with dignity and respect as feelings creatures.  We strive to create an environment where there is mutual care, trust, and respect.  Each year thousands of animals pass through our doors. We provide a warm bed, nutritious food, veterinary care and a gentle touch for the lost, stray, unwanted and injured domestic and wild animals in our community. We accept all animals, and often provide a second chance to the most needy animals who would otherwise be turned away at smaller adoption agencies that accept only those animals deemed highly adoptable.	In addition to rescuing animals in need, providing a safe sanctuary for stray or unwanted animals and ultimately finding new, permanent homes, the Peninsula Humane Society & SPCA offers these programs: low-cost (in some cases, free) spay/neuter for owned pets; rehabilitation for sick, injured and orphaned wildlife from San Francisco through Northern Santa Clara County; education programs, camps, tours and shadow programs for schoolchildren; a range of obedience classes taught indoors by outstanding instructors; private behavior consultations; birthday parties for 6-12 year-olds; temporary sheltering for pets belonging to domestic abuse victims (they must be referred to us by a domestic abuse shelter); a monthly Pet Loss Grief Support Group; temporary sheltering for pets displaced following local disasters (such as the San Bruno gas explosion); a monthly, low-cost vaccination clinic; no-appointment microchips.

Bay Area we accept every animal, regardless of that animals health, age, behavior, and even regardless of the animals species. We are truly an Open Door facility.  Despite that unusual fact and the obvious challenges it creates, PHS/SPCA guarantees a home for 100% of the healthy, adoptable dogs and cats we receive, with animals now able to remain at the shelter and receive love, care and attention for the days, weeks, months, even a year or longer it may take until a new permanent home and family is found.  We continue to increase the numbers of pets treated and then adopted through  our Hope Program which focuses life-saving efforts to an ever growing percentage of the animals who come to us sick, injured, too young to be away from their mothers, or behaviorally challenged.   Every year, PHS/SPCA saves the lives of thousands of animals: homeless, injured, orphaned, unwanted, lost, abandoned and often mistreated animals,  including dogs and cats and other companion animals, farmed animals, exotic animals, and native wildlife.  We have reduced euthanasia in San Mateo County by more than 95% since 1970 and continues year after year to push ahead, making this among the safest and best places in the nation for companion animals.  All of this wonderful work made possible, in part, through the support of over 1,400 active volunteers and more than 24,000 local contributing families and households.

It started with a simple email to the CEO of 24 Hour Fitness. We are now trying to raise money to cover the shipping of care packages overseas to our deployed military.   The average deployed military individual loses 50 pounds of body weight per deployment (information from the United States Marine Corp). Our goal is to keep this from happening by providing protein bars, muscle milk and vitamin supplements to as many military individuals as possible to maintain their physical well being and mental sharpness. By doing so, we are increasing the odds of our military not only doing their physical and mental best as they fight for our country but also coming home to their families and loved ones in better shape than in the past wars when these products were not readily available.

La Casa De Las Madres	http://www.lacasadelasmadres.org	415-503-0500	EIN 94-2330864	1663 Mission St Ste 225	San Francisco	CA	94103	USA	Crime & Law, Domestic Violence, Family Violence Shelters, Homeless & Housing, Spouse Abuse Prevention, Unknown	The mission of La Casa de las Madres is to respond to calls for help from domestic violence victims, of all ages, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. We give survivors the tools to transform their lives.  We seek to prevent future violence by educating the community and by redefining public perceptions about domestic violence.	Domestic violence victims must be able to access safety as well as services supporting their transition to a violence free life.  La Casa provides that bridge for battered women, teens and children seeking to escape abuse in their intimate partnerships.  Our comprehensive services are multilingual, with specific  English/Spanish capacity, and completely free of charge.  Our expert intervention and prevention services reach more than 50,000 community members each year.  Calling a crisis line is often the first step for a victim of domestic violence to reach out for help.  Through our two (2) 24-hour Crisis Phone Lines we are able to provide callers with statewide, toll-free support, crisis counseling and information about community resources and services.    La Casa Family Advocates are also on-site with the San Francisco Police Department's Domestic Violence Response Unit, at what is often the first point of access for domestic violence victims.  Through the Domestic Violence Response Team, our Advocates accompany officers in responding to crime scene calls, follow up on police and medical reports indicating violent crimes against women, and assist medical personnel responding to abuse.  Advocates provide crisis intervention and help professionals to identify victims needs, encourage victims safety and facilitate their access to services.  Skilled legal service coordination also ensures victims civil legal needs, like restraining orders, receive immediate attention.  La Casa also has the capacity to shelter and provide comprehensive advocacy and support services to 35 women and children per night.  Our 8-week Emergency Shelter Program emphasizes independent living skills and individual counseling, support groups and vocational/educational referrals to reverse the isolation caused by domestic violence.  Family Advocates assist each woman and her children with counseling, referrals, court and social service accompaniment, advocacy re legal, housing, job training and placement, financial and medical needs.  The shelter program also utilizes family-based interventions, working with women and their children together as a family unit to strengthen families in crisis and break the intergenerational cycle of violence.  Our collaborative model supports mothers in providing positive and developmentally enriching experiences for their children through mother/child playgroups; individual counseling; art and movement therapies; and day care, after-school and day camp programs.    Through the Drop-In Counseling Center La Casa is able to meet the initial and ongoing needs of battered women and their children.  Drop-In Counseling Center staff provide individual counseling and facilitate support groups for women who have left the shelter but wish to continue their counseling sessions and women who are not seeking emergency shelter, but who wish to address the impact of domestic violence on their lives. Child-centered clinical counseling is also available through La Casas Intern Program and in collaboration with San Francisco General Hospitals nationally-reknowned Child Trauma Research Project.  In addition, resource advocacy, referrals, emergency food and clothing are available.    The Safe Havens Project, a collaboration with the San Francisco Unified Family Court and Saint Francis Memorial Hospitals Rally Visitation Program, enables La Casa to address the needs of domestic violence victims as they develop and implement custody arrangements with their batterers.  La Casas Advocate assists survivors in realizing shared custody and visitation schedules, where they are ordered by the Court, that prioritize the parent and childrens safety while providing support navigating what can be an intimidating and punitive system.    La Casas Teen Program provides adolescent-appropriate intervention and prevention services to battered and at-risk youth and their children/siblings.  Using La Casa's basic service model, counselors assist each teen client with individual counseling, support groups, court and social service accompaniment, advocacy regarding legal, housing, financial and medical needs, and referrals for job training and placement.  Our Teen Advocates are available at our Drop-In Counseling Center and also hold counseling hours at nine (9) San Francisco high schools to facilitate support for adolescents.  Interaction focuses on helping teens recognize potentially abusive relationships, better understand what creates a healthy relationship, and gain an understanding of how the "Cycle of Violence" may apply to their lives.  La Casa's on-site Case Management Programs support up to 158 residents of two single womens transitional/permanent housing facilities in the Tenderlointhe Mary Elizabeth Inn and Verona Hotel.  Offering housing stability and emotional support services, the case managers provides advocacy, counseling and referrals to help formerly homeless residents sustain independent housing, build skills and community, and continue to move through the healing process, while building permanently violence free lives.  The Safe Housing Project is working to empower residents of San Franciscos permanent supportive housing sites to create communities that foster and demand violence free lives.  Originating from the San Francisco Family Supportive Housing Network member sites articulated need to systematically address domestic violence, the program brings La Casas expertise onsitethrough widespread outreach, staff and resident education, community-building efforts, site-specific direct service designs and relevant policy review and advocacyto raise awareness of abuse, its effects and alternatives, provide tailored support, and help residents build a community, from within, that does not tolerate violence.    An integral adjunct to our direct services, La Casas Community Education and Outreach Program provides outreach to media, schools, corporations and community groups.  Program activities seek to prevent domestic violence among teens and adults, give voice to silenced victims of domestic violence, and motivate social change through community education and public awareness.	Domestic violence is a crime that affects all members of society regardless of race, culture, economic class, educational background, age, sexual orientation or physical ability.  Accordingly, La Casas services are available to all domestic violence victims and survivors.    To facilitate access, we also actively strive to reach underserved and vulnerable groups including women of color, low income families, young mothers, youth aging out of foster care, immigrants, monolingual non-English speakers (particularly Spanish), LGBTQQI, the geographically isolated, and women with disabilities.	14,386	Women, children and Teens in the bay area	Our success is two-tiered. Each time a contact is made, educational presentation given, the crisis line rings or someone requests counseling we are successful. There are many choices to be made by a person seeking to address or escape violence in his or her life. Each step is invaluable in what is usually an incremental move toward safety. We measure this impact by tracking services and participants.  In FY 2009-10, La Casa de las Madres services were utilized as follows:   4,295 callers received crisis counseling, resources and referrals through our statewide, toll-free Adult and Teen Crisis Lines;   893 domestic violence victims accepted Domestic Violence Response Team crisis or follow-up assistance;      -Among them, 136 accessed DVRT legal assistance in pursuing a restraining order;   219 women and 206 children received emergency shelter and support services;    474 women and families received practical and emotional support through the Drop-In Counseling Center;      -Among them, 46 families received specific assistance with custody and visitation;   212 adolescents participated in individual and group activities of the Teen Program;   the MEI Case Management Program provided housing stability, community-building and emotional support services to 177 residents of the Mary Elizabeth Inn and Verona Hotel;    the Safe Housing Project worked with staff and residents of 75 Bay Area supportive housing sites and provided direct intervention to resident women and families; and    430 community education and outreach activities educating 7,907 teens and adults and reaching more than 49,000 community members were undertaken.   We also strive to offer services wherein victims can immediately access needed support, be safe, and build a stable foundation from which to start or continue an independent life free from abuse. So we are successful when we have provided a timely, relevant response; alleviated crisis; and facilitated improved quality of life through an increased sense of safety, prevention of homelessness, and encouragement of thriving. To determine if we are reaching milestones and benchmarks specific to each program, we solicit feedback in periodic surveys and exit interviews about experiences with services, what has worked or is not working.  A sample of results include:  94% of women exited emergency shelter with an increased sense of self-efficacy, and  were better able to identify the warning signs of a dangerous relationship.  Among adult Drop In Center participants, 92% felt better able to advocate for themselves and/or their childrens needs in the community.  Among moms engaging in clinical child-focused trauma interventions at the drop in center 84% reported their children exhibited more positive attachment and/or improved behavior.  Finally, among teen educational session participants, 91% agreed that, in a relationship, everyone is responsible for their own behavior; and 2% requested individualized follow up services.

We put government information into the hands of citizens, linking money and politics to the specific issues people care about in order to build public pressure for accountability and reform. We believe that democracy works best when lawmakers represent the publics interests rather than the interests of a wealthy few. Our groundbreaking transparency website combines campaign contributions, federal lobbying data, data on industry support and opposition of bills, and data on how legislators votes, providing citizens, journalists, and advocacy groups with the transparency tools to hold government accountable. Influence connections that once took days or weeks of research to uncover are now available at the click of a mouse.	MapLight operates a groundbreaking transparency website combining campaign contributions, federal lobbying data, data on industry support and opposition of bills, and data on how every legislator votes on every bill before the U.S. Congress and California state legislature. Our database makes influence connections that once required weeks of research to uncover available at the click of a mouse, giving citizens tools to hold government accountable. We conduct original research using our database and work closely with journalists, advocacy groups, and citizens to get money and politics data in the news and into public debate. MapLight is also proud to operate Voter's Edge, a one-stop shop for information on candidates and ballot measures in federal, state, and local elections.				MapLight has proven to be a powerful force in the government transparency and accountability movement. Since being founded in 2005, MapLight has reached over 300 million people with our data highlighting the impact of political influence, via 11,000 stories in local, national, and international media outlets. In addition to raising awareness and boosting advocacy campaigns, our research has galvanized civic action: for example, our report on the industry money behind a bill to expand payday lending practices in California generated 40 articles and editorials calling for the legislation to be voted down. The bill did not pass. MapLight has also won increased transparency for independent expenditures, ballot measure interests, campaign contributions, and legislative votes in California. Most recently, we launched Power Search, partnering with the California Secretary of State to help journalists, advocacy groups, and citizens easily pinpoint influence facts within California campaign finance data. This innovative, open-source tool is now live on the California Secretary of State's website. In addition, we have launched Voters Edge, an innovative online voter guide that provides citizens with a one-stop shop for information on federal, state, and local candidates and ballot measures. Voters Edge empowered more than one million people to cast more informed votes in the 2014 elections.

Todays youth are finding it increasingly difficult to recognize that they have the ability, responsibility, and power to determine their own destiny and choose their own future. To help women, families, and youth we provide access to positive and productive information and role models through books and our first class good news radio program. We help individuals discover their passion, learn life skills, gain effective conflict management skills, and build self-esteem through increased literacy and positive programs    STATISTICS:  According to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary Survey on Children, Violence and the Media:   An American child will have seen 16,000 simulated murders and 200,000 acts of violence by the age of 18   Modern music lyrics have become increasingly explicit concerning sex, drugs, and violence against women   More than 10 million web sites exist on the Internet dedicated to violent words, music and images    The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) reported that juveniles under age 18 were involved in 27% of all serious violent victimizations, including 14% of sexual assaults, 30% of robberies, and 27% of aggravated assaults.     Nearly four in 10 fourth-graders nationwide failed to achieve even partial mastery of the reading skills needed for school success. In our highest-poverty schools, nearly seven in 10 fourth-graders fail to read at this basic level.     Individuals with poor self-esteem are more vulnerable to peer pressure, more likely to have depressive reactions, eating disorders, and low achievement standards. They are at higher risk to abuse alcohol and drugs, partake in violent activities, and risky  behavior.    MISSION  Be the Star You Are! is a not-for-profit 501(c)(3) corporation empowering women, families and youth through improved literacy and positive media. Be the Star You Are! collects and distributes books and other resources as a way to raise their life skills and self esteem.

No Limits for deaf children	http://www.nolimitsfordeafchildren.org	(310) 280-0878	EIN 95-4603048	9801 Washington Blvd 2nd Floor	Culver City	CA	90232	USA	Arts & Culture, Support	No Limits serves an unmet need in the community by teaching deaf children to confidently speak, achieve, dream, and inspire through its national theatrical program and after-school educational center.	No Limits was founded in 1996 by Michelle Christie, Ed.D. Recognizing the lack of opportunities for children with a hearing loss to improve their speaking abilities in a fun and non-academic setting, Dr. Christie designed an after-school theater program to help develop communication skills, expand vocabulary and grammar, and understand character development. Through role-playing, cultivating creativity, and developing public speaking skills, No Limits children began to confidently move into the hearing world.   After witnessing dramatic improvements in the children and receiving countless testimonials from families, peers, educators and the community at large, No Limits expanded to become a national program. To date, No Limits has produced over 100 original shows in 13 states, with over 200,000 audience members witnessing the accomplishments and talents of these inspiring children.  No Limits had the distinct honor of making history as the first time deaf children who speak performed at the prestigious John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts and recently made history with its hit production Silent NO MORE at the world-renowned Carnegie Hall in New York City.  As a result of its remarkable success, No Limits extended its program beyond the theatrical arts to provide auditory, speech and language training year-round. In 2002, the No Limits Educational Center opened in Culver City, California.  The Center provides services for low-income school-age deaf children and their families.  Services include: individual therapy, academic tutoring, literacy, STEM, arts enrichment, parent education, audiological services, and a Leadership and Mentoring Academy for teens.  In 2013, No Limits opened an additional after-school center in Las Vegas, and most recently, in Oxnard, CA, pioneering the expansion of its services to reach more communities.  As a result of the comprehensive No Limits program, children who are deaf or hard of hearing are learning essential skills that will allow them to attend college and become successful, productive members of society.

Okizu	http://www.okizu.org	415.382.9083	EIN 68-0291178	16 Digital Drive Suite 130	Novato	CA	94949	USA	Camps, Cancer, Counseling, Mental Health, Philanthropy, Philanthropy, Voluntarism & Grantmaking Foundations, Sports	The mission of Okizu is to provide peer support, respite, mentoring, and recreational programs to meet the needs of all members of families affected by childhood cancer.	Okizu provides free camp programs for any child or family in northern California and Nevada that is affected by pediatric cancer. Recognizing that childhood cancer affects the entire family, we provide programs for siblings, young adults, parents and families as a whole.    Our camp programs include:		More than 3,000 members of families with childhood cancer.	Northern California	When a child is diagnosed with cancer, the lives of both the patient and the entire family are changed forever. Children who are diagnosed with cancer miss a normal childhood. Their illness, treatment, and complications can keep them from enjoying activities that are often taken for granted. And yet, like all children, they need the opportunity to grow, experiment and discover independence.   Siblings, who have a higher incidence of non-adaptive and at-risk behaviors, need support to maintain self-esteem and to manage anxiety and conflicting feelings.   Parents, whose emotional and financial resources are severely strained, also need respite, encouragement and the opportunity to share information with other families who have had to make similar treatment and strategic decisions. Those who have tragically lost their children to cancer greatly benefit from being able to share their experiences and remember their loved ones with others who are also coping with the death of a child.   Even long after the initial phase of treatment is concluded, young adults affected by childhood cancer also struggle to live normal lives and face their future with courage and hope.  Situated on 500 beautiful acres near Lake Oroville, Okizu's unique approach allows us to address the emotional, psychological, and social needs of each family member, which are often neglected by traditional medical providers.  One unique aspect of camp is grouping children together in all stages of treatment and recovery. By doing this, and not limiting the amount of summers a child can attend, we are able to provide a built-in peer support network that allows newly diagnosed campers to interact with other campers, similar in age and interest, who have already been through what they're currently forced to experience. Campers provide hope and encouragement to each other, simply by sharing a meal or a canoe ride together.  As one camper so aptly put it, "Camp Okizu is my gas station. It fills me up and helps me get through the year."  Tragically, more than 1,500 children in California are diagnosed with cancer every year. Unfortunately, the diagnosis of cancer in children is expected to continue to increase, between 1-4% a year. On a positive side, survival rates have increased dramatically during this same time period so that 70% of the children will survive. This combination of factors translates to a high demand for the services we provide to families affected by pediatric cancers.

The program served an average population of 650 former drug/alcohol abusers, homeless and others. The program provides long term residential housing, on-the-job training, education,and basic life skills on a 24-hour basis for a minimum 2 year period. Senior residents serve as "staff" and no salaries are paid. Many residents receive high school equivalency or above. All who graduated have obtained gainful employment and have returned to various communities as decent, law-abiding individuals.   delancey street california operates a short-term supporting living environment, san francisco strong. It houses 15 men returning from incarceration in jail or prison in cooperation with the san francisco district attorney's office. Participants can stay from two weeks to one year. Services provided include housing, food, job referrals, life skills groups, transportation, and referrals for substance abuse counseling. Graduates of delancey street california's core program staff the facility.	The population served by Delancey Street are adults  who have hit bottom, are poor, homeless, substance abusers, been incarcerated, and are often illiterate and unskilled.	1,500	United States	In 1971 Delancey Street began with 4 residents, a thousand dollar loan, and a dream to develop a new model to turn around the lives of substance abusers, former felons, and others who have hit bottom by empowering the people with the problems to become their own solution. Thirty-seven years later we remain true to our mission. We have been taking in as residents representatives of our societys most serious social problems and, by a process of each one helping another, with no professionals, no government funding, and at no charge to the clients, we have been solving these problems: generations of poverty, illiteracy, lack of job skills, hardcore substance abuse, homelessness, repeat felons, gang members, teen pregnancies, perpetrators and victims of every kind of abuse. After an average of 4 years, our residents gain academic education, 3 marketable skills, accountability and responsibility, dignity, decency and integrity. We have successfully graduated over 15,000 people from Americas underclass into society as successful taxpaying, citizens leading decent, legitimate and productive lives.   We have pioneered new models of education:   Over 10,000 formerly illiterate people have received high school equivalency degrees   Over 1000 have graduated with a diploma from our state accredited post-secondary vocational three year program taught by our own residents.   Fifty students have received an accredited BA either in Human Relations from our chartered college campus through Golden Gate University or majoring in Delanceys Urban Studies program through San Francisco State University.   Over  students have graduated from our ten-year-old charter public high school for juvenile justice youths, 50% of whom have gone on to college; 5% to vocational schools; 3% to the military and the other 42% into career jobs. This is remarkable considering that 90% entered our school as dropouts and complete school failures.  We have pioneered pathways out of violence, bigotry and hatred:    Delancey has moved over 10,000 violent, racial gang members away from gangs into active non-violence.    Over 5,000 Delancey folks have mentored others teaching non-violence and inter-racial mediation.   Delancey is completely self-governed by a Board and resident councils that are 1/3 African American, 1/3 Hispanic/American Indian and 1/3 Anglo, as is our population. Women comprise about 25% of the population and about 30 to 40%of management.   We have pioneered programs out of homelessness:   Through complete sweat equity, we have built and/or remodeled over 1500 units of very low-income housing built by the residents themselves with union support training over 800 people in the building trades throughout our 35 years.   We have moved over 2000 homeless people into permanent housing.   Our high school students renovated their own school expanding it from 8,000 square feet to 24,000 square feet.   We have pioneered an entrepreneurial pathway out of poverty.   We have successfully developed over 20 enterprises run completely by formerly unskilled people using the each-one-teach-one philosophy.   We have pooled our resources so that our enterprises have provided about 60% of the funding and growth of our organization.  We have now grown to have facilities in New Mexico, North Carolina, New York, Los Angeles, and headquartered in San Francisco. We have received over 100 commendations and awards from presidents, governors, mayors, legislative bodies, professional, religious, community, housing, and business groups in all the areas in which we reside. We have been commended in the media in over 30 major news and magazine programs such as 60 Minutes,   20/20, John Stossel Specials, World News Tonight with Peter Jennings, PBS Special on Crime and Alternatives, Street Stories with Ed Bradley, Oprah Winfrey Prime Time Special on Self-Esteem, Good Morning America, among many others. We have been commended in the written media in well over 200 articles in our 35 years ranging from the Chronicle of Philanthropy, through Fast Company Magazine through the New York Times, the Washington Post, Parade Magazine, Readers Digest, People Magazine, Newsweek, The London Times, Financial Times. We have been studied viewed and reviewed by a wide variety of researchers. The results are summarized by Dr. Karl Menninger, founder of Menninger Clinic who, after a 10-year follow up study stated, Delancey Street is the best and most successful rehabilitation program I have studied in the world.   While we are of course proud of our achievements, particularly because all have been accomplished by our residents themselves at no cost to the taxpayer or the client, we believe that because of our successes we have a larger responsibility to see that the mission of Delancey Street extends beyond reclaiming individual lives.

Homelessness affects every facet of a child's development, increasing the risk for developmental delays, learning disabilities, emotional and behavioral disorders, heath concerns, and deficient social skills.  Project Night Night believes that these devastating effects can be mitigated by receiving a good night's sleep.  Inadequate sleep can cause decreases in performance, concentration, learning, and health.  Sleep deprivation can also increase behavior and mood problems as well as memory lapses.  Children in homeless shelters do not have the luxury of falling asleep in the pristine conditions we, as parents, try to create for our children.  Instead, children in shelters often endure an overcrowded, noisy, and unfamiliar environment in their quest for sleep.  At Project Night Night, we hope that by receiving a package of familiar objects such as a security blanket, books, and a stuffed animal, homeless children will be able to have sweeter dreams.

HSSV adopts rescued, abandoned and surrendered companion animals into new, loving homes. Through our Regional Rescue, Behavior and Foster Programs, we collaborate with other shelters and rescue groups in Silicon Valley to save dogs and cats who are out of time, or need special medical and/or behavioral treatment to become adoptable. These animals are cared for at HSSV's Animal Community Center until they are ready for a new home. Oftern, animals who need a bit more time or need a quiet place to recover will stay in a foster home until a permanent home is found. We also have a robust Lost/Found program and operate a behavioral helpline. We invest our efforts in extensive behavioral assistance for people who might surrender their pets if we don't intervene. Our goal in Adoptions and Placement services is to find homes for the animals we save, and to keep animals in homes, so they never see the inside of a shelter.			San Francisco Bay Area and beyond
