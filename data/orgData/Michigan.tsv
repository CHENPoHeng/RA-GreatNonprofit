Services are offered to all youth who voluntarily seek help, with priority of concern and commitment to those for whom there are no other available services. Chm makes every effort to reunite youth with their families whenever possible, if it is in the best interest of the youth. Collaboration with community agencies and organizations as well as participation in community efforts to improve the condition of families and children in another targeted area in which attention is focused. In addition, covenant house michigan(chm) advocates with and on behalf of youth to raise awareness in the community about the issues of youth homelessness. Above all else, our mission is based on faith and the belief that all youth have a right to love, respect and genuine concern, which is the driving force for all chm services.		Shelter and crisis care: covenant house michigan works to meet the short and long-term needs of youth who are homeless through the provision of food, shelter, clothing, counseling, education, life skills and health (physical, mental and dental). Those services which cannot be offered on-site are referred to appropriate professionals in the community, so that basic necessities are met prior to assisting youth with eliminating the barriers that precipitated their homelessness. Our shelter, (caritas center) is open 365 days a year, 7 days a week and 24 hours a day and accepts any youth who is in need of shelter between the ages of 18-22. In operation since february 2000, covenant house caritas center has provided shelter and crisis management assistance to over 4,000 youth. In fiscal year 2014, covenant house michigan's caritas center provided services to 394 youth. They were assisted with job placement (127); enrolling in educational programs (118); and placement in job training programs (44). The total me life skills curriculum assisted these youth in preparing for adulthood and they are on their way to becoming productive members of society.   rights of passage: due to the need to provide homeless youth with residential services beyond emergency shelter, covenant house michigan opened the rights of passage program (rop) in october 2000. Rop provides transitional housing and supportive services up to two years for youth 18-22 years of age who demonstrate the desire to turn their lives around and make a transition from street life to productive adulthood and independent living. This program allows youth from the shelter who demonstrate the willingness to make a positive change in their lives and who have no other options for permanent housing to work toward their short and long term goals in a supportive and planned manner. In fiscal year 2014, covenant house michigan's rights of passage center provided services to 56 youth. They were assisted with job placement and retention (39); enrolling in educational programs including those at the college level (14); placement in job training programs (17); staff mentoring and support services (56); and services that prepared them for life after covenant house.   outreach: with thousands of homeless youth on the streets in michigan, covenant house michigan takes a proactive approach to find and help them through the street outreach program. These youth are often found in abandoned houses, cars and on street corners where they are usually engaged in illegal activities in order to survive. These youth often face unsanitary living conditions, violence, drugs and sexual abuse and exploitation. They lack basic needs such as food, clothing, and medical and mental health attention. The chm outreach team canvasses the streets of metro detroit, 7 days a week, to provide youth with prevention services, information about chm's housing and education programs as well as counseling, food and clean clothes. Immediate shelter is provided if youth are ready to leave the streets. For those youth who are younger than the youth serviced at chm's caritas center or who have children, the outreach team also provides assistance with getting them in a shelter that will meet their needs. In fiscal year 2014, the outreach team had contact with 5,604 youth. Of these youth, 209 were placed in the caritas center; 383 were placed in family shelters; 107 were placed in shelters for youth under the age of 18; 398 were assisted with food vouchers; 4261 were provided with counseling; 71 were reunited with their families; 241 were assisted in returning to school; 21 were assisted with getting into a domestic violence shelter; 43 were assisted with getting into permanent housing and 87 were assisted with filling out job applications and provided with appropriate clothing for job interview. The remaining youth were given outreach cards and instructed to call if they or other youth they knew were ever in need of covenant house michigan services.

Residential Program: The Residential Program offers individuals who are experiencing homelessness the opportunity to have temporary shelter and intensive case management to assist them in finding sustainable income and affordable housing. At the beginning of their stay, a case manager is assigned who leads them through a comprehensive, empathetic assessment to identify their specific barriers to obtaining housing. Together a plan is created to address these barriers. Upon entering the Residential Program, one must commit to work on finding and saving income, and obtaining sustainable housing, while remaining clean and sober for the duration of the stay.  Non-Residential Program: For individuals experiencing homelessness who are not currently in the Residential Program, the Shelter Association provides an array of services to both provide immediate assistance and encourage long-term change. Services such as laundry, showers, and access to the Shelter's free health services may be utilized by anyone in need. There are also a variety of assistance programs available such as: employment assistance, benefit assistance, housing search assistance and many others which help find or increase income and locate sustainable housing. Currently more than 30 agencies, ranging from AA to the VA, provide services on-site. These services help individuals who are not yet ready to enter the Residential Program, who are waiting for a place in the Residential Program or who have temporary shelter elsewhere but need to access our services.  Warming Programs: December through March, or any time the temperature (or wind chill) falls below 35 degrees, the Shelter Association opens the first floor Warming Center overnight to provide life-saving warmth to people in the community who are in need. During the depths of winter (December through March) the Shelter Association expands the capacity of the warming center through our Rotating Shelter Program.

Our members donate their time and talent to keep our building running, yet materials and repairs are very expensive.  We also hope to someday be able to add 21st century improvements to our building; such as sound and video systems, updated lighting and signage to make it more desirable for rentals.

For charitable organizations, we redefine the ways in which their goals can be reached.  We recognized a disconnect in the relationship between non-profit organizations and socially active people. Here was a large group of good people who really embraced the social scene; they regularly liked to spend time with friends at local venues, and (most importantly) they all liked to have a good reason to go out.  While theyre interested in being active in their community, they rarely heard about charity events that fit their interests. In fact, the phrase charitable event churned up associations with high-brow and established contributors  associations that didnt really resonate with them.  Enter SPF. Our three goals are:  1) To create an interactive resource to connect the public with the numerous non-profits in their community.  2) To partner with non-profit organizations (NPOs), helping them attract socially active people to fund-raising efforts and service projects by creating a more appealing (read: fun) atmosphere in tune with their interests.  3) To identify the immediate needs of NPOs, and serve as a valuable resource to addressing those needs in a variety of ways.  At SPF, our approach to giving is different than what you might expect from a non-profit organization. But we see that as our strong point. We cater directly to the socially active segment of our community, and give them an outlet for giving back.  The result?

DO Foundation, Inc.	http://www.dofoundation.net	855-9DO-HELP	EIN 27-1619074	18820 Woodward Avenue Suite 101	Detroit	MI	48203	USA	Homeless & Housing, Homeless Centers, Human Service Organizations, Human Services	The Do Foundation holds the essential belief that ALL PEOPLE, no matter their walk of life, are entitled to Dignity, Respect and the Opportunity to realize or regain a life of self-sufficiency through community involvement and assistance, as opposed to living in an unsheltered state of homelessness.  The Mission of the DO Foundation (DOF) is to connect directly with the homeless for a personal account of their immediate needs, and to generate community support in conjunction with implementing cost-effective programs to aid & assist them with meeting those needs. Homelessness is indiscriminate. Likewise, the DO Foundation will remain open to the needs of those who are homeless, whether their state of homelessness is to due to financial hardship, mental health related issues, addiction, flight from abusive circumstances, or lack of general support, as often is the case with Veterans and former inmates transitioning back into the community.	National Organizaition	PROGRAMS AND SERVICES INTAKE & ASSESSMENT  This is the first step an individual takes under the umbrella of DO Foundation (DOF) programs & services  your introduction to what we offer and how we can help. This process includes eligibility screening procedures & protocols to ensure that the appropriate referrals are made and any enrollment procedures result in individuals and/or families maximize their opportunity to receive aid and/or services that they are entitled to, or can benefit from. Intake & Assessment is designed to ensure that DOF personnel properly address an individual and their specific needs. It will also streamline the aid process, thereby eliminating redundancy and helping to alleviate an already stressful situation. REFERRAL  There are two types of Referrals, Immediate and Long Term. Immediate Referrals are those of an emergent nature, such as Emergency shelters, Medical or Mental Health, Prevention, and Drug & Alcohol addiction. Long Term refers to situations of a less than emergent nature, such as Transitional Housing, Outreach, Job Placement, Education & Awareness, and Financial Planning.  Based on the initial assessment, each person will work with one of our qualified Referral Agents (RA), who will contact the applicable facilities on behalf of the individual. These facilities may include, (but are not limited to): drug & alcohol clinics or rehabilitation centers, emergency shelters for immediate housing needs, medical or mental health facilities, job placement agencies and organizations, and food banks. The RA will make initial contact, then direct & guide the individual to the appropriate person within the contacted establishment. PREVENTION  DOFs Prevention Services address Crisis Management. In other words, you have a critical need, and we have an immediate solution. This program is for individuals who require immediate assistance to prevent loss of housing. Such services may include, but are not limited to: referral to organizations (such as Thaw or United Way) to help avert utility shut off, contacting a leasing office to avoid eviction. If all efforts fail, DO Foundation can, and may, provide (on a limited basis) on the spot emergency assistance for eviction prevention. {However, there are requirements for receiving this type of aid that will be thoroughly discussed at the time when, and if, this becomes necessary}. OUTREACH  Outreach (DOF style) tends to some of the immediate needs of a homeless individual. We accomplish this by hitting the streets for the homeless. Our volunteers take clothing items, DO Bags, a warm & friendly disposition and the desire to help. There is also an all access Resource Center where the homeless can come in out of the cold, make telephone calls, wash their clothes, get a hot shower, and have a bit of much needed privacy. Our Outreach services will also aid individuals in need of obtaining personal IDs and/or acquiring the necessary documentation for other potential programs and/or organizations from which they can benefit. TRANSITIONAL HOUSING  DOFs Transitional Housing program will help coordinate admission into supportive housing that is both affordable and appropriate for the delivery of supportive services to individuals and/or families; such as Welfare, Food Stamps, WIC and general state or federal aid. EDUCATION & AWARENESS  Our Education & Awareness programs are designed to enlighten individuals on Personal Responsibility, and are centered around Prevention  not only understanding HOW you got where you are, but how to prevent future recurrence once youve overcome it. We also provide hands on training in financial literacy and financial planning. We will guide you through areas from basic banking, to budgeting & strategies of long term success. Our goal is to help you achieve financial responsibility and personal financial success.

The grand rapids symphony is an integral and indispensable part of the west michigan community. The institution has long been an important part of the community, with musical excellence, diverse programming, collaborative spirit, and a commitment to learning, all adding to the quality of life we enjoy in west michigan. We are about sharing great concerts and educational programs with our community as grand rapids and west michigan grows and evolves, becoming a center of regional excellence with a diverse population and business base. We have an important role in the continued development of west michigan, helping to connect people with one another and supporting economic growth.   the grand rapids symphony education programs: the symphony provides exceptional music education programs for more than 80,000 attendees across 14 counties in michigan annually. Programs include opportunities for toddlers through adults to explore the world of classical music through performances and events in and around grand rapids. And we are working hard to ensure that these opportunities are available for a broad spectrum of our community-more than 35% of students attending concerts come from minority populations, and more than 49% of students qualify for the federal free or reduced lunch program-a barometer for low-income/high-poverty status. With the help of donors, corporations, sponsors, and foundations, we are able to provide these opportunities at low- or no-cost to attendees, thereby removing as many barriers to participation as possible. Current symphony education programs include:lollipop concerts (grades k-2): these concerts often provide a first experience with the grand rapids symphony and orchestral music. They are developed to include a connection to classic children's literature, and often incorporate other arts mediums through visual arts, actors and collaborations with other arts organizations. More than 19,000 children and adults attend these performances each year. Third grade concert: the focus is on the percussion section for these high-energy performances featuring symphony principal percussion, bill vits. Not only do his concerts highlight traditional percussion instruments heard in the orchestra, but they include a short history on the development of percussion instruments. Students always remember the "goat-toenail" rattles and the theremin demonstrations! Each year, more than 3,900 students and teachers attend these performances. Instrument & string discovery ensembles (4th grade): comprised of small groups of symphony musicians, these hands-on ensembles combine short performances with the opportunity for students to try the instruments for themselves while under the guidance of the symphony musicians. Performances are presented to one fourth grade class at a time to maximize the student/performer ratio. Fifth grade concert program: started in 1944, this concert has served hundreds of thousands of students over time. The fifth grade concert performances incorporate a classroom feel into a traditional concert structure. Annually, more than 16,000 students and teachers attend these events, with 26 districts sending 100% of their fifth graders! Nooks & crannies tour (6th grade - adults): these one-hour tours of devos performance hall not only dig into the nooks and crannies of the home of the symphony, but also invite discussion about careers and opportunities related to the arts beyond those of performer. Tour guests are treated to the full back-stage experience, including the chance to sit onstage. More than 1,500 attendees participate in these tours each year. Artists in residence program (grades k-6): this is the most extensive of the grand rapids symphony's education programs. The artists in residence (air) program combines the concert experiences listed previously for each grade level and adds additional in-school performances by small ensembles. Schools are accepted into the air program through an application process for a two-year program cycle annually, between 40 and 45 schools are accepted as an air partner school, which represents more than 18,000 students. Schools are located in grand rapids and throughout west michigan. Schools participate at no charge for the first two years, and are accepted back for additional program cycles with a participation fee of only $1,000 per year. Family series concerts (ages 8+): the family series concerts are designed to inspire and motivate young musicians who are just starting out on their instruments, and encourage those who aren't playing to give it a try! These concerts feature a wide variety of musical styles to show the versatility of the orchestra and our musicians, and to provide a platform to showcase guest artists from a variety of musical backgrounds. Each concert is paired with pre-concert activities in the lobby, which include an instrument petting zoo of instruments found in the orchestra. Mosaic scholarships (ages 11-18): a strong component of the symphony's efforts to reach diverse audiences, these scholarships provide talented african-american and hispanic instrumental students with completely subsidized private instruction on their instrument with symphony musicians. In addition to their lessons, all supplies-such as books, reeds, strings and instrument rental-are provided. Mosaic scholars also receive complimentary tickets to attend select symphony concerts with their families. Scholarship recipients are chosen by an audition process, and scholarships are renewable through the student's senior year in high school. We currently have 20 students involved in this program annually. Grand rapids youth symphony and classical orchestra (ages 11-18): for more than 50 years, the youth symphony program has provided advanced ensemble performance opportunities for highly-skilled students in the greater grand rapids area. The youth symphony ensembles meet weekly and present three concerts annually. Currently, more than 150 students participate in the program. Students are chosen through an audition process. Grand rapids symphony youth choruses (ages 6-18): started to meet the symphony's need for a highly-skilled youth vocal ensemble, the youth chorus program has been a success from its first day. Having now garnered a reputation for delivering professional-quality singing in a variety of symphony concerts and events, the youth chorus programs continue to grow, offering three levels of singing experiences, serving more than 150 students. Side by side concerts (ages 14-18): select high school orchestras are chosen to participate in a limited quantity, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to perform right alongside the symphony musicians on a concert in their school. The side by side concerts enable students to meet our musicians, talk with them, learn some "tips of the trade," and play the same repertoire that the professionals play. These concerts have become an outstanding opportunity to support our teacher colleagues in the field who work day in and day out to provide quality music education for their students. Student passport (ages 11-adult): the student passport program provides reduced-priced tickets to students from middle school through college to attend regular symphony concerts. This program continues to grow each year with average student attendance hovering around 200 students per concert, per evening. Annually, more than 4,000 attendees participate. Access to music concerts (all ages): the symphony is committed to ensuring that every segment of our community has access to the amazing music we have to offer. Each year nearly 1,000 guests with physical and economic limitations are provided with a special concert that enables everyone to feel welcome and a part of the symphony family. The access to music concerts are further made possible by the more than 100 volunteers on hand to assist guests with arrival and seating for the concert. Music for health initiative (adults): this new addition to the symphony's programs began as a conversation between spectrum health healthcare professionals and the symphony to address a need to enhance the therapeutic music interventions provided for their patients in the neuro-rehabilitation programs. Therapy sessions are guided by the on-staff music therapist and symphony duos are incorporated into the sessions. This program is currently serving approximately 100 patients, with program growth goals to begin similar programs in other health care facilities in the grand rapids community. Up beat (adults): ticket holders for classical series concerts are eligible to attend these special multi-media presentations that go well beyond the program notes. Presentations include conversations with conductors and guest artists, as well as composers and others. Each evening, more than 200 guests have come to make this their first stop in their concert experience-this represents about 4,000 guests annually. John p. Varineau outstanding music educator award: with the john p. Varineau outstanding music educator award, the symphony takes a full year to say thank you to the dedicated individuals who have focused their careers on providing exceptional learning opportunities and creative skill development to the students in our community. Each recipient receives a cash award to support their program in whatever manner they see fit, a season of complimentary tickets to the grand rapids symphony, and specialized activities for the recipient's students to interact with the symphony musicians.

NBS Animal Rescue	http://www.nbsar.org	(248) 633-8627	EIN 45-3588927	35 West Square Lake Road	Troy	MI	48098	USA	Animal Protection & Welfare, Animals	N.B.S. Animal Rescues Mission Statement is to foster, love & adopt homeless dogs one by one until there are none.	State of Michigan	The Philosophy of NBS Animal Rescue  NBS Animal Rescue was founded on October 12, 2011 by Aaron Fortin, Rebecca Akins, and Jaime Wolfe. Our administrative office is located at 1457 East Twelve Mile Road, Madison Heights, MI 48071.  No dogs are housed at this location as it is administrative only. NBS Animal Rescue is a 100% foster based canine rescue that is dedicated to the rescue, rehabilitation, and adoption of healthy, well-balanced, dogs and puppies into loving families. Our primary goals include the rescue and rehabilitation of homeless animals in need, educating our community regarding proper pet care, and to participate in community youth outreach programs.  Some key components to our rescue mission are as follows:  *We spay/neuter every rescue dog in order to help end the cycle of unwanted litters. *We treat each and every dog as if it we our own in order to give it back the respect, love and dignity it deserves.  *We maintain the highest standards of care for every dog we come in contact with, including the highest quality veterinary care, housing, love, training and compassion.  What Does NBS stand for?  NBS has a two-folds meaning for us.  The first is No BS.  Animal rescue is an emotionally charged venture.  Between dealing with lives at stake on a daily basis to most of the people in this industry are volunteers, unpaid and do this out of the goodness of their hearts; it can be emotionally taxing.  We recognize that this fiercely passionate drive can add fuel to an already emotional fire.  Unfortunately, the end result can be drama, name-calling and back-stabbing in and amongst groups and volunteers in animal rescue.  We choose not to partake in these practices.  We focus our time and our energy on the dogs that we are rescuing and keep any of the other BS off our plates to stay emotionally and mentally balanced for the dogs in our care and the ones about to come into our care.  We also encourage our fosters, volunteers and board members to work with and network with other rescues to build positive, healthy relationships.  The second meaning of NBS is Non-Breed Specific.  We believe that every dog should be judged on its individual merits.  We do not judge a dog based on the breed characteristics, the media portrayal or how it is perceived to be by the public but rather on how the dog actually behaves.  We do focus our rescue on small breed dogs.  When the three founders originally started the rescue, there were only two homes that were fostering.  We determined that we were able to foster 2-3 small dogs or one large dog at a time.  Therefore we focused on increasing the number of lives saved by rescuing small breed dogs.  Some interesting things happened during our infancy: 1) we became very proficient at diseases that appeared to plague small dogs more commonly than large such as luxating patellas, dental disease, etc. 2) we became known to the public as a small dog rescue and 3) we became fiercely aware that there are many small dogs that are turned over to shelters and their lives are in danger every day.  We can accommodate different sized dogs based on our foster home desires, resources and space.  Rescue  NBS Animal Rescue has a strong working relationship with several in state animal shelters and animal rescue groups that work together to network homeless dogs facing euthanasia with rescue groups that have open foster homes. In addition, we also take in owner surrender dogs and puppies from situations that are beyond the owners control and in the instances in which the current owner is acting in the best interest of the animal. We are a non-breed specific dog rescue; however, we do tend to specialize in small breed dogs.  We network with other groups for help when we are approached about cats and other species of animals.  Our rescue operation is 100% volunteer based with 100% of our available funds going to support our primary goals as listed above.  Rehabilitation/Training  NBS Animal Rescue is dedicated to the rescue, rehabilitation, and adoption of healthy, well-balanced, dogs and puppies into loving families. In order to reach this goal, NBS Animal Rescue seeks the advice and expertise of qualified positive reinforcement trainers and animal behaviorists on a regular basis. Our organization believes that through positive reinforcement, consistency, patience, and the assistance of experts most canine behavioral issues can be corrected and/or successfully managed. NBS Animal Rescue believes in the careful coordination of an animals routine health care, nutrition, exercise, training, and affection as a well-rounded approach to animal care. All of our adoptable animals are placed in family foster homes where they immediately begin teaching basic obedience commands of sit, down, stay, come, walk nicely on a leash, and to greet strangers properly. When needed, our foster families have certified animal trainers and behaviorists to assist them in teaching and reinforcing these basic commands in their foster dogs.  Our certified trainers and animal behaviorists are on call to evaluate an animals behavior, to offer training advice and suggestions, and to perform behavior assessments to determine if an animals behavior is a danger to itself or those around it. Our goal is to rescue, rehabilitate, and adopt out dogs who will be happy, healthy, and successful members in a family living situation. This requires that our rescue be responsible and heed the advice of qualified veterinarians, certified animal trainers, animal behaviorists, and rescue/rehabilitation experts and in some cases humanely euthanize the animal in question should their behavior become dangerous to themselves, other animals, or to the humans in which they come into contact with.  Medical Care  NBS Animal Rescue has a structured and comprehensive medical care procedure that all of our rescued animals go through to ensure that they are healthy and up to date on all age appropriate veterinary care. It is our organizations belief that no animal in our rescue be placed in an adoptive home until it has undergone, and passed, a thorough and comprehensive wellness exam by a licensed veterinarian and received all age appropriate vaccines and health care screenings. NBS Animal Rescue has a strong working relationship with the Animal Clinic of Sterling Heights, All About Animals Rescue, and Wilson Veterinary Hospital. Detailed veterinary records, receipts, and copies of all veterinary testing reports are kept both digitally and in hard copy and a compiled history of veterinary routines are given to each adoptive family.  All animals adopted through NBS Animal Rescue have received all of the following veterinary care procedures:      Spay or Neuter Surgery     Microchip Insertion     Bath, nail trim, and ear cleaning     De-worming for internal parasites     DHPP Vaccine     Rabies Vaccine (age appropriate)     Heartworm Test (age appropriate)     Heartworm preventative     Flea/Tick preventative   After completing extensive research, met with several licensed veterinarians, and collaborated with local well established animal rescue groups, NBS Animal Rescue adopted a mandatory spay/neuter policy in which all of our dogs and puppies are spayed or neutered prior to adoption. We feel that this is the most responsible stance our rescue can take in the fight against over population of dogs and cats in our nation. In addition, after researching the statistics on lost pets and the number of pets who are reunited with their families, NBS Animal Rescue also adopted the policy that all adopted pets will be microchipped prior to adoption. We feel that together, these two policies not only greatly help to control the number of animals who end up in animal shelters across our nation, but that they also offer our adoptive families the peace of mind of a healthy and safe pet.  While all animals in our rescue are provided with the above mentioned veterinary care, some of our rescued animals require special veterinary care, surgical procedures, or additional care by a veterinary specialist. NBS Animal Rescue believes that each individual animals pre-existing or developing health concerns be evaluated by veterinary professionals and a prognosis for a healthy, pain free, and happy future in an adoptive home be the primary concern. Our rescue has fundraised money to support bladder stone surgery, double luxating patella surgery and extensive dental work on a number of other dogs. We believe that an animals quality of life and prognosis for a pain free future should be the guiding factor in decisions that involve surgical procedures, extensive specialist care, or the necessity of humane euthanasia.  PAWS program  NBS Animal Rescue is a key supporter of the P.A.W.S.  Promoting Academics With Service Program taking place at Fitzgerald High School in Warren, Michigan. P.A.W.S. is a district wide, cross curricular approach to Service Learning related to educating the Fitzgerald Public Schools community about proper animal care, the importance of spay/neuter programs to control the pet population, and local ordinances regarding animals.  Together with community business partners, such as NBS Animal Rescue, Fitzgerald Public School Students have researched, planned, and implemented an event to provide valuable low cost animal services such as vaccine clinics, training seminars, health expos, dog washes, dog house building events, etc. to raise animal welfare awareness and financial donations for local animal shelters.  Students will use the P.A.W.S. Service Learning project as a vehicle to demonstrate to the community their knowledge in core curriculum classes such as mathematics, English language arts, science, social studies, and government,  while utilizing the skills learned in elective classes such as art, music, drama, computer design, web page design, and construction courses.  Together with other local animal rescue groups, veterinary offices, and animal businesses, NBS Animal Rescue provides key support in the aspects of educational information, demonstrations, lectures, real world videos and experiences, and mentoring to over two hundred students in the Fitzgerald Public School area. Our goal is to help share our knowledge of animal rescue, proper animal care, responsible ownership, and the horrors of animal abuse and neglect with the youth of our community to that they can be the voiceless animals advocates of the future.  Education  NBS Animal Rescue prides itself on sharing our collective experience, knowledge, and passion for animals with each and every one of our supporters, adopters, and foster families. As a responsible rescue organization we ensure that all of our dogs are seen by a licensed veterinarian for a general health wellness exam, are current on all age appropriate vaccines, heartworm preventative, flea/tick preventative, are Heartworm tested, have been properly de-wormed, spayed/neutered, and microchipped prior to being placed up for adoption. Not only do we feel that it is imperative for us to make certain that all of these health protocols are done with each and every animal that comes into our rescue, but we also ensure that this information, as well as future veterinary care expectations, are clear to all of our adopters.  NBS Animal Rescue provides each adoptive family with a comprehensive veterinary history as well as a schedule of upcoming veterinary care needs. In addition, we strive to educate all of our adopters of the necessity of annually vaccinating your pet, providing monthly, year round, heartworm and internal/external parasite preventatives, and ensuring that a pet receives yearly veterinary exams. Dental care, knee and patella concerns, eyesight, hearing, and mobility issues are also discussed in detail with adopters who are adopting a senior pet, with special information given regarding these issues in the form of literature and online resources. Proper socialization, training methods, potty training, introducing a puppy to new members of the family, and puppy health concerns are discussed in detail with adopters who are adopting a dog as well.  In addition to educating our adoptive families, we have also made it a priority to educate our supporters and those who send in e-mail inquiries regarding our dogs about proper care for their pets. Many times when processing an application or an inquiry we will be told that the applicants current pets are not up to date on veterinary care because they live in the country, never take their pets out of their home, or for various other reasons. Our volunteers make a conscious effort to share information, educational resources, and veterinary links on the Internet to help educate our supporters regarding the dangers of not providing your pets with proper routine veterinary care. Our supporters are grateful for the information, personal experiences with dogs who were not properly cared for, and the resources and contacts we are able to provide them with in order to get their pet proper veterinary care.  While educating our supporters and adopters regarding proper veterinary care is an important goal of ours, NBS Animal Rescue also prides itself on sharing information about proper canine nutrition programs, dog food analysis and grading websites, exercise, and training information as well. Our goal is to help our adoptive families offer a well-rounded care and wellness routine for their adoptive canine and ensure that we are able to educate our supporters on the importance of proper nutrition and exercise as well. A comprehensive list of local veterinarians, trainers, dog food analysis information, and proper nutrition pamphlets and Internet resources are shared with each of our adoptive families.  Fundraising Events  NBS Animal Rescue hosts fundraising events to help secure funds for medical care, supplies and various other costs associated with running a rescue.  We have had fundraisers at restaurants and establishments that donate proceeds or allow us to charge a cover charge.  We also have donation jars in the public and are happy to provide supportive businesses with an NBS donation dog house.  We also hosted a pop can drive to raise money for purchasing Pet Oxygen Masks for local firehouses.  We have also hosted three online fundraising efforts via an Internet based Chip-In.com. All three of these online fundraising events were held in order to raise monies needed for extensive veterinary care expenses for two of our rescued dogs: Lil Debbie and Mason. Lil Debbie required surgery to care for extensive bladder stones, and Mason required surgery to fix two luxating patellas.  We will continue to participate in several fundraisers that will increase our ability to rescue and rehabilitate homeless animals in need, educate our community regarding proper pet care, and to participate in community youth outreach programs such as the P.A.W.S program. Our projected fundraisers for the next five years include the following:  a bowling fundraiser, an indoor target shooting fundraiser, a dog wash fundraiser, a returnable pop can fundraiser, an Apple IPad raffle, a wine tasting fundraiser, a picnic Bark-B-Que fundraiser, several holiday pet photography fundraisers, and a CaPOOCHino day fundraiser.  Adoption Events  Our primary means of advertising our adoptable animals continues to be via online pet adoption sites such as Petfinder.com and Adoptapet.com. Our adoptable dogs are visible on our website, Facebook and Twitter for potential adoptive families to see and learn about each individual animals personality and needs.  We are a rescue partner with Petco where we have held adoption events in the past.  In addition, we participate in several local pet adoption events such as Meet Your Best Friend At the Zoo held at the Detroit Zoo, Fido Does Ferndale held annually in Ferndale and various other events that may change for year to year. Our participation in these well-advertised, established pet adoption events will help us to reach our goals of placing our rescued animals in approved adoptive homes and educating the community regarding proper pet care.  We encourage our foster homes to be active with their foster dog, post them on their own Facebook page, talk about them with friends and family, and taking their dogs out in public if the dog is up to date on vetting and responsibly handled in the general public.  Collaboration with other rescues and rescue efforts  One of our founding principles at NBS Animal Rescue is to collaborate with local animal rescues, shelters, and animal businesses in order to form a cohesive network of resources that provide animal aid to homeless animals in need. NBS Animal Rescue prides itself on having an open line of communication, a strong sense of teamwork, and an honest and respectful relationship with many of our local areas animal rescue organizations and supporting businesses.  We are always willing to work together with other like-minded organizations, who put the best interest of the individual animal at the forefront of their organization, operate with integrity and honesty, and share a deep rooted love and passion for rescuing and rehabilitating homeless animals.  To date, we have formed an extensive network of like-minded organizations including other animal rescue groups, veterinary offices, county animal shelters, groomers, and animal trainers. Together we have shared experience, contacts, informational resources, and have supported one another during our individual efforts to make a difference in the lives of homeless animals in our nation. NBS Animal Rescue is committed to fostering a strong relationship between our current rescue colleagues and building additional relationships in the future to help rescue, rehabilitate, and adopt homeless animals.

This initiative is designed to provide pro bono or low-fee intellectual property and creativity-related legal resources for artists, creative practitioners, business and nonprofit organizations in partnership with the arts communication entertainment and sports section of the state bar of michigan, detroit creative corridor center and national endowment for the arts. This year, artserve hired a new contractual coordinator to assist with finalizing efforts to officially begin providing program services - legal referrals, seminars, online resources and code dialogue events for artists and attorneys on legal issues in the creative realm. Community supported art (detroit pilot) - initiated this pilot program in partnership with springboard for the arts and the james l. And john s. Knight foundation to connect local artists to local arts collectors and patrons through the donation of shares of an "art harvest" season. Piloted in detroit in 2012 with 9 juried artists who received a 1,000 stipend to create 50 individual works of art for the program to be distributed to local patrons. Shareholders and artists connected at local share "pick-up" events. The pilot program ended this year but remains available for replication in other michigan communities interested in its opportunities.   strategic communications - positioned arts, culture and arts education as essential to the public well-being and michigan's economic resilience and connected constituents to information and resources while engaging dialogue on issues facing the creative sector - through its website, communications and media outreach, social media. Continued partnership with tanner friedman in the delivery of media outreach and public relations services for artserve and its statewide work achieving over 425 media placements in the calendar year. Used independent contractor services to manage social media and online --continued on schedule o-- communications. Initiated a new institutional marketing committee to guide artserve's marketing and communications strategies. Continued publication of creative impact michigan e-magazine this year to affirm and raise awareness of the significant impact of arts and culture across michigan through custom-produced feature stories, spotlights on organizations, artists or creative community news, and monthly videos. Included statewide events calendar for arts and cultural organizations and artists to promote events and build new audiences. Selected tanner friedman as new publisher partner for second-year operations beginning in june 2012, and adjusted the publication schedule from bi-weekly to monthly basis based on reader feedback. Supported by the michigan council for arts and cultural affairs, the michigan state housing development authority, and leading michigan foundations.   advocacy and public policy - led research, grassroots organizing, coalition building and lobbying to advance policies and sustainable public/private funding supporting the arts, culture and arts education. Artserve's case is grounded on the belief that arts and culture is an essential ingredient to michigan's reinvention - contributing jobs and economic benefits, creating vibrant communities to attract/retain business and talent, supporting statewide cultural tourism aims, and transforming lives of people of all ages. During this year, artserve released its second creative state mi report affirming economic, audience reach and cultural tourism impacts of michigan's nonprofit arts and cultural sector using data from the michigan cultural data project (www. Culturaldata. Org). The report revealed that arts and cultural organizations generated more than billion dollars in michigan's economy, contributed 22,335 jobs, and served more than 15. 7 million people; the next creative state mi report will be released in january 2014 (www. Creativestatemi. Org). This report positioned artserve to successfully engage its statewide networks and advocate for the first meaningful increase in state arts funding in back- to-back years - a fy 2014 appropriation of 8. 15 million for the michigan council for arts and cultural affairs. Artserve also shared information online with candidates and constituents on issues related to the arts, culture, arts education and creative industries. Represented michigan on the americans for the arts' state arts advocacy network, was represented at afta's arts advocacy day in washington, dc where information was shared with michigan congressional leaders, and attended and represented creative state mi at afta's national convention in pittsburgh. Also led efforts to inform and engage a statewide network of effective advocates for the importance of k thru 12 arts education in michigan as member of the michigan youth arts roundtable, working together with the interlochen center for the arts, michigan youth arts association, the michigan council for arts and cultural affairs, and the michigan department of education, and a consortium of 16 statewide arts education organizations. These efforts were supported by the baseline information on arts education released in september 2012 from the first michigan arts education survey on the status of arts education in michigan's k thru 12 schools and included efforts to further develop and disseminate an arts education policy platform and recommendations. As part of these efforts, shared information with the partnership organizations, the michigan board of education and legislative leaders. Was represented at the kennedy center alliance for arts education network annual meeting where information was shared with michigan congressional leaders. This year, artserve continued efforts to further establish the artserve michigan arts action network as an affiliated, independent 501(c)4 nonprofit organization formed to strengthen advocacy capacity and impacts, engage advocates and leverage resources to influence positive change for arts, culture and arts education at the federal, state and local levels in michigan (www. Miartsaction. Org). While the network was not actively engaged this year due to capacity challenges, artserve contributed modest funding to continuing its support of start-up costs for the new affiliated corporation. Changes to programs there were no changes to artserve's mission or priorities during the fiscal year. Certain programs were added or expanded during the fiscal year in alignment with the organization's mission: the creative state mi research and reporting initiative was continued this year with the release of the second report in january 2013 using data from the michigan cultural data project and other sources to document the contributing impacts of michigan's arts and cultural sector to the economy, communities, education, and audiences statewide. Under this brand, a new two-year partnership continued with the detroit creative corridor center for private sector creative industries research, reporting and case- making. The first report was released in january 2014. The community supported art detroit pilot program was initiated during last fiscal year in partnership with springboard for the arts (st. Paul, mn) and the james l. And john s. Knight foundation to connect local artists with local arts patrons through the distribution of shares of an "arts harvest" season. Designed as a pilot program, the initiative was concluded but remains available for replication in other michigan communities. No significant activity was reported for this year. During this year, artserve provided professional consulting services to western michigan university and the department of fine and performing arts in the development of a study evaluating opportunities to equip arts students with entrepreneurial skill building. Artserve also provided consultant services to artscenter traverse city in the facilitation of an online artist and community survey to assist the organization in exploring opportunites for a new arts center. More information about artserve artserve michigan is the statewide nonprofit organization leading advocacy for the arts, culture and arts education, and the transformative power of the creative industries in michigan. Our mission is to "cultivate the creative potential of michigan's arts and cultural sector to enhance the health and well-being of michigan, its people and communities. " collaboration is at the heart of artserve's work. The organization was formed in 1997 through the merger of the arts foundation of michigan, business volunteers for the arts, concerned citizens for the arts in michigan, and the michigan alliance for arts education - bringing together 32 years of statewide arts leadership. Artserve's 2006 merger with the michigan association of community arts agencies further strengthened the voice for the arts, culture and arts education in michigan. Artserve is the designated michigan representative to the americans for the arts state arts advocacy network and the kennedy center alliance for arts education network. Crain's detroit business recognized artserve as a best managed nonprofit award finalist in both 2009 and 2010. Artserve serves three primary constituent groups statewide -- artists and creative professionals comprising the creative industries, arts and cultural organizations and leadership, and arts educators. The organization seeks to engage local, regional and statewide partners and stakeholders sharing our belief in the essential and contributing role of arts, culture and arts education, and the creative industries for the future of michigan. Sustainability - continued efforts to increase artserve's financial capacity through development efforts focused primarily on grantmaking for programs and operations, individual donor cultivation, organizational memberships, increased program income, and coordination of year-end and mid-year fundraising campaigns. These activities were primarily conducted by the president and ceo due to the elimination of the director of development position in september 2012.

We believe that the arts should be available to everyone everywhere.Artrain brings enjoyment, understanding, and awareness of visual art and other cultural exhibitions to a diverse audience across the United States. It encourages the development of local cultural programs and organizations, provides educational programming to schools and increases participation in and support for the arts. The impact of Artrain programs is proven through its nearly 40-year legacy as the catalyst that has started or strengthened hundreds of cultural organizations. It has provided life-changing experiences for participants who have gone on to become artists, museum professionals, cultural volunteers and life-long art enthusiasts.		1. Creative voice - artrain is the project manager and producer of creative voice (formerly criticcar detroit). Creative voice is a media-based arts journalism project that produces and posts video stories about arts and cultural events in detroit and southeast mi on social media. Creative voice highlight reels, in addition to being made and shared free to arts and cultural organizations for promotional use, are posted immediately to youtube and other social media sites for sharing. Creative voice's overarching goals are to: 1) add an important resource to diminishing arts and cultural criticism in the media; 2) cover the creative sector of detroit and southeast michigan, especially the newly innovative offerings; 3) promote the region as a thriving creative center; 4) encourage audiences to try new experiences. Artrain hires emerging videographers and journalists to work with conlin and the creative voice team of producers and editors. Armed with an artrain commissioned creative voice app for the ipad, the team attends cultural events ranging from the experimental to the traditional. In addition to the stories, creative voice video highlight reels add "person-on-the-street" audience commentary to offer authentic views on events.

Since 2012 artrain has been contracted by the arts alliance of washtenaw county to provide administrative and project management services. The organizations share office space, resources and staff. The arts alliance, a young organization, benefits from artrain's administrative expertise and artrain gains an intimate knowledge of local arts agency challenges that enhances its national organizational capacity- building work. Encouraged by this success, artrain resolved to assist other like-minded projects and is offering fiscal sponsorships for worthwhile but vulnerable artistic or cultural programs that are not or may not need to be an independent nonprofit. To date, artrain has helped the selma caf, wonderfool productions producers of festifools and the ypsilanti 24-hour film shoot out. Artrain is presently working with individual artists and visionaries (i. E. Jennifer conlin with criticcar and mark braun of mr. B's joybox express) to help them bring their artistic goals to fruition. 3. An epic journey mr. B's joybox express mississippi river road ride 2014 - 1,840 miles, 80 days in as many towns, more than 23,000 people and hundreds of children were reached during this epic piano-touting, bike- pedaling and music-playing journey. Starting in lake itasca, minnesota on september 1st and ending in new orleans, louisiana on november 18, 2014, mr. B's joybox express, founded and fronted by renowned ann arbor, michigan jazz and blues pianist mark "mr. B" braun, spread the joy of music and movement along every mile. Mr. B teamed up with sam genson, marty stano, jules cunningham and tour manager and artrain program director, shoshana hurand. Motivated by his own involvement with music and sports, braun dreamed of putting a piano on a bike and riding it across the country to spread the joy of music and encourage physical activity. After trial runs in michigan, braun set his sights on the mississippi river corridor. Every obstacle was met including a few wayward armadillos and alligators. Performances at the dakota in minneapolis and preservation hall in new orleans were two of the many, many highlights. The pinnacle of this adventure was the people met on the way, as it is with every artrain touring project. All along the way the team was successful in raising interest in and awareness of blues, jazz, cycling and pursuing personal dreams.

Greening Of Detroit	http://www.greeningofdetroit.com	(313) 237-8733	EIN 31-0036036	1418 Michigan Ave	Detroit	MI	48216	USA	Environment, Environmental Beautification	The greening of detroit's mission is the sustainable growth of a healthy urban community through trees, green spaces, food, education, training and job opportunities.		Green infrastructure - in 2014, the greening, in collaboration with 34 community partners, hosted 50 tree planting events throughout detroit, resulting in the installation of 4,101 trees with the assistance of 4,041 volunteers. In 2014, the greening worked with the conservation fund and u-haul to plant a 2. 5 acre reforestation project in rouge park. We also expanded our work with detroit water and sewage department to reduce the effects of storm-water. This initiative involved the planting of expansive tree stands in areas most susceptible to storm-water runoff. These types of plantings not only provide good environmental benefits, they provide excellent long-term economic benefit and beautifies the neighborhoods. In addition, the greening is working to transform vacant land throughout the city by implementing several green infrastructure installations. Work has begun to transform 30-50 vacant lots on the lower eastside of detroit. We hope to beautify the neighborhood, create safer and cleaner feeling spaces, detour illegal dumping, and help raise property values.   workforce development - created in 2009, through a pathways out of poverty grant from the federal government, the greening's workforce development program is designed to provide unemployed detroiters with valuable job training and certification in the green industry. Participants in the greening's adult workforce program are trained for jobs in landscaping, forestry, and agriculture. The focus areas within the greening's program include: first aid and safety, landscape plan reading and estimating, turf installation and maintenance, plants and plantings, tree/shrub maintenance, irrigation systems, landscape equipment and safety (taught by osha-certified instructors) and chauffer's license training. In 2014, the training program added a new certification in the field of tree artisan. This is a huge focus around urban forestry, tree removal and stump grinding. Also, the program was officially certified as a federal apprenticeship program, from the u. S. Department of labor. Each training session is eight weeks and includes a half-day of job readiness skill-building such as resume writing, interviewing techniques, job hunting and follow-up tips. Case management services are offered throughout the training. Upon completion of the program, participants have the opportunity to take and pass the greening of detroit's landscape exam and the landscape industry certification through the state of michigan. 318 adult trainees have graduated from the greening's cohort sessions with certificates. The graduates have completed a 10-hour landscaping safety course conducted by miosha certified instructors. 88 percent of the trainees have been placed into jobs that pay on an average $11. 30 an hour. The greening of detroit has planted more than 81,000 trees throughout the city since 1989. As our scope of work grew, the organization created a summer youth workforce program to assist in the watering and maintenance of the trees. The green corps program has collectively employed more than 1500 detroit youth since its inception in 1998. By maintaining thousands of trees in 220 planting sites across the city, corps members are investing energy and time in their communities. These youth also beautify parks and participate in conservation projects that have meaningful and beneficial impacts for detroit residents. The greening of detroit has paid more than $2. 1 million dollars to city youth in employment wages since the program's inception in 1998. The ultimate goal of the youth employment program is to provide young people with opportunities for work, and to nurture a sense of environmental stewardship. In 2014, 80 green corps youth were employed by the greening of detroit, ten conservation projects were completed this summer (more than 50 conservation projects completed since 1998). Green corps employees watered and weeded more than 12,000 trees throughout the summer. Green corps students earned an hourly wage of $7. 50 an hour. These students are exposed to opportunities in green collar jobs, college readiness, work readiness, participating in college tours, leadership building, conflict resolution, and team building.   urban agriculture - in 2014, the urban agriculture department maintained 3 farm projects in the city on 5. 5 acres of city land producing 21,500 pounds of food. These farms served as training grounds for our adult urban agriculture apprenticeship program in which 6 community residents worked alongside our farmers for 30+ hours a week. The farms also conducted over 100 community classes, worked with 1,341 volunteers, conducted 23 school field trips, and 51 tours for both national and international guests. Over the last 10 years, greening has supported over 1,400 gardens in the city with basic resources. In 2014 alone, our build-a-garden program staff worked alongside the community to build 65 gardens throughout detroit, increasing food access to some of our most food insecure residents. After developing unique nutrition education stem curriculum for detroit public schools and supporting the creation of the school garden collaborative, we continue the work of educating hundreds of students each year through our grow and eat school nutrition and garden program.

The Detroit area is experiencing a severe, protracted downturn in its economy, with the result that many more families are turning to local agencies for help feeding their children.  Many of the individuals and families who turn to emergency feeding programs for help simply cannot meet all of their monthly living expenses and must make the hard choice between paying the rent and buying food or medicine for their families.  With the extended downturn in our local economy, we are also seeing an increase in requests from agencies in areas that haven?t typically needed assistance.  These agencies are serving families whose primary breadwinners have lost their jobs as a result of the massive lay-offs plaguing the Detroit area.  Lack of transportation is another issue contributing to the food insecurity of low-income tri-county residents. In high-poverty areas, particularly in inner-city Detroit, there typically are no grocery stores close by. In fact, of the 67 Kroger grocery stores in the tri-county Detroit area, there is not a single one left within the Detroit city limits.  As a result, residents are often subject to the exorbitant prices and poor quality of food items offered by corner convenience stores on the one hand, and the high-calorie, high-fat foods available at fast food franchises on the other.  Despite our tremendous growth in service, there are still too many tri-county Detroit-area residents going hungry while large quantities of readily available, highly nutritious foods are thrown away.

A total of 47,934,627 lbs of food was delivered this year.
