When a family has to travel away from home for medical treatment, it is traumatic enough, not to mention compounding the situation with finding a place to stay, the potentially high costs for the place to stay and food, as well as the loneliness of a hotel room. Whether for a few days, a month or even a year, this situation can wear on a family, financially, emotionally and physically. For our servicemen and women and their families, that is where the fisher houses step up to the challenge. In the last 24 years, these houses have served thousands of families from all branches and components (active duty, guard, reserve, retired and veterans) of the military; over 1,110 families in 2014. Guests stay in the fisher houses at no expense; the fnhi raises money to reimburse the air force for the day to day operational expenses. The average length of stay of a family in the house is 11 days. Some guests stay only for a day or two while others stay for several months or more while receiving medical treatment at the wright patterson medical center (wpmc). The wright - patterson fisher houses provide an invaluable service to our military members and their families. Most guests come from a seven state area (ohio, kentucky, west virginia, michigan, indiana, illinois and wisconsin). However, there have been guests from all over the world staying at the fisher houses as the wpmc is the largest medical center in the air force and the largest military medical center in the midwest.

It strives to provide experiences that enrich and enhance each childs language, cognitive, social, emotional, physical, and creative development.  Staff provide care that is warm, supportive, nurturing, and responsive to each childs needs.  Within LOFTs daily schedule, each child will be exposed to opportunities to create, explore, and influence their environment, with an emphasis on developing communication and problem solving skills.  A balance of child-centered and adult-modeled activities promote interpersonal interaction and provide opportunities to develop a positive self-concept.    LOFTs preschool program is built upon the Montessori philosophy and led by a Montessori trained and certified teacher.  Large open spaces and low teacher-child ratios create an environment that is conducive to every childs growth and development.  Following the Early Learning Content Standards, children leaving preschool and entering Kindergarten will be prepared and ready to learn.   Learning Gardens  St. Rita School for the Deaf has a unique Learning Gardens program, providing hands-on learning experiences that support state standards for Math, Science, and English.  The gardens and greenhouse help nurture the wonderment of nature, create respect for all living things, and inspire students to work cooperatively with one another and their community.  Through their work in the gardens, students are reminded that there is a myriad of exciting discoveries to be made in the natural world, and that they dont have to travel someplace exotic to experience thrill.  The Learning Gardens provide the perfect backdrop for students to learn about propagation, landscaping, soil, preparation, composting, and pest control.  In a totally organic environment, students of all ages are learning how to grow foods naturally, not only for the health of the earth but for the health of their own bodies.    Literacy  We believe the best way to educate deaf and hard of hearing children and hearing children with language or communication disorders is through Comprehensive Communication.  This philosophy offers a child every available stimulus for human interaction, including ASL, PSE, assistive listening devices, visual aids, and technology.    All staff and teachers communicate in a way with each child to help him/her develop their language and build reading and writing skills.    A full-time Literacy Coordinator works closely with teachers and speech therapists to ensure that each student stays on track with his or her reading and writing goals.  St. Rita School for the Deaf is currently using Literacy comprised of a Nine Piece Program which includes: Reading to Students, Language Experience, Independent Reading, Dialogue Journals, Guided Reading and Writing, Shared Reading and Writing, Writing Workshop, and Research Reading and Writing.  It also includes Montessori methods as well to help children identify parts of speech and sentence structure.   Socialization  Growing and learning socially, outside of the classroom, is an important aspect of education at St. Rita School for the Deaf.  With a thriving After School Activities Program, St. Rita School students have unique opportunities to communicate with their peers in a more casual setting.  There are clubs, classes, and team sports for different age groups, with new activities available each semester.  These social programs are not limited to St. Rita School students, but are open to all mainstreamed students as well.  These programs serve as a creative outlet for self-expression, teamwork, and building self-esteem.  Technology  Technology plays a crucial role in developing communication and language with the students at St. Rita School for the Deaf.    Children who wear haring aids and cochlear implants can benefit from the Phonak FM System.  The FM System amplifies the teachers voice to help children recognize speech sounds and focus on what matters most, learning.  Classrooms are equipped with technology that includes Interwrite Boards, computers, and video phones, and TVs.    Interwrite Boards become an extension of the computer, offering students a chance to stand in front of the class and use digital markers to write, drag, and tap their way through educational lessons that are fun.  Using the virtual marker, students can drag words to their corresponding pictures and watch the image come to life through simple animation.  These interactive exercises assist St. Ritas students of all ages form connections between ASL (American Sign Language) and written English.  The school continues to see an increase in Reading and Math scores while using the Interwrite Boards.  Video phones provide a visual tool for communicating with one another.  Students can see the facial expressions of the other person to provide a clear communication of the concepts and ideas being portrayed.  WSRS News is broadcasted live from the TV studio to all classrooms everyday to for morning announcements, The Pledge of Allegiance, and a thought for the day.  Vocabulary words are introduced as well to help the child continue to develop their language.  Sign n Say  www.apraxiaeducation.org  St. Rita School for the Deafs Sign n Say Program uses sign language to give students with childhood apraxia of speech another way to communicate, building a language base to allow children to progress in their academic education while they develop the speech skills needed to communicate verbally.  Small class sizes allow each student with apraxia to receive individual attention they need to overcome their motor and sensory challenges associated with Apraxia.  These components are combined Sign n Say adaptation of curriculum and teaching techniques to create an environment where children can succeed both academically and socially.    A support group allows parents of apraxic children to get together once a month and compare notes on how they are dealing with the special needs of their child.  The group is open to parents of students not enrolled in the Sign n Say program as well.      Voc 2 A program for high school students who are deaf with other multiple needs and their learning and language level are far below their age.  The students are not college bound students but have the potential to be productive members of society after they leave St. Rita School for the Deaf.  The Voc 2 program teaches functional academics through the community and life skills.  Students participate in an array of programs including the Special Olympics and community work sites.  A Work Study Coordinator, works closely with the students teaching them job training skills.  She also works closely with community businesses that are willing to help train students in various jobs.  Currently, CiCis Pizza in Tri-County, LaRosas in Tri-County, and Sharon Hill Day Care are embracing our students and teaching them various job training skills to help them become productive members of society.

We help them to heal in a safe, caring and respectful environment.	Greater CIncinnati and Northern Kentucky	medical recovery care and counseling, as well as support services and housing . With proper healing, Respite Care patient readmissions to the hospital due to improper healing are dramatically reduced, saving the community an estimated $10 million annually.  In addition, chronically homeless patients placed in Respite Permanent Supportive Housing results in a 60% reduction in publically funded services for these patients, generating an estimated savings to the community of at least $1 million annually.	RESPITE CARE OUTCOMES The Center for Respite Care focuses on healing the entire person, physically, mentally, emotionally, socially & spiritually, profoundly affecting the lives of people who are sick and homeless. As a result: 1.  90% of patients complete their medical plan of care at the Center for Respite Care 2.  90% of patients leaving Respite Care move into housing or treatment facilities 3.  94% reduction in hospital readmissions   These results far exceed the national average of only 55% of homeless patients of homeless medical respites completing their medical recovery before they leave, and only 30% being discharged to housing or treatment facilities.   RESPITE CARE COST EFFECTIVENESS  One day at Respite Care is only 5% of the cost of a day in the hospital.   RESPITE CARE IMPACT  Medical recovery at the Center for Respite Care dramatically reduced readmissions to the hospital due to improper healing. Estimated savings to the community: $10 million annually.   RESPITE HOUSING OUTCOMES 1.  In 2012, 92% of housing clients remained stably housed at exit from the Respite Housing Program. 2.  92% of clients leaving the program in 2012 had income, and 100% exited with non-cash benefits.  RESPITE HOUSING COST EFFECTIVENESS  Studies conducted in many cities across the country have reported that chronically homeless people living on the streets and in shelters used on average more than $40,000 in publically funded services per person per year. A study released in June 2011 by Northern Kentucky University showed similar results locally. These studies also indicated that placing a chronically homeless individual in permanent supportive housing reduced these costs dramatically.  RESPITE HOUSING IMPACT 1. 60% reduction in publically funded services for housed clients 2.  Estimated savings to the community of at least $1 million annually.

SANDY CAY, Inc. (SCI) is a nonprofit organization which has been in operation since 2000 helping many area families with their children?s special educational needs. SCI assists in the education of children ages three and up with communication, cognitive, behavior and/or social function deficits in rural Northwest Ohio.            Although SCI utilizes a multidisciplinary approach, the focus of training centers on Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) including Applied Verbal Behavior (AVB).  These have proven successful with children previously thought to be uneducable, such as some children with autism spectrum disorders.          Each child?s program is tailored to their specific needs.  In addition to academics, programs may include life skills, social skills, sensory integration, behavior management, music and strategies relevant to speech, language and occupational therapy.  Qualified staff trains tutors to effectively work with this population of special needs children.  Programs are closely monitored through data collection, observation and team review.  Services are typically provided at The Bryan Center.  The Bryan Center is a division of SCI that provides services to children with autism spectrum disorders including Asperger?s Syndrome and PDD.  In special cases, services can be provided to students enrolled in private school.  SCI may also support staff within other educational settings. Support personnel involved may provide consult services to staff or direct services to students.                                                                                                                                                                                                             Training is available to parents so that their children have consistency. Parental involvement is vital to each child?s success.  The ultimate goal is independence across environments.      Another division of SCI is The Coral Reef Project which provides after school tutoring, supports Team Meetings for SCI clients, operates an extended Summer School Program and also runs a Mentoring Program for teens with and without disabilities.       SCI has identified children in the community with present needs and wishes to augment their development with appropriate intervention. As financial resources grow, more children will have the opportunity to participate.  SCI operates throughout the year.  Number of support hours per child is at the discretion of SCI and depends upon financial resources, need and personnel.

Bethany House Services Inc	http://www.bethanyhouseservices.org	(513) 921-1131	EIN 31-1101401	1841 Fairmount Ave	Cincinnati	OH	45214	USA	Homeless & Housing, Homeless Shelters	Bethany house services empowers homeless and at-risk families with the solutions to achieve housing stability and long-term self-sufficiency.			Emergency shelter - bhs provides a sanctuary for desperate homeless families in need of help to achieve stable housing and income. Our shelters provide the secure environment needed for parents to look beyond their current situations and to plan for their futures. The shelter meets each family's immediate needs for safety, housing, food, and other necessities. During their stay in a bhs shelter, parents receive comprehensive case management from experienced licensed social workers. Case managers meet with families as soon as possible after they have entered the shelter and begin the process of identifying barriers to achieving housing as well as reinforcing the positive attributes and resources of the family. The case manager guides the family through the process of developing a comprehensive, reality-based plan for ensuring a secure future in stable housing. During 2014, 438 individuals (283 of whom were children), were sheltered by bhs. We provided 14,002 supervised bed nights and 30,350 meals. Family members are assessed for a wide range of needs and are referred to community resources for physical and mental health issues, job or education- related barriers, and financial assistance. Referrals are made to other agencies that can contribute to the well-being of the family. A mental health clinician is on site at bethany house to evaluate and counsel family members and to make referrals to community resources as indicated. This clinician also supports the family as they deal with the precipitating events and the trauma of homelessness experience. In 2014, almost 3,000 case manager meetings with clients were held; 2,324 referrals were made to community agencies and resources. In combination with one-on-one case management support, life skills group programs provide a foundation for prevention of future episodes of homelessness. These educational sessions are taught by experts from the community and bhs staff. Speakers address topics such as financial literacy, budgeting, parenting, developing healthy relationships, healthy choices, nutrition, yoga, and tenants' rights. Job-related skills such as resume writing and interviewing are also taught. Bhs programs address the multigenerational aspect of family homelessness by providing parents with the skills for "positive parenting" and by teaching children to make healthy choices. The positive parenting, family nights, and "nutrition, health and safety" programs provide parent-child activities and promote stronger relationships in addition to the core content. Bethany house staff emphasize the importance of education and regular school attendance, which is vital if the multigenerational cycle of poverty and homelessness is to be broken.   rapid re-housing - the rapid re-housing program, considered by hud to be the best housing practice for alleviating homelessness, provides financial assistance and services to families experiencing homelessness. The goal of the program is to expedite re-housing and stabilization of the family as quickly as possible. It is easier and more efficient for families to sign up for benefits or apply for jobs when they have a home address and can receive mail. They are also less stressed and better organized at home than when in shelter. The program provides several forms of assistance, including: identification of affordable housing suitable for the family's needs; short-term or medium-term rental assistance and housing relocation and stabilization services, including such activities as mediation, credit counseling, security or utility deposits, utility payments, moving cost assistance, and case management. Rapid re-housing case managers and a housing specialist assist each family to develop a housing plan, serve as liaison between family and landlord, and manage complex issues such as lease options, contracts and apartment inspections. In 2014, 66 families were assisted through the rapid re-housing program. Positive housing outcomes were achieved by 95. 2% of these families.   family transitional housing-the family transitional housing program is a federally funded, supportive housing program that adds an extra level of support for the families who enter homeless shelters in cincinnati. This temporary housing program serves as the "next step" in helping families make the transition from homelessness to stability and self-sufficiency.

Guests of the garden can experience its 20 exquisite specialty gardens and exotic indoor biomes all year long. Founded in 1930 as the garden center of cleveland, the garden has evolved into a community treasure. Records were set for the garden in 2013, with annual attendance reaching an all time high of 188,000, marking a 17 percent increase over the prior year's then-record attendance of 160,000. Likewise, membership to the garden in 2013 hit an all-time high of more than 8,000 northeast ohio households.

Other retrun events such as orchid mania, gourmets in the garden and te autumn ripe! Fest also attracted impressive crowds. Education efforts in 2013 remained at the root of the garden's mission, whether it involves standards-based plant science curriculum taught annually to more than 13,000 school children, or a particular guest finding one more way to garden sustainably in his own backyard. Applied research and exploration keeps the garden relevant. The garden's experts are trusted and important resources on issues related to conserving the environment, plant-based health and nutrition, plant science and best horticultural practices for the home and community at large. The garden's community involvement extends beyond its 10 acres in university circle into city neighborhoods through its green corps and applied-research programs. Since 1996, green corps has enlightened area teens by offering them hands-on urban-agriculture experiences; and green corps expanded in 2013 to bring "living classrooms" to local schools in cleveland through the installation of schoolyard gardens. The applied researc program, largely funded through grants, continued to lead regional efforts to address issues of vacant urban land and community greening. In late 2013, the garden's leadership began exploring opportunities to integrate with another organization as a way to ensure its vibrant future for generations to come. In june 2014, the garden anounced it was in talks to integrate with another northeast ohio not-for-profit with a similar mission.   arts, culture & humanities program, general & other gardens  education, general & other education

Matthew 25: Ministries Inc	http://www.m25m.org	513-793-6256	EIN 31-1348100	11060 Kenwood Rd	Cincinnati	OH	45242	USA	International	The mission of Matthew 25: Ministries is to fulfill Matthew 25:34-40 by providing nutritional food to the hungry, clean water to the thirsty, clothing to the naked, shelter to the homeless, medical care to the ill, and humanitarian supplies to prisoners.   "As you did it to the least of these my brothers and sisters, you did it to me" (Matthew 25:40).			Humanitarian Aid Organization   Matthew 25: Ministries is a humanitarian aid organization that helps more than 11 million people around the world each year and sends more than 10 million pounds of aid such as food, personal care items, medical supplies, and other  products to the poorest of the poor. We work with corporations, organizations and individuals to provide much needed aid to the poor and fight against world poverty .   Our HUMANITARIAN RELIEF Products   Matthew 25: Ministries provides humanitarian relief to the poor by collecting product donations from corporations, organizations, and individuals. With the help of our volunteers, M25M evaluates, categorizes, sorts, and processes these donated items before shipping them to those in need. These steps ensure that the products meet social, legal, and cultural requirements of the area. The donated items range from personal to community supplies, food, clothing, and medical aid. These donations help those in impoverished areas of Greater Cincinnati, throughout the U.S. , and around the world.   Our Humanitarian Aid Partners   In order to reach as many people as possible, Matthew 25: Ministries partners with non-profit organizations in the recipient location. This helps keep costs down. Through these relationships we ensure that donated goods are shipped to places with true need and distributed by people who are familiar with the area. Matthew 25: Ministries works with more than 20 organizations in the Greater Cincinnati area, groups throughout the United States including Appalachia and the American Indians, and in over 35 countries worldwide.  Disaster Response   In disaster situations, time is a precious commodity and implementing an effective disaster response is critical. Matthew 25: Ministries is constantly monitoring its readiness to meet the needs of a sudden disaster. This includes maintaining the facilities and resources needed, as well as being ready to engage disaster relief volunteers from the local community who want to help provide relief to the victims.     Disaster Support Process   In order to provide the most effective disaster support possible, supplies must be sorted prior to being shipped. When aid products reach the devastated area, they need to be ready for immediate distribution. Matthew 25: Ministries ships only pre-sorted, pre-processed items that are culturally and seasonally appropriate to the disaster area. This ensures that the products will bring relief to the victims instead of creating additional work for the responders in the area. According to UNDRO (United Nations Disaster Relief Organization), "The impulsive generosity of governments, organizations, and individuals alike can cause as much chaos and confusion as the disaster itself."     Natural Disaster Relief   Matthew 25: Ministries has responded to a wide variety of natural disasters including cyclones, tsunamis, earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, windstorms, and droughts. Most recently, Matthew 25: Ministries has been shipping disaster relief products to Japan in response to the March 2011 earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear crisis.	Thank you to everyone who supports Matthew 25: Ministries' work with the poorest of the poor! With the generous support of our volunteers and donors, Matthew 25 distributed record-breaking amounts of humanitarian aid to the poorest of the poor in our community, our country and our world in 2011. THANK YOU for being a part of our work!   In 2011, Matthew 25: Ministries:  Shipped 621 forty-foot containers of humanitarian aid and disaster relief. Shipped more than 13 million pounds of desperately needed supplies (20% of these products stayed in the U.S.). Helped more than 15 million people in Greater Cincinnati, throughout the United States and around the world. Responded to the earthquake/tsunami in Japan, tornadoes in the southern region of the United States, and flooding in Nicaragua and other parts of Central America. Celebrated 20 years of service and shipped our 100 millionth pound of aid. Was ranked #1 by Forbes and Charity Navigator for efficiency. Produced 3,324,265 meals in our Food Processing Center, 1 million of which went to Japan.

Ten of these programs were focused on health care and allowed our volunteer healthcare providers to treat over 2,000 patients in 17 communities.  One program was focused on education and allowed us to provide free English courses for approximately 50 local students.  Other programs have allowed us to support community projects such as the paving of a patio for a community center, the construction of a bathroom for a kindergarten, the planting of fruit trees in a school garden, and the building of a storehouse for a village grain bank.  Through our grants program, we have provided funding for four community initiatives in Mali, including the creation of a grain bank, the beginning of two school gardens, and the restoration of a well; and one community initiative in Ecuador: the creation of a school computer lab. We have also supported 30 rural Ecuadorian students by covering the various costs necessary for them to attend secondary school.

The education department continued to raise awareness of the atrocities committed against animals on factory farms and the importance of adopting a vegan diet, including tips for making the transition. Mfa's education team accomplished this through pro-vegan online ad campaigns; hundreds of leafleting events; tabling at vegetarian, earth day, environmental, and other types of festivals and fairs; conducting "paid-per-view" video screenings; producing and disseminating videos and blog content; and sharing the cruel realities of factory farming and the how-tos of vegan eating with millions of visitors via our educational websites.   the investigations department exposed animal abuse, including pigs locked for life in gestation crates barely larger than their own bodies, at seaboard foods, a walmart pork supplier. Mfa's investigators caught workers at a butterball turkey hatchery throwing live animals into a grinding machine, and footage taken at the largest duck farm in california showed birds trapped in cage wire left to suffer and slowly die. Video of facilities owned by major poultry producers koch foods and wayne farms revealed countless birds scalded alive in hot water tanks, and investigations into the dairy and livestock market industries exposed workers viciously punching, kicking, and beating animals.   the legal advocacy department secured a record number of criminal animal cruelty charges and convictions against both factory farms and farm workers for egregious animal abuse and neglect. Mfa's legal team presented multiple petitions to judges, prosecutors, and sheriffs nationwide, setting the stage for these prosecutions, and assisted law enforcement with raids of particularly corrupt facilities. The legal advocacy department, in conjunction with a national coalition of animal protection, civil liberties, environmental, labor, and food safety groups, also worked to successfully defeat the vast majority of whistleblower suppression, or "ag-gag," bills that were introduced in states across the country.   following an mfa investigation, the corporate outreach department worked with nestl to adopt a groundbreaking animal welfare policy to eliminate extreme confinement of pigs in gestation crates, hens in battery cages, and calves in veal crates; and mutilations without painkillers, including tail docking and dehorning of cows, and tail docking and castration of pigs. Nestl is the largest food company in the world, with 7,300 suppliers in 90 countries. Following another mfa investigation, tyson announced new animal welfare guidelines for its pork suppliers. Mfa also worked with great lakes cheese and leprino foods to develop animal welfare policies for their dairy supply chains.

She finds hope, and with holistic trauma therapy, life skills and sustainable career training, she finds a dream for her future.  We help girls transition, through the power of a dream, from darkness to light, from victim to survivor to world changer.			Transitions Dream Home  The Dream Home provides girls ages 13-18, rescued from trafficking a safe, loving full-time place to live  a home  and the comprehensive aftercare restoration necessary to realize a hopeful new future, one built on her dreams.  Each girl at the Dream Home receives personalized care to heal from her past and provide opportunities for her future.  A girl who finds her home here finds a new beginning. She finds hope, with holistic trauma therapy, medical care, life skills training and sustainable career skills, she finds a dream for her future. Our mission is to help girls transition, through the power of a dream, from darkness to light and from victim to survivor, to world changer.  Highlights of the Dream Home model:    Safe and secure family environment   Holistic counseling/Trauma therapy   Social work driven case management   Complete medical care   Restorative dental care   Life skills education   Educational and literacy   Computer training   Mentoring   Career training/Job placement   Reintegration services/ Follow-up  The success of this program is based on intensive and innovative care and casework to give girls the attention and services they need to overcome the trauma, abuse and exploitation theyve experienced, and to emerge free and empowered to recapture hope and dreams for their future.  Transitions Shine Career School  At Transitions we believe every girl in our program deserves the highest level of dignity and opportunity we can provide. We also believe every girl is capable of achieving her dreams with the right support and encouragement.  We dont allow girls to settle for what society has told them they are capable of, like sewing and handy-crafts; we know they can do so much more.  Every girl in our program studies English and computer technology and then goes on to find her dream. Shine Career School provides a firsthand opportunity to train girls in any career field they choose, and will serve to overcome the gap in training choices, by providing a high quality learning environment.  Shine will facilitate teaching opportunities for professionals around the world, in a variety of fields, to come to Cambodia and teach, while empowering survivors with the skills and knowledge they need to take control of their lives.  Shine will mirror our current program model and be fully social work focused and trauma-informed, toward healthy reintegration into Cambodian society. Our goal is to give girls the best opportunity to achieve their dreams and  have a successful future, while assisting graduates in job placement or business start-up, ensuring the highest chance of success.  Transitions STAR House  As the next step in the journey of restoration, the STAR House takes a girl from the Dream Home to a supportive transitional home where, alongside other girls she learns to live independently, to apply newly developed life skills and to exercise her rediscovered ability to dream. Highlights of the STAR House program:    Continued social work appointments   Ongoing counseling/group therapy   Independent life skills classes   Budgeting and saving of money   Caring for a home and sharing chores   Building relationships in the community   Medical and dental care Moto Matching Program:  Each girl who successfully completes the STAR House program and works toward a savings goal, will receive a moto match of up to $400. She can then purchase her first moto, which empowers her to begin life on her own with reliable transportation to work and a sense of accomplishment.  Transitions Bridge Project  In our efforts to bring healing and restoration to survivors of sex trafficking we have encountered a gap in services available to survivors that must be filled.  The Bridge Project will stand in that gap.  Recognizing the family related stress experienced by our clients, and knowing that an integral part of full restoration for survivors involves working through strains in family relationships, the Bridge Project serves to rebuild, strengthen, and restore the relationship of the survivor and her family.  The Bridge Project is an extension of current family support and reintegration services that Transitions has offered since we started work in Cambodia.  It offers a new level of fully comprehensive family based services, that will serve to not only provide support to survivors, but also to bring strength and empowerment to the Cambodian family.  The Bridge Project is designed with the belief that if families and communities are given enough support to make choices that enable them to meet their own basic needs in a manner that is sustainable and empowering, extreme levels of desperation can be avoided and people will not be driven to infringe on the rights of others to ensure their own ability to survive.  This year we will complete a thorough and empowerment-based research and needs assessment.  This will serve to inform the design of the program to ensure that it will work to serve survivors and their families in a manner that is sustainable and empowering.  The research will be designed and conducted by our Bridge Team, Claire Renzetti, PhD, Summer Twyman, Clinical Supervisor, Brianna Hodge, Fulbright Scholar, and a team of Cambodian social workers. Priorities of the Bridge Project:  1)     To serve survivors in the Transitions Dream Home by helping to alleviate the stress they feel as a result of poor conditions in their family. And for some, to increase the chances of a successful reintegration back home.  2)     To serve the families of those survivors by providing services and support, especially in situations where there are other children in the home at risk of being sold.  Services will include family therapy, follow-up support, crisis intervention, and information and referral services.  3)     To serve the Cambodian community by working to bring about sustainability, both in an effort to further stabilize trafficking survivors and their families, but also as a prevention effort. Community support will be strongly based on an empowerment model that seeks to combat dependability on NGOs.	Our Model  Transitions has a very unique approach to restoring the lives of girls rescued from sex trafficking. We have created a model of care, which is highly individualized, recognizing the different needs of each girl coming into our care. The result is that girls receive the most holistic care, focused on their specific needs. Each of our programs are designed to work together to ensure girls receive a continuum of care from intake to reintegration; ensuring girls the highest opportunity for success.  Transitions has an unprecedented success rate, with girls reintegrated into Cambodian society and not being re-trafficked, re-exploited, or voluntarily engaging in commercial sex. Its what we would do for our own daughters.  We help girls transition, through the power of a dream, from darkness to light, from victim to survivor to world changer. Our Core values  Transitions was founded on these four core values that guide all of the work we do in restoring girls lives. 1. Rescue is a process, not a single event.  Delivery from a life of bondage begins with the heroic and dramatic act of rescue in which a girl is removed from harms way. The rescue, however, is but the first step on a journey of healing, restoration and empowerment as a girl regains control of her life and once again learns to hope. 2. Freedom without a future is another form of slavery.  Without viable and sustainable career and life skills, a girl rescued from trafficking has few opportunities and little direction. But with these needs addressed she has a restored sense of dignity and a foundation on which to believe in herself and to pursue her dreams. 3. A girl shouldnt continue to carry the wounds of her past.  The goal of aftercare is to restore lives, not patch them up, to help each girl realize a life of substance and meaning. A holistic approach, with a comprehensive focus on individuals, is the only effective response to a girl rescued from trafficking. Every girl is empowered to shed the wounds of her exploitation to live a whole, healthy life, freed from the burden of her exploitation. 4. Giving a girl choices and a dream restores her future.  By first treating her trauma, then creating a nourishing environment that encourages and respects a girls desires and choices, Transitions builds a bridge to opportunities, programs and systems that give her control over her life and the tools to realize her dreams. Each girl plays a prominent role in shaping and taking responsibility for her future.
