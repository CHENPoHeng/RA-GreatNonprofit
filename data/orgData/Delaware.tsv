In 2014 mha reached over 2,250 participants in its education workshops and 200 participants in the 13th annual community mental health conference formerly known as the people of color mental health conference. Mha has continued as co-chair of the delaware suicide preventioncoalition which is promoting project life (living is for everyone), a comprehensive, statewide suicide prevention initiative targeting youth ages 10-24 through a teen website, a social marketing campaign, dissemination of booklets, and gatekeeper trainings. Gatekeeper trainings are available at no cost to community members, professionals, and non-professionals in the state of delaware. They are evidence-based trainings on how to responsibly respond to youth and college students showing signs of suicidal behavior and how to intervene effectively. This year the lifelines program continued to be implemented in middle schools and high schools. Lifelines is a compreshensive suicide prevention program developed specifically for schools, with separate components for school staff, parents and students. In 2014, mha conducted 48 lifelines trainings, 7 safetalk suicide alertness trainings and 8 two-day applied suicide intervention skills trainings (asist). In 2014, 1,095 participants were trained to increase awareness about suicide and to appropriately intervene when people at risk for suicide are identified. In addition, the fourth annual military suicide prevention conference was held in collaboration with the military subcommittee of the delaware suicide prevention coalition providing suicide prevention tools for 300 providers, service members, and veterans. In 2014, mha's media and advocacy program had the following results: 8 news articles were written, and 2 newsletters were printed and distributed to a circulation of 65,000 people. 550 people follow mha on facebook, and over 9,100 pieces of mental health literature were distributed throughout the state at presentations, healthfairs, trainings and at indiviual requests. Mha participated in 8 policy committees with contact with legislators and policy makers.   counseling and support services - through counseling and support services programs, the organization's goal is to provide supplemental mental health service for individuals suffering with and undergoing treatment for mental illnesses. Participation in a support group as a supplement to medical treatment increases an individual's likelihood of maintaining treatment. Mha also provides support groups for individuals who have lost family members to suicide or murder. In addition, mha responds to inquiries from family members, individuals, mental health professionals, and state agencies who request information about mental health, mental illness, and mental health treatment services. In 2014, 325 people attended weekly support groups that provided over 2,880 hours of service, 528 individuals accessed the information and referral help line, and over 11,000 individuals visited the mha website, mhainde.

(2) To identify temperamentally sound dogs and rescue them from overcrowded public animal shelters;(3) To provide them with excellent medical attention including all necessary vaccines, testing for Heartworm, Lyme & Ehrlichia, De-Worming, starting them on Heartworm and flea & tick preventative, and Microchipping; (4) To spay/neuter every dog before adoption; (5) To supply them with socialization as a family members in our foster homes; (6) To find each of them a forever home where they will be loved and cherished for the rest of their lives.Part of our mission is learning as much about each of our puppies and dogs as soon as they arrive. Since they are always fostered and live as part of our families, we can understand each dog's needs, personality and disposition which are key to making a perfect match with a potential adoptive family. We keep our website up to date and provide as much information as possible on each dog's webpage profile, as well as include regular updates on each dog's progress and adoption status.  After learning about our dogs through the profiles, we hope that you will take the time to come to one of our monthly "Mingle with our MUTTS? or schedule an appointment to visit our dogs in person after you have an approved adoption application.  Meeting the dogs in person gives the potential adopter an opportunity to have one-on-one interaction with our dogs as well as speak with the adoption coordinator or foster parent about a particular dog.  You may just find that although you had been interested in one dog's profile online, another may just win over your heart in person!

The nutrition and fitness programs provide opportunities to improve or maintain physical health. A variety of educational and social opportunities help to stimulate mental activities. Social opportunities support a general sense of wellbeing. The transportation program allows the less able to access the many programs and services available.					The education and recreation programs at the nsc provide a broad range of physical and recreational opportunities. There are a variety of options including: a therapeutic pool, fitness center, exercise classes such as armchair exercise, jazzercise, zumba, yoga, strength training, and dancing. All programs are tailored to the needs of the 50+ population. Some programs are offered free to members and scholarships are available. The recreation offerings range from billiards, table tennis, shuffleboard and horseshoes to a very wide range of card games and board games. One of the most important aspects to all of the programming is the ability to avoid isolation and interact with other individuals who may have common interests and life experience. The center offers educational programming on a broad range of topics: computer classes, art, writing, poetry, bible study, book groups, discussion groups, philosophy and much more. Many of the classes are taught by volunteer instructors who have a wealth of experience and a passion for their subject. The center also features many local business people for presentations that are pertinent to our members. The center is a wonderful community center that services individuals throughout the region.   the food service program at the newark senior center serves both the homebound in our community through our meals on wheels program and the members who are able to come to the center through our midday meal. The meals on wheels program allows many individuals to age in place in their homes and neighborhoods. More than 30,000 meals are delivered each year by volunteers. The volunteers provide not only a meal, but also a caring and concerned visitor each day. In many cases a referral is made to other social services that may be available to assist the individual. 80% of our clients report some economic relief because of the meal program and before receiving mow 100% of our clients did not eat a nutritionally balanced diet each day. The meal provides 1/3 of the nutritional requirements. The midday meal program provides a wide selection of freshly prepared items at a very modest cost. The meals are prepared on the premises by our food service staff. Each day a variety of salads, sandwiches, soups and an entree are served. More than 35,000 midday meals are served each year to the community. The meal provides an affordable nutrition option, but also a wonderful opportunity for socialization.   the social service and transportation programs at nsc provide a safety net for many individuals. The social services program provides options for counseling, case management, and offers presentations and screening that are pertinent to the 50+ community. The social services function is used by many in the greater newark area who are not members of the nsc. The nsc is also home to one of four caregiver resource centers throughout the state. The program establishes an atmosphere of trust, caring and sensitivity, provides support, effective services, accurate information and makes referrals to appropriate agencies for the elderly, their families and caregivers, always with an emphasis on the independence and dignity of those who seek our services. The transportation program provides door to door services to those who would probably otherwise be home-bound. Once at the nsc, individuals have access to the many programs, services, and activities available. The transportation program allows hundreds of members each year to continue to age in the community, prolongs independence and greatly increases the opportunity for socialization.

Greenways,trails, bike/pedestrian travel routes:delaware greenways works in all three counties to develop, coordinate, garner funding for and promote use of greenways and trails. This year we completed a pedestrian and bicycle plan for the city of rehoboth, calling for major bicycle-friendly changes. We also completed a plan to better connect the neighborhoods and developments along delaware's state route 1 between lewes and rehoboth to the junction and breakwater trail and regional shopping areas. Publication of maps with existing bicycle routes was one immediate benefit of both projects. Last spring we partnered with nemours and bike delaware to hold a public event (walkable-bikeable delaware) in dover advocating for state actions to plan, design, and fund pathways, trails, and other non-motorized transportation investments throughout the first state. Delaware greenways was an early and vocal supporter of the proposal for delaware's first national park.   scenic byways:delaware greenways is the leader in the development of scenic and historic byways in delaware. We work to secure byway designations that will help preserve the historic, natural, and scenic landscapes of the area. We develop corridor management plans that protect byway assets while providing for sustainable growth and development, including convenient mobility for residents, visitors, and businesses. This year, progress on the brandywine valley national scenic byway included a landscape design to restore trees along a portion of kennett pike as well as technical research to support legislation (now signed into law) forming a byway advisory board to guide management of the byway. Work on the route 9 coastal heritage byway lead to the concept of ten discovery zones and linkage with the bayshore initiative (a part ofamerica's great outdoors program), both receiving an enthusiastic response from the public. This year's milestone on the lewes historic byway was completing a public opinion report based on focus group meetings with many residents and business leaders.   healthy living initiatives:delaware greenways is part of the delaware healthy eating active living (de heal) coalition and continues to work with communities to evaluate, plan, and implement multi-faceted wellness initiatives. This year we completed a series of programs in the city of new castle including green hour at carrie downie elementary school (a scheduled, weekly, unstructured playtime for children to get them active on our trails/parks) and a smoke free parks policy and awareness campaign. Many of our healthy living initiatives come about through our role as master tenant and manager of historic penn farm (a 310 year old, 112-acre private urban land trust of the trustees of the new castle common). This year we hosted approximately ten open farm events (e. G. Tours of historic buildings, a community hoedown, a film in the farm stand and volunteer activities). We presented the first annual common ground forum, featuring a weekend of events including a presentation by world-renowned sustainable agriculture expert dr. Fred kirschenmann. We partnered with william penn high school to support their agriculture and culinary curricula as well as their csa. We continued work on soil restoration, water quality improvements and erosion mitigation.
