Run entirely by volunteers sharing compassion, dedication and commitment donating their time and resources to help save the lives of the many dogs in need.  We are dedicated to saving dogs mainly from high-kill city shelters in Texas where there is an abundance of stray, abused and neglected dogs needing our help. After veterinarian examination and a health certificate issued, they are transported via DOT approved companies to the rescue and, or foster homes in Maine where there are an abundance of families throughout the east coast and Canada eager to adopt.  Animals in our care are all spayed or neutered and receive all necessary and appropriate veterinary care and treatment.  We do not dictate to veterinarians when and what treatment is needed, but follow their advice and instructions. We comply with the state of Maine import policies and our rescue is inspected and issued a yearly state of Maine Shelter License.  We have an in-depth application, which includes a vet reference check, two personal reference checks, authorized back-ground checks and if we feel the need, a home visit.

Give a Dog a Home, German Shepherd Dog Rescue strongly supports spay and neutering programs and educate families on the importance to help stop the overpopulation of unwanted animals.	Save as many dogs as we can, get them all and necessary vetting and treatments before finding them wonderful families to live their lives full of love, happiness, fun and safety. We have excellent working relationships with veterinarians in both Texas and Maine that we follow their professional advice and treatment plans.

We are officially now a PARTNER AGENCY with the SAN ANTONIO FOOD BANK, working with the DAISY CARES PROGRAM.  We also work with a select few Service Dog Training Organizations who select our dogs for training. We always fund-raise to cover the adoption fee so that it is one less burden on a person that already has a lot in life to deal with.  We have been invited be a Day Care for mentally challenged adults and children to take our dogs to spend time with the clients, we also take a few of our dogs to nursing homes around San Antonio to allow the residents the joys of our dogs and also to allow our dogs to have lots of fuss and attention.	Over 500 dogs saved from the high kill shelters in Texas, strays taken in and owner surrenders since the rescue was founded in February 2011. We are a small volunteer rescue, who with our compassion, commitment and love of what we do have achieved a lot.   The rescue relocated to Maine in July 2015 and since then our adoption numbers have increased, allowing us to save many more dogs, even though the logistics and financial constraints do make saving these lives considerably difficult. However, where there is a will, there is a way and we always find a way.

Is a nonprofit conservation organization working to restore, preserve and defend the natural integrity of the north woods region through public awareness and citizen activism. Our mission is to improve the ecological awarenenss concerning the restoration and preservation of the north woods through conferences and publications serving over 1200 members.				Maine woods national park & preserve - in 1994, restore proposed a study of the benefits and costs of creating a maine woods national park & preserve. During fy15, we continued our efforts to build public and political support for the park vision by giving presentations, tabling at conferences and fairs, and distributing information including copies of a fully revised version of our park brochure. Simultaneously, epi, a foundation started by conservation philanthropist roxanne quimby, made progress in building support for her offer to donate approximately 150,000 acres for a new national park and national recreation area within our proposed maine woods national park & preserve, along with 40 million for an endowment.   maine environmental news - we continue to manage the maine environmental news website (www. Maineenvironews. Com)as the most comprehensive compilation of online conservation and natural resource news in maine. We have added links on the website to more than 34,000 news articles, events and announcements, including several thousand new postings in fy15.   new national parks project - for more than a decade, restore has been building a network of citizens and conservation organizations that support our national parks. During fy15, we continued to coordinate with supportive groups and activists as part of our new national parks project, obtained a grant to create a full-color new national parks brochure, and published a book chapter making the case for new national parks.   maine woods threats - while much of our work focuses on implementing positive change, it is essential to stand up against environmental destructive plans and proposals. In september 2014, we updated our map featuring 20 major threats to the ecological integrity and recreational traditions of the maine woods, including misplaced developments, excessive logging, dangerous energy projects, a plan to develop a 220-mile private east-west highway and utility corridor across maine, and a disastrous mining proposal for northern maine. Allagash wilderness waterway - the allagash wilderness waterway (aww) is the longest state-managed wild river in the national wild and scenic rivers system. In 1999, restore launched a coalition to defend the wild character of the aww. During fy15, we monitored meetings of the state-chartered allagash council and supported public acquisition (via aww foundation) of the last private property along the aww waterway. Wildlife - for over 20 years, restore has been a voice for protecting wildlife, especially significant habitats and imperiled species. During fy15, we coordinated with the national endangered species coalition and northeast wolf coalition, which are working for recovery of this endangered species. Environmental legislation - during fy15, restore participated in the maine environmental priorities coalition, which informed citizens and lawmakers in maine about the importance of maintaining strong environmental protection programs. Visitor center - for the 22nd consecutive year, we reached visitors to acadia national park with informational handouts about our issues at a visitor center in downtown bar harbor. Maine paper mills - the forest products industry was a backbone of the economy of maine and the northeast for generations. However, it is experiencing massive changes, which have big implications for our work on conservation of wildlands and wildlife. We researched and created the most comprehensive map published in decades illustrating the recent history and current status of paper mills in maine.

This scenario places these kids at serious risk for a variety of adverse outcomes. Thanks to the sizable body of research that has accumulated over the past 50 years, significant progress has been made in our understanding of the factors underlying challenging behavior, and points toward lagging skills (rather than lagging motivation) as the key factor. However, this research has been slow to influence assessment and treatment in many settings. Our mission is to build on that knowledge, the sizable body of research supporting the effectiveness of the CPS model, and our experiences in working with families, schools, inpatient units, residential and juvenile detention facilities, and government agencies, to change the lives of behaviorally challenging kids and their caregivers.  We've prioritized four key initiatives in pursuit of this mission:  Open Access: The CPS model has dramatically improved outcomes for behaviorally challenging kids in many different settings. Through this website, we ensure that Dr. Greene's vision -- that parents, educators, mental health clinicians, and staff in restrictive therapeutic facilities have easy access to vast resources on the CPS model at no charge -- is realized.  Lead the Change: Our Kids Advocacy Action Network (KAAN) takes action whenever we learn of schools and facilities that are treating behaviorally challenging kids in ways that are punitive and adversarial, and counterproductive. Through Action Alerts, our thousands of advocates reach out and urge a shift in thinking and point people to resources to empower change.  Share A New View: Dr. Greene's mantra -- Kids do well if they can -- propels caregivers toward interventions that are non-punitive, non-adversarial, skill-building, communication-enhancing, proactive, and collaborative...and away from traditional disciplinary practices such as time-outs, sticker charts, detentions, suspensions, and paddlings. Getting the word out, through our Public Awareness Campaign, is imperative! There are lives in the balance!  Fix The System: At-risk kids and their families often have difficulty accessing the help they need. Systems of care often struggle to coordinate efforts and communicate, and kids and families can get lost in the process. But those things can be fixed, and Lives in the Balance has developed an ambitious, practical, realistic plan to make it happen!	behaviorally challenging kids and their caretakers	21 schools via biweekly coaching, held 10 workshops, delivered 56 purchased care packages and 37 complimentary care packages		a website with free information about the Collaborative & Proactive Solutions Model, interactive radio programs for parents, educators, and clinicians, workshops, the 1st Aid Project, Kids Advocacy Action Network (KAAN)...and much more.

For many years we have been trapping ferals for spay, neuter and vaccination and returning them to their colonies, while adopting out the strays who are sociable. There are several kinds of people who are feeding these animals, and we provide some support for food and shelter. We are moving towards assisting low-income people to spay and neuter their pets in order to prevent the future growth of feral colonies. While we feel we have done much good work in that area, we are moving towards spay/neutering owned cats to prevent stray and feral cats in the targeted neighborhoods. Those families who apply for our services are scrutinized carefully to determine their low income status(e. G. Disability, tanf, fuel assistance, food stamps, low income housing, unemployment, etc. ) last year we spayed and neutered 33 cats in targeted areas; this year we plan to up that number to 25. Outreach occurs locally through rabies clinics,spay and neuter clinics, and adoption events in areas of the greatest need, fundraising events, "letters to the editor" for local newspapers and vfa's own regular newsletter have also helped to develop an effective local presence regarding our services in the targeted areas. In addition, vfa board members are in constant contact with local aco's who are able to help directly connect vfa with those who need our services. At this time, vfa is working on developing an on line presence in order to broaden and improve outreach efforts as well. While we feel that there is much good work being done at this time, we would like to improve in the following ways: 1. Increase our ability to offer low/no cost spay and neutering for pets who live in low income homes. 2. Improve outreach to communities via increased number of events. 3. Grow our community volunteer base. The volunteer base is not just for spay/neuter issues as our mission statement involves us in as many ways as possible with all animals in need. To that end it is our goal to have a sanctuary/shelter to address the cat issue, which still remains a problem in new england, as well as dogs that come up from the south on almost a daily basis. And remembering our mandate, we wish also to be a sanctuary for farm animals in need, including horses

Breaking Ground	http://www.breaking-ground.org		EIN 51-0628198	104 Neal Street	Portland	ME	04101	USA	International, International Relief	MISSION Enabling Cameroonian communities to break ground on sustainable, locally initiated projects.   CORE VALUES  We believe that a community development project can only effectively address the needs of a population if it is conceived, planned, and implemented by the community for whom it is intended.   Furthermore, we believe that a projects long-term sustainability is reliant on the deep-seated investment of the local population, and that this investment cannot be fostered through the work of a foreign entity like ourselves, but must develop organically through a collective recognition of the identified problem and a commitment to solve it.   Thus, Breaking Ground sees the role for outsiders in development as providers of funding and strategic resources to assist locally-initiated projects. By empowering Cameroonian communities to realize their own grassroots projects, we enable truly sustainable, bottom-up development.   OUR UNIQUE APPROACH  Breaking Ground takes two approaches to empowering grassroots development initiative:   Community Partnership Program: We provide seed funding to the locally-initiated projects of mobilized communities.   Small Enterprise Development Program: We provide training and resources to increase the ability of individuals and families to earn money through their primary income-generating activities, better enabling them to invest in their own local initiatives.				WOMENS ENTREPRENEURIAL PROGRAM:   Founded in 2007, Breaking Grounds Womens Entrepreneurial Program (WEP) provides women with critical business skills and the confidence to put them to use. In collaboration with the locally-based Community Research and Development Center (COREDEC), we offer a seven-week business course that incorporates topics such as feasibility studies, basic marketing, cost analysis, and leadership, among others.   Many WEP participants have no personal finances and have no experience in approaching banks for loans. The WEPs classes have become renowned and respected in the community and have helped many women overcome their fear of the banking system and apply directly for a loan.  However, there are still many women who struggle to qualify for bank loans, often because they are single or widowed mothers with no assets. In response to this, Breaking Ground established a program of providing micro-grants to selected participants at the end of each class cycle. To date, Breaking Ground has provided start-up grants to twenty-two female-run business in Ngaoundr, ranging from raising poultry to selling books.	We have made a tangible impact in the lives of over 35,000 Cameroonians.

Three target audiences have been identified for the current strategic plan:  Teens, seniors, and tourists.  A regional high school is very close by and programming is in development to reach this target audience.  The school has an excellent technical program and most students begin careers immediately after graduating.  Seniors are the second priority target as those residing in this area have few, if any, activities to enhance their quality of life after retiring.  The Garden offers significant opportunities for seniors to contribute their knowledge and experience as well as their time.  This is why the Garden has been so successful as, with only 2 staff members, volunteers must fill significant leadership roles that would otherwise be filled by middle and upper management.  Lastly, tourism is a significant economic driver of the area and the Garden is committed to contributing to the economic vitality of the Oxford Hills area.	Approximately 20,000 people visit the Garden each year.	Primarily southwestern Maine and more broadly through tourism.	High School Program "Teen Challenge" - ties nature to the state teaching standards and supports teachers by providing all resources for meeting standards in the arts, science, writing, and math that they have difficulty meeting.  Steward Program - a volunteer program which provides meaningful ways for seniors to contribute to their communities and remain active and engaged.  Historic Preservation Program - maintains the unique and threatened history of the remote, rural southwestern Maine.  Heritage Horticulture Program - preserving unique and local varieties of plants.	We have come a long way in 11 years.  We have purchased the entire site and restored most of the home and barn.  The gardens are in great shape and the volunteer program is strong.

Western/Central Maine		We are innovative and operate with outcome measures in all areas of our work. This allows us to document success in our supports to people. In addition it promotes better use of our funding and utilization of our time.   One example of this system is in our day/community support programs. We determined that people wanted to experience better health and wanted to be in their community more often. To increase their value as contributing members of their community and to enhance their chances of full integration we embarked on two goals: physical fitness and volunteerism.  People now (2009) volunteer over 50% of their time and spend 25% of their time on fitness. This happens in a variety of ways from gym membership to trail hiking.   As innovators we began a couple of projects this year to address our needs for employment and the area need for a community kitchen.  In 2010 we will enter our third year of our famers food collaborative, an innovative food purchasing and delivery business. The Oxford Hills Food Collaborative supports local food producers and allows for over 12 local farms and food producers to sell their products through our marketing and delivery services. The collaborative also offers employment and volunteer opportunities to people we support in fully integrated settings within our community.  We began a program called the Community Table, Helping Hands - Helping Others. This is a program to feed those in need. Currently we provide meals out of a local church however we are in the midst of a building project at our Cottage Street address; we are building a fully licensed commercial kitchen. This addition will not only support our Community Table project but will meet an identified community need for a certified kitchen to support farmers and food producers. The rental of this multi-purpose licensed commercial kitchen will help to support our projects.   We support over 150 people. It is our hope that these highlights of the past year will encourage you to visit our web site to view our annual results of surveys and outcomes.
