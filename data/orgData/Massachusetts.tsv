While many organizations offer hope and the possibility of a good life to their clients, Career Collaborative is committed to providing clients with the exact assistance they need to attain this vision. Since its inception in 1997, Career Collaborative has helped more than 1,300 poor families in the Boston area move toward economic self-sufficiency by helping adults get, keep, and most importantly, succeed at good jobs.	Career Collaborative works with adults who are chronically unemployed or underemployed.  Typically, clients have worked at jobs without career paths for minimal pay.  They do not have the skills to conduct a successful self-directed job search and, because they do not understand unwritten workplace rules, they are likely to violate them.  They need our help to get and keep good jobs.Career Collaborative:1. Teaches job search skills, which are essential for permanent economic self-sufficiency, in a highly interactive course that helps clients build relationships with other students and staff.  We supplement the course with individual services, including resume help and 20 practice interviews with volunteers and staff members.  We teach clients to use the internet for job search and help them submit online job applications.2. Makes individual referrals to good employers.  We refer clients to full-time, permanent jobs that pay at least $20,000 a year and offer benefits.  As long as the client does her or his part, we make referrals until the person gets a good job.3.  Provides coaching and feedback throughout the interview process and for at least two years after the client enters our mentoring program.  Staff members have small caseloads and provide excellent job advice and encouragement so they build trusting long-term relationships with our clients.  4.  Provides clients with an unusually broad range of supportive services both during job search and after they are employed.  For example, we connect clients with organizations that help them get interview clothing, training in budgeting and computer skills, and emergency financial assistance for food and housing.	Since December, 1997:      Career Collaborative has demonstrated that comprehensive employment services combined with intensive supportive and mentoring services lead to continuous employment. Seventy-three percent (73%) of our clients have completed two years of continuous employment or are working toward that goal. In contrast, other organizations estimate that 25% of their clients reach this goal.       Mentees have earned more than $7,300,000 during their mentoring period compared to our cumulative expenses of less than $2,600,000. These numbers do not take into account the public assistance  welfare, unemployment, food stamps, and rent subsidies  that our clients no longer need since obtaining jobs.      Career Collaborative has assisted more than 1,100 people with their job search.      Career Collaborative has developed a replicable job-readiness/job-search course and a leaders guide.	150	Career Collaborative works with adults who are chronically unemployed or underemployed.

Since the U.S. Surgeon General issued a call to action to prevent suicide in 1999, schools and human service agencies have grown more aware of the need to address suicide as a serious public health issue. Yet, there exist few resources for the suicidal, the despairing, or for individuals that have lost a loved one to suicide.   For more than thirty years, Samaritans has been dedicated to reducing the risk of suicide by befriending youth, adults and elders in crisis and educating the community with suicide prevention strategies. For many callers, the befriending support offered at Samaritans is extremely important in helping them cope with pressures in their lives.

Girls work with mentor-scientists who model and foster leadership, affirm college as an expectation, and promote careers in science and technology as goals and options.   In other words, we create an environment where girls have fun doing science and engineering, connecting with female mentors in those fields, and give older girls a chance to grow as guides and leaders!  P.S. We were voted the 2009 Nonprofit of the Year by the Cambridge Chamber of Commerce.	Science clubs - a total of 65 school-year k-8 science clubs engaged 794 participants at 14 sites in five cities in eastern massachusetts (cambridge, boston, newton, lawrence and fitchburg). Clubs were led by volunteer mentors at a ratio of approximately 1 adult:5 girls each semester. Clubs met for 1-1. 5 hours per week for 8-10 weeks in the fall and spring. Curricula included engineering around the world, body maps, circuits and magnets, sound and light, chemistry and crystals, slime and matter, rescue by design, oceans, and astronomy. A total of 98 mentors from area universities and corporations supported these programs. Approximately 37% have or are earning their masters or doctorate degrees in stem. 4 campus chapters support our programs through volunteer recruitment, and the some club management roles, providing these women with leadership and other development opportunities, so in turn, they can be better role models for our girls and teens. We currently have chapters at northeastern university, harvard university, boston college, and brandeis university.   teen programs - we piloted a new 6-8th grade program, steministas, with 30 students at 2 sites, in preparation for the transition of these grades to the teen program. The steminista program is designed as a project-based, interdisciplinary curriculum that consists of multiple modules over the school year, and allows middle school girls to combine creativity and stem-related problem solving. Girls first go through a series of learning modules that give them foundational stem skills and an understanding of design, and are introduced to ideas such as biomimicry, climate control and feedbacks, and material science. Thereafter, they engage in 2-5 week-long "consulting" projects in different areas of stem, from civil and environmental engineering to astrobiology that are presented as problems by experts. They work in teams to create a solution, product or set of results related to the topic. We continued the research internship program for a second year. Junior and seniors in high school engaged in research projects at harvard university, simmons college, children's hospital and at aurora flight sciences. These and the other young women presented their projects and research at a year-end showcase, and/or the cambridge science festival. 90 and 98 high school girls participated in the fall and spring semesters respectively, in one or more of teen programs. Participants were engaged in our challenge teams: media team (6), rocket team (7), girls with a z: adventures with zebrafish program (20), coup de code game development (5); mobile app development (11) and internship program (6). The remainder were junior mentors who co-taught the science clubs or vacation week programs. 32 mentors, mostly professionals in stem, facilitated these programs. An additional 35 volunteers hosted girls for field trips. 32 mentors, mostly professionals in stem, facilitated these programs.

The New England Innocence Project was founded in 2000. NEIP considers cases in which a conviction is final and in which scientific testing or other investigative leads could establish a strong likelihood that the individual is factually innocent.  In addition to its work on behalf of individual inmates, NEIP also seeks to raise public awareness of the prevalence, causes, and costs of wrongful convictions, and advocates for legal reforms that will hasten the identification and release of innocent prisoners. It is the New England Innocence Projects vision that no one in New England will ever go to prison for a crime he or she did not commit.		In June we hosted our annual litigation training, with over 120 attorneys and other criminal justice experts in attendance.  This summer we assisted with Vermont's first ever DNA exoneration and were able to walk an innocent man out of prison.

We engage with those most in need and support their initiative and strength as they move beyond crisis and discover new possibilities.	Keep the keys/safe haven program: otr's core programming provides tangible aid and long-term, broad-based support to women, starting when they are homeless or in crisis. Safe haven: through comprehensive daytime direct services, otr engages and annually assists approximately 400 severely disenfranchised women, providing emotional, practical, and professional support that helps the women achieve and sustain extraordinary accomplishments - from improving health, to getting jobs, to finding housing. The goals of the program are to:goal 1: provide a safe space six days a week where women can find practical necessities and a supportive community to begin to explore the steps they need to take to move out of homelessness and increase their quality of life. Goal 2: provide advice, assistance, accompaniment and advocacy for women addressing housing, abuse, trauma, physical/mental health, legal, and other urgent needs and issues. Goal 3: ease women's access to and transition into specialized and single-issue programs and eventually out of homelessness. Otr relies on a collaborative network with approximately fifty other human service providers. This network helps the program facilitate a woman's access and success in programs such as battered women's services, detoxification programs, emergency and transitional shelters and housing, legal and healthcare services, and more. Otr does not duplicate other services, but fills in the cracks to make the whole system work better for women who need it the most. Many women at otr must cope with complex physical and mental health conditions. A program participant's struggle often is complicated by the fact that she cannot set a daily routine, she has no sense of place in a family or in a community, and she has little control over when and what she eats, where she can sleep, and other basic survival needs. Health access and wellness activities in the safe haven break down barriers to healthcare by facilitating access to emergency, primary and preventative healthcare through referrals, support, accompaniment and advocacy with women at community health centers, hospitals and other services. These and other strengths-based group and individual activities are critical components of otr's success. Keep the keys: otr has helped many homeless women move into housing of their own; however, women continue to struggle with addiction, mental health, parenting, financial, employment, legal, and other challenges after they have moved into housing, and they face the new responsibilities of independent living. Participants in the keep the keys program maintain their connections with otr staff and receive a range of services designed to support housing retention and to help women build the neighborhood connections and independent living skills they need to sustain their quality of life. Services include home visits, goal-setting, training in life skills, weekly meetings and gatherings at otr and limited access to the safe haven.   the community outreach and education program: integral to otr's mission is its responsibility to raise awareness and facilitate public discourse about the most vexing social issues that affect the women who participate in otr's programs. Through the community outreach and education program, otr informs the broader community about the interplay of homelessness, trauma, mental illness, addiction, and domestic violence, and helps individuals and groups participate in creating a safe, supportive space for women as they reintegrate back into the community.

Our services aim to help low-income and first-generation students get in to college, graduate from college, and go far in life. We achieve this mission by providing students with consistent, one-on-one support from college applications until college graduation.	College Access Program: Students begin working with Bottom Line during their junior or senior year of high school. At first meetings, students discuss their interests, aspirations, academic history, and family circumstances with a Bottom Line counselor. Once students commit to our program, counselors help them navigate every step of the college application process. While the specific services Bottom Line provides differ to suit individual needs, our counselors typically help students in five areas: college lists, essays, applications, financial aid, and making a college choice. Counselors build a strong relationship with each student during regularly scheduled one-hour meetings, which allows them to support students through any obstacles that arise during the application process. When college acceptance and financial aid award letters arrive in the spring, Bottom Line helps each student review their options to select a college that best suits their academic, financial, and personal needs.  College Success Program: After college decisions are made, students who elect to attend a target school are invited to join the College Success Program. A target school is one of 19 Massachusetts colleges that a large percentage of our students attend. As a first step to succeeding in college, students participate in transitional programming during the summer before their freshman year. Counselors work with students in groups and individually to prepare them for the academic rigor and cultural shock of college. This programming includes several workshops and events, as well as enrollment assistance, financial aid advising, and general problem solving during individual meetings.  Once students arrive on campus, Bottom Line becomes a financial aid advocate, academic advisor, career counselor, and mentor. We offer consistent support to students in four areas: Degree, Employability, Aid, and Life (DEAL). Assisting our students in earning a degree means helping them select a suitable major, monitor their academic progress, develop strategies to improve their performance, and connect with tutors, advisors, and on-campus resources. We assist students in renewing financial aid annually, but also help year-round to resolve problems with tuition bills, determine how to pay balances, and encourage appropriate decisions that will allow students to avoid excessive debt. Additionally, Bottom Line helps students secure internships and part-time jobs, create and update their resumes, and build a unique brand that will allow them to leave college employable. Lastly, Bottom Line offers parent-like guidance and mentoring. The strong relationships counselors maintain with students enable our organization to offer consistent support and help students through unexpected obstacles, such as illness, pregnancy, debt, a death in the family, academic probation, or transferring to another college. This comprehensive support is provided for up to six years or until a student graduates.	98% of high school seniors have been accepted to college and 80% of college students have graduated in 6 years or less.	1,925 high school and college students	low-income & first-generation college-bound students (ages 17-23) from Boston & Worcester, MA, & New York City	Boston and Worcester, MA; New York City

The Walden Woods Project	http://www.walden.org	(781) 259-4700	EIN 95-4292658	44 Baker Farm	Lincoln	MA	01773	USA	Arts & Culture, Environment, Historical Organizations, Land Resources Conservation	The Walden Woods Project was founded in 1990 to protect land of ecological and historic significance surrounding Walden Pond.  At that time nearly half of the Walden Woods' 2,680 acres remained unprotected from development.  Two large tracts of land (a total of 43 acres) were under immediate threat as developers sought to construct an office park and a large condominium complex in close proximity to Walden Pond.  In January 1991, the Walden Woods Project raised enough money to buy the 25-acre Bear Garden Hill site.  A few years later, the Project acquired a second parcel, known as Brister?s Hill.  In 1998, the Walden Woods Project opened The Thoreau Institute at Walden Woods containing over 8,000 volumes and 60,000 items of Thoreau-related materials and launched its two trademark teacher education programs, Approaching Walden and Finding Walden.	Conservation:the walden woods project preserves and protects walden woods and thoreau country in recognition of their worldwide literary, historical, and environmental significance and their capacity to motivate others to identify, study, and protect the environment and historically significant areas that exist in their own communities. In 2014, the project purchased two houses and appurtenant structures on three acres of land that completes our acquisition of the farm at walden woods. The land and structures will provide increased capacity for our organic farming operation, new meeting and program space, facilities for farm staff, housing for program participants and maintenance facilities for farm operations. Land management:the walden woods project manages conservation restrictions on 61 acres of land, which prevents development of sites not owned in fee. Annual conservation restriction monitoring is done to ensure that the protections prescribed in the conservation restrictions are in effect. Invasive exotic plants are a major threat to the ecological integrity of our land. The project actively manages our properties to reduce the prevalence of invasive plants and to minimize the threat they represent. The project's programs support ongoing collaboration between a wide variety of civic and environmental groups who regularly provide volunteer invasive species management to our organization.   education:the education programs of the walden woods project serve an audience that includes students, educators, and life-long learners from around the globe. Our signature programs include our guided tours for groups visiting walden woods and the pond; the live deliberately essay contest for youth ages 13-21 from around the world; a week-long summer professional development program for teachers, approaching walden, and other professional development workshops throughout the year; vernal pool workshops; skype in the classroom sessions; the stewardship lecture series; and world wide waldens, an on-line community of youth working to conserve places in their own communities. All of our programs are inspired by the writings and philosophies of henry david thoreau and ask people to explore their own sense of place-their connection to their own community and other places in the world-and to develop an environmental ethic. As thoreau himself is a highly interdisciplinary subject, we address the topics of transcendentalism, social reform, writing, natural history and 19-century history in our programs, as well. In the 2014/15 academic year, we hosted over 600 students (plus nearly 100 teachers/coordinators with them) in our guided tours of the walden woods area (including the pond). We also host groups in our library at the thoreau institute at walden woods, which maintains the world's largest collection of thoreau-related documents, books, and artifacts, and serve approximately 1,000 students each year through our skype in the classroom program (for those who are too far away to visit the woods). Our approaching walden summer professional development program brings in 25 educators from across the country each year for an intensive, immersive study in thoreau's words and place. There is a competitive process to attend this program that receives high acclaim each year from its participants, with the 2014 feedback being no exception. Participants have the option of completing additional readings and assignments to receive 3 graduate-level credits for the course through fitchburg state university. Our 2014 stewardship lectures series included the following presentations: "walden's shore: henry david thoreau and nineteenth century science," with author of the book of the same title, robert m. Thorson; "who's watching you? : owls of the world," a presentation for all ages with live owls conducted by mark and marcia wilson of eyes on owls; "the transformation of american community," with mark dunkelman, author of the vanishing neighbor (this event was a festival forum as part of the concord festival of authors).   research and library:the thoreau institute library/archives, is owned and managed by the walden woods project and is located in walden woods. The library houses the most complete research collection by and about henry david thoreau, as well as other collections by american writers, including ralph waldo emerson. Staffed by a full time curator, the library is the premiere resource on a global basis for thoreau research and scholarship. Each year the institute welcomes a steady stream of interns interested in pursuing a career in library science, as well as volunteers with an interest in the history and literature of thoreau's time. Every year brings new people to the thoreau institute library, whether in-person or virtually. In 2014, we hosted visitors from canada, europe and asia. Translators from china, czechoslovakia, and iran have worked with the curator to provide accurate and representative translations. "skype in the classroom" sessions bring our curator into classrooms around the country via skype, reaching more than 1,000 students in 2014. We continue to publish many works electronically and update finding aids to our collections. In 2104 we acquired the kevin macdonnell collection, adding rare and unique items to our library.

CLOSE TO HOME DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PREVENTION INITIATIVE INC	http://www.c2home.org	617-929-5151	EIN 30-0082690	42 Charles St Suite A	Dorchester	MA	02122	USA	Family Services	Close to Home's mission is to foster community-wide responsibility to prevent and reduce the impact of domestic violence.  We are building and supporting networks of community residents and organizations in local neighborhoods that want to take action and address the problem of domestic violence together.  Close to Home believes that domestic violence is a critical community issue and that all community members - youth, residents, families, friends, neighbors, civic leaders, and organizational partners -  are essential to designing and implementing the solutions to the problem.  Close to Home seeks to create opportunities for people and organizations to: - Learn about domestic violence in their community,- Discuss and reflect on domestic violence in their lives and communities, - Develop skills to respond to and prevent domestic violence, - Develop and implement solutions to domestic violence, and - Build strong meaningful connections with each other.    Close to Home is leveraging the success of our local community engagement work to influence domestic violence prevention practice and policy locally and nationally.	Close to Home combines expertise in domestic and sexual violence with expertise in working in the community to draw attention to and to help its members design and implement community-centric solutions to these issues. Our goals are to: 1) Build a strong, active network of community members and organizations committed to fostering community-wide responsibility for domestic violence; 2) Develop local community leadership to identify solutions and take action; 3) Intervene where domestic and sexual violence is already present; and 4) Transform environmental factors and social norms to prevent domestic and sexual violence.   We achieve these goals through our community mobilization process that includes the following four activities which occur in parallel: 	Assess Community: Close to Home and community members engage in a process of inquiry and research to understand the local context, learn about the prevalence of domestic and sexual violence and identify community talents, resources, and assets to mobilize for prevention. 	Start Conversations: Community members convene friends, neighbors and colleagues for discussions to raise awareness, foster critical thinking and dialogue, identify solutions, and recruit volunteers.   	Build Skills: Close to Home facilitates training and team building to support skill and leadership development in violence prevention.   	Take Action: Close to Homes network members develop domestic and sexual violence prevention projects to implement in the community (e.g. our 1000 Actions social action campaign in 2010).	Close to Homes innovative community mobilization model is having a deep impact on local community members as well an impact on the broader field. Through our network of 160 trained volunteers in Dorchester, we are reaching over 14,000 community members annually with information about how to both respond to and prevention domestic and sexual violence.    One of the profound challenges in measuring the impact of a community mobilization model is that it is a process that seeks to change behaviors, attitudes and values over the long-term.  We firmly believe, and public health research indicates, that changing behaviors, attitudes and values while building community cohesion will bring down rates of domestic and sexual violence.  We are seeing changes in community members both in terms of their willingness to be active bystanders when violence happens and in terms of transformational change community members are experiencing related to their goals and values in their own relationships.   The engagement of our youth, residents and community members in C2H activities and the civic life of the community is evidence of behavior change.    We are achieving this kind of depth and reach through the implementation of community driven projects such as: developing three bi-lingual social marketing campaigns (English/Vietnamese), a youth literary magazine, and 35 digital stories; supporting youth to design, fund and install a mural at the Fields Corner T station with local business and government backing (2008); completing a youth-led survey of over 200 high school students from eight Boston Public Schools to learn more about youth experiences with domestic and sexual violence at home and in dating relationships, and the role of schools in supporting youth to deal with these issues (2008-09).    Close to Home is also having a major impact on prevention discourse at the state and national level, where program and policy directions are determined. We are influencing the field to see the importance of engaging community members themselves in being central to developing solutions to domestic and sexual violence, and for government and private funding to be substantially increased to support this approach alongside current crisis response efforts.  For this we have been recognized by Governor Deval Patrick as a promising domestic and sexual violence prevention model in Massachusetts (2007); and selected by the California Department of Public Health to train two CA communities (one rural, one urban) (2010).	Our Dorchester network includes over 160 youth and residents, and over 75 local businesses and organizations	Close to Homes primary practice site is in the Fields Corner neighborhood of Dorchester, a diverse neighborhood of 23,000+ residents.  Over 50 percent of the residents are people of color, many of whom are immigrants; it is home to a large and active Vietnamese community and has many residents from Haiti, Cape Verde, Ireland, Jamaica, and the Dominican Republic. Each year, we work with over 160 youth and adult volunteers and over 75 organizations in Dorchester to reach 14,000 people. Civic engagement is a vital part of community life in Fields Corner. There are multiple civic associations and block groups, a diverse faith community, and several economic development projects under way, all of which contribute to the neighborhoods vibrancy.

Ceres	http://www.ceres.org	(617) 247-0700	EIN 22-3053747	99 Chauncy Street 6th Floor	Boston	MA	02111	USA	Environment	Mobilize investor and business leadership to build a thriving, sustainable global economy.	Ceres is an advocate for sustainability leadership. Ceres mobilizes a powerful network of investors, companies and public interest groups to accelerate and expand the adoption of sustainable business practices and solutions to build a healthy global economy.  To accomplish our goals, we work with leading companies, investors, public interest groups, policymakers and other economic players to advance sustainable solutions that will reduce carbon emissions and other pollutants, protect vital natural resources like water supplies, ensure safe and just working conditions for employees and reduce our reliance on fossil fuels while transitioning to a clean energy economy.  Ceres is uniquely situated at the nexus of the business, investment and advocacy communities. Drawing on the expertise of the Ceres Coalition, we convene and direct stakeholder engagements with Ceres network companies to find smart strategies and meaningful performance improvements on key environmental and social issues. Our unique engagement model features diverse teams of credible, external stakeholders that provide ongoing input to companies on policies, strategies, disclosure and bottom-line performance.  In addition to working with investors in the Ceres Coalition, Ceres directs the Investor Network on Climate Risk (INCR), a network of 100 leading investors collectively managing more than $10 trillion in assets.  Ceres helps INCR members leverage their power as shareholders to secure meaningful commitments on sustainability issues companies are facing. Through shareholder resolutions and face-to-face meetings, investors working with Ceres are asking companies to boost their focus and transparency on sustainability-related risks and set tangible performance goals for mitigating those risks  whether by lowering carbon emissions, reducing water and energy use or developing more sustainable technologies and products.  Ceres is also working with investors, Wall Street analysts, credit rating agencies and other financial firms to integrate environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks and opportunities into day-to-day decision-making.  Ceres produces cutting-edge reports on wide-ranging sustainability topics, including global water scarcity risks, challenges from unconventional oil extraction, corporate climate change strategies, and regulatory/policy-related analyses. Our reports highlight key sustainability risks in the global economy and define new standards and corporate/investor best practices for responding.	Ceres has achieved dramatic results our 20-plus year history, most recently including:  In August 2012, Ceres helped to achieve a truly historic strengthening in fuel economy standards for cars and light-duty trucks sold in the United States.  By 2025, vehicle fleets will need to average 54.5 miles per gallon, nearly double the level of today.  This milestone rule is a win-win-win for consumers, the economy, and U.S. job creation.  Ceres played a pivotal role in mobilizing business and investor support for the rule and in publishing reports demonstrating the job creation benefits of higher fuel economy standards.   In September, Ceres mobilized more than 18 companies, including major consumer brands and several Fortune 500 firms, to write a letter to Congress urging the renewal of the Production Tax Credit for renewable energy.  Ceres is unique in its ability to convene such a strong force of Fortune 500 companies to weigh in favor of this important measure.  The strong message from these companies, many of which are members of Ceres BICEP program (Business for Innovative Climate and Energy Policy) demonstrates how a broad cross-section of U.S. companies are already relying on inexpensive and abundant American wind energy to power their businesses.  Also this fall, Ceres published a groundbreaking report on the vulnerability of the insurance industry to climate change.  Ceres has identified the insurance industry as a key potential driver of change, because of the double jeopardy it faces. The industry is reeling from record losses ($32 billion in 2011 alone) due to extreme weather events that are increasingly exacerbated by climate change.  And with more than $23 million in assets globally, insurers are also exposed to climate risk in their investment portfolios.   With our reports and other pressure, Ceres aims to waken the sleeping giant of the insurance industry and spur it to take bold leadership action on climate changeaction that will have reverberations throughout the economy.     Finally, in 2012, Ceres was named by Philanthropedia, a project of the charity watchdog group Guidestar, as one of the top 10 nonprofit organizations in the country working to combat climate change.  Ceres is honored to be recognized for our unique approach to climate change issues: bringing together businesses, investors, and policymakers to build a healthy global economy.  Among the comments of the 121 expert reviewers in the climate change field who participated in Philanthropedias survey: Ceres was admired for its clarity of purpose, definitive niche, and very clear view of what is required to drive change.

Tom and his wife describe their educational farm like this: We enjoy providing access to a small farm that raises chickens, pigs, goats, turkeys, ducks, cows and produce.  We especially want children to experience the connection to their food source, and to have fun doing it.  We practice farming in a way that sustains environmental systems.  We're eager to teach and learn about how farms can provide food that is clean, safe, and nutritious and doesn't harm the earth in its production.

North Plain and Blue Hill are ca. 150 acres, where Sean runs a small 20 cow raw milk dairy, raises 30-100 pasture/woodland raised hogs, 600 laying hens and grows thousands of pounds heirloom tomatoes and other produce.  While Sean actively sells at the Great Barrington Farmers Market, most of his produce goes to the famous Blue Hill Restaurants in NYC and Tarrytown, NY.  Remembering his roots at MITP, Sean honors his early on-farm learning by employing 4-6 farm interns per year.    Rich Ciotola (2005-2008) extended his apprenticeship into 3 years!  When he left MITP, he was already settled into the Berkshires as a committed farmer.  Rich worked, volunteered, bartered, and participated in any way that he could in local Berkshire farming activities post MITP.  That included work at Twin Oaks Dairy (Paul Paisley) , the Wilcox Farm, North Plain Farm, Farm Girl Farm, and Barnum Hill Farm to name a few. Foggy River Farm is the vegetable growing operation, established ca. 2010, that grows and distributes corn (for polenta), potatoes, beans, sunflowers, assorted vegetables and winter squash to local south county restaurants.  Farmer Rich, as hes come to be known, is recognized as a rock in the foundation of the new southern Berkshire farm to table movement.   Jeff Backer (MITP 2008-2010) found two loves of his life at MITP.  After extending his yearlong apprenticeship by 3 months and then apprenticing at Natural Roots, a horse-powered farm, for a year, he established his own farm outside Worchester on Grafton Land Trust land.  Potter Hill Farm raises grass-fed beef and heritage breed pork and grows only heirloom vegetables making a significant contribution to their conservation.  Narragansett White Cap Flint Corn is now grown in Grafton and in the Berkshires, as result of Jeffs efforts.  Jeff also met Carolyn at MITP  Carolyn Hurwitz (2009) was a summer intern at MITP the year that Jeff was a full-year apprentice.  While working a grueling farm-summer schedule and falling in love with Jeff, Carolyn studied for and took the GRE and was accepted to Tufts Veterinary Colleg

In 2014, the organization launched an initiative in schools to engage all youth in the special olympics movement. The organization offers a program to engage the whole school in sports, leadership and education programs. The sports program is known as unified sports, a program which students with and without disabilities train and compete side by side on the same team. The leadership programs involved youth organizing sporting and education events such as a track & field meet or an anti-bullying campaign aimed at educating students at the derogatory use of the "r" word. In 2014, the organization maintained a partnership with the massachusetts interscholastic athletic association (miaa) and the massachusetts association of student councils (masc) to help grow our school programs across the state.

Civic Engagement: is infused into all youth development programming at Sociedad Latina, as we train all youth to advocate for themselves and their communities. Youth learn the importance of civic engagement and receive the tools and space they need to become active citizens. At the heart of our work is an organization-wide commitment and promise to elevate youth voices in decision-making processes that affect youth lives and opportunities. Currently, more than 60,000 young people in Massachusetts are disconnected from education, supportive adults, employment, and their community, with the locus of disconnection in the states cities among Latino youth and youth of color. Our Civic Engagement programs bond Latino youth to their communities, inviting them to participate in the power structures that influence their daily lives and empowering them to be lifelong community leaders. At Sociedad Latina, we work to combat the trend of disconnected youth by engaging youth in community initiatives that are led by youth and families.    Education: Sociedad Latinas Education programs address the unmet needs of Latino and English Language Learner (ELL) students in Boston Public Schools (BPS), many of whom face significant ethnic/racial barriers to advancing through middle school and high school and accessing postsecondary education. Latinos in BPS have the lowest four-year graduation rate and highest drop out rate across racial subgroups. As a result, fewer Latino youth enroll in postsecondary education or complete their college program. Our solution is a holistic pathway of three Education programs that provide the long-term support needed to keep students on-track for grade promotion, high school graduation, and postsecondary success. Our expansive College Access Network of 14 local colleges and universities support our Education programs by providing volunteers, tutors, curriculum support, campus tours, admissions counseling and more.  Arts & Culture: Sociedad Latina enriches the quality of life for Latino youth and families by providing them with opportunities to explore the arts and celebrate their cultures of origin. Arts programming provides youth with a rare opportunity to self express, articulate frustrations and fears, and dream of alternatives in a society that discounts youth input and leaves many young people of color at a disadvantage. Participation in arts activities build academic achievement, creativity, and fluency, while increasing self-efficacy and awareness. Highly creative youth have more consistent school attendance, higher academic achievement, and are more likely to give back to their community. Our arts and cultural programs accommodate various skill levels and interests, while fostering lifelong appreciation of and engagement in the arts. They are also rooted in the cultural traditions of our youth and celebrate the rich history of Latinos.    Workforce Development: Sociedad Latinas Workforce Development programs empower Latino youth to overcome cycles of poverty and experience success in the workforce. Currently, Latinos make up 13.7% of the U.S. workforce but are over-represented in low-earning and often hazardous industries, while being underrepresented in fulfilling, career-ladder jobs. Over the next decade,16 million Latino youth will enter the U.S. workforce. These youth will need to develop workforce and 21st century skills in order to succeed in their chosen career pathway. Building on nearly 20 years of success with our Jovenes Latinos Pro Salud program, our workforce development programs now provide Latino youth, ages 14-21, with the opportunity to prepare for five robust career pathways: healthcare, law & public service, business & entrepreneurship, arts & music, and STEM. These fields respond to the interests of our youth and offer a diverse array of career ladder employment possibilities in thriving fields.		4,000 youth and adults	Young Latinos and Mission Hill residents become leaders	Mission Hill/Roxbury and Greater Boston in Massachusetts

's mission is to bring our communities together to help improve people's lives and strengthen the neighborhoods in our region.	Increasing youth opportunities - research shows that youth who have access to quality afterschool programs and trusting relationships with adults have reduced problem behavior and increased self-confidence , self esteem and attitudes towards school, school grades, and achievment test scores. Our goals in this area are that youth will have consistent long-term, supportive relationships with nurturing adults so that they stay in school and graduate able to compete in the 21st century. Our vision is that they will have a safe place in the community to connect with peers and mentors, to explore, learn, and develop the relationships and skills they need to be successful throughout life and that adults will have the skills needed to develop effective relationships with youths that supports their positive development and learning. Here are some examples of how we are addressing the needs of young people in our region: 1. There's an achievement gap and disparities in the drop out rate in our region. We provide more than 25,000 youth with academic support, 91% stayed on track for graduation. 2. Low-income youth lack the skills needed to compete in the 21st century workforce. Uwmb collaborates with afterschool programs and the region's healthcare, life sciences and technology industries to help our youth succeed in the sciences and inspire the next generation of professionals. 3. Many youth do not have caring adults in their lives to support and guide them. Last year we matched over 7,600 youth with mentors.   healthy childhood development - decades of research affirm that very young children grow, learn, develop and thrive when exposed to close, dependable, nurturing relationships. The social and emotional skills and competencies learned within these relationships are the foundation for a child's success in kindergarten and throughout life. Long-term studies indicate that development in children's early years has a dramatic impact on school readiness, and that improving early learning helps prepare children for kindergarten and a lifetime of achievement. Our goals are to ensure that young children are better prepared to succeed in school because their social and emotional needs are met and that families have access to the information and resources they need to raise and nurture their young children. Here are some examples of how we are addressing the needs of young children and their families: too many children are entering school not ready to learn. Last year, our work resulted in more than 33,000 children enrolled in high quality early education and care programs that help them gain the skills they need for kindergarten. 13,000 children received early intervention services to ensure that young children are screened for developmental delays. 90% of those who received intervention showed improvement. Through our partnership with the city of boston we oversee thrive in 5, a 10-year plan to achieve universal school readiness for 39,000 young children. Thrive in 5 has collaborated with multiple partners and community-based organizations around school readiness efforts that have resulted in an increase in the percentage of young children entering kindergarten with strong early language and literacy skills, a key element of school readiness, from 54% in 2009 to 63% in 2013.   families - research has shown that financial stability is essential to improving the future for children and families. Financial stability comes from providing families the resources and opportunities they need to meet their basic needs, attain safe and affordable housing and secure jobs that pay family-sustaining wages. Uwmb has created an asset-building framework to move people who are low-income into the economic mainstream. Assets include both soft assets and hard assets - including language proficiency, education to attract a self-sufficient job, skills in a labor market with high demand jobs, a home and savings. However, without knowledge and skills in managing money, workers and families will face economic uncertainty and potential pitfalls. Families without access to coordinated income, work supports, or asset-building tools have a much harder time finding pathways out of poverty. Underlying all of this is the basic necessity of safe, affordable, permanent housing. A strong supply of affordable housing is critical, coupled with community resources to help those at-risk or experiencing homelessness to access that housing supply. Uwmb supports service delivery, capacity building and public policy to help families achieve economic self-sufficiency. In building a strong framework with the assets families need to thrive and gain economic security, uwmb helps families today and strengthens their capacity to succeed in the long-term. Here are some examples of how we are addressing the needs of families in our region: 1. Many families struggle to meet their basic needs. Last year uwmb helped 291,000 people with emergency assistance, including food, heat and housing. 2. Family homelessness is at an all-time high. Last year we prevented over 15,900 families from becoming homeless, and developed, preserved or managed over 7,900 units of affordable housing. 3. Many families lack the tools and resources to achieve financial stability. Uwmb helped 10,590 individuals to obtain, retain or advance employment. Uwmb also increased access to free tax filing services in seven communities and raised public awareness about the earned income tax credit (eitc) to help generate over $10. 2 million in refunds to 4,515 low-income, working families.

Since 1989, Pioneer Valley Habitat for Humanity has built decent, affordable homes with 37 low income families in Hampshire and Franklin Counties. We build our homes with volunteer labor and donations of material, supplies, land, and services. At the onset of homebuilding, a family is selected and enters into a long term partnership with Pioneer Valley Habitat. Future homeowners contribute 250 hours of labor during the construction of their home alongside volunteers from the community. Upon completion, the home is sold to the family with an affordable mortgage. Habitat is a hand-up, not a hand-out: the organization has a perpetual legacy in that all mortgage funds received are reinvested to build more homes.  We are a housing organization helping to bring stability to families, bringing more stability into our neighborhoods and communities. Beyond the homeowners partnering with Habitat, thousands of community donors and volunteers are impacted by and have participated in the work of our local Habitat. Our construction volunteers receive on-site training ranging from basic building skills to high performance construction techniques. Volunteers are the heart, soul and muscle behind Habitats work. As they walk away from the construction sites, volunteers tell us that their lives have been transformed by helping build a Habitat home.

Ibj has trained approximately 2,000 police officers in modern investigative techniques to discourage the use of torture to coerce confessions. Also, every december 4th, the anniversary of china's adoption of its constitution in 1982, ibj conducts an extensive campaign throughout the country to educate citizens about their legal rights in the case of arrest.   singapore- the singapore justice training centre continues to progress as the first regional hub of ibj. It conducted the legal aid systems training for myanmar and the concurrent regional legal aid forum for 17 senior government officials from the union attorney-general's office, supreme court of the union, myanmar police force and lawyers from the myanmar legal aid network. The sessions for skills training and capacity building proved to be a unique platform for meaningful engagement between government officials and young lawyers where open discussion and shared learning experience were realized. Their other achievement is it launch of 50 e-learning modules. The modules are specific to seven asean countries, namely cambodia, indonesia, laos, myanmar, the phillipines, thailand, and vietnam, as well as india. The topics covered by the modules include the rights of the accuses, the rights and obligations of defense attorneys, attorney-client relations, presumption of innocence, defenses, evidence, cross-examination, complaint procedures, pretrial detention, investigative torture, and preventing torture. With these modules, the sjtc is helping an ever-expanding group of lawyers from around the world increase its skills and knowledge through an accessible on-demand training platform.   cambodia - since 2001, ibj has been helping cambodia to rebuild its justice system by organizing training sessions, rights awareness campaigns, roundtable meetings and providing legal aid services. Through its offices located cambodia, ibj holds seminars and training sessions throughout the country to help train attorneys and inform citizens of their rights. Ibj's team works to ensure that cambodia recovers from the extensive genocide perpetrated by the khmer rouge during the 1970s and 1980s and becomes a place where every single citizen can pursue justice.   other program services - ibj has a program called justicemakers that conducts online competitions to support grassroots legal rights projects worldwide. In four competitions since 2008, ibj has selected 46 justicemakers fellows from over 26 countries.

Additionally, SWB engaged 1500 youth through outreach and one-day events.  SWBs mission of facilitating growth, inclusion and personal success for newcomer youth is made possible by the quantity of direct hours invested at our programs (average core participants spend 12-15 hours/week with SWB).

Each year, close to 80,000 refugees and 500,000 immigrants arrive in the US seeking peace and a chance for a better future. Newcomer youth are one of the most vulnerable populations in the seven US cities where SWB programs operate. Not only are these youth navigating a new culture and language, their often-traumatic backgrounds create significant barriers to traditional models of academic and social success. The difficulty of integration is compounded by many unfortunate social realities that exist in the communities where SWB programs operate. The combination of poverty, urban violence, and cultural isolation lead many newcomer to youth to feel hopeless, with a National school drop-out rate of more than 40%.  SWB International focuses on engaging populations that are traditionally excluded or marginalized, with a particular emphasis on engaging girls.

The children receive structured lessons and hands on education from 07h00 to 18h30.	Daktari meets regularly with teachers and the headmasters of our local schools.  Teachers have reported significant progress in their students who have visited Daktari Bush School and Wildlife Orphanage. The improvements that teachers have reported include:  	Increased concentration in the classroom. 	A greater motivation to learn and speak up in class. 	The children are much more polite and attentive in class. 	A significant increase in self-confidence and self-esteem. 	A higher pass rate at the end of the year for those who attended Daktari.  The survey is designed as an indictor of the children's progression throughout the week, and gives valuable information on the children's improvement. The questions asked range from general knowledge, such as 'what is a tourist and why do they benefit South Africa?' to ones concerning basic education. We have noted extensive improvement in all of the subjects tackled.    Another indication of the projects success was the creation of the Daktari Eco clubs developed by school children who have completed their week at Daktari. These children are so inspired by Daktaris environmental education programme that they want to share their knowledge and newfound passion with their friends and the local community.   There have also been noted cases where children from Daktari have stopped the creation of hunting parties, and called Nature Conservation when wild animals have been found in the area. On one occasion, this resolved in the rescue of a female cheetah and her cubs.  Since Daktari began they have worked with five schools in the Sekoro area, and hosted over a 2000 children.

Circle of Women	http://www.circleofwomen.org	(917) 207-5627	EIN 20-4576506	P.O Box 381365	Cambridge	MA	02238	USA	International, International Development	We mobilize students to provide access to education for girls without it.  We collaborate with communities eager to implement innovative, sustainable, and localized solutions to increase girls access to secondary schools. In doing so, we cultivate a new generation of global citizens by providing students at home with hands-on opportunities in organizational leadership, fundraising, and project management.  We also raise public awareness about the health, education, and interests,  so that our project becomes a global exchange of information and resources.	Provided funds to barli development institute for rural women, which educates rural, village and tribal women who have not had the opportunity to receive secondary education, to build classroom, computer room and dormitory space for 50 additional students.   provided funds to daraja academy, a free boarding secondary school for girls in east africa, to create additional dormitory housing for 5th year transition students and four secondary classes. Funds also provided for multi-use common room to be used for testing, seminars, study hall and speakers as well as for other social and recreational events.	In 2009, after 18 months of construction and fundraising about $180,000, Circle opened the doors to its first girls school. The two-story building has twelve classrooms that service the community as a gathering place after school hours. Local leaders registered the school with the Afghan Ministry of Education and designed the curriculum after state standards.  In 2010, after the major earthquake hit Pakistan and badly damaged the local secondary school for girls,  Circle of Women, in partnership with the Nathiagali Residence Committee, embarked on a large-scale re-building of the girls school involving the construction and installation of four new bathrooms and a septic tank, a computer lab, two drinking water tanks and a library.  Currently, Circle of Women is building a boarding house in Cumbum, India, to increase access to education for girls who would otherwise have to stay at home because of recent increases in reports of sexual assault, and the single-sex (male-only) policy of many local hostels.

Reel recovery provides a unique and innovative program of support and education to men in cancer survivorship. We conduct free 3-day fly-fishing retreats that blend outdoor activity with directed psychosocial support activities, to offer a relaxed, reflective environment for men to come together, share their stories and gain a network of support among people with common experiences. Fly-fishing and cancer. Why? To those of us with a passion for the sport and for the outdoors, the connection is easily understood: life's troubles drifting away as we focus on rod, fly and rising trout; the peace and serenity we receive from the healing connection with nature; the power of friendship as we stand with a fishing buddy and share the day's triumphs and failures. For people with cancer, a day or two on a stream brings relief from their suffering, and hope for their future. Reel recovery is dedicated to providing cancer patients with information, education and a network of support that will help them as they proceed through their cancer treatment and/or recovery. We are directly enhancing their ability to learn about and manage their disease. We provide participants an opportunity to gain new insights about living with cancer and about coping with the psychological, social and emotional aspects of having the disease. Our participants learn about treatment options, navigating the healthcare system, facing mortality, coping with stressful family and work related situations - in sum the whole gamut of experiences that life with cancer entails. By learning from others in similar situations, our participants can gain a fresh perspective about their disease and renewed hope about fighting and surviving it. Reel recovery has grown from our boot-strapped beginnings in 2003, to a thriving, successful non-profit, that has now offered a total of 182 retreats in 19 states, all completely free to the participants, serving well over 2,000 men. 25 retreats were conducted in 2014, serving approximately 300 men.

We serve as the community hospital for the children of boston; provide specialty pediatric care throughout the region; and offer access to innovative, life saving care to children across the world facing challenging medical issues. Bch's vision is to advance pediatric care - both in our local neighborhoods and worldwide - through a commitment to innovation and science-based care. All of our activities are driven by four interwoven missions: providing access to safe, high quality, compassionate and innovative clinical care to children, especially to those with complex medical conditions and rare diseases; researching new cures and treatments for diseases and methods of care delivery; training the next generation of pediatric caregivers; and improving the health and well being of children, with a special emphasis on helping the children of boston grow and learn in safe, healthy environments.	Clinical care: as one of the largest pediatric hospitals in the us and the only freestanding pediatric hospital in massachusetts, boston children's hospital(bch), provides access to safe, high quality health care services that meet the unique needs of our patients and their families, regardless of their ability to pay. The services we offerfrom well child visits and treatment for typical child health issues(broken bones, tonsillitis, etc. )to chronic care(asthma, diabetes, obesity, etc. )and specialty services(oncology, cardiology, neurology)benefit from our clinicians' high level of specialization, our collaboration with research scientists(many of whom are also physicians)affiliated with the hospital, and our significant investments in equipment, facilities and clinical and support staff. Our team has a deep commitment to setting the bar for quality and safety and exceeding the expectations of our patients and their families for service, undertaking significant investments in each of these areas. Annually, bch sees: 23,172 inpatients at our main campus; 849 bedded cases at our satellites and 551,660 combined outpatients at main campus and satellites; 29,594 patients in our community health clinic. Of these patients, more than 22. 8%(cmi > 2. 00)can be qualified as clinically complex. Of these patients, approximately 33%(patients on medicaid/medicare)are considered low income. Bch is the safety net institution for very sick children throughout the region, supporting the entire health care system for the most complex pediatric cases. We receive referrals from community hospitals as well as from other academic medical centers throughout new england. Bch is the single largest provider of care to children enrolled in the medicaid program, caring for approximately 30% of all pediatric medicaid patients statewide, including more than 90% of the sickest children in the state. Bch also provides clinical care for the largest number of uninsured children in the state; total free care and losses from medicaid in fy2014 were approximately $52. 5 million. Recognizing the difficulties that community-based hospitals face in providing specialized pediatric care(which requires significant investments in staff, equipment and training), bch has formed partnerships with 8 community hospitals throughout eastern massachusetts, including beverly hospital, winchester hospital and south shore hospital. With approximately 100 physicians serving those community hospitals, we enhance the community's-and the state's-ability to provide access to emergency, neonatal, inpatient and outpatient specialty services for children. Bch also operates satellite facilities in lexington, peabody and waltham where we offer specialized care in cardiology, gastroenterology, neurology, respiratory diseases, diabetes, orthopedic surgery, urology and other specialties. In addition, our physicians offer outpatient services at our physician office locations in brockton, milford, norwood, north dartmouth and weymouth. Each year, bch improves the quality of the clinical care it provides by recruiting talented staff, investing in cutting-edge equipment and technology, undertaking safety and quality initiatives, supporting community health programs and ensuring that our facilities make the care process easier and more comfortable for all the patients and families we serve. For example:focus on quality: in 2014, bch's program for patient safety and quality (ppsq) awarded 139 research grants, totaling more than $1. 5 million and launched a quality improvement science course, which taught quality improvement (qi) fundamentals that help staff to better implement qi projects across departments. Through the program, the hospital also supports 20 quality and safety registries where data from other pediatric hospitals are used to benchmark performance. Ppsq grant-funded research led to the development of new quality and safety measures for nursing, 10 of which are being tested through a national consortium. Ppsq also established a more rigorous maintenance of certification(moc)process to better assist physicians and physician leaders in maintaining their board certifications through the creation and execution of qi projects. In that same time, the hospital's center for patient safety and quality research(cpsqr)awarded $400,000 across 4 grants. A cpsqr-funded national registry of clavicle fractures in adolescents expanded from 3 sites to 5 sites nationwide. Surgical repairs are more common for clavicle fractures, but also more expensive and riskier. The registry will help determine whether surgical treatments are more effective, which is likely to drive safer and higher quality orthopedic care for children with clavicle injuries. Additionally, cpsqr supported a study on safe sleep practices for preterm infants in the neonatal intensive care unit(nicu). The study led to the development of safe sleep practices for infants that have been shown to reduce the risk of sleep-related morbidity and mortality. Approximately half of level iii nicus in massachusetts will adopt those practices. Cpsqr also launched a pilot scholars program for academic faculty, which provides research support for hospital faculty for up to 2 years. The highly targeted support is intended to accelerate the academic careers of leading patient safety and quality researchers and includes dedicated project management support, analytic support for large database projects, and faculty mentoring. In 2014, cpsqr selected 3 researchers from a competitive pool of 13 nominations. Encourage innovation: the innovation acceleration program(iap)at bch promotes innovation at a grassroots level by creating opportunities for hospital staff to develop solutions that effectively address real clinical pain points. The iap offers "innovestment" grants and fast track innovation in technology(fit)project awards, which are both open to all hospital staff. Instead of funding, fit project awards offer software development resources. The fit team rapidly creates "proof of concept" software that can be piloted inside bch. The software is refined and can then be adapted for the institution's use or distributed externally for other organizations. In 2014, the fit team streamlined this process by creating a platform that already complies with the hospital's it security framework, allowing the team to create software in less time. The iap's innovestment grants support early stage innovations with up to $15,000. More than 1/2 of recipients have gone on to attract external partners as a result of their grant, including mit lincoln labs and the wyss institute for biologically inspired engineering. The iap awarded 4 innovestment grants in 2014, one of which funded the creation of device that could cut healthcare spending nationwide by $2. 34 billion. About 41,000 patients contract central line infections every year. Up to a 1/4 die from them and survivors can require 2-3 extra weeks of inpatient care. This adds as much as $55,000 to a patient's hospital stay, explaining why the us spends $2. 34 billion treating central line infections. Central line infections start when the catheter's hub(the port where it enters the body)is exposed to bacteria. The academic literature concluded that 94 percent of hospitals do not meet existing guidelines from the centers for disease control(cdc), that call for clinicians to scrub a hub for 30 seconds before leaving it to dry for another 30. The typical icu cardiac patient needs 30-40 injections per day, adding up to 40 minutes of scrubbing and drying per day for each patient. Bch researchers used an innovestment grant to create a handheld device that easily cleans and dries central line hubs. Clinicians snap a hub onto the device, set a scrubbing time and press a button. The device scrubs faster and harder than a human can, eliminating the potential for human error. The iap also strengthens bch's culture of innovation by organizing events that connect hospital staff with resources they need to turn their ideas into a reality, including monthly innovators' forum events, where hospital innovators can share their work with their colleagues and staff from nearby institutions. The iap also organizes panel discussions that bring external experts together to discuss issues relevant to innovators including licensing, vendor contracts and intellectual property rights. Improve care in the community: the community asthma initiative(cai)has helped improve the health of more than 1,360 boston children with asthma. Cai provides case-management services, offers home visits, educates caregivers and providers, distributes asthma control supplies and connects families to local resources. The program has reduced the percentage of patients with any asthma-related hospitalizations by 80%, emergency department visits by 57%, missed schools days by 43% and missed work days for parents or caregivers by 52%.   research:boston children's is dedicated to enhancing the wellbeing of children and families by leading research and innovation around child health issues, and by seeking new approaches to the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of childhood and adult diseases. With over $300 million in annual funding and 800,000 square feet of space, boston children's is home to the world's largest and most active research enterprise at a pediatric center. Boston children's research mission encompasses basic research, clinical and translational research, community service programs and the postdoctoral training of new scientists. While the national institutes of health is our largest sponsor, boston children's has made a significant investment of more than $23 million towards supporting its research activities in 2014. Our investigators hold numerous prestigious honors and awards, including many "research firsts. " in our laboratories and clinics, hundreds of scientists seek to identify the factors that contribute to both childhood and adult diseases and to develop effective treatments for them. Our investigators are harvard medical school faculty - basic scientists, clinical researchers and epidemiologists - who are accelerating the pace of medical discovery from brainstorm to bench to bedside. Our researchers were the first to develop 10 new disease-based stem cell lines by reprogramming adult stem cells that can be used to study treatments for diseases ranging from parkinson's to diabetes. Clinicians and researchers at boston children's work with colleagues throughout the medical community to translate basic science research into applications for clinical care. These projects frequently have applications that go beyond pediatrics to impact adult care as well. For example:skin cream for peripheral neuropathy: peripheral neuropathy causes weakness, numbness and pain, usually in hands and feet, as a result of damage to peripheral nerves. One form, called small-fiber neuropathy, is especially difficult to treat and causes pain, tingling and loss of sensation, usually starting at the feet. The loss of sensation can increase the chances of ulcers and infections that may lead to amputation. Current treatment options rely on painkillers to reduce pain, but those medications don't address the underlying cause of neuropathy. Researchers at boston children's hospital developed a skin cream that may do just that. Small-fiber neuropathy is known to degenerate nerve endings of sensory neurons and diminish the body's supply of gndf, a group of factors that stimulate nerve growth. Because gdnf is a large molecule, it was thought that the only way to get it into the nervous system was through invasive methods such as injections into the spinal cord. The skin cream bypasses this barrier by delivering a small-molecule compound (called xib4035) known to enhance the gdnf's effects through the skin. 3d printing gives clinicians a rehearsal for complex procedures: boston children's hospital was one of the first hospitals in the country to develop a simulation program and last year it became one of the first to adapt 3d printing technology for clinical use. Boston children's hospital developed its own 3d printer, which it uses to produce replicas of patient anatomy with a resolution of between 16 and 32 microns per layer, meaning that each layer is about the width of a filament of cotton. The printer can print multiple resins or textures, allowing doctors to work on replicas that model different types of tissues such as brain matter and blood vessels. That technology is an especially useful tool for clinicians treating the complex, one-of-a-kind patients that are often referred to boston children's hospitals. Because, those cases are incredibly rare, the clinicians and surgeons treating those complex patients rarely have opportunities to practice the equally complex surgeries these patients require. 3d printing allows them to create replicas of their patients' anatomy and perform a "dress rehearsal" before anyone enters the operating room. One neurosurgeon at boston children's recently used several different 3d models to perform brain surgery on a 15-year-old patient with an abnormal cluster of veins above his optical nerve. Because of the delicate work involved, even the smallest mistake could have left the patient blind. The neurosurgeon used a see-through replica of the patient's skull on a light box in the operating room as a reference, enabling him to not only finish the operation successfully, but also complete the operation in less than half the usual time for a similar operation. 3d printing technology is also used to help parents understand their children's surgeries before the operation as well as to educate medical students and residents. Adapting behavioral drugs to return the brain to "critical periods": a team of boston children's hospital researchers has discovered that behavioral drugs can return the chemistry of the brain to what they describe as "critical periods" in its development. These periods typically occur during childhood when the brain is rapidly growing, and help explain why children younger than seven can learn new skills like language and music much faster than adults can. The ability to return the chemistry of the brain to that state has created new opportunities to treat conditions in older patients that would typically need to be treated at a much younger age. The research team was able to do just that with one 14-year-old patient suffering from amblyopia. The condition, commonly referred to as lazy eye, left her with extremely poor vision in one eye. Typically, the best chance for correcting amblyopia is before a child turns eight. Those who don't get treatment early enough, or for whom treatment does not work, usually end up living with their condition for the rest of their lives. The research team used donepezil, which is typically prescribed to treat alzheimer's disease, to return to a critical period, allowing her brain to properly learn how to process visual stimuli from the amblyopic eye and dramatically improving her vision.   teaching:over the course of the year, 149 residents, 267 clinical fellows, 545 research fellows and more than 900 rotating residents/fellows come to boston children's from around the world. More importantly, these men and women are selected for their potential leadership in their respective fields and their commitment to advancing the frontiers of pediatric care. In fact, a 24-year analysis of residents who have graduated from our department of medicine found that about 40% go on to become leaders in academic medicine, filling positions such as deans, chairs and program heads across the country. Over a third of the chiefs of pediatric departments across the country trained at boston children's. We train individuals throughout all areas of the care continuum, including medical students, interns, residents, fellows, nursing students and community pediatricians. We provide continuing professional education for all of our clinical staff.

The non-profit Conservancy maintains, programs, and improves the Greenway on behalf of the public and in partnership with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.	horticulture and maintenancesummary and accomplishments:the conservancy is the designated steward of the rose kennedy greenway, boston's mile-and-a-half of contemporary parks that connect people and the city with beauty and fun. In a public-private partnership with the commonwealth of massachusetts, the conservancy programs, maintains, and improves the parks. In fy14, the conservancy continued to make the greenway a joy-filled place for residents and visitors:- the greenway carousel at the tiffany & co. Foundation grove opened to the public on-time, on-budget, and with much fanfare. It has already become a new landmark in boston. - the horticulture continues to improve through our award-winning organic landscape care. We made upgrades and replacements across the greenway north end garden beds, installing plant signage, planting 27,000 additional bulbs. - we conducted/offered more than 300 free programs on the greenway. Due to the free events, our nationally-recognized mobile eats program, the carousel, and our free wi-fi network, we attracted over 800,000 visitors, plus millions more who casually enjoy greenway plazas, gardens, and paths. For these efforts, we won an arts & entertainment award from bostinno. - we expanded our public art efforts, announcing new initiatives and installing a new mural on the greenway wall at dewey square park through a partnership with the institute of contemporary art. - we completed a successful first year of contracted care for the armenian heritage park. - our maintenance team accomplished significant repairs to the light blades, harbor fog, chinatown fountain, and masonry, while continuing the daily responsibilities of maintaining a clean, functional park. Horticulturewe continue to improve the greenway's beauty through skilled, attentive maintenance and important, thoughtful improvements. The conservancy uses organic and sustainable landscape practices that are innovative, award-winning, and fiscally sound. The greenway is boston's only organically-maintained public park and one of a handful of organically-maintained urban parks in the united states; our sustainability efforts have earned us a mayor's greenovate award. Greenway plants are healthier, more resilient, and better able to withstand the stress of public use and the demands of an urban environment because of our management practices. The conservancy's policy of not using herbicides and toxins also ensures that run-off from the parks will not pollute boston harbor or harm the delicate marine life. Children and pets can freely and safely play on our park lawns without the worry of pesticides. A harvard kennedy school team partnered with us and determined that our daily organic care is less expensive than a non-organic approach. The cornerstone of our organic approach is our compost tea operation. We have increased applications of our organic compost tea from 1,800 gallons in 2010 to 13,000 gallons annually. The depth of the roots on the greenway has tripled since the conservancy took over park operations and introduced organic methods. The park is a national wildlife federation certified wildlife habitat. A walk down the greenway reveals lush green grass and thriving garden beds. Our sustainable horticulture practices include weed management, top seeding and aeration, organic debris composting for fertilizer applications, and efficient water usage. In addition, the greenway's dewey square park features pollinator, edible, demonstration, and rain gardens. 59 planter containers throughout the park are changed seasonally with arrangements consistent with their park surroundings. An important project this year was the spring replanting in the north end park along the pergola between hanover and north st. We installed new plants, including evergreens and roses. Plants were selected to screen against the traffic on the adjoining surface streets, to provide four season interest, and for urban-hardiness. Daffodils and other flowering bulbs were replanted back into the garden bed, and other removed plants were transplanted elsewhere in the park. This project was based on input from community meetings held over the last several years. We made upgrades along the length of the greenway. In chinatown, we significantly filled in garden beds throughout the park. In the fort point channel parks, we added evergreens for winter interest and structure, a new garden bed to anchor a park entrance, and installed plant signage. In the wharf district parks, in conjunction with the new plantings around the greenway carousel, we filled in plantings along the promenade. Throughout the greenway, 21 failing street trees were replaced and an additional 27,000 bulbs were added. We have placed an increased emphasis on our volunteer program. Strategically, we have made hands-on learning through volunteering a focus for our educational efforts. Bringing people to dig in the soil shoulder-to-shoulder with our horticultural staff is a terrific way to tell the story of our organic care of this roof-top garden. Following another big increase in volunteer hours (up from 2,183 in 2012 to 3,118 in 2013), we hired our first full-time volunteer coordinator who has increased and diversified the opportunities and partnerships for the 2014 season. Already we have created a new collaboration with the united way for the care of the dewey square park gardens. On the strength of reviews from volunteers, the conservancy has consistently won the top rated award from greatnonprofits. Org. Maintenancein fy14 the maintenance department responded to the daily and seasonal demands of running a clean, green, and safe park. Our team cares for seven water features, acres of granite paving, complex lighting systems, and more. The conservancy's maintenance staff handles repairs, fountain maintenance, and other skilled tasks; our efforts are supplemented by our contracted non-profit partner, work inc. , which employs individuals with disabilities. Work inc. Handles basic park care-including lawn mowing, litter and trash removal, and snow removal-and helps provide an in-park presence 16 hours per day, 365 days per year. In addition, this was the first year of a three-year, competitively-awarded contract to maintain the beautiful fountains, labyrinth, and gardens in armenian heritage park. Regular work includes fountain care, welding repairs, re-lamping, vehicle maintenance, and more. We added a mason to our staff who reset loose pavers, repaired handicapped ramps, restored failed mortar joints and re-caulked several failed expansion joints throughout the greenway. Seasonally, the maintenance team sets out and removes moveable furniture; starts-up and then decommissions and winterizes the seven water features; installs and removes winter lighting; and supervises acres of snow removal. This year we accomplished numerous maintenance projects. Our team upgraded the failing light blade components, including the design, fabrication, and installation of a new mounting system. We restored the harbor fog water feature to fully operational, addressing problematic lights, speakers and controller. Following water intrusion into the chinatown fountain vault, we made necessary repairs to minimize fountain downtime and restore 100% operation; as part of this work we corrected a flaw in the original design and installation of the sump pump piping. We removed and reset 27 pieces of granite wall cap at one of the north end fountains; we discovered that the original park construction had failed to seal joints and sealed these to prevent future heaving. We painted no-biking signs on the pavement on all parcels. We re-graded, raked out and compacted the stone dust paths. The trash cans' rusting leveling feet were replaced. We removed the rust stains from the stone slabs in several fountains. To support the new "little free library" program, we installed footings, including welding, painting, and pouring concrete footings.   see attached schedule o - public activities - programs and artpublic activities - programs and art:the conservancy has brought vibrancy to the greenway. In addition to the millions of visitors who passively enjoy our fountains and gardens, the patronage at park offerings-events, wi-fi, carousel, and mobile eats-increased 23% to 801,000 in 2013, on top of a 66% increase in 2012. The greenway hosted more than 300 free events. Tourists, workers, and residents meet and play on the greenway, moving through the gardens from the fountains to the food trucks to the nearby attractions. This year, bostinno named the greenway one of its winners for arts & entertainment. We launched new programs and continued favorites. We introduced the boston calling block parties, held weekly at dewey square park with outdoor music and drinks. We hosted 7 pianos as part of the celebrity series' play me i'm yours, and solar-powered phone-charging benches through a partnership with the mit media lab. The twice weekly seasonal farmers market at dewey square park continued, and a new twice-weekly seasonal market was added across from the north end parks. We collaborated with organizations such as the boston public market association, national center for race amity, chinatown main streets, and sustainable business network. Many people flocked to the popular greenway open market, berklee college of music concert series, and race amity day. And we hosted scores of free fitness classes from yoga to crossfit. These efforts were complimented by the nationally acclaimed greenway mobile eats program and one of massachusetts' largest free wi-fi networks. The greenway conservancy has become a leader in contemporary public art in boston. Public art on the greenway gives residents, workers, and tourists a reason to visit, linger, and discuss. In fy14, funded entirely with private donations, we installed the second mural on the greenway wall at dewey square park. The mural, remanence: salt and light (part ii) by matthew ritchie, was featured on the front page of the boston globe. It continued the partnership with the institute of contemporary art that was begun with the award-winning mural "the giant of boston" by brazilian twins os gemeos. The conservancy announced a partnership with the museum of fine arts for the third iteration of the mural, to be installed in fall 2014. The conservancy also announced plans to hire a full-time public art curator and to bring in 2015 a dramatic aerial sculpture from renowned local artist janet echelman. We continued our partnerships with flash forward photography festival and the figment participatory art festival for programming on the greenway. The greenway gala is the conservancy's annual fundraising event. In fy14, the gala was hosted on the greenway for the second time, welcoming guests into a spectacular tent with decorations put together by the conservancy's horticulture team. The night was a glowing success - attended by 450 representatives from the business community, nonprofit community groups, corporations, foundations and individuals. The gala provides the conservancy an opportunity to say thank you to our supporters and provides a platform for sharing our current and future initiatives.   see attached schedule o - planning and designplanning and design: on labor day weekend 2013, after three years of planning, design, fabrication and installation, the greenway carousel, at the tiffany & co. Foundation grove, opened to the public on-time, on-budget, and with much fanfare. Private donations covered 95% of the total project costs, with public support through a competitively-awarded grant. The one-of-a-kind, artist-crafted carousel features native creatures that seem to prance, swoosh and splash as they rotate around in their fanciful poses to the delight of children and adults. The greenway carousel features 14 different characters native to the land, sea and sky of massachusetts including a sea turtle, rabbit, lobster, cod, peregrine falcon, and skunk. The characters were inspired by the drawings of boston school children; classroom presentations and site visits kept the elementary school children updated on the progress of the carousel they helped design. The drawings were brought to life by the character sculptures of newburyport artist jeff briggs. The location of the carousel, across from faneuil hall, the armenian heritage park, and the aquarium, with the national park service harbor islands kiosk in the middle, creates a natural gathering spot. The carousel is close to the north end and wharf district neighborhoods, offering a new attraction to those who live or visit boston. The carousel provides connection to and between city neighbors, as well as strong partnerships with other boston attractions. The tables, chairs, umbrellas, and the gardens in the tiffany & co. Foundation grove that surround the greenway carousel create a beautiful, welcoming environment with four season plantings, comfortable seating and filtered shade. The carousel offers an inviting space for relaxation, and creates a place where people of all ages and backgrounds want to visit. The greenway carousel uses universal design principles to create access for people of all abilities. With the guidance of the institute for human centered design, the carousel was designed to subtly and effectively offer all riders delightful experiences. It is new england's most accessible carousel for adults and youth with physical or auditory disabilities, and in the first hour of opening alone, the wheelchair ramp was utilized seven times. Ridership has exceeded expectations and financial projections. The carousel, open seasonally, drew 51,902 riders in fall 2013 and 39,300 riders through the middle of 2014. Children who visit the aquarium and view a sea turtle, make a deeper connection when they ride on the carousel's sea turtle. Wedding, bachelor and bachelorette parties stop for photos on the carousel as well. The carousel is a significant net contributor to the conservancy's operations, helping support the 300 free annual programs on the greenway.   green & grow - youth workforce developmentfor four years, the conservancy carried out its educational efforts principally through the green & grow workforce development program. The program provided a pipeline to future studies/training or environmentally focused jobs. It combined job readiness training with career exploration, environmental education, academic support, team building, personal attention from mentors and attractive compensation. In the first two months of fiscal year 14, the conservancy continued to offer the green & grow internship program in which the participants gained on-the-job experience alongside our staff. After graduating the summer green & grow intern class in august 2013, the conservancy ceased its green & grow program. Based on the conservancy's revised approach to educational efforts, the remainder of fy14 was focused on expansion of the volunteer program as described in our summary of horticulture accomplishments.			connect people and the city with beauty and fun in a mile-and-a-half of contemporary and organically maintained parks	Boston

Cambridge Credit Counseling Corp	http://www.cambridgecredit.org	(413) 821-8900	EIN 04-3337726	67 Hunt St Ste 305	Agawam	MA	01001	USA	Financial Counseling, Human Services	The organization specializes in providing education and counseling services to individuals and groups who are concerned about their financial situation. If appropriate, the organization also helps individuals establish affordable and convenient debt management plans to help them repay their debts in a timely manner. As a hud-approved housing counseling agency, the organization also provides pre- and post-purchase counseling, rental and reverse mortgage counseling, and foreclosure intervention and default counseling.	Individualized educational financial counseling cambridges tax-exempt status is based on the provision of financial education to the public. The organizations primary method of fulfilling this exempt purpose was accomplished through the provision of 27,574 individual educational financial counseling sessions. Cambridge provides financial counseling, education and debt management programs to individuals in 47 states. Every individual who requests assistance from the organization is given the opportunity to participate in a comprehensive evaluation of his or her financial circumstances, conducted by one of the organizations thirty-two independently certified credit counselors. Cambridges counselors are certified by the association for financial counseling and planning education, or by the partnership for financial education. Both organizations certification programs have been reviewed and approved by the association of independent consumer credit counseling agencies, by the association of credit counseling professionals, and by those states that require approval of counselor certification programs. Cambridges financial analysis is aimed at identifying the best course of action for each individual, and it allows the cambridge counselor to provide education and budgeting information appropriate to each persons circumstances. This assessment, which is performed at no cost and without obligation, is based on statutory requirements for identifying an individuals current financial condition, and, when necessary, appropriate techniques are used to discover the factors and behaviors that may be contributing to the individuals circumstances. To help ensure that all debts are discussed and to verify the accuracy of the account information provided, cambridge has established an arrangement with trans union that allows cambridge counselors to review each individuals credit report at no cost to the individual. On the basis of the information developed during the counseling session and through documentation of income and expenses, an appropriate action plan will be created and provided to the assessed individual. If a financial assessment indicates that the consumer would not reasonably be able to alleviate his or her debt without significant creditor concessions, cambridge will offer the option of enrolling in its educational debt management plan (dmp) program to help the individual establish an affordable and convenient plan to repay his or her current debts in a timely manner. If, on the other hand, creditor concessions are unlikely or unnecessary under the assessed individuals circumstances, the counselor will advise the individual of any other appropriate steps that he or she may take to address his or her financial condition. Regardless of the individuals enrollment, however, all consumers are encouraged to participate in post-counseling sessions with cambridge counselors, and are also provided with the most current editions of cambridges free financial management guides and dvd, which the public may also access on cambridges websites, www. Cambridgecredit. Org and www. Goodpayer. Com. In 2014, cambridge provided 27,574 individual counseling sessions. Of the roughly 20,187 individuals who contacted the agency for the first time in 2014, 4,025 (approximately 19. 9%) enrolled in cambridges debt management program (dmp). For these individuals, dmp enrollment is only one aspect of cambridges educational counseling program. As the consumer federation of america, american express, and the georgetown university credit research center noted in a joint 2006 report entitled evaluating the effects of credit counseling,(the cfa report) effective debt management plans must contain a meaningful educational component. The effect of this education was evidenced by significantly improved credit profiles and a reduced risk of bankruptcy filing, which the report attributed to the dmp experience itself, e. G. , budgeting to make regular dmp payments, continued interaction with and reinforcement from the counseling agency. Cambridges policy of providing extensive post- counseling follow-up sessions to all consumers who receive a financial assessment and budget review is consistent with the conclusions of the cfa report: participation in a debt management plan provides an educational benefit for the individual, particularly when contact with the counselor is extended throughout the period of enrollment. Furthermore, the data presented in cambridges transparency reports supports this approach. Clients who actively participate in post-counseling sessions are more likely to adopt healthier budgeting practices and to begin saving money. Although a dmp can be instrumental in helping individuals become debt-free in a five-year timeframe, enrollment alone does not prevent individuals from reverting to previous behaviors, attitudes and spending patterns that resulted in the need to contact a counseling agency. For this reason, cambridges counselors provide three post-counseling sessions within an individuals first 90 days of enrollment, and then again every six months thereafter to offer additional counseling. The first three post-counseling sessions are designed to help build a productive and trusting relationship with the client, and to help them recognize that cambridge intends to extend its educational efforts beyond the initial counseling period. Counseling sessions are held with each new client after the third, seventh, and eleventh week of enrollment to determine whether or not the individual has begun to follow his or her action plan, to offer encouragement and advice to help them take the steps that have been recommended, and to offer additional counseling for any issues that may not have been introduced previously. After these initial post-counseling sessions, each participant will receive a financial checkup from his or her counselor every six months for the duration of their enrollment in the program. In addition to addressing the participants particular issues, these follow-up calls continue building the participants financial skills by emphasizing the need to create and follow working budgets, to record all expenses, to implement appropriate savings plans, and to develop realistic short- and long-term financial goals. In addition, within 45 days of the initial request for assistance, cambridge counselors also contact each individual whose financial assessment indicates that dmp enrollment would either not be necessary or for whom creditors would be unlikely to grant meaningful concessions. This is done to verify that the individual has received all of the free educational materials provided by cambridge and, more important, that the individual has begun to utilize the tools and advice that his or her counselor provided in the individuals action plan. The consumer is encouraged to access the companys educational websites and to continue to use his or her counselor as a financial education resource, at no cost or obligation. The impact of cambridges post-counseling program has been significant. Cambridges most recent statistics indicate that more than 87. 6% of new program participants have begun to track expenses and develop new budgets by their fourth month of enrollment, taking the first steps toward re-establishing a positive payment history. This often represents a remarkable accomplishment for these individuals, whose credit reports show evidence that their record of inconsistent payments resulted in the higher interest rates and late fees that compounded their financial difficulties. Perhaps even more indicative of the results of cambridges post-counseling program are the survey responses gathered through iota solutions, a third party, which indicate that 89. 1% of long-term program participants continue to track their expenses, while 75. 4% review their budgets every six months. In 2014, cambridges counselors conducted 1,532 one-on-one post-counseling sessions for individuals already enrolled in the cambridge dmp program. While these services are very beneficial to individuals who decide to enroll in the program, cambridge has also developed educational tools and programs for individuals who do not enroll in the cambridge dmp program. In 2014, cambridge provided sessions for 16,162 individuals who did not enroll in the cambridge dmp program. These individuals were among the 74,160 individuals who received copies of free educational materials from cambridge, including: guidebooks, dvds, relevant articles about personal finance, and links to the agency's educational videos.   financial literacy education cambridge offers no-cost financial management education to individuals in a number of different ways. Cambridge provides outreach programs to members of its local community, including a number of non-profit social service agencies. Cambridge also offers financial management seminars and lesson plans to colleges and high schools, both locally and nationally. In addition, cambridge provides a number of free online resources, including financial calculators, videos, guidebooks, informational articles, and budgeting tools. Finally, and perhaps most important, cambridge provides comprehensive one-on-one financial assessments and counseling to any individual interested in improving his or her understanding of sound credit and debt management principles. The results of cambridges financial assessments indicate that 15-20% of participants would be incapable of alleviating their own debt in less than five years without significant creditor concessions. Cambridge believes that, of the remaining 80-85% of individuals who have problems with money management and debt, the majority lack a basic understanding of the fundamentals of personal finance, a subject that, unfortunately, is rarely taught in americas classrooms. In fact, while 19 states require high school students to take a course in personal finance, only 6 mandate testing on the topic prior to graduation. While young adults have been targeted by credit card issuers, few have the proper education, resources or tools to make informed decisions and establish responsible credit practices. It should come as little surprise then that many young adults need some form of financial assistance five, ten or twenty years down the road. Studies by the gao and the boston bar associations task force on financial literacy each confirm that young people in the post-college years are filing for bankruptcy at an alarming rate, the result of receiving too much credit, too soon, and with too little guidance on how to use it. Cambridge is committed to changing this trend, and to improving the lives of americans by providing the education they need. In its local community, cambridge provides free financial literacy education and counseling to veterans receiving services through hud's vash program, to inmates and former prisoners through programs delivered through the hampden county sheriff's department, and to senior citizens receiving assistance from greater springfield senior services. Cambridges education department staff continues to provide educational materials and classroom speakers for the westover job corps, the largest vocational training program for young people in massachusetts. Cambridge also conducts seminars for several local colleges, including one program specifically designed for low-income, first-generation college students at springfield technical community college. In 2014, the cambridge education department presented 474 free financial seminars to 4,626 participants throughout massachusetts and connecticut. Cambridge also expanded the number and variety of free educational content that the agency places on the internet. In 2014, cambridge added 14 new educational videos to the 239 videos already available online at www. Youtube. Com/cambridgecredit. Cambridges 253 videos were viewed a total of 29,712 times in 2014.   housing counseling - in 2010, after a comprehensive application and on-site examination process, cambridge became a hud-approved housing counseling agency. Nearly half of cambridge's counselors now hold one or more neighborworks certifications in foreclosure prevention counseling, pre- and post-purchase counseling, rental, and reverse mortgage counseling. The vast majority of these services are provided for free to the public. (cambridge's reverse mortgage counseling fee of $125 is in keeping with hud guidelines but can be waived, and participants in cambridge's eight-hour pre-purchase class pay a nominal fee of $50 for materials. ) cambridge's reverse mortgage counseling program has also been approved by the massachusetts executive office of elder affairs. In 2014, cambridge provided 560 free one-on-one foreclosure prevention counseling sessions. 252 prospective homebuyers attended cambridges pre-purchase classes. Seven participants subsequently received free educational financial counseling from the agency. During the year, cambridge also conducted 4,851 reverse mortgage counseling sessions, 1,101 of which were provided free of charge. Bankruptcy counseling - in the fall of 2011, following another round of applications and examination, cambridge received approval from the executive office for united states trustees to provide credit counseling and debtor education services to financially troubled consumers who are considering bankruptcy or who are awaiting the discharge of their debt. In 2014, cambridge conducted pre-filing credit counseling sessions for 240 individuals and provided pre-discharge debtor education courses to 178 individuals.

Alongside internet users everywhere we beat back attempts to limit our basic rights and freedoms, and empower people to demand technology (and policy) that serves their interests. Activating the internet for the public good can only lead to a more vibrant and awesome world.	Our Internet Blackout of 2012 was the largest and most visible online protest in history. The copyright industry had spent a record $92 million to try to pass laws that they could use to shut down any website. These laws  the Houses Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the Senates Protect-IP Act (PIPA)  faced minimal public resistance and their passage was seen as inevitable.  But by organizing more than 115,000 websites to fully or partially blackout out their own sites in protest, more than 24 million individuals applied pressure on Congress and we defeated both bills. This protest marked the dawn of public Internet activism.      Our Battle for the Net was the driving force behind the landmark Title II net neutrality win. FFTF can take failing fights and figure out the best legislative and organizing strategies and the most compelling communications framework to change their course. In the net neutrality fight, we occupied the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and organized the Internet Slowdown, which prompted more people to contact the FCC about net neutrality than had ever contacted the agency for any other topic. Massive public support got the President to take a firm stand and FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler fell into line, reversing his initial stance ultimately opting to reclassify broadband, granting the agency the authority to protect net neutrality.  Were stopping spying and censorship. On June 5, 2014 we launched Reset the Net, and together with websites like Tumblr, Wikipedia, and Wordpress, turned on new encryption technologies that blocked mass surveillance. Weve also been working with groups in China and Turkey to build a network that is resistant to censorship and can circumvent blocked websites.	Fight for the Future is known for its powerful and massive viral organizing campaigns that have changed Internet history both nationally and globally. Under a campaign to stop SOPA and PIPA  the largest and most visible online protest in history  hundreds of thousands of websites, including sites like Google, Craigslist and Wikipedia, joined the protest by going dark or prominently displaying info on the bills. Ultimately, 24 million people took action against bad tech policy, and both bills were shelved.  Our SOPA strike inspired street protests across Europe against the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA)  another attack on digital rights  and led to ACTAs historic defeat. In 2012, we also helped to stall out the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (CISPA) written ostensibly to prevent threats to cybersecurity, but written so broadly that it could easily be used for government spying and censorship. For the last election, we created a slate of voter registration and get-out-the-vote apps which gave the grassroots access to the tools that typically only large presidential campaigns can afford, diluting the power and influence of SuperPACs. And last November, public outcry from our campaign contributed to the rejection of a treaty that would have moved Internet governance to a top-down United Nations agency that operates behind closed doors and under corporate influence.	Since our founding in 2011, we have launched campaigns that have spurred millions to take action and help keep the Internet open. Weve partnered with some of the most powerful players like Google, Amazon, Mozilla, Wikipedia, reddit, Tumblr, and Craigslist and earn regular press coverage in major news outlets like New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, CNN and NPR.

See schedule o:jumpstart offers a unique, results-driven and research-based program to enhance the educational opportunities for preschool children in low-income neighborhoods. The jumpstart curriculum is carefully designed to provide strategies for our corps members to maximize the time they spend with children, and targets specific language and literacy skills that are most important to a child's future academic success. School success: jumpstart sessions take place two days per week, for two hours each time. Corps members and children read core storybooks and participate in targeted and intentional activities based on these stories. Each session revolves around a core storybook and one book serves as the focus for two sessions. Session plans are organized in six unit themes: family, friends, wind and water, the world of color, shadows and reflections, and things that grow and use the following routine:welcome: children transition to jumpstart from their previous activity. Children build alphabet knowledge through exploration of name cards and over time develop an understanding of meaning and use of print. Reading: children and corps members engage in a shared reading experience. Corps members use a variety of strategies to engage children in the story, highlight key vocabulary, and check for comprehension of the text. Circle time: children participate by singing songs, playing word and letter games, and reading poems. The whole-group learning experience builds a sense of community among children and adults. Center time: centers are set up with materials and activities that support childrens language and literacy skill development. Activities are inspired by the unit theme and core storybook, deepening childrens understanding of the book and providing opportunities to use story vocabulary. Let's find out about it: a small group activity designed to build children's concept knowledge and vocabulary. Here, children have the opportunity to explore new ideas and information, learn about objects and their use, and understand how things work. Sharing & goodbye: children talk and listen to others share their favorite session activities in a large group setting. Corps members use objects or examples of children's work from center time and rich vocabulary to support the conversation. Future teachers: jumpstart develops future teachers and leaders by increasing corps members' early childhood knowledge and community awareness. Corps members receive 30 hours of training before entering the classroom and up to 60 hours during their year of service. During this training, corps members participate in hands-on activities that deepen their understanding of developmentally appropriate practice, children's language and literacy development, active learning, classroom management, and family involvement. Corps members learn how to deliver jumpstart's curriculum during trainings that focus on jumpstart's target domains and skills, implementing the jumpstart routine, and understanding and using jumpstart's reading strategies. In addition, corps members continue building and strengthening their skills to implement jumpstart sessions through application and practical learning during in-service trainings held throughout the year. Family involvement: jumpstart recognizes that families are children's first and most important teachers. We seek to engage families as partners in supporting their children's school success and provide opportunities to extend learning into the home whenever possible. Corps members form relationships that build trust with families through ongoing, consistent communication. This communication happens face to face when corps members meet family members at early childhood centers, as well as through formal, written communication at least once per month. Jumpstart also strives to build connections between the jumpstart session and children's learning at home. Jumpstart provides the family involvement calendar and take-home activities included in family newsletters to support this connection.				United States

Community strategies - massachusetts (csma), a division of community resources for justice, provides comprehensive community based residential, vocational and clinical services in a highly supervised therapeutic environment to dually diagnosed individuals with behavioral challenges. Since its inception in 1993, the program has evolved into a specialized service provider with unique expertise in serving individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities and psychiatric disorders, as well as those with past involvement in the criminal justice system. With an emphasis on positive behavior supports, the goal of csma is to provide these individuals with the opportunity to live happily and comfortably within the community while maintaining a safe, high quality and cost effective program. Csma operates thirty homes and 21 shared living arrangements in 24 communities. Presently, the program's primary funding source is the massachusetts department of developmental services. Funding is also provided by the department of mental health, the massachusetts rehabilitation commission, department of children and families and out-of-state agencies.

We are successful when individuals learn necessary social and life skills, have greater opportunities for inclusion in the community, secure meaningful employment and require less external structure. We provide a continuum of supports - ranging from group programs with 24/7 supervision, through shared living with a provider, to case management where the individual lives alone with minimal services. We have been successful in supporting individuals move into situations requiring less support. In the last two years, we have placed a dozen individual from programs into shared living situations, and have supported three other clients who require case management or only intermittent supervision. In the last two years, we have seen a marked increase in the number of individuals who have gotten or maintained jobs and/or who have required less job coaching to be successful. Our individuals increasingly attend community college, formally study for their ged, take vocational classes, and attend religious study classes. Many more of our individuals have developed quality personal relationships with members of the community. This increased community involvement has been accompanied by a high level of demonstrated proactive social skills, community awareness, and safe behavior.   social justice services (sjs) consists of adult correctional programs and a residential youth program.

Our goal is to assist our clients to reenter their communities as productive and contributing citizens. Based on a comprehensive assessment, our programs provide assistance with transitional issues including employment, housing, addictions, family support, counseling and treatment. Working with over 1,000 residents per year, crj's adult programs offer a balance of accountability and service options. The intent is to enable these men and women to break out of the cycle of gangs, crime, and incarceration, and create a new cycle of personal responsibility and positive community engagement. Crj's residential youth program works with youth aging out of the supervision of the department of children and families. These are 18 to 22 year old young men who exhibit challenging behaviors due to trauma-based diagnoses, cognitive disabilities, and/or intellectual challenges. They may be eligible for dmh or dds services, but not until they turn 22 years of age. Our program appreciates all of our residents' unique qualities, strengths, and abilities. By building on those resident centered abilities, they will gain the potential to live healthy and productive lives, and achieve their full potential.

The conference program included nationally recognized leaders in the field and great examples of best practices together with networking opportunities. More details can be found at the conference podcast page at http://www.homeinc.org/2009podcasts.htm  Over the past year, HOME, Inc. conducted a pilot study based on a sample of 18 of our students tracked over three years. We measured student success in media literacy/media creation in correlation with other high school subject areas. Our study suggests our program has a profound impact on the academic performance of those students who are involved. The GPAs (Grade Point Averages) of those involved in the program have increased by nearly one whole grade level during the course of the first year. Students involved in the program, also received grades in the language section of the MCAS that were 25% better than their peers, overall. In addition there was a 5% increase in MCAS scores among those who were in the program for two years as opposed to those who completed the first year. Most promising, and perhaps the main reason for these increases, is improved school attendance. Students involved in the program showed an increase in attendance of 20% between the previous year and the end of the first year of the program. Based on this small, pilot study we have reason to expect students to improve in statistically significant ways .

And without treatment plans in place, 2 our of 3 women exiting prisons will reoffend within 3 years of their releae. With extensive budget custs to correctinal programs, community treatment options for woemn ex-offenders are more important than ever.

We fulfill this mission by funding early intervention programs for children with hearing loss and their families, such as the Minute Man Arc Early Intervention Program for Children with Hearing Loss in Concord.  Decibels also helps to educate educators by offering workshops and training sessions for professionals who are working with children using hearing aids and cochlear implants in regular education settings.	Donate proceeds from charitable events serving deaf children	This year alone, our donors helped us do some incredible things. We've continued the support of weekly playgroups, speech therapy and parent support groups, while expanding to include a Baby Group. We hosted a successful full-day workshop, attended by 140 professionals on 'Meeting the Needs of Young Children with Hearing Loss.' We also gifted $27,500 to various programs at Children's Hospital Boston, including the Sound Start Hearing Aid Loan Bank and the Cochlear Implant Spare Parts Bank.  None of this would be possible without our valued supporters. Your impact over the past ten years has resulted in the following incredible achievements:  - The cornerstone of the Decibels Foundation's work is the Minute Man Arc Early Intervention Program for Children with Hearing Loss. We understand that children with hearing loss need specialized services during the crucial early years of development. 64 children and their families have benefited from this program since its inception.   - As more than 80 percent of children who are or were hearing impaired now attend their local schools, part of our mission is to ensure these educators understand what it takes to teach a child with hearing loss. Since 2008, our Education Specialist, Dr. Honore Weiner has provided 785 consultative hours to local school districts for 44 school-age kids with hearing loss.     - Children with hearing loss need the support of knowledgeable professionals. Since 2007, the Decibels Foundation has hosted five full-day workshops covering four different hearing loss related topics. Over 450 teachers, speech therapists, and professionals working with children with hearing loss have attended and rated the workshops an average score of 1.4 out of 5 (1 being the highest).  - In an effort to encourage the best and brightest to pursue careers helping children with hearing loss, the Decibels Foundation has awarded $30,000 to our Decibels Scholars. To date, five top students in the Graduate Program of the Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders at Emerson College have received this honor.

Notre Dame Cristo Rey High School	http://www.ndcrhs.org		EIN 86-1096572	303 Haverhill Street	Lawrence	MA	01840	USA	Education, Job Training, Secondary & High Schools	Established in 2004, Notre Dame Cristo Rey High School, Inc. (NDCRHS) is a nonprofit organization serving economically challenged youth in grades 9-12.  Located in Lawrence, Massachusetts, our mission is to provide a family-centered secondary education in the tradition of the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur that equips these youth with the knowledge and training needed to pursue a college education and quality employment.  NDCR replicates a national work-study model first introduced by the Cristo Rey Network of schools in Chicago. Through this model students participate in a full-time work-study program where local corporations sponsor their employment helping them to both gain real-world job experience as well as earn a portion of their annual tuition. In addition, this educational model focuses on capping enrollment at 300-400 students allowing for a personalized learning environment which has proven critical to helping inner-city youth receive the attention and support they need to succeed in high school and prepare for college. Recent statistics cite that over a 40 year work life, an individual with a bachelor's degree will earn approximately $1.1 million more than a high school dropout. In the city of Lawrence, only 5.8 percent of residents aged 25 years and over have obtained a bachelor's degree and 20 percent of the population has less than a 9th grade education. The highest percentage of dropouts in our community continues to be Latino youth.  In 2007, 69 percent of incoming 9th graders to NDHS reported that they would be the first in their family to attend college.  NDHS exists to help students and their families break the cycle of poverty by providing them with a college preparatory secondary education coupled with high quality job training and support.

TransCultural Exchange addresses this need. Through collaborations with renowned artists, schools and cultural institutions around the world, the award winning organization has produced dozens of high profile, public art works. These works serve as dynamic testaments of global cooperation. Additionally by placing these installations directly within the public sphere, they become an integral part of the fabric of everyday life, at no cost to their viewers. Further these public art works serve as viable and non-threatening means for bringing people together. The works? international components, the organization?s artist exchanges and interactive workshops also help to promote cross-cultural sensitivity at a time when this need is becoming more and more pressing.Every year both K-12 and university students throughout the world take part in the organization's virtual (local, national and international) pen pal and artistic exchanges.  These activities foster understanding and respect of others' differences, helping to turn strangers into neighbors. According to UNESCO's Assistant Director-General for Culture, "Culture in this sense is not only an instrument of peace and conciliation but also a powerful factor of development, and perhaps, even a key to a shared planetary future." (www.unesco.org/culture) Art is one of the few media that can cross political, economic and social divides and is the basis for much of our increasingly visual mode of communication. TransCultural Exchange?s educational programs help teach visual literacy, the understanding of how images can communicate complex ideas. This skill arguably is as important as the ability to read.  Both are necessary tools in today's global market.
