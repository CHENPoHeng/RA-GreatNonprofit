Those who obtain their ged while in prison are likely to return and are better able to find employment upon release from prison. As of september 2014, rofw volunteers have individually mentored 57 offenders. Of the 57 offenders, 40 have been out of prison more than six months and no longer receive formal mentoring, 12 are still inside the prison and have not yet been released, 1 is in the first six months following release and 4 were dropped from the program prior to their release. Of the 40 mentees who have been out of prison for more than six months, only one has been returned to prison for a new charge and 4 were brought back to prison for 60-90 days due to a technical violation of the special provision of their parole plans. These results are significantly better than the usual recidivism rate of the general prison population in kansas.

Water, Ste 300	Wichita	KS	67202	USA	Arts & Culture,Arts Education,Education,Student Services	There is growing recognition that children who learn to think creatively, problem solve, and work as a team have a greater chance of future success. In the 21st century, many argue that the new basic skill for global competitiveness and individual fulfillment will be creativity. Research has shown that using the arts for learning provides the best way to encourage higher level critical thinking by taking what students hear, see and/or read, and using music, dance, visual art, drama, film making or other arts disciplines to create new learning. Arts Partners' artists bring the "leveraged learning" process to reading, writing, math, science, social studies: all the core subject areas. This "leveraged learning" effect is even more profound in "at-risk" students. Because we believe that creative minds make communities better, Arts Partners is dedicated to providing opportunities for all students from early childhood through high school to learn in the arts and through the arts.

It is our primary mission to find permanent, loving and healthy homes for our rescued dogs, or temporary accommodations until a permanent home becomes available. Upon arrival, we assess adoption potential and begin socializing - training the animal to be placed in a responsible home environment. Due to abuse, neglect, or physical limits, any and all special requirements specific to a particular dog must be taken into account.  After determining the best course of action, these special needs are dealt with utilizing available resources. We attempt to find the appropriate home for each dog, interviewing interested individuals, explaining any special needs, and making a home visit to meet the family and assess the viability of the situation.  After placement, we provide continued support and follow-up via telephone, email, and on-site visits to ensure that the animal is integrating well into the new family. We regularly respond to calls from friends, neighbors, and people familiar with S.C.A.R.S. concerning neglected or abused animals. We also work closely with area animal control agencies, notifying them in initial abuse cases, and then follow-up to assess whether or not the needs of these animals have been met.

Now imagine we are driving 55 miles per hour down a curvy Ozarks road, with you and your friend both holding the same pen trying to draw a straight line while the paper is being jerked in different directions.that can be like canoeing.Ive observed canoe partners become frenemies. Ive seen tiny branches wreak havoc. Ive seen once tricky cross currents turn into a great friend (once you learn them). In all of this I have yet to see many straight lines.It just is not the point.So why are we so dedicated to this ministry?  First, it is about Jesus. The life He was born to lead and the price He paid so that we may live a life eternal in the Creators presence. Sometimes in the comfort of the noise of our life, we can ignore the Creation and the Creator.  But out here, on the river, in the demands of silence it is unmistakable. There is a God, and He wants our attention.  present tents.jpgThat is the point.God brings us each to Him at His time and His place. Being given the opportunity to serve that loving God is lifes greatest privilege. Since 2001, weve been blessed to work with over a hundred volunteers; many of them complete families with young children. Never once had a volunteer imagined themselves at Living Waters.
