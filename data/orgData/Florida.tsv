The first initiative of the Foundation was the establishment of the Lotus House Womens Shelter in the heart of Overtown, Miami, an area suffering from profound poverty and urban blight in one of the poorest large cities in the United States. Lotus House is a unique women's resource center and residential facility serving women who are homeless or at risk of being homeless, whether due to domestic violence, untreated medical or mental illness, disability, loss of employment, or other economic reasons. For many women, it is the shelter of last resort, as time spent in temporary shelters does not afford them an opportunity to address untreated medical and mental health issues, obtain employment, and save the funds needed to secure affordable housing. This is not a typical short term shelter, but a place where the minds, bodies and spirits of women most in need are nurtured and supported to empower them to improve the quality of their lives on every level, achieve greater self sufficiency, and transition to permanent homes off the streets.			Miami Dade County, Florida	Operation of residential facility and resource center, known as lotus house women's shelter, providing free shelter, holistic support services and access to wide range of community resources for homeless women and children, including: food, clothing, counseling, job readiness training and educational workshops, access to medical and mental health treatment, pre-natal care, birthing and parenting classes, infant supplies, and a host of enrichment of activities. Facility serves approximately 350+ homeless women and children each year. After its initial formation, the foundation concentrated its efforts on providing relief to homeless, poor, distressed and disadvantaged women and children. It established lotus house as a prototype women's resource center and transitional housing facility, providing basic human services and resources to homeless, poor, distressed and disadvantaged women in miami-dade county. It elected not to further pursue assistance to the school project of the theodore gibson foundation, which was in the planning stages.   through its wholly owned subsidiary lotus house thrift, llc, the foundation has established a work program and community outreach thrift shop benefiting lotus house women's shelter, providing job training, clothing and furnishings for homeless, poor, distressed and disadvantaged women in furtherance of the foundation's charitable and educational purposes.   through its wholly owned subsidiary lotus wellness center, llc, the foundation established a free, volunteer, health and wellness clinic in furtherance of the foundation's charitable and educational purposes.

Through child sponsorships and donations we support orphans with special needs residing at the House of Love in the city of Guilin.	Orphaned Children in China			Clubfoot Casting Unit The Clubfoot Casting Unit at An Orphans Wish was created to treat and care for orphans born with clubfoot, who otherwise would not have an opportunity to have their feet corrected. The Ponseti Method of serial casting is used to gently manipulate the affected foot with a series of casts, changed weekly. Once the desired position is achieved, braces are worn to keep the correction, on a gradually reduced schedule, until the child is 4-5 years old. The children treated at An Orphans Wish live in our residential facility until correction is achieved. Once the bracing protocol is well underway, the children are placed with a foster family. Most clubfoot patients stay in our facility between 6 and 9 months before moving to foster care.  Special Care Unit Our Special Care Unit (SCU) cares for orphaned children born with medical conditions, prematurely or those who are in need of specialized care. Children come into our unit from local orphanages and remain in our care until they are healthy enough to be placed into loving foster homes.  Upon entering our unit, the children are bathed, fed, evaluated to determine their medical needs, and placed into the arms of one of our wonderful caretakers. With the help of medical professionals we begin to develop a medical and specialized care plan, specific to each child. If needed, we arrange for the childs surgery and medical care by partnering with other charitable groups working in China. Our caretakers accompany the child during any surgery to ensure they are receiving the best care possible. Quality care post surgery is provided as well, so the child has the best opportunity for successful healing. Some childrens needs are too severe and the only care we can provide for them is palliative care. Other times the child only requires individualized care as well as lots of love and attention, and they begin to thrive.  Residential and Cerebral Palsy Unit: The House of Love is a residential unit, opened in 2005, that provides full-time care for orphans with cerebral palsy and other special needs that require long term care. These children have a more difficult time finding adoptive families, and so this unit was created to provide a loving home environment. The children receive individualized physical therapy, quality education, and specialized care to help them achieve their highest potential.

We follow the parable of the Good Samaritan, as there are no requirements for our services. We constantly reinvent the wheel, and adapt quickly to make it work in any situation.  The faces of homelessness can change as well as each individual's circumstances. Our founder became homeless himself, and found that traditional shelters were not working, and did not address the needs of the homeless, especially Veterans. This in and of itself was discouraging, as our Veterans fought for the rights of all, not just themselves. The Founder feels that no one should lose those rights by becoming homeless. Many fought and also died for freedom in America.  The Mission in Citrus operates on love and a family atmosphere. Veterans, and many others who are homeless are helped regardless of their beliefs or unique situations. Many of the homeless Veterans have given up trusting our society, and have little access to shelter and services in rural settings. Based out of Citrus County, Florida, our program is designed for those who are less than perfect and know it, but want and need health, outreach, spiritual, and social services.   We seek to empower homeless Veterans of all ages to meet their own needs. Recognizing the uniqueness,dignity, and value of each person, we accept individuals as they are, in an affirming and compassionate manner, and call upon the larger community to the same mission.  The Mission provides basic and self-care supplies, free health care, housing and supportive services for the homeless Veterans that are the hardest to reach, including those who refuse to go into a shelter and live out in the rural wooded areas of our county. The Mission also provides referrals to other community agencies, such as child care providers and legal aid.   The Mission in Citrus Inc operates three shelters located in Crystal River, and Inverness, Florida. The Mission In Citrus strives to help all in need - regardless of their faith or lack of.  While we encourage, teach, and preach the Gospel, we force it upon no one. It is not a requirement for any of our services.   As Founder and Executive Director , I have worked for seven years to improve the help we give to others.That is between God and I. But there are several projects that need to be completed before God takes me home.Most of them concern Veterans, as they are becoming the new face of homelessness each day. In the past two weeks, we have taken in six new Veterans. Not good.   I am asking for help in getting them help with disabilities, contacting Congressman,and funding to offer more services. Anyone can visit the shelter at 306 south Park Ave in Inverness at anytime and meet our homeless Veterans.

After this profound experience, anytown graduates begin looking for opportunities to change their communities. Many will return to anytown year after year as counselors in order to give back to the program. Community tampa bay provides the anytown experience for youth ages 14-19 across tampa bay. We profoundly believe we can improve our community -- one person at a time. One of our strengths is turning negative leaders into positive ones through our unique and proven methods of peer modeling and experiential education.

Wildlife conservation		Worldwide	Wildlife conservation expeditions funded mostly through volunteer and voluntourism contributions	Southern Africa  Data collected by our expeditions in Namibia have helped our local and international partners make arguments that have led to the declaration of the Kavango Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area, or KAZA TFCA. The KAZA TFCA is the world's largest conservation area, spanning five southern African countries; Angola, Botswana, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe, centered around the Caprivi-Chobe-Victoria Falls area. Also in Namibia, fewer lions, leopards and cheetahs have been killed in farmer-predator conflict due to our data collection, awareness-building and educational work.  Oman  Data collected by our expeditions as well as our intensive work to influence decision-makers have led to the creation of two MPAs (marine protected areas) in the Musandam Peninsula of Oman, where all fishing except local handline fishing has been banned by a new ministerial decree.  Ukraine  Data collected by our expeditions in the Ukraine have helped our local partners make arguments that have led to the declaration of a national park in the Ukraine. This park now protects a unique steppe area jutting into the Black Sea and a stop-off point for many migratory birds, as well as a haven for fauna (e.g. birds & wolves) and flora (it boasts amongst other things Europe's biggest orchid field).  Altai Republic  Data collected by our expeditions in the Altai have helped our local and international partners make arguments that have led to the declaration of a protected area in the Altai Republic, Central Asia. This area now provides a protected habitat for a number of endangered species, including the snow leopard. Also in the Altai, we have converted local poachers into conservationists by paying them for verifiable camera trap pictures of snow leopards surviving year-on-year. This is obviously not a long-term strategy, but with so few snow leopards remaining, some stopgap solutions are needed until the long-term ones can be reached.  Australia  When Australia created the world's largest network of marine reserves in 2012, the Roebuck Commonwealth Marine Reserve, site of our flatback turtle study, was part of the network. Along with our local partners, we were working towards getting flatback turtles listed within the major conservation values of the reserve and this is what happened, with the citation being Foraging area adjacent to important nesting sites for flatback turtles.   SOME STATISTICS  Over 150,000 hours worked in voluntourism wildlife conservation & research.  Over 1.5 million pounds put directly into conservation project worldwide. Over half a million pounds put into local projects and communities as in-kind donations.

These cooperative relationships allow mhri to "fast track" the project bypassing the usual bureaucracy endured by larger institutions. Research projects are selected based upon their scientific validity and their contribution to the advancement of our understanding of the prevention, diagnosis, treatment of heart disease and the disease process. Projects are reviewed by our scientific advisory panel, which is comprised of the physician members of mhri's board. Projects where there has not yet been sufficient interest, knowledge or support are preferred which gives mhri a cutting edge niche as an innovator and leader.   education and prevention: education and prevention projects are pursued that improve public health, reduce health disparities and / or increase access to care in measurable and meaningful ways. At the miami heart research institute, we believe that through basic and clinical research combined with education about the causes, risk factors and lifestyle options, heart disease can be stopped. Research discoveries benefit all humanity and education promotes informed choices thereby improving outcomes and quality of life. Research is imperative for our future health while education and prevention are key to health today.

But as important, their will and spirit heals as they learn to trust the love and respect that surrounds them. Our goal is to save them all. While that is humanly impossible, we save as many as we can, and the ones we lose are lost with deep sorrow. None are forgotten as we move on the the next one that needs us. Our main goal for the wildlife we care for is to repair their bodies and keep their spirits as wild as we can, so they may be released into their wild world again. Willife that is permanently disabled live here for life, and they become the teachers that only they can be - to educate humans about their kind. Their very presence here is one of the surest ways of teaching why they need to be left in the wild, not picked up and taken home as pets.

Our mission is simple: we serve over 60 children in Jacmel, Haiti.  Art is the focus that provides them a future. Our children have been selected based on specific criteria. All of the children were between 6 and 11 when enrolled; they had never attended school nor did they eat on a regular basis. Many of our children are orphaned and were destined to a life on the streets. The children who are blessed with family are still living a life of severe poverty that should not exist in a world as advanced as ours. Knowing that these children now have an opportunity for a better life, arts education, schooling, consistent supply of food, medical care and support is an overwhelming relief to the children. We are a simple, grassroots, non- bureaucratic organization with no hidden agenda ... all we want is for our children to thrive and be children!   MISSION  Art Creation Foundation For Children is a non-profit arts organization created for education and personal growth of children in need in Jacmel, Haiti.

Endometriosis Research Center and Women's Hospital, Inc.	http://endocenter.org		EIN 65-0735986	World Headquarters 630 Ibis Drive	Delray Beach	FL	33444	USA	Breast Cancer, Health, Medical Disciplines Research, Medical Research, Voluntary Health Associations & Medical Disciplines	WHO IS THE ENDOMETRIOSIS RESEARCH CENTER?  Thank you for taking the time to learn more about our efforts concerning Endometriosis, a painful reproductive and immunological disease affecting more than 8.5 million women and teens in North America alone, with 176 million more worldwide. Our organization, the Endometriosis Research Center (ERC), was founded in 1997 to address the growing international need for disease research, education, awareness and patient support.  ERC Overview  The Endometriosis Research Center was founded because of the limited research, support, education and awareness for Endometriosis. No one with this disease should ever feel alone, and one of our goals is to create enough awareness to ensure that women and adolescents - and their loved ones - never have to feel that way again.  The ERC is a 501(c)3 tax-exempt, tax-deductible organization that operates from contributions generously donated by individuals, corporations and foundations that share our goals of making a positive difference in the lives of those with the disease, and ultimately, of finding a cure. The ERC does not accept funding from the makers of GnRH agonists, as we feel such funding presents a conflict of interest.  Furthermore, unlike similar womens health organizations, we are unique in that we do not have a membership fee, and there is never a cost to participate in or benefit from the ERCs education and support programs.  We are an international organization, with headquarters in beautiful South Florida, USA. We are pleased to have a virtual network of staff and volunteers from around the world who help implement our programs in both the online and local communities on a global basis. Founded by Executive Director Michelle E. Marvel in early 1997, the ERC strives to improve the quality of life for women and girls with Endometriosis through our extensive programs and outreach efforts.  We are pleased to maintain and offer a vast database of unbiased and accurate materials, educational sheets, videos, newsletters and articles on every aspect of Endometriosis to practitioners, patients and all those interested in the disease. In addition, the ERC works with legislators and government officials to facilitate proper funding for Endometriosis research; assists medical industry leaders with developmental studies and data collection on the disease; lobbies the National Institutes of Health and similar foundations in support of various research grants; attends and presents at health fairs, medical symposiums and similar events; maintains one of the worlds most extensive Endometriosis patient registries; and so much more.  We are actively involved in ongoing disease research, ranging from recruitment for clinical trials on proprietary new treatments to participation in genetic research studies for various biotech companies focused on the discovery of novel therapeutics and diagnostics to address significant unmet medical needs in Endometriosis. We were also involved in the A-Fem Medical pilot study conducted to validate the worlds first self-collection kit and testing method to attempt to provide a screening system for Endometriosis. The preliminary results were promising, particularly for undiagnosed women and adolescents, and this novel work has now become an area of focus for the global biotech community. Our organization also performed a recent product focus study involving a unique, all-natural topical product designed specifically for menstrual cramping. The ERC also conducted a study of medical professionals in collaboration with Agile Therapeutics, using data collection and analysis to determine the formation of a birth control patch compound. Other collaborations include Amgen Praecis Corporation; Neurocrine Bioscience; the International OxeGENE Study Group; the National Womens Health Information Center; The Office on Womens Health/U.S. Department of Health & Human Services; Helica TC Corporation; Zonagen Corporation; and many more.  The ERC also investigates controversial issues in Endometriosis research to ensure that all facets of the disease are adequately addressed; in some instances, even publicly challenging popular study conclusions. For example, we refuted Yale Universitys Sexual Activity, Orgasm & Tampon Use are Associated with a Decreased Risk of Endometriosis report in the Journal of Gynecologic & Obstetric Investigation, citing extensive evidence as to why this theory was flawed; more recently, we publicly confronted an Expert Panel Consensus Report in the Journal of Fertility & Sterility advocating the use of pre-diagnostic GnRH drugs. Our position on these matters can be viewed online at http://endocenter.org/endostudy.htm and http://endocenter.org/pdf/PreDiagnosisGnRH.pdf, respectively. Currently, we are conducting our own research concerning the potential risks associated with Menstrual Cups devices and Endometriosis in association with renowned Reproductive Toxicologist, Dr. Armand Lione. Dr. Lione is the President of Associated Pharmacologists & Toxicologists in Washington, DC, the author of the prestigious ReproTox database, and an Official with the Reproductive Toxicology Center in Bethesda, MD.  In addition to our research facilitation and patient education programs, we also offer a vast support network for those with the disease and their loved ones. The ERC is pleased to host over 50 active, in-person support groups worldwide, and is the owner of the Internets largest electronic Endometriosis support group, currently with over 3,000 participants from around the globe. Access to location-specific listservs is also available, which are hosted by ERC support group leaders. For male partners of women with Endo, we recommend John Blondins group for men only, MENDO, located online at:http://www.endocenter.org/mendo/. In addition, until recently, we were the first and only Endometriosis organization to formally recognize and support the unique needs and perspectives of the lesbian woman with Endometriosis.  In honor of young women with Endometriosis ages 25 and under, the ERC launched Girl Talk TM. Girl Talk TM is a specific support and education program tailored to meet the needs of young women and adolescents who have, or think they may have, the disease. In addition to providing patient advocacy and education, Girl Talk TM raises awareness about Endometriosis and improves patient care among practitioners offering healthcare services to young women.  Education & Support  Endometriosis affects twice the number of Alzheimers patients and seven times those with Parkinsons Disease, and is a leading cause of female infertility, chronic pelvic pain and gynecologic surgery. It accounts for nearly half of the 600,000 hysterectomies performed in the United States annually. It is more prevalent than breast cancer, yet continues to be treated as an insignificant, obscure ailment. Recent studies have even shown an elevated risk of certain cancers in women with Endometriosis. Endometriosis can be so painful as to render a woman or teen unable to care for herself or her family or attend work, school or social functions. Endometriosis affects every aspect of a womans life, from her self-esteem to her relationships to her ability to be a contributing member of society.  Even in this age of medical advances, Endometriosis remains a conundrum to patients and practitioners alike. The disease can only be diagnosed definitively through invasive surgery, and there is no absolute cure. The average delay in diagnosis is a staggering 9 years, and a patient may seek the counsel of 4 or more physicians before her pain is addressed.  Though Endometriosis is one of the most prevalent illnesses affecting our society today, disease research continues to remain significantly under-funded. In fiscal year 2000, the National Institutes of Health planned to spend $16.5 billion on research. Of that funding, only $2.7 million was earmarked for Endometriosis; amounting to approximately 40 cents per patient, in stark contrast to other illnesses such as Alzheimers Disease and Lupus, which received approximately $105 and $30 per patient, respectively. The ERC strives to improve the public focus on Endometriosis, and provides extensive materials, fact sheets, videos, newsletters and articles on every aspect of Endometriosis to practitioners, patients and all those interested in the disease. Our organization raises awareness about Endometriosis throughout the medical and lay communities, works with Government officials to facilitate proper funding for Endometriosis research, and assists medical industry leaders with developmental studies and data collection. The ERC is also pleased to host over 50 support groups worldwide and is the owner of the Internets largest electronic Endometriosis support group, currently with nearly 3,000 participants.  In 2000, the ERC organized and implemented a unique and groundbreaking opportunity for world-wide education and awareness regarding Endometriosis. World-opinion leaders on the disease brought forth the most current research and information on Endometriosis at this one-day Symposium entitled, Endometriosis 2000. The first of its kind, the Endometriosis 2000 Symposium was filmed and later broadcast on the internet so individuals unable to attend had the opportunity to watch the program right from their own home. Furthermore, VHS copies were also made available. Due to the overwhelming success of Endometriosis 2000, the ERC implemented Endometriosis 2001 a year later, which followed the same format as the original symposium. Without the ERCs co-presenter, Amgen Praecis, neither Symposium would have been as successful.  Amgen Praecis supported the ERCs education program with unrestricted grants in 2000 and 2001. Developers of the new, investigational medication, Abarelix, Amgen Praecis completed the FASTER (First Abarelix-Depot Study for Treating Endometriosis Pain Rapidly) Study. The Study involved nearly 400 patients in multi-site, blinded trials to determine whether the medication is safe and capable of relieving pain associated with Endometriosis faster and with fewer side effects than current therapies.  Research  The ERC has the privilege of working with leaders in the ongoing study and treatment of the disease. ERC programs and operations are governed by an Executive Board of Directors and a Medical & Professional Advisory Panel consisting of pioneers in Endometriosis research and treatment; including Andrew Cook, MD, Director of Vitalcare Institute of Center in Los Gatos, CA, world-renowned for his dedication to Endometriosis research and treatment; Armand Lione, Ph.D., President of the Associated Pharmacologists & Toxicologists Association, David B. Redwine, MD, Director of the St. Charles Medical Center Endometriosis Treatment Program and founder of the innovative LAPEX procedure for Endometriosis, in Bend, Oregon; Serdar Bulun, MD, RE, Director of the Molecular Genetics & Reproductive Endocrinology at Northwestern University in Chicago, IL, known for his groundbreaking research on Aromatase Inhibitors; Nabil Husami, MD, Director and Founder of the Endometriosis Research & Treatment Center at Columbia University Medical Center in New York City, NY; Nancy Petersen, RN, Founder of the Endometriosis Treatment Program at St. Charles Medical Center in Bend, OR; Donna Laux, MA, former Program Director of the Center for Endometriosis Care in Atlanta, GA; Glenda Motta, RN, MPH, ET, of Washington, DC, co-Author of Coping With Endometriosis and Successful Living With Endometriosis; William Fleming, PhD, Vice Chairman of A-FEM Medical Corporation, also in Oregon, Linda Howard-Smith, Nurse Practitioner with the Vitalcare Institute of Health in Los Gatos, CA; and many other distinguished professionals. The organization is also implementing a unique program for Professionals only, which is designed to encourage global collaboration on, and advance the study and treatment of, all aspects of Endometriosis for researchers, physicians, scientists and healthcare professionals from all over the world.  The ERC also enjoys collaborative relationships with similar like-minded foundations, including the National Endometriosis Society (United Kingdom), Associazione Italiana Endometriosi (Italy), the Endometriosis SHE Trust (United Kingdom), the Endometriosis Care Centre of Australia (ECCA), and RESOLVE, a national infertility organization. Additionally, the ERC is represented in the World Endometriosis Society, the National Pain Foundation and the American Chronic Pain Association. The ERC is also a Founding Partner in the Society for Womens Health Research, a collaboration sponsored by the Alliance for Women in Clinical Research, and a member of the Primate Freedom Projects Moratorium on Primate Research.  The Guidestar Foundation, a Federal charity watchdog organization, formally recognizes the organization as a member in good standing.  Fundraising  Since the ERC was founded, we have held numerous fundraisers including, Cruising For A Cure in October 1997; Walk for the Women You Love in February 1998; the Classic Swing Golf Tournament in June 1998; and the ERC National Raffle in October 1998 and March 1999. Generous individual donations, corporate sponsorships, raffle and silent auction proceeds along with event attendees have supported these fundraising events.  Additionally, the ERC works with GBI Marketing bi-annually (spring and autumn) to host international Yankee Candle fundraisers. Through the ERCs volunteers, we have raised thousands of dollars annually through this fundraiser.  In October 2001, we participated in an event known as The Shopping Benefit, sponsored by Bloomingdales Department Store. This annual fundraising event is held throughout South Florida at each Bloomingdales retail location (Miami, Aventura, Boca Raton & West Palm Beach). The ERC was successful in its efforts, and plans to continue participating each year. In addition to South Florida, Bloomingdales holds this event in local communities throughout the United States where the company has retail locations. It is the ERCs goal to have volunteers living in these areas to also coordinate and participate in this fun fundraising event.  Our organization also reaps fiscal benefits from member support of our online store, located at http://www.cafepress.com/ERC. The ERCs online store allows interested parties to support the ERC and our efforts by purchasing various Endometriosis awareness items. We are also pleased by the support of many various fundraisers held by our members and supporters throughout the year, all of whom designate the ERC as their recipient charity of choice.  As described, the ERC has enjoyed much fundraising success. With our dedication and continued public outreach, we will continue to gain the financial support to assist us in our future growth through innovative fundraising activities.  Public Awareness  Endometriosis affects more women than breast cancer. However, the general public is not aware of the disease. Among many of those who are aware of this affliction, it is mistakenly believed to be an insignificant issue because of the misconceptions that have developed through the years. My sister had that and she was cured with birth control pills; I had that and it went away when I got pregnant; My friend had that, and a hysterectomy fixed her are all common fallacies about Endometriosis. The misconception develops because there are women in the world who have had surgery, become pregnant or taken hormones and  temporarily - no longer suffer symptoms of Endometriosis. However, speak with the millions of women and girls who live with chronic daily pain, and they will tell you that having Endometriosis is no life at all.  To assist us with our awareness goals, the ERC has developed an Awareness Campaign that includes branded awareness products, including t-shirts, water bottles, license plate frames and more. Public knowledge about our organization and Endometriosis is very important, and is accomplished through the ERCs ongoing efforts, including offering awareness items, press releases, feature stories, internet, speaking engagements, word of mouth, advertising and more.  The ERC is also the premier awareness organization where legislative efforts are concerned. We raise awareness and provide education about Endometriosis not only throughout patient and medical communities through our free Symposiums, meetings and materials, but on State and Federal levels as well. For example, in late 2000, we testified before the California State Legislature at the invitation of Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza on behalf of Assembly Bill 2820, a crucial health bill calling for independent research into the presence of dioxins in feminine hygiene products and the subsequent risks these toxins pose to women and their children. AB 2820 was approved by majority vote and passed on to the Senate Committee on Health & Human Services. Our organization has also been very successful over the years in working with concerned legislators and policymakers to establish Resolutions formally recognizing the need for disease awareness throughout society. To that end, the states of New York, Colorado, Florida, Michigan, California and Pennsylvania have all passed Resolutions officially recognizing the Month of March as Endometriosis Awareness Month.  Our most gratifying success, however, came in late October 2002 when Congress unanimously passed our Countrys first-ever National legislation, House Concurrent Resolution 291. Introduced on behalf of the ERC by Congressman Howard Buck McKeon and supported by numerous Co-sponsors, H.Con.Res.291 formally proclaimed March as National Endometriosis Awareness Month. H.Con.Res.291 also expresses the sense of the United States Congress that it strongly supports the ERCs efforts to raise public awareness of Endometriosis throughout the medical and lay communities and recognizes the need for better support of patients with Endometriosis, the need for physicians to better understand the disease, the need for more effective treatments, and ultimately, the need for a cure.  The Endometriosis Research Center is open to all those concerned with Endometriosis: medical professionals, researchers, women of all ages with Endometriosis, and anyone interested in the disease. Help us make a difference by making a donation to the ERC today. Together, we can find the cure so that our daughters will not suffer as we have.	all women and girls who have, or think they may have, Endometriosis and the healthcare/medical industry that serves them.

Arise Foundation	http://www.ariselife-skills.org		EIN 59-2744449	601 Heritage Drive Suite 421	Jupiter	FL	33458	USA	Children & Youth, Crime & Law, Disaster Aid, Safety Education, Youth Development Programs, Youth Violence Prevention	ARISE's focus is on troubled youth; violent, aggressive offenders who thumb their nose at family and community often ending up in juvenile detention. ARISE has chosen to deal with this population who have substance-abuse dependency, mental and emotional problems and, in all likelihood, have been subjected to physical, and sexual abuse. They require much more than just a secure facility for any chance at a normal life. ARISE delivers its social skills lessons to approxamately 5,000 at-risk youth each week as an antidote for their menacing anti-social behavior.According to America's Promise: The Alliance for Youth, nearly 67% of African American children and almost 25% of white children live in households with only one parent. Two million American children have a parent in jail and approximately 8 million children regularly spend time without adult supervision. A total of 30 million young Americans live in families with incomes below the poverty level. Life is often too hard for many youth. With daily survival often the priority, many of the tools youth need to make healthy choices are not available. This is where the ARISE Foundation make a difference. A 1998 study by Vanderbelt University estimated that each high-risk juvenile prevented from adopting a life of crime could save the country between $1.7-2.3 million.ARISE Foundation?s mission is to introduce valuable life skills to youth, enabling them to achieve their highest potential through training and education. This mission is accomplished in two ways, through the development of life-skill lessons and through careful training of ARISE certified life-skills instructors. ARISE has written over 260 life-skill lessons, such as anger management, conflict resolution, and finding and keeping a job, among others. These lessons were carefully written to be highly interactive and understandable for at-risk youth ages pre-k to teens. This population required gentle encouragement to express their honest feelings in ARISE groups. To accomplish this, rigorous staff training was a must. ARISE created a unique delivery system for teaching life skills by training staff in seven intensive hours on precisely how to conduct memorable, interactive, group life-skill lessons. A remarkable 5,000 ARISE Certified Life Skills instructors have also been trained. They have taught an astounding 3,500,000 documented hours of ARISE Life-Skill Lessons to at-risk youth in Florida and Washington D.C. ARISE Foundation?s goals are to continue to create lessons and update training, as well as broaden the number of people using these tools worldwide. ARISE foundation is unique in that it is the only program of its kind created specifically for juvenile offenders.

A focus is on harder-to-adopt dogs, especially those needing extra training and care for whatever reason. Tactics used to save lives include; prison inmate dog training, mobile training and education, all focusing on partnerships with animal welfare groups.	Hundreds of hard-to-adopt dogs!	Northeast Florida	Training: The Mobile Training Program launched in 2015 to provide a way for families to be able to receive professional training for their pets, regardless of breed, where the dog came from or training issue. This program is proven to help keep dogs with their families and out of the shelters, which is crucial, as 48% of all shelter dogs come through the system through owner surrenders. Since 2015, over 150 dogs have been trained, free of charge, by certified positive reinforcement trainers.  This program is offered as a life saving resource for; Jacksonville Animal Care & Protective Services, Clay County Animal Care and The Jacksonville Humane Society and is also offered in area shelters throughout Northeast FL. This program focuses on potty training and excessive barking, among other issues. A Pit Sisters canine aggression expert gives dogs with more serious issues additional assistance. Training is also about working with pet owners, as often times they cause issues unknowingly.   Community Engagement and Involvement: We believe in order to save homeless pets, more involvement and engagement from the entire community is needed. Pit Sisters continually works on collaborative relationships with animal shelters, rescues, businesses, government, etc. to breaks myths and educate entire communities.    TAILS: TAILS (Teaching Animals & Inmates Life Skills) is a collaborative effort bringing together prison inmates and hard-to-adopt shelter dogs. This is one of the largest programs of its kind in the country and fully implemented and paid for by Pit Sisters. Through partnerships with city shelters across Northeast FL; the State of Florida Correctional System; and Sheriffs offices, shelter dogs are placed in correctional facilities to be trained, socialized and cared for so they have a chance of finding a new forever loving home. Pit Sisters assesses dogs at the city shelters to find those who are in need of training and socialization and at risk of euthanasia. They provide all transport to one of the five facilities in which this program currently resides, which include The Jacksonville Bridges Community Release Center; Raymond James Correctional Institution; Baker Correctional Institute; Lawtey Correctional Institution; and Montgomery Correctional in Jacksonville.   Each TAILS dog is assigned to two pre-screened prisoners so they wont bond to any one person and learn to respond to a variety of voices and personalities. Once matched, inmates are fully responsible for the dogs care, which include feeding, grooming, housebreaking and obedience training. Pit Sisters provides food and medical care for the dogs and employs a trainer to teach the inmates and correction staff how to handle and train them. Each dog is with at least one inmate 24 hours a day, and a member of the Pit Sisters team will visit each facility frequently to observe interactions and troubleshoot any problems.   The dogs stay at their respective prison for eight weeks and at the end of the program, they are crate-trained, know basic commands such as sit or stay, walk on a leash, and are generally well-mannered. Upon graduation, all dogs will receive an APDT CLASS Certificate and inmates will be asked to take a written exam based on what they have taught. All data is compiled and monitored. Immediately upon graduation a new set of dogs arrive to enter the TAILS program.  If a dog does not get adopted prior to graduation, it is not returned to a shelter to risk euthanasia again, rather, the dog will stay in the program until adopted, go to a foster home, or will be brought to an adoption event.   TAILS benefits dogs, trainers, families, prison staff and entire communities. It has beneficially impacted behavior as inmates learn teamwork. The wardens have observed prisoners increasingly deal with problems by talking rather than fighting. Stress has been noticeably reduced. One inmate who recently spoke at a graduation stated, For the dogs to listen to us, we have to be stable. This program is bringing stability to unstable people. Its better to give than receive and we are truly blessed to receive the opportunity. This program gives us all renewed strength to strive to become better people in our everyday lives.   Inmates who have gone through this program leave with employable skills and life-saving stories to share. One Northeast, Florida animal welfare group has hired two TAILS inmates. TAILS is truly saving lives from the inside.   This program is so hugely important because it is estimated that 48 percent of all shelter dogs entering come from owner surrenders. More notably, many dogs come in unruly, un-socialized and just dont have basic training skills. This program helps solve this common, potentially deadly problem.  Since 2012, close to 400 dogs have been through the TAILS program. All dogs leave with letters from inmate trainers about their personalities, and also a professional training certificate.	Pit Sisters have always dedicated themselves to giving a voice to the most misunderstood dogs. This has been done by providing love and homes to harder-to-adopt dogs in need.  The mission has expanded to be more proactive and innovative with efforts focused on the following programs.  The Pit Sisters Mobile Training Program launched in 2015 to provide a way for families to be able to receive professional training for their pets, regardless of breed, where the dog came from or training issue. This program is proven to help keep dogs with their families and out of the shelters, which is crucial, as 48% of all shelter dogs come through the system through owner surrenders. Since 2015, over 150 dogs have been trained, free of charge, by certified positive reinforcement trainers. This number is expected to increase each year, as more support is garnered.   Our community engagement intitatives have touched thousands of people over the past six years, as we were founded in 2011.  Helping break the myths and educate entire communities about pit bull type breeds has been a life mission for our team.    TAILS (Teaching Animals & Inmates Life Skills) is a collaborative effort bringing together prison inmates and hard-to-adopt shelter dogs. This is one of the largest programs of its kind in the country. We are in five prison facilities to date and plan on expanding as more support is given to this life saving program. We partner with city shelters across Northeast FL; the State of Florida Correctional System; and Sheriffs offices, as shelter dogs are placed in correctional facilities to be trained, socialized and cared for so they have a chance of finding a new forever loving home. This program currently resides at, The Jacksonville Bridges Community Release Center; Raymond James Correctional Institution; Baker Correctional Institute; Lawtey Correctional Institution; and Montgomery Correctional in Jacksonville. To date over 400 hard-to-adopt dogs have been served by our TAILS program.

The community issues of cat overpopulation cannot be achieved through the adoption process. It must be accomplished through sterilization of the existing community cat population. In addition to sterilizing, the cats are vaccinated and under the daily feeding and care of volunteer caregivers. For the Love of Cats works with Domestic Animal Services in Collier County to adhere to the TNR ordinance currently in place. To date, For the Love of Cats has TNRd over 5000 cats. Caregivers feed over 300 cats on Marco Island every day. Rescue of Abandoned House Cats and Kittens Abandoned pets are a major contributing factor to the increase in community cats throughout Collier County. For the Love of Cats has rescued almost 300 abandoned house cats in the immediate area over the last 4 years. Kittens are a by-product of the community cat colonies. Rescued early, they can be domesticated and adopted into loving homes. We have rescued and adopted over 3000 kittens since 2002 and continue to rescue kittens that are the offspring of abandoned house cats in our community (we rescue the mom cat as well). We no longer have kittens from the community cat colonies because we have fixed and vaccinated all of the free roaming unadoptable cats in the community to our knowledge. Spay/Neuter for Cats of Low Income Families Our Low Income Spay/Neuter program pays for sterilization surgery for cats and kittens owned by families that would otherwise abandon them without this service. Our program is designed to help families keep their pets with the benefit of reducing abandonment and thereby also reducing the number of cats and kittens that add to the existing community cat population. Every year, we help over 75 cats and kittens to keep their home. Emergency Veterinary Services for Low Income Families Many low income families have pets that need urgent veterinary attention and would be forced to allow their pet to suffer or be euthanized without this program.  Last year alone, we paid for 3 dental extractions, 3 knee surgeries, 2 cats with severe whole body infections, 1 cancerous eye removal, 1 crushed tail surgery and 2 broken leg surgeries. Each of these emergencies was over $1000 each. Seniors for Seniors Adoption Program  Older cats languish in shelters for years and most do not get adopted or worse, they are euthanized to make room for younger animals.

(cci) is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit florida corporation whose goal is to make a determined effort within our community to educate our residents about the tragedy of "throwaway" kittens and cats. Our main goal is to rescue cats and kittens and as such we are a no-kill organization. We will care, maintain and rehabilitate as many kittens/cats as possible. We are a connected group of people who see a need to do whatever we can to help these kittens. At any given time, 6 - 10 volunteers foster anywhere from one to fifteen kittens. Some of the kittens come to us very sick or orphaned, and the foster moms and dads wake every 2-3 hours to feed or check on the kittens, to medicate, and/or to comfort them.				In the year ending 12/31/13 we estimate that we rescued and neutered/spayed approximately 382 cats/kittens and found adoptive homes for 332 of those cats/kittens. The majority of the cats/kittens come to us malnourished and in dire straights and we nurse them back to health and either find them adoptive homes with families that will love them and care for them or we find a foster family that will take them in until we can find families that will adopt them. A few examples of the cats/kittens we have helped are as follows: swiffer is a kitten who came to us injured by an animal bite on his spine which paralyzed him. We found a family that was willing to adopt him, help provide him with equipment so that he could be more mobile and help him adapt to his paralyzed state. Rambo was another kitten who came to us on the verge of having his leg amputated; we were able to treat him through exercise and nutrition and we were able to save his leg so that it did not have to be amputated. Raj and leonard are two kittens who came to us exposed to poison due to the fact that they were born two days later than their siblings and thus they were exposed to poison while in utero. We did everything we could to rejuvenate them but when we determined that they would have chronic respiratory issues, the foster parent chose to keep them rather than adopting them out.

We often take horses that others would not take for various reasons such as requiring extensive and/or costly rehab  we feel they all deserve a chance. Quality of life is always a factor in determining the future of each horse. We are pro-life  we do not euthanize any equine to make room for another.   We have an excellent care team that includes professionals in traditional and holistic medicines, dentistry, equine podiatrists, etc. However, we do euthanize when it is in the best interest of the horse  we dont deny a peaceful and loving end to any equine that is suffering or has a poor or painful quality of life that cant be rehabilitated. We have taken in horses with birth defects, broken bones, mutilations, cancer, blindness, COPD, Cushings disease, are extremely emaciated, and have other serious diseases. We also help other animals (dogs, cats, pigs, goats, etc.) in need on occasion.     In 2012 Beautys Haven was awarded Verified status by the Global Federation of Animal Sanctuaries (GFAS).

We believe literacy is a right that provides equal opportunity to achieving the American dream, which every child deserves. If we help the nations children get on the path to learning in the earliest years, even before they enter kindergarten, they are far more likely to succeed in school and life. We also believe in investing in low-literate parents who are unable to provide the stimulating learning environment that young children need to jumpstart their education.  We help families understand:  The childs first school is the home.  The parent is the childs first teacher.  The childs first subject is reading.  The Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy is focused on fulfilling its mission by providing low-income families across the nation with scholarships to learn together. We partner with a network of high-performing local family literacy programs that help both young children and their parents learn how to read and write. When families share a love of reading, children have a far greater chance to live more productive and healthier lives, graduate from high school and obtain a better job. Supporting family literacy programs is a win-win for parents and children where they acquire basic literacy skills that help them advance their education and provide greater opportunities to succeed.

Fraser and his surviving spouse, Mary Ellen Fraser, from the metropolitan Detroit area of Michigan.  James and Mary Ellen realized the desperate need for a Christian home when two small children were deserted at the nursery school operated by James and Mary Ellen.  After being dropped off for a regular day at pre-school, the parents of the children never returned for them.  After two weeks of frantic searching for the parents, the Frasers decided to find a Christian children's home for the children.  Every place they contacted, they were told the beds were all full, so arrangements were made to place the children in a county juvenile home.  Upon seeing the conditions at the crowded juvenile home, which looked more like a jail, Mr. Fraser found it impossible to leave the children there.  This experience brought into sharp focus the desperate need for homes for abandoned children.  After visiting his parents in Florida, James Fraser decided to locate a home there where the children would have year round outdoor activities.
