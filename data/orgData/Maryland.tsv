Campaigns include Meatout, Vegan Earth Day/Bite Global Warming, the Animal Rights National Conferences, Humane Facts, World Farm Animals Day, and Gentle Thanksgiving.			United States and 31 other countries	Grassroots outreach:the 10 billion lives program focuses on video outreach, offering incentives to watch a 4-minute video about the 10 billion animals raised and killed for food each year. Through a tactic called "pay-per-view," activists offer people $1 each to watch the video. Surveys indicate that an average viewer eats thirteen fewer animals per year after participating, meaning that the 10 billion lives tour has the potential to spare one million animals per year. The great american meatout is now an international observance in two dozen countries and in all fifty states. Every march since 1985, farm works through its grassroots network of volunteers organizing outreach events in their communities. The purpose is to demonstrate the joys and benefits of a plant-based diet to the public, while promoting the availability and selection of vegan foods in mainstream grocery stores and restaurants. World farm animals day is a global day of action, observed on october 2nd, dedicated to exposing, mourning, and memorializing the more than 65 billion cows, pigs, turkeys, chickens, and other land animals that needlessly suffer and are killed in the world's farms and slaughterhouses. Grassroots activists across 30 countries hold symbolic and educational events in their communities. Public awareness:farm raises public awareness by posting billboards and bus ads in major us cities, as well as running tv and online ads to promote veganism. For the past 16 years, farm's letters-to-the-editor program has been linking benefits of the vegan lifestyle to current news developments or national holidays. Each of the 16 letters per year is published in 30-50 local newspapers, reaching millions. Vegan support:the live vegan website serves as an online vegan starter guide, educating visitors on how to make an enjoyable transition to a vegan lifestyle.

Esophageal Cancer Action Network, Inc. (ECAN)	http://www.ecan.org	410-358-3226	EIN 77-0710311	P.O. Box 243	Stevenson	MD	21153	USA	Cancer, Digestive Diseases & Disorders, Health	Esophageal Cancer Action Network's mission is to >SAVE LIVES by raising awareness about the link between Heartburn and Cancer > promoting early detection > supporting progress in medical innovation for the prevention, early detection, treatment and cure of Esophageal Cancer and > linking patients and families to compassionate support.  Every 36 minutes, an American dies of Esophageal Cancer. ECAN is dedicated to fighting Esophageal Cancer, the fastest increasing cancer diagnosis in the U.S.   Esophageal Cancer can be treated successfully if it's detected early. But usually it isn't. That's one of the reasons we founded ECAN.   We want people who have persistent heartburn to know that they are at risk for this deadly disease.   And we want those who decide how federal research dollars are spent to focus more attention on finding much more effective tools to discover and fight Esophageal Cancer.				Ecan's mission is to save lives by increasing awareness about the link between heartburn and cancer, promoting early detection, supporting medical innovation to prevent, detect, treat and cure esophageal cancer and link patients and families to compassionate support. This national non-profit organization, based in baltimore, is led by a board of directors of top physicians, business leaders, and families that have been touched by esophageal cancer. History: ecan was founded in 2009 by mindy mintz mordecai and an impressive group of dedicated professionals after she lost the father of her two young daughters, and her husband of 14 years, to esophageal cancer. Angry and frustrated because she believes that her husband and thousands more like him might never have died had they been aware of the link between heartburn and cancer, mordecai is determined to prevent others from suffering the pain esophageal cancer has caused her family. Accomplishments: over the past 6 years, ecan has made significant strides in the fight against esophageal cancer. Among ecan's successes:critical research: ecan successfully advocated with the national cancer institute to change course and include esophageal cancer in its genome mapping project known as the the cancer genome atlas (tcga). Mindy mintz mordecai is also a member of the national cancer institute's esophagogastric task force of the gastrointestinal steering committee as a patient advocate representative and the nci patient advocate steering committee. The focus of the task force is to improve the clinical research that impacts esophageal and gastric cancer patients. A guide for patients: with input from physicians around the country, ecan developed an innovative guide for patients providing comprehensive and clear information about the link between heartburn and cancer. The guide is designed to help patients advocate for their own health care and is available as a free download from the ecan website in both english and spanish. Esophageal cancer awareness month: esophageal cancer awareness month: ecan led the effort to have april designated as esophageal cancer awareness month in states throughout the united states. With ecan's support over the past 5 years, more than 150 gubernatorial declarations of ec awareness month have been achieved throughout the country and in some other nations, as well. April is now observed as ec awareness month by companies, organizations and governments across the nation - and the world. Legendary partnership: ecan has partnered with the estate of film icon humphrey bogart whose life was cut short in 1957 by esophageal cancer. In may 2013, the 3,000 guests of the first annual humphrey bogart film festival in key largo, florida witnessed the launch of screenings for screenings. In movie trailers produced by ecan and presented before each film, bogart's son stephen encourages those at risk for esophageal cancer to "get checked. " those trailers can now be seen at a variety of events, including the annual humphrey bogart film festival in key largo, florida. Events that make a difference: in april 2014, ecan presented the first esophageal cancer awareness event in professional sports at the staples center when the l. A. Clippers took on the dallas mavericks. Later that month, ecan sponsored the first esophageal cancer awareness race ever held in new york city; more than 1,000 attended the two day festival that included a 5k, 10k and half marathon. In april 2012, ecan hosted the first gala ever held in the u. S. To focus on esophageal cancer advocacy. Former california congresswoman and under secretary of state ellen o. Tauscher moved the crowd of nearly 300 with her story of survival of stage iii esophageal cancer. In 2013, the cancer dancer gala attracted a larger audience and raised more than $110,000 in support of ecan's life-saving mission. In 2014, the cancer dancer gala went hollywood with more than 300 guests and remarks by ecan spokesman stephen bogart. The fun night celebrated ecan's success as it approached its fifth anniversary. Seriously funny: in 2015, ecan launched its no laughing matter campaign - a public awareness effort that uses humor to help folks understand that reflux disease is a serious condition that should not be taken lightly. The highlight of the campaign was an evening with jeff foxworthy in arlington, virginia in april that brought a new audience to our message and entertained our supporters with a fantastic evening of fun and laughter. Leading up to the foxworthy event, ecan hosted competitions in comedy clubs throughout the us where comedians competed for the chance to be the opening act for jeff foxworthy. The winner of the competition, andy huggins of houston, performed a hilarious set before jeff foxworthy took the stage. Reaching for the sky: ecan took awareness to new heights in 2015 with its stories to save lives event in los angeles. More than 40 brave participants rappelled down 24 stories of the hilton universal city hotel on behalf of someone who has faced esophageal cancer. Two rappellers were ec survivors and a third is a patient currently battling esophageal cancer. This fun and moving day delivered a strong message about the importance of early detection and taking reflux disease seriously. Ecan sponsors and supports multiple fundraising and awareness raising events around the country including walks, runs, bike rides, golf tournaments, dinners, library outreach, speaking events, art shows and more. Ecan volunteers have hosted more than 60 events to raise awareness in cities and towns across the united states since 2010.

Pfd worked with mobile and migrant populations (mmp) to reduce the spread of malaria, as population movements are one of the main factors in the emergence and spread of antimalarial resistant parasites. Pfd also trained mobile malaria workers and plantation workers to disseminate malaria information, treatment and prevention packages including insecticide treated bed nets.

Due to the unique relationship formed between the participant and the horse, most participants experience increased confidence, patience and self-esteem, as well as increased independence, improved balance posture and muscle tone.  Therapeutic riding provides participants with a sense of accomplishment that no amount of traditional therapy can ever provide.	Children and Adults with physical and/or mental disabilities

Founded by and for cancer survivors in 1986, NCCS created the widely accepted definition of survivorship and considers someone a cancer survivor from the time of diagnosis through the balance of life.   Since our founding, NCCS has worked collaboratively in pursuit of our mission to advocate for quality cancer care for all Americans and to provide tools that empower people affected by cancer to advocate for themselves.

More information is available at www.canceradvocacy.org or 1-877-NCCS-YES.	NCCS is known as a convener of diverse groups throughout the cancer community and the broader healthcare arena. A prime example of our collaborative success is the formation of the Cancer Leadership Council (CLC), by NCCS in 1993, which now includes 34 leading cancer research, support and advocacy organizations. The CLC meets monthly to consider issues that affect the quality of research and the quality of care for people diagnosed with cancer. Other collaborations have included our Cancer Policy Roundtables, and our partnership with the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) in co-chairing the Cancer Quality Alliance (CQA).  NCCS is proud of its track record as an honest broker of patient-centered education and advocacy to inform science, regulatory, and health policies related to cancer. Our relationship with some of the nations most respected health leaders and policymakers enables NCCS to carry out its important work.  NCCS led a nationwide grassroots campaign to make the cause, the care and the cure of cancer the nations top health priority. The campaign culminated in 1998s THE MARCHComing Together to Conquer CancerTM, an event that brought more than 100,000 supporters to the nations capital and a million more to events in all 50 states.  The Cancer Survival Toolbox was developed by survivors, social workers, and nurses, and represents a unique collaboration of the National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship, the Association of Oncology Social Work (AOSW), the Oncology Nursing Society (ONS), and the National Association of Social Workers (NASW). The Toolbox is a free, award-winning self-learning audio program that has been used by hundreds of thousands of listeners since 1998.  The Toolbox addresses vital issues such as communicating with your doctors, finding information, advocating, topics for older persons, clinical trials, paying for care, and tips for caregivers.  In 2009, the Cancer Survival Toolbox received two National Health Information Awards, which recognize the nation's best consumer health information programs and materials. Both winning entries, the Toolbox and the Toolbox's Multiple Myeloma Module, received the highest award given in each category and were selected from more than 1,000 entries judged by a national panel of health information experts.  Each year, NCCS strives to disseminate 50,000 digital and hard copy Toolboxes to individuals, healthcare professionals, cancer centers, community hospitals, support groups, community organizations, and clergy.

Most affected are the poorest countries, the elderly, women and children.  Unfortunately, the results of inaction are not ?newsworthy? and do not garner as much funding or political support as a Pacific tsunami killing 250,000 people once every 100 years.  However, efforts successfully addressing this situation could easily save ten times that number every year.  IEDRO rescues historic environmental data (i.e. old weather observations) throughout the world. We provide for their digitization and free distribution so that the world community can benefit.  These paper-based data are disappearing at the rate of over 100,000 observations each day due to fire, vermin, flood, age and lack of storage space.  Once these critical data are lost, they are lost forever.    Forecasts of the spread of air-borne diseases such as malaria are now possible so that health workers can take preventative measures in advance of the arrival of the disease-spreading mosquitoes. These accurate forecasts of the disease vectors are possible by correlating previous disease outbreaks with historical meteorological data.  Without the historic data, no correlation studies would be possible.  Subsistence farming families, living in hunger and on the edge of starvation can manage to keep their families fed by planting a new strain of rice developed to produce 20% less in a year with average rainfall, yet yielding a significant crop even in the driest years when the rice previously grown would have produced nothing except starvation.  Historical weather data can convince most farmers to use the new rice when the analysis shows a drought frequency of one year out of every 7 instead of every 20 as previously thought.  This one activity could save millions of lives.   There are other benefits to data rescue including climate change and global warming (glacier photos we are trying to rescue in Patagonia are the same kind as depicted in the film "An Inconvenient Truth"), building and bridge construction, flood forecasting, but the health and food aspects are most important in saving lives.   IEDRO sends data rescue experts to developing countries to help the local data caretakers/owners identify, and compile the old paper-based records for rescue.  Once the records are ready, another team provides personal computers, digital cameras, copy stands and blank CD-ROMS and trains the local data caretakers to photograph every page of data, burn the images onto CD-ROMs and return a CD copy to us for digitization.  Once the records are digitized, a copy is returned to the data caretakers and the data are also added to the world environmental data base through the NOAA National Climatic Data Center in Asheville, NC for the open and unrestricted use of the entire world community.  To date, we have supported the rescue and digitization of over 300,000 weather observations in Africa and South America.

Programs That Change Lives The Arts Mentorship Academy (AMA) program is one example of Creating Communities at work. AMA is an Arts-based alternative education opportunity for young people ages 8 to 17 providing Arts instruction, mentoring, and experiential learning. The program also focuses on teaching academic competencies based on Maryland State Voluntary Curriculum standards. The program teaches artistic skills while it fosters community service. It also teaches life skills such as leadership development and teamwork, which in turn build self-confidence and self-reliance.   The Arts Mentorship Academy serves 100 students and runs for one week in the summer, with occasional weekend intensives and after school sessions. A typical day at the Academy begins with the teachers/mentors leading students in an interactive session. Students then break out into smaller groups to work closely with master artists, followed by collaborative art projects such as creating murals, participating in a drumming circle, or choreographing a group dance.    Another program, The Youth Arts Fellowship (YAF), is an innovative arts-based alternative education opportunity that provides instruction, mentoring, and experiential learning for twenty Annapolis and Anne Arundel County 10th to 12th graders.  YAF is designed for students who are particularly challenged by traditional curricula and who need additional support to assist them in reaching personal and academic goals. Students meet one Saturday per month for ten months for an all-day retreat. The teacher-to-student ratio is 1:4 enabling personal mentoring and special attention to the needs of each student. Field trips to the Kennedy Center, Baltimore Museum of Art, and Maryland Hall for the Creative Arts broaden and enrich the students experience. The group also takes part in three, arts-based community service projects, giving back to the wider community while strengthening the social fabric.  Not only youth but also adults are benefited from Creating Communities programs. For example the Life Skills Through The Arts track includes an eight-week program for parents residing at Sarahs House. Located in Anne Arundel County, Sarahs House is a supportive housing program offering emergency shelter rooms and transitional apartments for families that are homeless. The typical family consists of a mother and two children.  More than 55 percent of the residents served annually are children. In FY2010-2011, over 325 children lived at Sarahs House. Poetry, music, drawing, and storytelling, are just a few of the means used to develop life skills and encourage learning.

Eastern Shore Land Conservancy Inc	http://www.eslc.org		EIN 52-1711989	114 S Washington St Ste 101	Easton	MD	21601	USA	Environment, Land Resources Conservation	The mission of the Eastern Shore Land Conservancy (ESLC) is to sustain the Eastern Shore's rich landscapes through strategic land conservation and sound land use planning. When Eastern Shore Land Conservancy was founded in 1990, the founding Directors shared a fervent dedication to the future of this matchless association of land, rivers, resources, and community called the Eastern Shore. And they shared a common concern that sprawling development patterns typical of the western shore of the Chesapeake Bay and many other areas of the Mid-Atlantic region was increasingly eroding these special attributes of the Eastern Shore.  Even in the face of staggering development trends of the past few years, it is extraordinary how unfaltering the Board of Directors has remained to achieving that end.

By providing yearly gym memberships and state of the art gym equipment to these men and women, CAL is giving them a release from the stress of their physical and mental injuries, a place to connect with their mind and body, a way to better their lives and that of their families, and the financial help that so many wounded veterans need.   With the development of our MAPS Program (Motivation Accountability and Peer Support), Veterans who have received grants through CAL are put into squads headed by a civilian or veteran volunteer leader where they are tracked, held accountable for their health, given motivational support, and are able to heal vet to vet within their squad.  Catch A Lift Fund currently has over 2,500 Veterans in the program, 350+ of which are awaiting their memberships or gym equipment to be purchased by Catch A Lift so that they may begin their fitness regimen. With over 200 applications coming in each month, and most of our referrals coming from the VA and Caregiver outreach groups, the need for Catch A Lift is clear.  90% of all donations to CAL go directly to the Veteran fitness programs.

DC Metro area, primarily Montgomery County, MD	Bethesda green serves as a community hub catalyzing businesses, government, and residents in growing a more sustainable local economy. Our work focuses on three pillars: educating the community about sustainability, facilitating green solutions, and housing a next-generation green business incubator. Employment creation has increased over 50% from 2012 to 2013 (35 jobs); and remained high in 2014 with at least 29 fte based only on companies in the incubator at the end of the year. Bundled revenues for the same companies neared $1. 8 million. Funds raised annually by companies fluctuated between $600,000 to as high as $1. 3 million. A key role of the incubator program is to accelerate business development into success or failure. Seven companies left the incubator: three are successfully in business, one has been sold, and three others have ceased operations. Two new companies have come in the incubator. Many strengthening and revival activities have taken place to attract additional growth minded entrepreneurs. Bethesda green facilitates green solutions. The most notable impact are the logo marked sponsored recycling bins around bethesda. In 2014, staff worked with about a dozen restaurants to educate them about green practices. Major impacts lie into the synergy of our pillars with incubator companies and their impact; an example being air lawn who is rethinking landscaping care.

It also helps people of different generations understand, learn from and care for one another.  JCA accomplishes this through a myriad of community-based programs built upon vibrant programmatic partnerships with funders, fellow charities and local communities; and by providing opportunities for volunteers to make the National Capital Area a great place to age.   Although our Jewish heritage and values guide our vision and work, JCA is a recognized leader in meeting the needs of seniors and caregivers regardless of their religious beliefs.	JCA represents something different to each and every man and woman we proudly serve. To the isolated senior with no means of getting around, we are a smiling ElderBus driver who cheerfully helps with canes, walkers and wheelchairs and even carries packages with a smile. To the concerned family member suddenly faced with overwhelming health or home care issues, we are the confident voice of an information specialist who understands precisely the services needed to care for a beloved parent or spouse and can access our unique, comprehensive database to find needed resources close to home. For the senior who is frail or suffering from Alzheimers disease or other challenges, we are a safe and caring place that provides dignified assistance at adult day centers that are second to none. To the older jobseeker, we are a friend, advocate, teacher and guide.  JCA is all of this and so much more!  We are vibrant intergenerational programs that build bridges and shatter stereotypes. We are volunteer-run computer training programs that have graduated 11,000 adults since 1992. We are different faces in various places, but united in our mission of helping local seniors experience the positive side of aging while making the National Capital Area a great place to age. Last year, because of generous friends like you, JCA served 31,000 older people of all faiths, ethnicities and walks of life. We helped them avoid isolation and live independently.

Permanence outcomes were very strong given the reality that the average age of children entering foster care is raising to mid teens corresponding with greater difficulty of obtaining permanency. 1 adoptions by foster parents 3 custody and guardianship 9 reunifications with birth families 3 aged out successfully with plans to live with relatives6. Mpp did very well with maintenance of educational participation. Education is one of the greatest indicators of future success and foster children nationally lag significantly behind their peers not in fostercare. 45 school aged children enrolled in school 10 graduated high school 10 entered college7. Life skills services are fundamental to the success of foster children separated from the matrix of biological family modeling and support. Mpp is working consistently with both individuals and groups of foster teens 14 yrs+ to supportacquisition of critical life skills. Mpp has 35 youth between 14 and 20 years old. (9) nine youth received individual life skills programming focused on college entry including school application, fafsa, and life/career planning; (7) six youth received individual work in finding part-time employment and one youth is receiving support in aging out of foster care critical life skills groups for a total of 45 hours for the over14 years mpp foster youth. The numbers reflect greater disturbance behavioral and emotional among this group resulting in lowered ability to do group programing of this kind. 8. Mpp continues tfc to focus on placement stability as the path to permanency for current high intensity older youth with serious behavioral, psychiatric, educational and social disorders. 9 foster parents participated in this reporting period. The results are positive continuing to suggest that foster parents can stabilize the most difficult older youth supporting their long term success. Mpp is seeking research assistance in gathering data to support our practice and give additional information regarding the success factors. 9. Mpp tfc continued to integrate trauma informed practice into agency services. 52 hours of training in trauma treatment was provided to staff and 25 hours provided to foster parents. Trauma informed content is fully integrated into the recruitment and pre-service training of foster parents and student interns. The martin pollak project (mpp) treatment fostercare program has purposefully initiated the process of full integration and implementation of the trauma informed practice model. Mpp ceo initiated agency staff orientation and training employing the nctsn child welfare trauma training toolkit. Executive staff, program management, and program staff have all been included. Trauma facts, knowledge and awareness has been fully integrated into foster parent recruitment and training. Ongoing in-service staff training has made the shift from a primary focus on child maltreatment to assessment and treatment of trauma. Given the well documented shift in maryland to the presence of older children exhibiting more substantial emotional and behavioral disturbances in foster care trauma informed practice has been critical to effective and appropriate foster care service delivery in mpp programsmpp is directly involved in initiation and implementation of innovative collaborative service development capability in communities. This work is in concert with maryland title iv-e waiver child welfare policies and best practices specifying collaboration, family centered and community based service delivery. Since july 2014 the mpp ceo has served as the president of the board of the maryland association of resources for families and youth (marfy) and has been integral to the commitment to transformation of child welfare through the activities of the marfy systems redesign committee. This committee attracted the involvement of casey family programs foundation of seattle washington. Subsequently the baltimore collaborative including mpp and three other metro maryland child and family serving agencies were designated as a model demonstration project by the casey family programs foundation in their communities of hope national initiative. The baltimore collaborative with casey foundation technical and financial support is incubating innovative approaches to community activation aimed at bringing together city and state child welfare institutions, community people and professionals to develop effective sustainable services in response to data supported expressed community needs. Mpp treatment fostercare (tfc) and independent living (ilp) programs have attained fully compliant with performance based contracts (pbc). The mpp ilp program has been referred to as a model program by department of human resources office of licensing & monitoring auditor. Mpp is not funded for follow up monitoring of youth that graduate from our program at age 21 but informal after graduation contacts with youth have been gratifying. They come to the office to say hello and report they are stable and productive pursuing life plans developed in collaboration with program staff. Both mpp programs have remained in good standing posting positive outcomes on quarterly evaluation by dhr pbc contract monitors. The collaborative initiatives between mpp and other tfc agencies continue with a monthly network meeting between 6 agencies. During this reporting period network formation to apply for a federal grant, sharing of staff training resources, collaborative mobilization of community groups, professional and lay people, to support community ownership of a trauma lens to support restorative and healing activity in the baltimore metro region. A concrete result of this work has been the baltimore healing collaborative. This collaborative has monthly meeting and seeks ways to create collaborations that could employ the trauma lens to improve the quality of relationships, collaboration and unique community responses to poverty, homelessness and violence. Youth aging out of foster care are over represented in these troubling statistics. Current discussions are focused on formation of enhanced capacity alliances with the capability to provide a continuum of services short of outright mergers. This collaboration is critical as the number of children in foster care in maryland continues to drop precipitously. New and innovative approaches to stacking capacity to serve fewer but more disturbed children in the system achieving quality of service, results as well as necessary economies is the requirement for sustainability. Once again mpp collaborated with gallery church of patterson park a faith-based latino group, hopesprings baltimore and university of maryland department of virology to provide hiv education and screening day in the mpp building. Mpp is expanding its relationship with morgan state university msw social work program.

Yai staff worked very hard to support these youth with the schools to make sure youth met graduation requirements. - one of our youth who aged out in january 2014 came to yai shortly after he turned 18 and struggled to finish high school. He was very anxious and non-trusting. At the time of age-out, this young man received his diploma, was working full time, was working on getting his driver's license, and was able to secure an apartment that he shared with his long-term girlfriend. - another youth aged out, struggled with academics. She graduated high school and tried college, cna programs, and various other vocational programs. She was not able to obtain any certifications, but this youth maintained a job the entire length of her time in the yai program, with zero times of unemployment. She was working two jobs at some points, and aged out to her own apartment with a comfortable amount of savings. - during the fall 2013 and spring 2014, 28 youth received direct 1:1 services from yai independent living associates to: complete their financial aid (fafsa) applications, identify a major, register for college classes, receive the tuition waiver, sign up for etv (education training vouchers for youth in foster care) and make decisions that allowed them to afford their books and obtain needed computers. - our youth are working many jobs from human resources internships, to certified nursing assistants, to cashiers, to security guards, to various restaurant positions, to college work-study, to full time hospital and state career track positions. - supported youth regularly and individually take part in our once monthly planned activities (water taxi tours of the city, attending the maryland state fair, poetry contest, halloween costume & pumpkin carving contests, take a friend to dinner, movie gift cards for self & a friend/family member of choice, cooking/baking contests) while offering ongoing ymca memberships to each youth. - program continues to have a prioritized relationship with property owners and management of the complex where we lease 28 apartments of their total 150 units. This relationship has been instrumental in providing timely services and safe, stable living arrangements for the youth we serve. In addition, the community has come to accept our youth as reasonable, friendly tenants and neighbors. - program has resolved prior charges for youth entering our program with open court cases based on incidents in their family homes or prior placements.

Baltimore, and urban alliance. - because we continue to offer one bedroom supported apartments to youth ages 16-21, the young adult's initiative independent living program has been highly successfully in serving youth with alternative life styles, glbtq youth and youth whose mental health issues have in the past affected their ability to maintain a stable living environment. Each youth's unique needs, special dreams, heartfelt desires, personal struggles, and meaningful, life-supporting results are our everyday business. Mpp's independent living program is staffed by a vested and diverse non-hierarchal team of energetic, highly motivated, authoritative professionals who work individually with every youth in the program. We are old and young, male and female, social workers and multi-disciplinary. We are real. There is an authoritative rather than authoritarian stance.

Pn is a one-on-one tutoring and mentoring program for homeless and low-income children. The program is largely donation funded and is almost totally volunteer-staffed (with only two mpp full time staff employees). The programs mission is to facilitate educational achievement and social support for homeless, at-risk and foster children in grades k through 12, living in some of dcs underserved neighborhoods. Currently, the program does not serve foster children. However, it has collaborated with area shelters and schools to draw in homeless and at-risk children. The program is unique and effective as it engages families along with the children served and exemplifies the precepts of learning community to achieve long lasting results for children and adolescents. Students: - project northstar served 65 students in fy 2014, a 38% increase in registration compared to the previous year. This also marks the fifth year in a row the program saw more than a 20% increase in student population. - 100% of returning students graduated to the next grade level. - approximately 2/3 of students come from homes where english is the second language. - the average project northstar family of four makes $25,000 per year. Volunteers: - project northstar had 89 full time volunteers (attending every session), substitute volunteers (attending sessions when available) and interns throughout fy 2014. - a significant percent of volunteers who joined in fy 2014 came from existing volunteer referrals. - project northstar continually has a waiting list of volunteers and once a tutor begins, they typically spend the first 3-4 weeks of their time in the program as substitutes until they are paired with a new student. - project northstar volunteers come from a variety of backgrounds and professional fields including; legal work (20% of volunteers), medical professionals (7% of volunteers), federal employees (20% of volunteers), congressional staff (17% of volunteers), nonprofit employees (23 % of volunteers), college and high school instructors (8% of volunteers) other - including scientists, event planners and athletic instructors (5 % of volunteers). Tutoring program: - during fy14 project northstar continued to make math and reading a significant priority during tutoring sessions, and provided weekly targeted materials to enable student/tutor pairs to focus on each subject. - in june, 2014 project northstar prepared for our first ever summer camp. Participating students attended testing sessions to determine specific areas each student needed to focus on during the six week camp. - during fy 2014, tutors of students in grades 10 and 11 made sat preparation a priority during weekly sessions. Project northstar provided a number of test prep materials including practice tests, study books and flash cards. Northstar also held a separate practice test session for students to familiarize themselves with the testing format. Because of all of these efforts, participating northstar students raised their sat scores by an average of 100 points by the end of the year. - northstar students and volunteers spent approximately 5,000 tutoring hours together in fy 2014. Fundraising: - raised $40,000 or 65% of fy14 annual budget through grant money and individual donors. - in kind donations in fy14 included free rental space for our weekly tutoring programs, meals for both the summer party and holiday event, and a number of office and school supplies for tutoring sessions. Special events:- the project northstar holiday party was a huge success. More than 175 volunteers, students and family members joined together for a meal provided by bertuccis. A local lobbying firm also gave approximately $5,000 in gifts for students to open during the party.   regular or community foster care (rfc)the community foster care program is small and comprises of children that allows traditional foster care children who are siblings of treatment foster care children to remain in treatment homes while permanency is sought. Permanency of siblings relationships is the sole and totally justifiable reason to maintain the program. Children forced to be in foster care have lost their parents and everything familiar. These children gain uniquely valuable support to their adoptive functioning from the presence of siblings living in the same foster home.

Further illustrating brightfocus's impact, a third-party roster of papers that considered milestones in alzheimer's disease lists 19 brightfocus-supported papers, six percent of the total recognized. Brightfocus continues its partnership with the academic journal "molecular neurodegeneration" as the official journal of the brightfocus foundation. The journal publishes technical papers related to neurodegeneration in the three disease areas.

In addition to supporting cutting-edge research, alzheimer's disease research provides excellent resources on detecting, treating, and living with the disease. Alzheimer's disease ranks as at least the sixth leading cause of death in the united states, yet it is the only cause of death among the top 10 in america without a way to prevent, cure, or even slow its progression. It is an irreversible degeneration of the brain that causes disruptions in memory, cognition, personality, and other functions and inevitably leads to death. More than 5 million americans aged 65 and older are thought to have alzheimer's disease today, and that number is expected to triple in the next 40 years.   macular degeneration research (mdr), a program of brightfocus, has awarded nearly $18. 5 million to scientists studying the disease. The latest research is focused on novel treatments for the disease, understanding its causes and progression, drug therapies, and new screening techniques.

In addition to supporting cutting-edge research, macular degeneration research provides excellent resources on detecting, treating, and living with this disease. Age-related macular degeneration is a leading cause of vision loss in the united states. It destroys the macula, the part of the eye that provides sharp, central vision needed for seeing objects clearly. The most common eye condition in people age 60 and older, it can lead to vision loss in one or both eyes, making it difficult to recognize faces, drive a car, or read.   brightfocus's national glaucoma research (ngr) program has awarded more than $26. 7 million worldwide for the study of glaucoma. Ngr-supported research has been focused on the eye-brain connection, the mechanisms for pressure buildup in the eye, preventing damage to the optic nerve, and understanding the role genes play in order to develop early glaucoma screening and targeted treatments. Ngr grants are available to glaucoma researchers worldwide. Ngr places special emphasis on encouraging applications from young scientists and those with cutting-edge ideas. Annual grant applications are peer-reviewed, and recipient selections are based on scientific merit. During the fiscal year ending march 31, 2015, ngr awarded $1,249,616 for 13 new projects that range from calculating individual risk for glaucoma to real-time monitoring and control of pressure in the eye, a significant risk factor for glaucoma. In addition, the ngr program launched a $1,200,000 investigation into the suitability of already existing drugs for potential ability to repair or enhance vision in glaucoma patients. Additional details about specific projects are included in schedules f & i. Ngr-funded research was recognized by the media this year, including an ngr-supported strategy to improving imaging and diagnosis of glaucoma. More details are available in the news updates section of the brightfocus. Org website. In addition to supporting cutting-edge research, national glaucoma research provides excellent resources on detecting, treating, and living with the disease. Glaucoma is a group of diseases that damage the eye's optic nerve and can result in vision loss and permanent blindness. More than 3 million americans age 40 and older have glaucoma. More than 60 million people in the world have the disease, and that number is expected to increase by as much as 20 million by 2020. With early detection and treatment, glaucoma often can be managed to protect eyes from more serious vision loss, but it is estimated that only half of the people living with glaucoma are aware that they have the disease.

So far, more than 25,000 articles and 6,000 photographs and maps have been integrated into the site. The library has 13 wings: history, women, the holocaust, travel, israel & the states, maps, politics, biography, israel, religion, judaic treasures of the library of congress, vital statistics and reference. Each of these has numerous subcategories. Under religion, for example, we have the complete text of the tanakh, information on jewish holidays and material on relations between jews and christians and muslims. The politics wing includes collections on u. S. -israel relations, the united nations and the peace process. The reference section has bibliographies of more than 1,000 books and 1,000 web sites, and a glossary of more than 1,000 words and a time-line for the history of judaism. The library also includes the virtual israel experience, an educational tool and virtual tour of israel designed especially for students going on birthright and other trips to israel. Using virtual israel as a model, we are now creating a virtual jewish history tour that allows jewish students and other internet users to "visit" jewish communities around the world to learn about their history and culture. The goals are to educate visitors about jewish heritage, the development of judaism, the changing nature of jewish communities and the connection between the jewish past and present. Much of the information in the library cannot be found anywhere else in the world, such as material on joint u. S. -israel projects, cooperation between israel and the individual states and the treatment of americans during the holocaust. We received permission from the library of congress to put its judaic and hebraic treasures on our site. We have also received permission to use material from the american jewish historical society, anti-defamation league, the simon wiesenthal center, the israeli foreign ministry and prime minister's office, rabbi joseph telushkin (author of "jewish literacy") and dozens of other sources. One of our goals is to offer visitors a single source for information so they dont need to search thousands of other "jewish" web sites.   myths and factsmyths & facts is a book published and sold by the american-israeli cooperative enterprise to help teach readers about the arab-israeli conflict. It clarifies the conflict in a concise and helpful way. The book is meant to promote knowledge on the conflict and the issues today.
