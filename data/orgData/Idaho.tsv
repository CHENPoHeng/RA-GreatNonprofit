Domestic violence is an epidemic in our society and a public health and safety concern. A child's exposure to domestic abuse is the strongest risk factor for transmitting violent behavior from one generation to the next.  Awareness is the first step in enacting change and the Man Up Crusade is dedicated to breaking the cycle of violence. The program was launched in 2012 by bringing a "purple" night to professional rodeo events. Across the nation the color purple and the purple ribbon has been adopted to show support for victims and advocates to honor those who have lost their lives at the hands of someone they once loved. Our goal is to make "purple" recognized for domestic violence in a way that pink is recognized for breast cancer. In 2014 the Crusade is contracted with multiple rodeo's covering six western states.

Laptops to Lesotho Inc.	http://www.laptopstolesotho.org	208-574-2990	EIN 27-1239343	55 Eagle Creek Rd	Wayan	ID	83285	USA	Economic Development, Education, Educational Services, International, International Relief, Microfinance, Rural Economic Development	Our mission is to break the vicious cycle of illiteracy, poverty, and disease that is leading to early death in Lesotho by working through a local, grassroots, community-based organization to high quality education and job skills for the children in rural Lesotho.  To do this, we provide special children's laptop computers and access to the internet.   Thses laptops, and the access to information they provide, are an avenue for growth and improvement in the students' lives and in the community as a whole. We believe that truly successful solutions to the multitude of problems facing the people of Lesotho will come only when the Basotho devise and embrace solutions as their own. The best way to prepare them for that is through education and access to information, and the best time to reach them is when they are young.  Our primary goal is to give each and every child in the community their very own laptop. With child-ownership, the laptops can be used both in the structured environment of the classroom and by the children on their own, away from school, for unstructured learning and discovery at their own pace. We use refurbished XO laptops by the One Laptop Per Child organization, unique notebook-sized computers designed specifically for children in less developed countries. The laptops are a fun way to expand on the basic classroom skills of reading, writing, and math. They also help develop more advanced skills such as logic, conceptualization, and problem-solving. The operating system can be changed to a more advanced interface as the students skills progress.  Our secondary goal is to make this completely a community-run program. This idea was started by people in the community, and we serve merely as facilitators to help them achieve their goal. To this end, our team includes three staff members from the school, two in prominent leadership roles. We work with the community throughout the entire process to ensure their continued, long-term participation. We mentor and train selected individuals in community organization. This year, we will be teaching them fundraising and grant-writing, so that eventually they take over and run this project on their own.	In 2008, Andrew Dernovsek, then a Peace Corp Volunteer in Ketane, started teaching computer skills to his colleagues, students, and members of the community on his own computer. The community was so enthusiastic about the idea that they raised money to buy a second, used computer, and they set up a donated solar power system to run them. The school then used its surplus power to charge cell phones for a fee to earn money to purchase a printer/scanner/copier. A new building to house the school was started with labor and supplies donated by the community. Thus started the Ketane Computer School.   In June 2009, the Balcomb family donated two childrens laptops, unique computers designed by One Laptop Per Child, to Nohana Primary School, immediately adjacent to the Ketane Computer School. In 2010, 48 more of these laptops were delivered to the school.  A gas generator-powered electrical system was installed to charge and run the laptops, and a network server was set up.  All the teachers and the principal at Nohana Primary participated in three weeks of intensive training on the computers. They now run the computer school and also teach their primary school students using the computers in the classroom. Even with just 50 computers so far for over nearly 400 students, they have already seen improvement in the students language skills, increased enthusiasm for learning, near perfect attendance, and better behavior.  They now receive strong support from parents, who even permit their children to attend during the harvest when they are needed in the fields.   The school asked if there was a way to get more of the special kids laptops, and that request gave birth to this project. In the following months, founders Andrew Dernovsek and Janissa Balcomb recruited  seven more team members and developed goals and objectives with an eye toward laying a strong foundation for what will hopefully be a long-term, community-run project.  They set up a website and started a blog to serve as a step-by-step record of our work.   School officials and the Ketane local council committed to supply labor, services, and some of the materials. This contribution is a huge sacrifice because most of the people live at or near the subsistence level. The school held a contest for the students to name the project and design a logo.   We have raised over $10,00 in donations and pledges. We have acquired 50 used laptops. We partnered with several organizations who are providing support and/or funding, including BLOOM Africa, Friends of Lesotho, Peace Corps/Lesotho, School Technology Innovation Center, Family Literacy Lesotho, and Foundation for International Partnership Exchange (FIPE). FIPE agreed to fund a professional exchange to bring one of our Basotho team members to the U.S. to observe and train with teachers in Colorado.   In November 2010, we will be (1) setting up the network and internet infrastructure  solar power system (2) distributing 53 laptops to 6th grade students, teachers, and a school computer lab (3) training teachers and working to incorporate the laptop activities into the existing curriculm, and (4) working with the local community.  Our organization has earned the GuideStar.org Exchange Seal transparency and proactive information disclosure.	Primary school-age children in Ketane, Lesotho  Lesotho is a mountainous kingdom completely surrounded by South Africa. It is one of the poorest nations in the world. The terrain is rugged, there are few roads, and many villages are isolated and only accessible by foot or horseback. The mountain soils are poor, and only about 10% of the land is arable. Winters are harsh with snow and frequent sub-freezing temperatures.  Lesotho has the third highest rate of HIV/AIDS and the fourth highest rate of drug-resistant TB in the world, resulting in an average life expectancy of just 36 years. The twin epidemics have had devastating effects on family structure, making life extraordinarily challenging for Lesothos children. A large number of todays children have lost one or both parents. Some orphans are raised by grandparents, while others live in homes with a child as the head of the house.  Primary education is free in Lesotho, but because of responsibilities at home, some children are unable to attend school. Secondary education is not free, and many students cannot afford it.  Ketane is a small, very remote community in the Mohales Hoek District of southwestern Lesotho. The primary source of income is cattle ranching and raising sheep and goats for wool. There are two chiefs and a local council who govern the area a well as an active widows association called Diamonds of Ketane.  Nohana Primary School currently has 370 students in grades 1-7 and nine teachers. The teachers English ranges from conversant to fluent, and the sixth and seventh grade students are sufficiently fluent in English to be able to use existing computers without translation of the interface into Sesotho.	In 2010, 25 5th, 6th, and 7th grade students were designated as student leaders and received extra training with the laptops. Nine teachers and a principal received extensive computer training.  All the primary school students will have access to the computers at school and the upper grade students are permitted to take them home.  Parents and guardians have benefitted by improved behavior of their children at home.

This is accomplished by restoring species in jeopardy, conserving habitat, educating students, training conservationists, providing factual information to the public, and accomplishing scientific investigations.  We have assisted on conservation projects in more than 40 countries. The organization employs the inter-disciplinary principles of conservation biology.  We strongly believe in cooperative efforts involving individuals, organizations, corporations, and government, a belief that has been the cornerstone of the program to restore the Peregrine Falcon.  We are a results-oriented organization that works locally, nationally, and internationally.  Preserving visible, charismatic, far-ranging species results in many benefits.  By focusing on birds and their ecological requirements, and providing sufficient protection to sustain viable populations, we are using birds to provide an umbrella of protection for the diversity of life and the entire ecosystem associated with them.					Species restoration. California condor - the captive breeding facility in boise, idaho produces california condors for release to the wild to establish self-sustaining populations of this rare species. By 1982, just 22 california condors remained on earth. Today there are approximately 425 individual birds, more than half of them flying free in the wild. This year the 16 pairs held by the peregrine fund produced 12 fertile eggs. Nine hatched in boise and the rest were sent to other facilities. Thirteen captive-bred condors were transferred to the arizona vermilion cliffs site for release to the wild and that population now includes 77 individuals. Cooperative programs with state agencies and hunting groups were expanded to encourage the use of lead-free ammunition in condor country. Each year we attempt to trap every condor to be tested and, if necessary, treated for lead poisoning or any other maladies discovered. Raptor propagation. In 2014 we began a captive population of eurasian sparrowhawks accipiter nisus to maintain personnel competency in captive propagation techniques, but more so to obtain skills and knowledge in producing accipiters in captivity which could be applied to future conservation efforts within this genus. Currently the peregrine fund's world center for birds of prey houses 7 eurasian sparrowhawks (3 breeding pairs and one lone male). The sparrowhawk is of least concern as far as conservation status, however, the genus accipiter has been produced minimally in captivity when compared to other species of raptors, so developing and publishing techniques will no doubt benefit any future species of concern. We also continue to maintain a captive breeding population of taita falcons falco fasciinucha to maintain a genetically diverse captive population for potential future conservation needs of this near-threatened species. Currently in the u. S. , all taita falcons are of the same genetic strain from a handful of falcons brought to the u. S. From africa in the 1980's. We are currently working with cooperators to obtain more individuals from africa to diversify our captive population. The peregrine fund currently houses 5 taita falcons (2 breeding pairs and 1 lone male).   conservation programs - since founding in 1970, over 100 raptor species in at least 66 countries have benefitted from field research and hands-on recovery efforts by the organization. This year the peregrine fund was involved in raptor research, graduate studies, and conservation projects in 18 countries on four continents. Training and support were provided to 24 students conducting graduate thesis research projects and doctoral and master's studies, all in their native countries; since beginning, 27 students have graduated with phd degrees and 76 with msc degrees. This year, eight pairs of previously released young of the critically endangered ridgway's hawk formed territories and four pairs bred successfully in the wild in the dominican republic in an experimental assisted dispersal project, and a record 31 young were released to help establish a new population. Five orange-breasted falcon chicks, hatched in captivity, were released into the wild in belize, and surveys were conducted for nesting falcons in belize and guatemala. Captive-bred and wild-hatched harpy eagles were tracked and observed in the forests of darien, panama using radio telemetry, and public educational campaigns were conducted to reduce shooting of this threatened species. Eight graduate students were supported in argentina, brazil, chile, bolivia and ecuador, and two graduated with phd degrees and one with an msc degree. Four students conducted field studies for graduate or post-graduate degrees benefitting vulture conservation in kenya and understanding of eleonora's falcon migration. In madagascar, work to set aside globally significant wetlands and forests was rewarded in 2015 with the declaration of permanent protection for three community-based conservation areas, where we monitor rare and endangered raptor species, assist captive breeding of critically endangered species, support eight graduate students' studies, and work with local communities to develop new income sources while protecting traditional customs and practices. Financial, scientific and technical support was given to the philippine eagle foundation for work including captive breeding and release of philippine eagles, public education, conservation of critical habitat, and telemetry studies on wild eagles. Annual breeding population surveys of critically endangered gyps vultures were completed in india that revealed stabilizing populations after the catastrophic declines recorded due to the use of veterinary diclofenac in livestock. Key presentations were given to the first andean condor regional workshop in peru and 10th neotropical ornithological congress in brazil, as well as the annual meeting of the raptor research foundation, wilson ornithological society and the american ornithologists union, among others. The american kestrel partnership was expanded to understand the species' decline on a continental scale. The second season of study to understand how the gyrfalcon responds to impacts of climate change was completed in alaska. Studies on the effects of wind turbines on raptor mortality, and golden eagle distributions were conducted, and a symposium on the effects of wind power on raptors was held in sacramento, ca. Aplomado falcon surveys found 33 pairs in south texas and a total of 50 young were produced.   education / information - the education program at the peregrine fund's world center for birds of prey provides cultural and educational opportunities to the greater treasure valley, idaho, and beyond. With a growing population, complicated land use patterns, and the need to increase the public's awareness of natural systems, we provide information for students and individuals to make wise decisions and have a positive impact on our environment. In fy2015 we hosted 35,399 visitors at our interpretive center. We also continued our school-endorsed programs which are geared to k-12 students in idaho. These programs have been designed by educators and biologists to meet stem standards and provide valuable scientific content for visiting students and teachers. In 2015 we reached 5,584 students through a combination of on-and-off site programming. Calendars, annual reports, news releases, brochures and other materials are updated annually and made available to the public. Photographers are encouraged to participate in conservation by entering the peregrine fund's internationally-recognized photo competition, raptors at risk. The peregrine fund's online audience logged about 750,000 page views of our webcams trained on peregrine falcons and american kestrels that show them courting, nesting, and raising young each spring. Year-round, viewers access explore raptors on-line, a user-friendly guide for all ages to identify and learn about raptor species. For users seeking more technical information, our on-line global raptor information network presents academic species accounts and bibliographies of published works on 333 raptor species. Journal articles from the peregrine fund's library may be requested; this year staff supplied 640 articles to researchers worldwide free of charge. Visitors to the archives of falconry learn about the role of falconers in raptor conservation and habitat protection. The website provides tools to join, subscribe to e-newsletters, shop for raptor-related merchandise, and track donations.

Land acquisition/protection - the palouse land trust works with willing landowners to protect working lands, open space, and wildlife habitat in north-central idaho and eastern washington. The primary tool the land trust uses to accomplish this is a voluntary conservation agreement called a conservation easement. Since 1995, the land trust and local families have used conservation easements to protect threatened farmland, wildlife habitat and corridors, rare and endangered plants and habitats, and areas for the public to recreate and enjoy nature.   land stewardship - staff and board members monitor all palouse land trust conservation easements and other projects encompassing 3,500 acres to ensure compliance with individual easement restrictions/language and to note any changes in the property. All monitoring data, such as photo points, are reported and entered into the permanent record. The land trusts fee simple land is also monitored. Staff and board members also organize volunteer work for pruning and improvements to the trails and habitat.   outreach - the palouse land trust strives to reach new audiences and constituents to describe how voluntary conservation easements can be used to protect private lands. This includes focusing on outreach to soil and water conservation districts within its service area (north-central idaho and eastern washington), and also focused on outreach to agricultural producers. As part of this, the land trust brings speakers in to a variety of conferences attended by district staff and agricultural producers, including the idaho cattle association annual meeting, the north idaho grazing conference, and a division meeting of local soil and water conservation districts.

Met through the Youth and Veterans Programs, this mission guides WITH in teaching participants life skills to develop and sustain physically and emotionally healthy lifestyles.	Recent accomplishments of the program include the amount of success that we are observing through the veterans who have been through our program.  For example, in 2015 WITH Foundation launched a six-month pilot program which enrolled seven veterans. At the start of the program, four of the seven veterans were homeless and living on the streets, and all seven were unemployed. After six months in the program, all of the participants were in a stable living environment and reported more self-confidence as well as more physical and mental stability than they experienced prior to entering the program. Additionally, six of the seven veterans are now employed (the seventh one is retired and not looking for employment).
