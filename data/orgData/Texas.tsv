Too old for the instant community of a childrens hospital, theyre still too young to be a part of the over-50 community that overwhelmingly populates adult cancer wards. Because young adults with cancer are a relatively small group, the difficulty of finding peer support is increased exponentially, forcing many to deal in isolation with issues specific to this age and stage of life: dating with cancer, disclosure to a potential employer, long-term insurance issues, moving back home, loss of fertility, or having to quit school or a newly-launched career.Planet Cancer exists so that no young adult will have to endure such isolation. In addition, we work to raise awareness in the medical community about young adults as a distinct group with distinct needs. A greater focus on young adults, their cancers, their issues (including lack of insurance and low participation in clinical trials) and their medical needs will hopefully lead to improvement in survival rates, which have not increased one iota for this age group in 30 years.	18-40 year old cancer patients and survivors.	national	Planet cancer has provided a critical community of peer support and advocacy for young adults with cancer.

With technology rapidly changing and advancing, a digital divide grows between individuals with understanding and access to technology and individuals without.  At the same time the obsolescence of personal computers has fallen to just two years.  75% of computers collect in homes, are stockpiled in warehouses, or end up in landfills.  Comp-U-Dopt, Inc. strives to address both of these issues through computer refurbishing and the computer "adoption" program.  Donated, refurbished computers not only help children develop increasingly necessary technology skills, they also benefit society and the environment by providing another generation of use for serviceable computers.			Computer adoption - this program awards refurbished computers to children who complete an essay and submit a signed parental release form. Families are then invited to an adoption session scheduled at their school on a pre-scheduled saturday morning. At the session, children learn how to use and care for their computers and are introduced the educational software included on the computers.   after school program - the after-school program, presented with the boys and girls club of greater houston, provides a fun and safe place for students to be after school.

Love Never Fails International Inc	http://www.LNFI.org	817-831-8877	EIN 06-1735294	5617 Diamond Oaks Dr. South	Fort Worth	TX	76117	USA	Education, Educational Services	Love Never Fails International, Inc. (LNFI) is a non-profit organization that exists to glorify God by providing a hand up, not a hand out to at-risk and impoverished children.   The primary work of Love Never Fails International (LNFI) is after school mentoring programs known as Love Never Fails After-School (LNFAS). These programs allow elementary and middle school children a safe place to spend their afternoon school hours free of cost for their families. Currently, LNFI operates after school programs in three Fort Worth ISD (FWISD) elementary schools and one middle school. LNFAS serves approximately 60 at-risk children at each site. In order to provide students with the most individualized attention possible, they are divided into small groups of 10-12 students for their daily activities. LNF After-School programs operate four days a week; Monday through Thursday from 3:00 pm to 6:00 pm at their elementary school sites; Monday through Thursday from 8:00 am to 9:00 am and 4:30 to 6:30 pm at their middle school site.	At-risk and impoverished children, ages 8 - 16.			What is the impact of LNF!? Child poverty costs the nation nearly $500 billion every year. We realize that the statistics are daunting, but an investment in our programs is the start of ending the cycle of poverty in America. No matter what our children may be facing, they are the leaders of tomorrow and their potentials are greater than their circumstances. The 2014-2015 was an incredible year, full of BIG changes for all of our programs. We served over 160 children as a first-year Full-Provider for Fort Worth ISD. The following results are calculated based on the number of children who attended the program at least 70% of the year:  	Student Attendance for both campuses was 86% this year  which translates to show that of all students served, 141 students came every day! 	LNFI Academic Assessment based on our curricula helped improve students scores in science, social studies, reading and math by an overall 13.4%! 	125 total teacher involvement hours 	537 total volunteer mentor hours  	Nearly 140 students improved in their conduct grades on their final report cards!  Most importantly we saw overwhelming changes in our children. We saw students transform into student body presidents, basketball captains and math-a-letes from angry, secluded and broken children.    LNF attests that the development of character is the ultimate measure of success of our programs. We use student assessments, mentor and staff reporting, school discipline records and teacher observations to analyze each childs behavior enhancement. We know that good conduct reduces high-risk behaviors that strengthen the individual, their school, family and community.   LNF will always have a strong focus on character building and mentoring, as this is key to fulfilling our mission: Love Never Fails International exists to glorify God by providing a hand up, not a hand out to at-risk and impoverished children through positive, caring relationships and educational support.

Teen Mania Ministries is one of the largest Christian youth organizations in America, reaching millions of young people and touching lives worldwide. Teen Mania reaches out to this generation, aspiring to cultivate future leaders that have Christian values, godly character that lead lives of integrity who will change the culture and the world through education, business, politics, missions, and entertainment. Teen Mania reaches the youth of today through eight very unique departments: Acquire the Fire, Global Expeditions, the Honor Academy, Center for Creative Media, the School of Worship, Extreme Camps, the Furnace and Center for Information Technology.  Teen Mania is not affiliated with a specific denomination; the organization works with local churches of various denominations as a para-church organization, while providing its programs and other resources for youth, parents and church leaders. As you prayerfully consider partnering with Teen Mania, thank you in advance for your willingness to make a difference in the lives of our future decision makers, work force, families, and leaders...the generation of today. We pray you will stand with us through prayer, action, and financial sponsorship. Together we are making an eternal difference.		North America, South America, Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, all around the world!	Acquire the Fire is a youth event held in stadiums within major cities throughout the US. These events are high-voltage, high-adrenaline gatherings where teens from across the United States and Canada are motivated and mobilized to take a stand for Christ in their own lives and communities. Acquire the Fire believes that todays youth are our future and that we must reach them for Christ now. Over 3,000,000 teenagers and young adults have been reached through these life-changing weekend events.   Global Expeditions is one of the largest short-term mission's agencies in the world. To date, 68,011 teens have traveled with Global Expeditions to some 79 countries in one-, two-, and four-week missions trips. 1,306,772 people have been brought to Christ as a result of their efforts. While in-country, teenagers provide love and care through building homes, hosting vacation Bible school, providing clean drinking water, clothing, school supplies, as well as various social issues like; working with ex-child soldiers and working with those previously rescued from sex slave trade, along with leading medical and dental relief trips.  The Honor Academy's mission is to build leaders of the next generation whose lives are defined by the pursuit of wisdom, vision, and discipline. The scope of the Honor Academy is extensive and includes classroom instruction, practical hands-on experience, and life-transforming events, all of which are designed to build strong character and leadership skills. Since its inception, the Honor Academy has influenced over 6,543 passionate young people who are challenging the boundaries of the world around them, both domestically and internationally through ministry, business, missions, politics and education. The Honor Academy has also recently established college partnerships that provide accreditation for the course work completed throughout the internship.  The Center for Creative Medias purpose is to train young people to be salt and light as future executives in the media industry. They do this through creating and producing broadcast TV events, live events, DVDs, curriculum, and music videos, all with the purpose of reaching their generation.   The School of Worship began as a second-year program for Honor Academy graduates and has since blossomed into one of the largest programs on campus. Through specific skills classes and intensive discipleship, the School of Worship empowers young musicians in their technical skills and grows their spiritual leadership so they can use their music for the glory of God.  Through Extreme Camps, Teen Mania offers a week-long camp that is designed to help youth groups genuinely discover God and live an extreme life for Him. Through the influence of dynamic praise and worship, today's hottest Christian bands, adrenaline-pumping activities, power-packed speakers, and the opportunity to build Godly relationships, Extreme Camps is being used as a catalyst to see the youth of this generation discover what Christianity is all about.   The Fire on the altar must be kept burning; it must not go out. ~ Leviticus 6:12. The Furnace is a 4 month prayer internship designed to cultivate a burning heart for Christ, a lifestyle of Godliness, and a vision to reach the world. Interns in the Furnace program explore the depths of Knowing God through prayer; cultivate their Passion for Jesus through dynamic teaching and saturate a life in Godliness through an atmosphere of discipleship. The interns learn about the Pursuit of God, existence and attributes of God, character development, the Spirit of worship, breakthrough prayer, the history of missions, fasting and prayer experiences, complete a global justice project and learn about the unreached people groups.  The Center for Information Technology is for individuals who are called to the technology field and want to use their ability to further the Kingdom of God. This two-year internship offers interns with expert training, certifications, and work experience required for a professional career as a Software Developer or a System Administrator. With a 1 to 5 instructor to intern ratio, the CIT far exceeds the amount of academic attention a student would receive at a typical community college or university. Daily classes, labs, one-on-one coaching and hands-on experience all combine to launch our students into a successful career in information technology with a deep foundation in Christ.	Ministry Summary Over the Years Teen Mania has grown and expanded in ways that are incomprehensible and still hard to believe even now. But we at Teen Mania Ministries know and acknowledge that the success and impact of this ministry are all a reality because of our God, who is able to do immeasurably more than all we can ask or imagine, according to His power that is at work within us Ephesians 3:20. And this is why we look back on these past 25 years with deep, overwhelming gratitude and look to the future with child-like wonder; we cannot wait to see what God will do next through this ministry.

So far, Chompers, Consuela, and Bonnie, Clyde and Levi have had pools built in their enclosures  and they love them! The summer heat can be very hard on the cats (especially our older cats) so providing cats with swimming pools as a means of cooling themselves off is essential. While the cats are provided with above ground pools every summer, we felt as if permanent, cemented, in-ground pools were a more viable alternative. Our volunteers and interns have been hard at work digging holes for the pools and then securing the pools in the holes with cement. While the building can be labor intensive, it is entirely worth it to see the cats enjoying the cool water and being able to stay cool in the Texas heat. By the end of this summer, we are hoping to have a completed in-ground swimming pool in each tiger enclosure.

San Antonio	Deriving inspiration & vitality through activity (diva) program provides exercise, nutrition and wellness classes to breast cancer patients and survivors in san antonio and bexar county. Research shows that women who exercise and follow a low-fat diet and adhere to their recommended hormonal or chemotherapy, have a reduction in breast cancer mortality by up to 50%. As of december 31, 2014, the diva program offered 30 classes a week at 5 different locations across san antonio. More than 900 women are on the diva roster.   many cancer patients in our community are without a reliable means of transportation thus making traveling to and from treatment appointments impossible. Additionally, the financial burden of a cancer diagnosis can be devastating. Thrivewell cancer foundation provides patients with financial assistance to help offset the costs associated with their medical care, as well as treatment related transportation. Our goal is to give patients the best possible chance of beating the disease while eliminating the added stressors that go hand-in-hand with cancer. During 2014, thrivewell cancer foundation's patient assistance program provided transportation services to 131 cancer patients and financial assistance to 159 cancer patients helping offset the costs associated with their treatment.   thrivewell cancer foundation funded two cutting-edge research grants in 2013. The title of the funded projects are as follows: microrna's: safe and potent therapeutic molecules for treating drug resistant breast cancers; exploring the role of crl4cdt2 in aggressive prostate cancer. During 2012, the foundation launched a special research project entitled the san antonio 1000 cancer genome project (sa1kcgp). The sa1kcgp provides whole genome sequencing on tumors from patients with the ten most common cancers in san antonio and makes the data obtained from the tumors available to doctors and researchers worldwide.

Our approach empowers donors, caregivers and children. It's transforming. It's measurable. It's proven. And it works miracles.	orphans reach their full potential	rural India	clean water, nutritious food, high-quality healthcare, and an excellent education for orphaned children - all in a stable, loving, nurturing home.  The Miracle Foundation model is a proven three-phase method that raises the standards and expectations of existing orphanages. We start by selecting orphanages with a genuine commitment to orphans and their education. Next, we help local orphanages help themselves by providing incremental funding to cover gaps in the quality of care. This involves working hand-in-hand with the orphanages during an incubation phase to provide paired funding, training and capacity building. We have codified measurement standards based on the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and actively work with orphanages to implement improvements. Once an orphanage maintains 90%+ goal achievement, they become a Miracle Foundation partner and can count on ongoing support. Using this approach helps any struggling orphanage measure success, guard against corruption and report real, tangible, lifesaving results.	The Miracle Foundation helps turn orphanages into functioning, loving homes where orphaned children can thrive.  Drawing on knowledge gained from over ten years of working with orphanages, we have codified measurement standards based on the 12 Rights of the Child. With this framework in place, we are able to identify and evaluate orphanages that share our philosophy, but struggle to properly care for the children they support due to insufficient resources. Our systematic approach helps us meticulously measure each of our orphanages on their success toward implementing each and every one of these childrens 12 basic rights.  In 2015, we fed, nurtured and educated 1,000 orphans, supported 16 orphanages in India and funded numerous college scholarships. We also continued our partnerships with Safe Water Network India, St. Stephens Hospital and Katha, bringing clean water, quality healthcare and tutors to each of our homes.  As part of our global mission, we acted as a voice to promote and advocate for orphans around the world. With platforms such as the United Nations, the World Economic Forum and UNICEF, we actively recommend that orphans be considered as equal citizens and become a part of the government and society. We work to develop tools to help orphanages to understand and meet global standards.  Because our model is based on best practices, measurable standards and training curriculum for caregivers, it is fully replicable and can be used in any part of the world.	1,000 orphans receive all of their rights

Funding is provided to MD Anderson Cancer Center as they apply comprehensive team science to improve treatment and clinical outcomes for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). This dual focus stems from recent studies that point to remarkable similarities in the underlying molecular events that cause these two rare, aggressive cancers.	NBCF has provided over 937,000 patient services since 2001 through their network of hospitals.  With rising healthcare costs, many uninsured or underinsured women cannot afford the cost of screening and diagnostic tests.  By providing free mammograms and breast care services to underserved women, NBCF will increase the early detection of breast cancer which will lead to higher survival rates.   Facilities within the screening and diagnostics program continue to report that because of grant funding from NBCF, they are able to help women in their areas that did not qualify for state or local funds to access mammography services.  Any life that is saved is an example of the success of the program.

Sky King Foundation	http://www.skyking.org	214-550-1455	EIN 04-3733242	8611 Lemmon Ave	Dallas	TX	75209	USA	Emergency Medical Services & Transport, Health, Public Transportation Systems	Sky King Foundation was created to provide no-cost air transportation to rural patients seeking specialized healthcare in urban centers.			A clear need to meet the skyrocketing need due to economic factors has been identified by our board members and the marketplace. Sky King Foundation is uniquely positioned to immediately increase existing capacity of patient transport operations to include many more patients in the Texas Region. We have seen a steady increase in requests for our services over the past three years and we simply do not have the resources to the current demand. To provide some insight as to the need, just one of our coordinating agencies, Grace Flight, had 4,300 requests for transport in 2009. Slightly less than half of those requests were filled at forty-five point eight percent. This unfortunate statistic is multiplied by the number of organizations who are far less successful than Grace Flight in filling missions. It is our desire to raise additional funds to help address this increased need and decrease in participation by other pilots due to the economic downturn. Sky King Foundation understands that it is not practical to be able to fill the entire gap of missions requested, but we want to make as big a difference as possible. By expanding our Texas operations, we can make the most immediate impact. With a $500,000 grant, we would be able to assist 290 additional patient mission requests and combined with our operational budget, we could cut the number of unfilled Grace Flight missions by half. In providing a more detailed view of the financials associated with the organization in the financial overview section of this document, we will learn that each charitable mission averages 2.4 hours of flight time. The resulting cost per flight is $1,720 with a cost per patient leg of $500. Arriving at the total grant figure the organization took into account a variety of factors; aircraft utilization, crew resource considerations, feasibility of incremental expansion, and need.

We are an all-volunteer, foster home based, certified 501(c)(3) dog rescue organization based in Austin, TX. We do not have a physical shelter. Instead, we operate primarily through our foster homes, online databases and at adoption events/expos.  The majority of our animals come from animal control groups and open admission shelters throughout Texas, where overcrowding and overpopulation lead to the euthanasia of millions of healthy, friendly pets every year.  We are committed to providing the dogs that come into Texas Sweeties Dog Rescue with the best possible care while they wait for their forever homes by acclimating them to life outside of a shelter and providing the appropriate veterinary care needed.  We also serve our community and adopters by educating and encouraging responsible pet ownership with an emphasis on the need for spaying and neutering.  We never euthanized animals due to space or time constraints, but we may elect to euthanize in the event of a severe, untreatable/debilitating illness or extremely dangerous behavioral concerns. Because we do not kill to make space, however, we cannot take in every animal that needs help.  Because our foster homes are the backbone of Texas Sweeties, and to help our organization run smoothly, it is our goal to provide the best experience possible. We encourage each foster home to be as involved as they are comfortable with and allow them the freedom to foster based on their needs, restrictions, or desires.	dogs	Texas	vet care, spay/neuter, microchipping and training.

Under Dirsts leadership, ALH set[s] the agenda for imaginative periodinstrument programming in Houston (according to the Houston Chronicle) with a distinctive blend of chamber, dramatic, and sacred works from the late Renaissance through the Classical era in music history. Its recordings have garnered international acclaim: Gramophone, the leading journal of the classical recording industry, praised Ars Lyricas debut CD for its exemplary skill and taste, the ensembles musicians for their impassioned performance of never-before recorded works by Alessandro Scarlatti; while Ars Lyricas latest CD, the world premire recording of Johann Adolf Hasses Marc Antonio e Cleopatra, was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Opera 2011.   ALH is proud to have represented Houstons thriving early music community with programs at national meetings and conventions of the American Musicological Society, the American Bach Society, the American Guild of Organists, the Society for 17thCentury Music, and, this past summer, at the worldrenowned Boston Early Music Festival. ALH also serves communities across Texas through frequent collaborations with other Texasbased arts organizations, including leading choral groups and early music sponsors.

Our principal activity is to provide specially adapted homes for qualifying service members through partnerships made with the builders, developers, communities, and the veteran. Helping a Hero strives to engage the community in providing services and resources for our wounded heroes and their families. Additionally, Helping a Hero provides additional support programs such as marriage retreats, caregiver retreats, recreational activities, emotional support, and financial support.			The wounded warrior home program is the signature homebuilding program for severely wounded warriors injured in support of the global war on terror. Traditionally, homes are built in master-planned communities with the developer and builder donating time and materials toward the construction of the house, in addition to their paid services. Helping a hero. Org donates cash funds and oversees the project. The veteran is required to take out a minimum 50,000 mortgage on the home plus contribute the proceeds of their va grant for which most of the veterans are eligible. For more information, see schedule o the actual mortgage amount is determined at the end of the building process and is based on the minimum required 50,000 veteran investment, plus any upgrades selected by the veteran over the maximum 100,000 cash contribution by the organization and any excess cost of land. Each home is built to address the special adaptation standards for the veteran who will live in the home and is designed to ensure maximum independence,within budget constraints. The home is recorded at cost plus any in kind donations from the builder or other sources. During 2014 there were 543,930 of in kind donations that are added to the cost of homes under construction during 2014. To date, the organization has awarded 113 homes in 22 states. The organization conducts a groundbreaking ceremony before the construction of a new home for the wounded warrior. The ceremony allows the organization to introduce the wounded warrior and his, or her, family to the community, educate the community about the needs of the wounded warrior, educate other businesses about the opportunity for giving back to wounded warriors, and honor the wounded warrior for his or her service. The organization has a welcome home ceremony when the home is completed and the wounded hero is ready to move in. The ceremony allows the organization to thank all the vendors who have donated time or products to the home as well as to educate the community about the adaptation needs that this wounded hero has as a result of his or her permanent injuries.   the organization conducts a groundbreaking ceremony before the construction of a new home for the wounded warrior.

The divorce rate is an average of 85% among the most severely wounded. The organization is committed to equipping these families to enhance their communication skills and work through these crisis issues so that they can rebuild their marriages, based on the new normal they now face. Over 40 families have participated in the retreats, webinars, and crisis communication support for more information, see schedule o the caregivers, primarily spouses and parents, face the 24/7 day to day challenges of supporting our wounded warriors. They are often overlooked and unappreciated. The organization organizes and offers retreats that provide encouragement, fun, pampering, and camaraderie for these care- givers. Over 50 caregivers participated in these programs during 2014. The wounded warriors have often been in the military since high school and do not know what it takes to sustain a household in the civilian world. The organization helps them develop a budget and make better financial decisions. Emergency needs and recreation support - the organization provides ongoing support for wounded warriors and their families, with priority given to home recipients. This support includes financial support, sports events, fishing and hunting outings, rodeos, operation merry christmas, and others. Over 300 wounded warriors receive assistance.
