As a place that honors each child's unique way of learning, St. Croix Montessori follows the principles of Dr. Maria Montessori. Children are grouped into mix-aged cohorts for 3-year learning segments; our approach is designed for the developmental phases beginning in the toddler years and carrying through to young adulthood. Our classroom is a balanced environment, every detail designed to foster a joy of learning and peacefulness.    St. Croix Montessori provides a range of need-based financial-aid awards, and is the only Montessori school on St. Croix offering both an elementary education (ages 6-12) and primary education (ages 2  - 6). Having served a diverse community since 2006, we achieved 95% of our 2015-16 strategic objectives, including critical capital improvements to the classrooms, acquiring a new Library/Nurses area and Office trailer, and our largest enrollment and retention in five years!    Our school is founded on the basis of community. We offer a diverse group of families a safe, stable environment in which to raise a child and receive globally-recognized education. In addition to our AMI-certified instructors, we offer enrichment programs including Chess Club with a national chess champion, yoga, African and Caribbean dance, art, an Orff-Schulwerk music program, and Bush Skills, and we are beginning a seed-to-table gardening program.   We currently serve 45 children in our Primary and Elementary Program. Our multi-age, multi-year curriculum has provided Montessori education to over 200 children over the years.    Close to 100 children from across St. Croix and visiting St. Croix join our Summer Enrichment Programs each year.    Our greatest challenge is that we are running out of space! Our focus is on establishing an endowment for an expanded, sustainable campus and providing educational stewardship to the St. Croix Community.	Ages 2 1/2 to 12	41 full-time students; 94 students in summer enrichment programs; 6 local artists	St. Croix, US Virgin Islands	Primary (pre-school to kindergarten), Lower Elementary (grades 1-3) and Upper Elementary (grades 4-6), Parent Education, After School Enrichment, and Summer Enrichment in Science, Arts, Music, and Caribbean Wildlife and Bush Skills...
