For instance, teen moms who are involved in YoungLives for two years or more are three times as likely to graduate from high school or earn their GED as girls who have been involved for less than two months - and 58% of teen moms report accepting Christ because of YoungLives (an additional 28% report that they accepted Christ outside of YoungLives). These statistics take into account girls' age and initial behaviors, so the outcomes can all be attributed to their involvement in YoungLives.

The In-Facility Program, which brings the arts directly to our constituents through on-site performances and arts activities at participating agencies and schools. The Workshop Program, which provides in-depth, participatory arts programs that address specific social needs on an as-needed basis. The Access Guide, the region''s premier resource for structural and programmatic accessibility information about arts and cultural venues and organizations, available in printed form and online at www.art-reach.org.	Each program is sensitive to the individual and group needs of member agencies by making certain of accessibility issues and appropriateness of the performance/event for particular audiences.

In-Facility Program:The In-Facility Program offers member agencies and schools the unique experience of having arts events carefully tailored to their needs and brought directly to their agency. This offers special-needs audience members the opportunity to interact much more directly with artists and with the artistic medium itself.

COSACOSA art at large, Inc.	http://www.cosacosa.org		EIN 23-2613697	4427 Main St	Philadelphia	PA	19127	USA	Arts & Culture, Children & Youth, Community & Neighborhood Development, Economic Development, Museums, Youth Development Programs	COSACOSA art at large, Inc. is a non-profit organization creating new public art specific to the concerns of Philadelphia neighborhoods in direct, long-term collaboration with city residents. COSACOSA reasserts art's original role as a catalyst for community dialogue, creative cooperation, and positive change. Since 1990, COSACOSA projects have brought together thousands of citizens of diverse backgrounds and differing abilities to learn about art, about each other, and about how to work together.	COSACOSA designs innovative programs to deliver interactive dialogues through art directly into inner city Philadelphia neighborhoods. Each year, through extended, community-based artist residencies, we engage city residents of different backgrounds, ages and cultures to design and create site-specific public art projects in collaboration with professional artists.  Since its inception, COSACOSA has brought together thousands of citizens from over thirty city neighborhoods to learn about art, about each other, and about how to work together. Our approach is multidisciplinary -- incorporating many possible artistic techniques, from painting to theater, from sound art to ceramics -- as well as interactive, creating safe forums for city residents to dialogue and build their communities through art-making.  COSACOSA's first major initiative, Community Collections (begun in 1990), examines Philadelphia's cultural histories and changing urban landscapes through community-based artist residencies. In 1995, a second organizational initiative was established, the Healing Art Project, a youth development program exploring relationships between art and healing.  Young people in the hospital come together with at-risk youth from local communities for interactive dialogue to design and create permanent, collaborative public art. In 2003, two new initiatives were launched, Artist.Sight.org, a gallery featuring exhibitions by community-based artists creating for cultural change and Connection Studios, a youth-centered art and technology program.	Art can honor our past, inspire our present, and challenge us to create the future we'd like to see. COSACOSA's goal is the education of our citizenry and the empowerment of our city's neighborhoods -- that the project participants will continue to work together for a better future, within and without the boundaries of their own cultures and communities.  COSACOSA constituents work together to achieve shared objectives, including  originating new community-specific art, collaboratively conceived and created by individuals of differing backgrounds and abilities working together with professional artists;  ensuring the permanence of a high quality, accessible arts program providing all of our city's residents with meaningful opportunities to create art;.  lessening the physical, social, and economic barriers that often limit the audience for art and art-making;.  exposing our project participants to artist-leaders who represent new ways of working and thinking from those role models they may have previously encountered;.  initiating dialogues on art, health and community that include a multiplicity of voices, abilities, cultural visions and values; and  building a sense of community ownership and participation among the project participants.

Rabbit Wranglers	http://www.rabbitwranglers.org		EIN 27-2584855	PO Box 8003	Pittsburgh	PA	15216	USA	Animal Protection & Welfare, Animals	To help abused, neglected and abandoned rabbits and educate the public to improve the lives of these companion animals.	Rabbit Wranglers is an all volunteer-staffed network of foster homes.  The following services are provided to the rabbit community and general public: Rabbit Wranglers works with animal shelters and aids these facilities with humane rescues.  The organization also assists animal shelters by taking in those rabbits with challenging behaviors that prevent their adoption, or those who require medical or palliative care beyond what the shelter is able to provide, or those who would otherwise be humanely euthanized due to shelter over-crowding.  Additional rabbit intakes occur through contact with humane agents, owner surrenders and rescued strays.  Rabbit Wranglers spays/neuters all of its rabbits and provides any medical care needed. The organization works with area shelters for low-cost alter surgeries and micro-chipping, and with a veterinarian who holds a weekly clinic at reduced rates.  Rabbits with health or behavior issues preventing adoption remain with Rabbit Wranglers until the issues are resolved.  In those instances where hospice care is required, life-long, loving, and humane care is provided by the organization.  Rabbits suitable for adoption are transferred to an area shelter if space is available.  Otherwise, they remain in Rabbit Wranglers foster homes where they are socialized and litter-trained.  Throughout their foster care placement, the organization works to find them permanent homes as house rabbits.  Adoptions occur through online resources, word of mouth and at adoption events.  Rabbit Wranglers works to improve rabbits lives and reduce the numbers of discarded rabbits by educating the general public about proper rabbit care and health.  The goal of education is to assist people in becoming better equipped to care for their own rabbits, as well as making informed decisions as to whether or not a rabbit is the right companion animal for their families.  Education is accomplished via phone, email and in-person consultations, as well as outreach during Pittsburgh House Rabbit Club meetings and adoption events held at local pet stores and other venues.  Rabbit Wranglers also offers a variety of services to assist people with the care of their rabbits, including: boarding, medical respite, grooming, behavior resolution, and bonding two or more rabbits.	Since its inception, Rabbit Wranglers primary accomplishments include:  rescuing abused, neglected and abandoned rabbits; assisting shelters with their high maintenance cases and overflow population; providing medical, hospice and behavior rabbits safe harbor and state of the art care; and finding them loving and permanent indoor homes.  The organization has also been successful in educating the public about the unique nature and proper care of these intelligent companion animals.  As part of the process of becoming a nonprofit, Rabbit Wranglers formalized its programs and streamlined its infrastructure and operating procedures.  The organization also strengthened its relationships with local Pittsburgh shelters, Humane Officers and Veterinarians.  These modifications have provided a solid base for decision-making for the future and for management of significant external critical issues. Rabbit Wranglers has grown quickly from a two-person operation, to an organization that is now 50 volunteers strong and highly regarded in the rabbit community.  We achieved this through our professional coordination of rescue efforts with area shelters and humane officers; ongoing recruitment of volunteers to assist with fundraising, education, and fostering; and our interaction with countless rabbit owners to provide assistance during times of medical crisis.   In May 2011, Rabbit Wranglers debuted on a television segment of WQEDs Pittsburgh 360.  The show continues to air every few months and has been a wonderful opportunity for the organization to reach out to hundreds of people.  Rabbit Wranglers has an excellent track record for providing care to medical and behavior rabbits.  In 2011, 81 rabbits found their way through our doors.  Twenty-seven of these rabbits had their health issues resolved and were transferred to area shelters for adoption. Seven rabbits found their forever homes while still with the organization, and 13 long-term medical and behavior boarders returned home to their families with their issues resolved.  Sadly, five rabbits, unable to overcome the medical issues that brought them to Rabbit Wranglers, passed away.  Additionally, in 2011, the organization boarded 24 rabbits while their guardians were away from home.  The boarding of these rabbits, along with the 13 long-term medical and behavior boarders mentioned above, show that owners trust our ability to provide care for their rabbits.  Local shelters, who accounted for 30 of our intakes, turn to us first for their high maintenance rabbits.  We also receive calls and emails daily from rabbit owners seeking our assistance; many of these individuals find their way to us via other satisfied rabbit owners.  The majority of our funding is received from private individuals  many who are rabbit owners. This too is a testament to our good reputation as a soundly run and skilled nonprofit.  We began 2012 with 29 rabbits in our care and have admitted an additional 70.  We have also provided boarding services for 30 rabbits this year. Our current census is 35.

Pre College Program Transitions ProgramSaturday ProgramStudent Matinee ProgramOutreach Programs	PMT considers the youth of our organization to be our most valuable asset. Placing their education at the center of our programming has enabled a philosophy of continuity of training that is tested regularly in performance to gain traction. This philosophy has proved effective in producing disciplined, prepared individuals. A small staff with a strong commitment to our mission provides a foundation of focus and flexibility. This allows PMT to meet challenges with an eye for quick action to adapt. PMT is considered the home away from home by most of our students and graduates. Because of our small size there has been a family feel to our culture, where young talent is nurtured and graduates return regularly to act, direct, and teach.   Seeing 1200 students completely focused on a live theatrical production and cheering at its conclusion confirms our mission. This happens regularly over the course of the season. Watching our young talent mature into seasoned performers ready to excel in either higher education or the professional world is a measure of PMTs success. Knowing that the majority of our students will apply the discipline, heart, and knowledge they have gained through their association with PMT to a wide range of professions validates the basic PMT process as a builder of good citizens. Seeing dozens of our graduates from the 90s building careers on Broadway, film, and TV validates PMTs musical theater education as a promoter of the next generation of theatrical artists. Seeing grandparents with their grandchildren and large families attending a cultural activity on a regular basis validates PMTs mission to provide high quality, affordable musical theater to the Pittsburgh community.	Pittsburgh Musical Theaters mission statement provides the basis for its artistic vision. PMT is committed to providing quality musical theater at an affordable price, to educating youth, and to developing and promoting local talent. Thus, artistic decisions are made with PMTs student and audience demographics in mind. Our goal is to combine local seasoned professionals and career-oriented younger artists to produce quality musicals. Accessible materials with compelling themes that play well to our middle and working class audiences are a driving force. As well, musicals that provide opportunities for our high school and college age students, and musicals that support educational goals in the public schools demand attention. Overall, we see artistic value in leveraging what is best in our professional company to support our educational programs. Maintaining a pricing point that allows all citizens to experience the joy of a musical performed in Pittsburghs Cultural District continues to inspire our vision.

Community Services For Children Inc	http://www.cscinc.org	(610) 437-6000	EIN 23-2204725	1520 Hanover Ave	Allentown	PA	18109	USA		Community services for children (csc) prepares young children and their families to succeed in learning and in life. Founded in 1981, csc is committed to ensuring that children enter school ready to learn and that families are equipped to help support their children. Csc provides:* early education for the most vulnerable children and their families through head start, early head start, and pre-k counts programs;* child care quality improvement services and grants in 13 counties through the pa northeast regional key; and* subsidies to child care providers that provide access to servcies to low income families through child care information services of lehigh county. Collectively, csc serves more than 40,000 children and families in the lehigh valley and 11 other counties of northeastern pennsylvania. Csc is the sole provider of head start (since 1965) and early head start (since 1996) in northampton and lehigh counties.	Head start/pre-k and early head start of the lehigh valley is our nation's premier provider of developmental and educational services to pregnant women, babies, toddlers, preschoolers and their families who live in poverty and struggle to meet the basic needs of life. We seek out the neediest of families, those at or below 100% of poverty, who without our intervention may not succeed in learning and in life. We provide high quality early education and comprehensive family development services. Specifically, our mission is to ensure that each child can reach their full potential, is ready for school and that each family is successful. Though children enter the program well behind their peers, over 95% of head start/pre-k children exit the program having achieved all of their learning indicators; positioning them for a successful academic future. Ninety-six (96%) are achieving at or above their age level in math, science and literacy skills. Ninety-seven (97%) of pregnant enrollees in early head start delivered a healthy, full term baby! On a daily basis we provide developmental experiences to at least 181 infants and toddlers (early head start) and 979 (head start/pre-k) preschoolers in conjunction with comprehensive health, nutrition, disability services and family services to them as well. This year over 1,400 children and families received vital early education services on a variety of schedules. Families participating in the program had monthly group activity opportunities as well as either weekly (early head start) or monthly home visits. We ensure that each child had all early and preventive health screenings and immunizations, and receives at least 2/3 of their daily nutritional requirements. Ninety-nine percent (99%) of all children achieved positive health status by obtaining all of their needed screenings, and 100% of children this year were up to date on all age appropriate immunizations. Oral health is equally significant with 100% of all children receiving preventive dental care. Seventeen percent (17%) of head start children, and 27% of early head start children had disabilities, yet 100% of these children with special learning needs received therapeutic intervention. Those children with health conditions, such as anemia, asthma, vision or failure to thrive were able to receive all needed treatment. We provide transportation services to over 350 children daily to and from their classrooms. Parents are an integral part of the program, as we work in full partnership. We assist parents to identify their goals for themselves and for their children, and to reach those goals. This year 90% of parents achieved at least one goal, and 45% of available fathers became actively involved in their child's learning. We provide parent training, parent involvement opportunities, and vital community linkages to other social service agencies that can benefit the family. Over 1,200 referrals were made to community providers for emergency assistance, food, housing, domestic violence, and child care assistance. The head start and early head start program has maintained its accreditation status by naeyc and was reaccredited by the middle state association commission for grades infant through four.   subsidized child care services for low income families who are working or are in training programs help make child care more affordable and provide a safe early childhood or school age experience. Families whose income is less than 235% of the federal poverty guidelines are eligible for the subsidy. Each family is required to pay a portion of the cost of the child care based on their family income. Requirements for the program include: working or in training at least 20 hours per week, must be citizens of the u. S. , and must provide verification of need for child care for employment or training. Parent services to families include family counseling (approximately 1,500 calls) on the quality child care programs available based on a parent choice model. All families may select a provider that best meets their child's needs. Other services include the processing of over 2,000 applications annually, determining eligibility for over 2,100 families enrolled, providing affordable child care to over 9,000 children each year. Provider services include subsidy payments to over 1,800 providers totaling approximately $16. 5 million annually.   early learning and school age quality initiatives (northeast regional key) - the northeast regional key is responsible for coordinating and administering a variety of professional development activities, quality improvement activities and financial awards and grants for more than 1,800 programs in northeastern pennsylvania.

Mentors and kids work on writing projects, school and career planning, time management, and other issues as they arise. Mentors and mentees select books to read together based on topics relevant to the mentee. We train mentors to report any issues that may need more qualified help, in-house or beyond. In 2016, we will serve at least 85 children and youth in mentorships.   A College Readiness Initiative that includes high school workshops, 24-session SAT prep courses, college admissions essay nights, college tours, and a weekly Teen Scholars program.

Effective literacy instruction combined with great children''s books is the heart and soul of CLI''s programs.  The majority of children in the classrooms we serve are from economically disadvantaged families with little or no access to books. When we furnish classroom collections (up to 200 children''s books) and assist pre-K through 3rd grade teachers in literacy instruction, we work to give these children an essential tool for academic success and an opportunity to develop a life-long love of reading.  Headquartered in Philadelphia since our founding in 1988, CLI has been funded by government and private grants as well as many generous individuals.  Our clients have included the school districts of Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago, Newark, and Philadelphia.	In addition to our long-term projects for systemic change in Baltimore, Newark, Philadelphia, and other smaller school districts, CLI conducts numerous targeted projects from Atlanta to Boston to Chicago for school districts, individual schools, Head Starts, and childcare providers. We have conducted Institutes for Teachers and provided materials to Head Starts nationally. CLI offers a summer Institute for teachers in Philadelphia for second-year Teach For America teachers from around the country to help them learn effective classroom management. CLI provides: 1. Professional development for early childhood educators. This includes group trainings (Institutes, seminars, and workshops), one-on-one on-site coaching by our Professional Developers, consultations, and guided classroom visits. Our clients include teachers (including teachers from Head Start and Teach For America) and school district reading coaches. 2. Creation and maintenance of 51 Model Classrooms in typical schools serving low-income communities in 11 cities and 6 states. These classrooms provide opportunities for other teachers to see best instructional practices used effectively in classrooms like their own. Observing these successful classrooms serves to increase teacher expectations of students, a key factor in raising student achievement. Some of the classrooms also serve as coaching laboratories in which our Professional Developers can help school district coaches enhance their skills. 3. Our Blueprint for Early Literacy pre-kindergarten curriculum, which has demonstrated extraordinary and consistent success in helping disadvantaged children acquire the skills they need to learn to read. We work to implement Blueprint and train teachers in its use in school districts, Head Starts, and childcare centers from Atlanta to Boston and from Chicago to the Shenandoah Valley. 4.

Erie Homes for Children and Adults Inc	http://ehca.org	814/454-1534	EIN 25-0967472	226 East 27th Street	Erie	PA	16504	USA	Mental Health, Residential Mental Health Treatment	The mission of EHCA is to assist people with disabilities to live rich and fulfilling lives	residential group homes and a variety of community services and supports.	The children and adults supported by EHCA have diagnosed intellectual disabilities, and many have additional physical and medical challenges. These conditions are referred to as developmental disabilities, defined as intellectual or physical impairments that are manifested before the age of 22. Many of the individuals supported by EHCA have seizure disorders and are non-ambulatory and/or nonverbal. The intellectual and physical disabilities affecting these individuals result from a variety of factors and conditions, including the following:  Conditions due to premature birth or complications from delivery, such as cerebral palsy. Cerebral palsy involves the loss or impairment of motor function caused by brain injury or abnormal brain development.  Conditions caused by genetic transmission, such as Down syndrome. Down syndrome is caused by a chromosome abnormality and is associated with the growth delays, a particular set of facial characteristics, and intellectual disability. Congenital disorders, such as Noonan syndrome. Noonan syndrome can involve heart defects, distinct bodily and facial features, and intellectual disabilities. Traumatic brain injury, which occurs when an external force causes brain dysfunction. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which is believed to affect one out of every 88 children in the U.S. Autism is a group of developmental brain disorders producing symptoms of social impairment, communication difficulties, or repetitive/stereotyped behaviors.  In addition, EHCA serves individuals with rare and debilitating conditions such as the following:  Aicardi Syndrome is a genetic disorder causing a partial or complete absence of the part of the brain that allows the right side to communicate with the left.  Fibrodysplasia Ossifcans Progressive (FOP) is an inherited disorder in which muscle and connective tissues such as tendons and ligaments are gradually replaced by bone (ossified).  Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome (LNS) is a rare gene mutation predominately affecting boys, giving them irresistible urges to hurt themselves. Most individuals with LNS have lifelong mental and physical problems.  The families of individuals with disabilities face important and difficult decisions. Can the parents adequately care for their child at home? What happens when their child reaches the age of 22 and no longer qualifies for school district services? Who will care for their adult child while they work or after theyre gone? Some individuals have such complex medical needs in addition to their disabilities that family members simply dont have the training or physical capability to care for them at home.  EHCAs diverse programming and flexibility of services are intended to address these concerns. From residential facilities to adult day programs to in-home support and respite care, EHCA tailors its services to meet the needs of every individual and every family it serves.  For example, Chris lives at home but participates in EHCAs MOVE program on weekdays. This gives him the opportunity to make friends, attend special events, and pursue his interests while still living at home. Chris volunteers at Second Harvest Food Bank and participates in MOVEs dance program.   Adam, on the other hand, has been in EHCAs residential program for over 25 years. The level of care he requires made it too difficult for him to remain at home. Adam loves making music on his keyboard and swimming in EHCAs indoor swimming pool. Like Chris, he volunteers at Second Harvest Food Bank and participates in MOVEs creative arts and dance opportunities. His mom, Paula, is an active EHCA volunteer.  We have a resident who was expected only to live to his 20's, who is now nearly 40 years old.  We also have a resident with severe and significant disabilities who has lived at EHCA for more than 40 years.  Our Project First Step program has a 95% success rate of helping pregnant women with extreme social concerns and physical and intellectual disabilities have healthy, full-term babies.  Individuals in our MOVE program volunteer in the community and give back over 6,000 hours of community service annually.    EHCA has served some of the most vulnerable people in our community and region for over 100 years.  Our success comes from treating every person as an individual and knowing that each person with a disability should have the opportunity to make choices, to contribute to his or her own daily lifestyle, to obtain the best education/training possible, and to enjoye a home-like atmosphere with quality caregivers.	individuals with all levels of disability	over 500 individuals and families	Erie, Pennsylvania

EMTAH has served over 2,500 young people in Seattle, WA - Albany, NY - and Chester County, PA. Our stories of students tell the most about our results:  When Steve came to EMTAH had ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder) and a grade point average of 1.8. He wandered the streets, experimented with drugs, spoke incoherently, and often hit himself in the head. When he started studying piano at EMTAH, his ADD was most evident in his lack of focus and ability to keep time. He was literally unable to beat his foot four times in a row.   Steves teacher began to develop an in-depth creative relationship with him, and using our progressive and rhythmic curricula he taught him to focus and build his concentration. Once Steve was able to focus and concentrate on rhythm, he was able to begin applying this ability to other areas of his life. Within one year Steve had raised his GPA to 3.5; he later graduated with honors from the University of Washington graduate school and recently emailed us to say he is now happily married and earning his PhD at the University of Maryland.  -----  Before her mother died, Sharia had lived for months in unused tunnels of the New York Subway, sticking her skinny little arm up into the candy machines to feed herself and her younger brother. When she was put in care of the State, she was diagnosed with PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) and only spoke in whispers. She started with EMTAH taking singing in a small group  in time, was singing from the stage.  -----  Josef  was a seriously depressed teen who often missed his lessons. When he first started, he was extremely self-critical, his teacher said. He was very quiet and hed sit and play, and every time he made a mistake hed scold himself. He was very hesitant to communicate with me  he was never hostile, but he held himself back. In time, Josef regularly made his lessons despite having to take two busses to get to the studio, and developed an easy rapport, often joking with his teacher. His social worker told us EMTAH has truly been a life-saving intervention for him.  -----  Jasmine had a 4.0 GPA (grade point average) but was lonely and isolated. She grew into a happy, well adjusted student who was content with a GPA of 3.5 because shed reclaimed and rejuvenated her spirit.   -----  These are not just isolated success stories  EMTAH students thrive.

Kelsey was an inspiration to everyone who met her. She truly appreciated the never ending support of her family, friends, classmates, school, community and church. Kelsey always wanted to give to others. We are striving to honor Kelsey and her all-too-short life by carrying it forward and fulfilling her dream through Kelseys Dream.	The Snack Pack Program was created for the Pediatric Cancer Patients, visiting Foss 3, at Geisinger.  These children are usually on steroids which makes them very hungry.  Appointments usually consist of lab work and chemotherapy, which usually take a full day.  This makes for a very long day, with no vending machines, nearby.  The Salvation Army's Angel Tree program is a favorite holiday tradition! Annually, Kelsey and Kylie enjoyed sponsoring up to 6 children, at Christmas time. We want to continue the tradition of Helping Children in Need, through Kelseys Dream. Angel Tree provides holiday assistance to needy children in the form of brand new toys and clothing each year.  In 1983, the Danville Ronald McDonald House initiated Camp Dost. It was the first summer camp in Pennsylvania for children stricken with cancer. Camp Dost was founded on the philosophy that every child deserves the chance to experience the challenges and rewards of summer camp. As the first camp for children with cancer in the state of Pennsylvania, Camp Dost has become a model for cancer camps across the country. Every year we provide around 100 handmade blankets to Camp Dost. These blankets were donated to Camp Dost, to distribute to each camper.  Camp Dost is a Pediatric Childrens Cancer Camp held in Millville, PA at Camp Victory, in July.    Global Youth Service Day (GYSD) was established in 1988 and is a time in the year when we come together to focus the world's attention on what young people are contributing every single day.  During Global Youth Service Day, millions of youth around the world organize community service projects to address the needs of their local communities through service, to be recognized for their contributions, and to be a part of a global youth service movement.  GYSD is the largest service event held during a weekend every April in over 100 countries in every region of the world.   'Kelsey's Dream', an all volunteer organization, organized the event.  "Our volunteers know the value of community service.  The Mifflinburg area is comprised of a lot of great, ambitious youth that really stepped up and ran with the idea of giving back to their community" said Tina Kuhns, CEO and Volunteer for 'Kelsey's Dream'. "If you wondered where tomorrow's heros will come from, a good place to start is with the leader of today."   Kelsey's Dream works with the Bone Marrow Transplant team at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, and created a program, "Happy Transplant Day," for the children receiving a Bone Marrow Transplant.  Kelsey's Dream participates to "Make a Difference" Day, by holding a winter clothing drive.  We distributed winter coats, hats, gloves and other winter clothing to bundle up local children in need.  Kelseys Playground is located behind the intermediate school. The school now has a series of climbing walls and a toss up that would be the envy of any community. Thank you to the local Boy Scout troop for their help in placing a whole tractor trailer load of wood fiber (mulch), under the playground. For those who were involved with the project, it was a labor of love, a way to keep Kelseys memory alive. We hope that the playground is more than just a place where people come to play. We want them to remember Kelsey, keep her in their heart and keep her spirit alive like we are trying to do with this project.	Kelsey's Dream has helped bring smiles to many children with cancer and children in need through the various programs we take part in and organize.

Students share:  It helped me to enjoy books more and see details that I might not normally see.   Teachers share:  Prime Stage enhanced my teaching methods. Not only did the students understand the literature, their confidence and test scores went through the roof as the year progressed. The experiences gave me creative insights on how to spark imagination in my students. My reluctant readers are more motivated to read and write.    A group leader from Summit Academy wrote: You give us the opportunity to show them (not just to tell them) that there is a world beyond the one theyve always known, a world beyond their neighborhood, a world beyond the choices theyve always used to limit themselves.    And a patron shared: Ive been looking for a theater that stimulates thought and presents literature for my granddaughter and I and Prime Stage is it.    Teacher from Wesley Spectrum Academy -  "Overall my students and I agree that this is a great program.  I really enjoy the fact that this gives many of my students a chance to discover reading and the theater.  A great deal of them do not have the means to do this in their free time nor do they know how to get involved in these types of activities.  It is a great feeling having my students come up to me and tell me how excited they are about going or debating their feelings regarding the adaptation of the play/novel.    The students always ask me if they are going to be the class that gets to go to the next play because they enjoy what is going on.  I think that the selections have been great picks that are either relevant within society today or fit the curriculum that is being taught in the local schools."	students and adults discover enjoyment in literature through the theater.

Accomplishments:   PSC relocated from the South Side to East Liberty and established the PSC Family Center in 2001. The Center, located in East Liberty, is a 73,000 square foot facility and serves children, youth, and families through various programs, including 1) Family Unification Services, 2) Visitation Services, 3) Youth in Service (an after-school program), an 4) Economic Empowerment Initiative for low-income individuals and youth, and 5) Summer Fest.  Since moving into the Center, PSC has had the opportunity to invite like-minded non-profit organizations to co-locate in the facility. The following organizations share space in the PSC Family Center: Youth Enrichment Services Inc., Family Guidance Center, Allegheny County Juvenile Court Hearing Office, PHASE IV Learning Center, and the Three Rivers Computer Clubhouse. Thanks to these partnerships, at-risk families have access to a variety of supportive services and resources in one convenient location.  PSC has been providing supervised visitation and transportation services for families involved with Children, Youth and Family services (CYF) since 1998. In Allegheny County, we are the primary provider of this important service that builds healthy life-long relationships between parents and children.   The Safe Visits Safe Families program was established within PSCs Visitation Services program in 2006. As the only high-security visitation program in the state of Pennsylvania, it caters to families in which divorced/separated parents and their children are at the highest risk for domestic abuse and violence during court-ordered visits.   Sixty local youths attended Summer Fest in 2007. The program was offered for 10 consecutive weeks, beginning on June 18 and ending on August 24. Campers participated in diverse activities such as a book club, charcoal sketching, team sports, African drumming lessons, writing stories, and field trips to the local swimming pool and childrens museum.  We were able to promote a partnership with the Kelly-Strayhorn Theater in East Liberty so that summer camp participants would have a location where they could display their art and science projects. Based on these positive interactions, PSC plans to pursue an interactive partnership with the Kelly-Strayhorn Theater during the school year.         This program is particularly important for East Liberty, a neighborhood in which street violence and drug activity is prevalent. Supervised recreational activities for youth are limited here during the summer months, and parents are often unable to afford childcare. PSC is dedicated to ensuring the safety of youth in our community, and we believe that all families should be given the opportunity to access our services regardless of their ability to pay. We hope that you will support us in this endeavor to keep youth safe and active this summer, and we thank you for your consideration of this request.

Center for the Study of Economics	http://www.urbantoolsconsult.org	215-266-4877	EIN 25-1384471	1501 Cherry Street	Philadelphia	PA	19102	USA	Economics, Public Finance, Taxation & Monetary Policy	The Center for the Study of Economics (CSE) is a 501c3 organization. Our mission is to assist local government in evaluating current local and urban tax policy. Our remit is to study and administer implementation of land value taxation (LVT) to determine which policy would work best in meeting local governments economic development, budgetary and planning goals.	Education, research, outreach and program implementation and administration assistance to local governments.  We field numerous media queries to help the public better understand the need for bold new policies to provide a fair and just economy for all.	The Centers unique experience is in identifying appropriate sources of revenue of value capture either as a standalone project or as part of traditional government expenditure.  Specifically, in 1996 the Center was commissioned by the Allentown home rule charter Commission to analyze existing values and apply them to a land value capture environment. The Center also identified other forms of tax that were barriers to investment of labor and capital in the city of Allentown Pennsylvania. Per its mission, the Center created parcel by parcel as well as aggregate analysis of the city to give the Commission (and subsequently the voters) accurate information pre-and post-implementation.  In 1997, Center was asked to identify revenue effects of the Pittsburgh Downtown Partnerships options for establishing a Business Improvement District (BID).  Land value capture was selected as the funding option for the BID, tying in both an incentive and reward for built parcels, and an incentive for vacant and blighted parcels to pay substantially more into the mission of the district.  In 2001, the city of Altoona Pennsylvania facing disinvestment and depopulation asked the center to identify, study and project the effect of a 10 year shift to a property tax system based upon capturing land values only. Implementation took place over the 10 year period, with the Centers assistance in adjusting tax levies as needed by the city.  In 2013  2015, the Center was charged by Connecticuts M.O.R.E. Commission on municipal efficiencies, who identify, study, and publish the various scenarios of land value capture in Connecticuts municipalities (parking studies, construction forecasts, revenue outcomes for cities, etc.) Throughout its active research and educational history, center has identified both legal and political obstacles to land value capture and taxation successfully.  The Center provided research to both the Maryland Attorney General in 1995 and the Virginia Attorney General in 1999 to provide solid evidence that land value capture could be enacted constitutionally and legally.  CSE has induced 20 cities, school districts and improvement districts to adopt LVT.  The general outcomes have been:  - reduction in tax burdens for homeowners, renters and productive business - growth of municipal tax bases as more investment and work returns to urban centers - changing urban property taxes into a model of progressivity - penalizing blight and land vacancy with added tax incidence, removing rewards for holding land our of use through private land baking	Revitalization  by incentivizing markets to return and expand cities without the use of costly and unreliable subsidy and abatement programs.	20 jurisdictions, and provided education, expert witness testimony and outreach in 12 states, and dozens of cities, as well as international partners in Africa, Europe, Asia and Australia.

Bailey Foundation	http://www.bailey-foundation.org		EIN 20-1242200	P.O. Box 2122	Boothwyn	PA	19061	USA	Animal Protection & Welfare, Animals	Our goals include finding good, caring homes for the birds that have been given up by their guardians due to unforeseen difficulties. We have encountered many cases where birds have been given up for adoption when their guardians have become ill or divorced. These people needed to place their birds quickly and felt uncomfortable with the options of reselling their bird back to a pet shop, in the want ads or giving the bird to friends or family where questionable care might be offered. We have also received birds that have been given up because of unacceptable vocalization or dangerous behavior. We hope to offer people the security of knowing that their bird will be cared for and that time will be taken when finding a new home with a sincere, dedicated and appropriate person. We do not purchase birds. We also offer telephone help for new caretakers with questions.      * We do not breed or place companion birds with people who breed.     * We do not sell, trade, or use birds in our care for commerce or profit.     * We promote responsible guardianship of all captive birds.     * We promote education on all issues of avian welfare.     * We oppose the sale of un-weaned baby birds to the general public.     * We support and encourage responsible legislation protecting the rights, health, and safety of birds living in captivity.     * We strongly oppose legal/illegal exportation/importation and encourage all countries to adopt legislation, enforcement, and conservation policies to prevent wild birds from entering captivity.  Since July of 2004, we have taken in dozens of birds, from finches to macaws. Many of these birds will probably require extensive rehabilitation due to medical or behavioral problems. Many others have been placed in homes that we continue to monitor. The remaining birds are awaiting for a "Forever Home", a process that involves an application, working with the bird, and the signing of a contract of care by the adopting party.  We anticipate with the effect of the internet, there will be more adoptions as well as more desperate people wanting to give up their birds to our care. Many of these birds will need care for up to 80 years or more, our task is formidable. Space is running out for the care of large birds like macaws and cockatoos. We will need to expand our available space soon. Our long-term goals are to purchase land on which large aviaries can be built to house the various species of birds as well as serve as an educational center. In our current location this is not possible. We do invite people to contact us. We are very happy to share whatever knowledge we have gained with any prospective or current parrot parents.  It is our goal to always have a place for one more bird in need.

Birthday Parties: We host a celebration at the agency for children who have a birthday during that month/season. The guests are the other children in the program and their families (if applicable). The celebrations are staffed by volunteers and the parties include food, dessert, games/entertainment, and treat bags. Our birthday celebrations represent more than just a party. We believe that birthdays are an opportunity to wish a child a happy and healthy new year, and therefore all of our birthday celebrations expose the children to some type of enriching learning experience.  Birthday Presents: All of the children we serve receive a birthday cheer bin on their birthday. This bin is filled with gender and age appropriate gifts, which we can customize. All of our bins include a new book and a new toothbrush/toothpaste. A bin contains $40-$50 worth of items. We believe these extra items help reinforce a "happy, healthy yearfilled with cheer."  Itty Bitty Birthday Cheer: This program provides birthday cheer bins (filled with essential newborn items) for newborn babies. We also partner with agencies to provide group baby showers. Help support this program by purchasing an item off of our baby shower registry.

Families facing financial hardship may not have the means to provide this special experience for their children to share with peers. We work with schools to provide treat bags for qualified children to distribute to their peers on their birthday. In collaboration with The Education Partnership, we also provide teachers in elementary and primary schools throughout the Greater Pittsburgh region with their own Classroom Cheer Kit. This kit contains everything a teacher would need to celebrate their student's birthdays. The kits are filled based on the teachers roster.
