We are for over 5,000 injured and orphaned wild animals each year. Our volunteers answer over 20,000 calls about distressed wildlife and wildlife issues every year. At WIC, the emphasis is on emergency medical care and temporary housing for injured and orphaned animals-not on keeping releasable animals in cages for public display. We run a nurture center- not a 'nature' center. Since there is a direct correlation between rising numbers of injured and orphaned wildlife and unbridled development the purpose of our Wildlife in Crisis Land Trust is to protect wild animals by preserving their natural habitats and providing them with permanent sanctuary. Since our ultimate  goal is to help people live harmoniously with native wildlife, we provide ongoing practical environmental educational programs to surrounding communities. Wildlife in Crisis relies entirely on donations to care for debilitated wildlife.

This holds great importance for our seriously ill children.

OPIN	http://www.opinpets.org	(203) 326-0216	EIN 30-0386610	OPIN, Inc, Office only:  1747 Summer Street, Suite 1	Stamford	CT	06905	USA	Animal Protection & Welfare, Animals	Outreach to Pets In Need (OPIN) is an all volunteer nonprofit organization, and our mission is to decrease the population of homeless pets in Connecticut through medical treatment, training, public education, surrender prevention, spay/neuter, and placement programs.	Since 2007 OPIN has worked to put and end to pet homelessness within the community.   We have no brick and mortar building but rather rely on foster homes for pets we rescue from Connecticut kill shelters, those abandoned at vet offices or, those we accept from community members who are in crisis.    From 2007-2014, OPIN has supported the Stamford Animal Care & Control facility, financially providing: medical care, medicine, training, evaluations, microchipping, supplies, food, web services, networking, advertising, in-home dog training for adopted dogs and much more.    OPIN worked along side Ms. Laurie Hollywood (former Director of Stamford Animal Control) to help with the adoption of over 3,000 pets (cats, dogs, birds, little furries, reptiles, etc.).  Thanks to OPIN's funding, no pet of the Stamford Animal Shelter, suffering a treatable illness, was euthanized.   Medical care was given no matter the cost, age or breed.  Timeline:   March 2007 - OPIN received 501c3 nonprofit status  2008 - Microchipping of the shelter animals and SNIP (Spay Neuter Incentive for Pits), a subsidy program is offered to low income Stamford families.  2009 - OPIN offers FREE dog training to the public, currently held at the Stamford Bartlett Arboretum on Wednesday nights.  2010 - Two foster programs are developed:  the SafePet program provides foster care for pets owned by victims of Domestic Violence.  It provides temporary housing for a pet during the owners time of transition.  The second is for pets that come into OPIN's foster network. Foster homes provide a nurturing environment for pets from a shelter or otherwise, preparing them for a forever home.  2012 - Project Chip'n is launched.  FREE microchip clinics are held each quarter at different locations within the City.  This program aims at making pets safer and ensure a quicker reunion back home should the pet get lost and be picked up by Animal Control, a resident or a veterinarian.  Our goal?  To chip every pet!  2015 - OPIN leases a small office near the Stamford downtown to hold volunteer and board meetings, meet and greets with dogs and prospective adopters, event planning and small gatherings.  2016 - OPIN to unveil plans to build a privately owned, safe house/adoption and education center.  None of what we have been able to do has been possible without the kind financial support of our donors with the local and surrounding communities and our incredible volunteers.    Our first successful seven years deserves a special acknowledgement to Ms. Laurie Hollywood (former Stamford Animal Control Director).  Her leadership, dedication, compassion and knowledge is unmatched!	homeless pets at local Animal Shelters and  within the community	over 500 homeless shelter, cats, dogs, birds, rabbits & reptiles and a number of pets owned by low income individuals who could not afford medical care for their animals.

Mercy Learning Center of Bridgeport, Inc.	http://www.mercylearningcenter.org	(203) 334-6699	EIN 22-2859879	637 Park Ave	Bridgeport	CT	06604	USA	Adult Education, Education	Mercy Learning Center of Bridgeport, Inc. (MLC) provides basic literacy and life skills training to low-income women using a holistic approach within a compassionate, supportive environment. All women are welcome without regard for race, religion, color, creed, sexual orientation or national origin.    MLC was founded in 1987 on the premise that one of the best ways to help entire families overcome poverty and succeed is to educate women and mothers. Rooted in this multigenerational approach, the motto of Mercy Learning Center is Educate a woman Educate a family. Since its founding, MLC has educated and empowered over 10,000 women.  MLC provides a range of flexible learning opportunities for women, including part time tutoring, full-time classroom instruction, technology education, employment and life skills training, family literacy programs and enrichment. Holistic support servicesincluding social services, counseling, childcare, and food assistanceare available to all program participants. All programs and services are free.	Progress is defined in many ways among the diverse group of women Mercy Learning Center serves.  For women who come to MLC with little or no English language proficiency, progress comes when they are able to explain their symptoms to an emergency room doctor or count change at the grocery store. For students who struggle to make ends meet by working in a minimum wage position, success is celebrated when they receive a job promotion with an increase in wages. And, for the women who work towards completing their high school education, success is realized when they earn their diplomas.  As a cohesive community, however, Mercy Learning Center students have a high rate of success.  According the Connecticut State Department of Education, academically "Mercy Learning Center's adult education program consistently reflects high performance outcomes for its learners and has performed in the top 5% of the approximately 70 programs statewide."  MLC basic and secondary-level students advance at rates that are double the federal and state guidelines, and our ESL students advance at rates nearly 50% higher than federal and state guidelines.   Since the GED preparation program began in 2003 and the NEDP began in 2008, 229 women have graduated from MLC.  The majority of our graduates have attended college, served in the armed forces, focused on raising their young children, or sustained living wage employment. During the 2014-15 program year, 65 MLC alumnae were enrolled in college or job certification programs.  One graduate earned a masters degree, 1 graduate earned a bachelors degree, 2 graduates earned associates degrees, 3 graduates earned college certificates, and 11 students and graduates completed career certifications.  In addition, 85 students reported finding new jobs and 17 students, with help from MLC tutors, prepared for and passed the U.S. citizenship exam.   Each of these achievements strengthens the overall Greater Bridgeport community by bringing about an increase in educated and skilled workers more engaged parents who actively advocate for their childrens education and increased economic stability and independence among families.	low-income, undereducated women and their families	881 women and 169 children	Bridgeport, CT	litearcy and life skills education, high school diploma programs, citizenship education, computer skills, family literacy and more.

Love146	http://www.love146.org	203.772.4420	EIN 20-1168284	PO Box 8266	New Haven	CT	06530	USA	Child Abuse Prevention, Civil Rights, Crime & Law, Domestic Violence, Human Service Organizations, Human Services, Victims Services	Love146 is an international human rights organization working to end child trafficking and exploitation through survivor care and prevention. The trafficking and exploitation of children is one of the darkest stories and most severe human rights abuses imaginable. But for us, the hope of ending it is a reality. Love146 is helping grow the movement to end child trafficking while providing effective, thoughtful solutions. We believe in the power of love and its ability to effect sustainable change. Love is the foundation of our motivation.  Founded in 2002 (as Justice for Children Intl.), Love146 is a registered public charity. Love146 is a 501c3 non-profit organization.	OUR HOLISTIC CARE In The Philippines: Our Round Home in the Philippines is uniquely built and designed to facilitate the restoration and holistic health of every girl entering its doors. A tree house is regularly the venue for therapy sessions. A volleyball court is available to play on. Theres even a punching bag for children to work out their aggression. The physical structure of the Round Home is intended to promote reflectiveness, a sense of peace, freedom, dignity, and self-esteem, as well as playfulness so that children can simply be children again. After years of providing direct care to dozens of girls, the Love146 White Home opened in 2014, caring for exploited boys, providing them with holistic care, including medical attention, nutrition, therapy, formal and informal education, and vocational training, all to help them walk toward recovery and prevent future exploitation.  In the United States Over the years, we have heard stories about exploitation and trafficking of children in the United States. Before launching our US Survivor Care program, we talked with survivors of child sex trafficking in the US, asking them what sort of care they would have liked to have. We listened to government officials, asking them what was actually needed. After much research, we realized that while many services for children exist in the US, service providers are generally not familiar with human trafficking, and few survivors have a trauma-informed advocate who understands human trafficking and can help them gain access to the services they need. Youth who have been trafficked are at higher risk for further exploitation; thus, one of the first things we tell a youth is, We go where you go. If you move placements, or foster homes, or run away and come back, we will always be there. By journeying with the youth, Love146 helps ensure that youth receive victim-centered services and the support they need to become self-sufficient and flourishing adults, which includes freedom from revictimization.  Our Prevention Education in the United States We are driven by the belief that child trafficking and exploitation is not inevitable, and working to reach youth before traffickers do.  Our child trafficking and exploitation prevention education curriculum, Not a #Number, is designed to teach at-risk youth how to recognize recruitment tactics, understand vulnerabilities, and develop skills to safely navigate potential and existing exploitative situations. Youth identify healthy support systems and learn how to access community resources when situations occur that increase their vulnerability or if exploitation is already underway. We also provide resources to educate parents, caregivers, and professionals about the issue and actions they can take to help safeguard children. Not a #Number has been embraced by schools, child welfare and juvenile justice agencies, and other youth-serving organizations.	Children who have experienced being trafficked or exploited.	161 children who have experienced being trafficked or exploited; 3,922 youth received prevention education, 592 professionals and community members received training, and 41 professionals were certified to facilitate Not a #Number, our prevention education curriculum.	United States, The Philippines, The United Kingdom	We serve children from our offices in Asia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Love146 is working to end child trafficking and exploitation through survivor care and prevention.  We began in 2002, building and expanding safe homes in Asia and training grassroots aftercare workers with knowledge in best practices and equipping them with practical tools to be even more effective. In 2008, we opened our Round Home for girls in the Philippines, and since then have added three more additional survivor care locations, serving both boys and girls in the Philippines, the U.S. and the U.K. However, we could only provide survivor care for so long before asking ourselves, What can we do to actually prevent exploitation from occurring in the first place? Our Prevention Education program has been developed to better answer just that question. Prevention Education reaches children before traffickers do. Weve reached thousands of U.S. children in classroom and community settings, equipping them to recognize vulnerabilities and protect themselves and their peers from exploitation. In 2015, we completed & began implementing a youth curriculum, called Not A #Number, which incorporates what weve learned about effective prevention. The trafficking and exploitation of children is one of the darkest stories and most severe human rights abuses imaginable. But for us, the hope of ending it is a reality. Love146 is helping grow the movement to end child trafficking while providing effective, thoughtful solutions. We believe in the power of love and its ability to effect sustainable change. Love is the foundation of our motivation.

To date, DSF has awarded over $2M in Dravet-specific research grants, more than any other nonprofit organization, and over $80K in patient assistance grants. Even though research might not move as quickly as we as parents would like to see, we don't want lack of funding to be slowing down the process.	We collaborate globally with researchers, geneticists, clinicians, and other professionals with an interest in Dravet syndrome and related epilepies, as well as serving patients and familes across the globe.			Research Grant Program  This program offers grants for research directly related to Dravet syndrome and associated epilepsies.  Our research grants fund initial research hypotheses that have not been fully explored.  The results extracted from this type of research will help bring untested research to the point that it can qualify for larger governmental funding. Research applications will be judged principally on novelty of the hypotheses, innovative approaches with a direct relevance and application to Dravet syndrome and related epilepsies, scientific quality, strength of approach, and likelihood of success.    International Ion Channel Epilepsy Patient Registry (IICEPR) This registry (co-funded by the DSF & ICE Alliance) is owned by University of Michigan and Miami Childrens Hospital, but will be available to all interested researchers.  It will collect basic information and genetic test results of individuals with Dravet syndrome and related epilepsies worldwide.  The establishment of this registry will expedite future clinical trials and will serve to improve communication of ideas amongst interested researchers, as well as assure rapid distribution of any new information that may benefit patients and their families.  DSF Annual Research Roundtable  This annual meeting allows researchers, geneticists, neurologists and other professionals with a strong interest in Dravet syndrome and related epilepsies establish a research roadmap.   By allowing this consortium of specialists to establish a plan, the DSF can facilitate the development and implementation of better treatments by funding research projects that address the critical challenges of this syndrome and which will offer the most promising breakthroughs at the fastest pace possible.    International Patient Assistance Grant (PAG) Program - This program offers grants to patients with Dravet syndrome and associated epilepsies for necessary medical expenses associated with these conditions that are not covered through private insurance or other assistance programs.  Three percent of donations, after expenses, are allocated to this program.

These students cannot afford to attend public school, but  those who can afford school are in overcrowded classrooms for approximately 2 hours per day. CCEdFund expands educational opportunity to impoverished students by providing scholarships for them to attend exceptional schools within Cambodia. While recent economic growth in Cambodia and the creation of a democratic system of government has expanded opportunities for some, many Cambodians have little to no access to public education due to poverty. Further, there are exceptional schools in Cambodia that provide progressive, child-centered educational experiences to students whose families can afford the schools. CCEdFund provides similar educational opportunities to Cambodian students who have exhibited dedication to their studies by providing scholarships to these exceptional schools. In doing so, CCEdFund is promoting peaceful economic, social, and political development in Cambodia where there is a paucity of education professionals (due to the Khmer Rouge genocide). After completing their education, our students commit to working in the public interest in Cambodia for a minimum of two years.

In 2009, True Colors Executive Director, Robin McHaelen was chosen by the National Association of Social Workers (NASW) and Lambda Legal Education and Defense fund as one of the two professionals to design and conduct a national master training program for child welfare professionals across the country. The training has been published by NASW and is available on the web as Moving the Margins: Curriculum for Child Welfare Services with LGBTQ Youth in Out-of-Home Care. In addition, True Colors staff trained more than 2,400 educators, social workers, clinicians, health care providers, students and others across CT.	LGBT youth, their families and the systems that support them.			True colors' annual conference began as a field work project for its founder and current executive director in 1994 and its now the largest and most comprehensive lgbt youth issues conference in the nation. More than 3,000 youth, educators, social workers, clinicians, family members and clergy participate in more than 150 workshops, films, activities and events over the course of the 2 or 3 day event. School groups participate from more than half of the communities in ct, from across the northeast and nationally. The conference is open to the public and provides up to 15 continuing education credits for professional participants.   the safe harbor project is a public/private partnership between true colors, the ct state department of children and the ct association of foster and adoptive parents targeting the unique concerns and needs of lgbt youth in out-of-home care. The safe harbor project's mission is to ensure the safety, support and nurturance of all children and youth, regardless of their race, inherent sexuality, gender identity or expression by ensuring culturally competent, unbiased and affirming service by all dcf staff and its contracted providers. The safe harbor project includes a state-wide, policy-focused task force that meets monthly; staff and provider training to approximately 400 youth-serving professionals annually; foster parent recruitment for adolescents regardless of their gender or sexuality as well as individual case consultation. We provide intervention and mediation on behalf of approximately 75 youth annually, resulting in the creation of new foster homes, staff development and improved services.

This work includes the provision of on-site 6-week activist institutes, annual gsa summits; direct advocacy on behalf of lgbt youth in school based settings; and policy work with various state agencies. In addition, true colors provides cultural competency training for approximately 2400 professionals per year.

Artspace's gallery program includes exhibitions in various formats and scale, including individual, site-specific projects, small solo exhibitions, installations, curated thematic group exhibitions, window installations, and a large city-wide festival that encompasses offsite exhibitions. We invite proposals from artists and curators twice per year. A group of 10 elected volunteer artists, curators, and critics serves as a peer review visual arts committee, and assists the staff in the selection of applications for special funded commissions, and with the planning of portions of the program schedules. The mission of the organization as established in its 2012 strategic plan, and reaffirmed in 2013, is too catalyze artistic activities;o connect contemporary artists, audiences, and resources; ando enrich art experiences and activate art "spaces". As a means to support artists in other ways, artspace maintains a flatfile of works on paper by approximately 125 local, regional, and national artists juried by our staff curator and the visual arts committee. Works on paper include collages, drawings, prints, photographs, paintings on paper, and small books. Art from the flatfile is drawn upon for group and solo exhibitions. The flatfile is a resource for collectors, curators, artists, and students. Artists bring new work to their portfolios annually, creating an ever-changing, dynamic body of affordable artwork. Artspace also offers professional development workshops to aid artists in promoting and presenting their work to curators, galleries and institutions.   city-wide open studios - since 1998, artspace has presented city-wide open studios every year. This is our flagship and most popular event. It's a democratic fall festival that brings together hundreds of area artists with thousands of audience members. Artists in new haven, west haven, hamden and north haven all open their studios in a coordinated way. The event is free to the public. To assist artists who cannot afford a studio, or who do not have access to a workspace that can accommodate the public, artspace negotiates with landlords to secure underutilized space. In so doing, vacant buildings are reinvented as exhibition spaces and temporary studios that aid in our ongoing community development efforts. All artists are welcome to participate regardless of training or background. To facilitate the public's discovery of all the sites, and heighten the public's understanding of the creative process, artspace publishes a printed guide with a map to all the studios and an online guide with images from each participating artist. Artspace also organizes guided walking, van and bike tours and demonstrations. Artspace presented its 17th annual city-wide open studios, showcasing 300 connecticut artists in their studios and temporary spaces. Since the program's inception, artspace has showcased over 2 million square feet of commercial and industrial space in transition, in the service of new haven's economic development. About half of this space has gone on to find new tenants, uses and owners. To help artists prepare for city-wide open studios, artspace organized a unique professional development workshop speed/networking/live! In which 20 esteemed curators came to coach artists, each spending 5-6 minutes with an equal number of artists. The curators represented museums and institutions around new england. In 2015, this event was copied (with our enthusiastic permission) and adapted by the vulnerable cleveland, oh alternative space (spaces). The new haven register donated advertising space and the city of new haven contributed the 200,000 sq ft goffe st. Armory for exhibition space for the event. As a fundraiser and educational event, we continue to refine and enhance the featured series of special tours, led by a curator and focusing on a few studios of notable artists.   youth and education programs - artspace organizes a range of initiatives aimed at fostering an appreciation for art within new haven public high school students. All youth programs are designed for long-term relationship building between artists, educators, and students in the context of artmaking, critical thinking, and contemporary culture by providing students with mentors and positive creative experience within the a gallery setting. Artspace endeavors to stimulate life-long interest and involvement in the art world. Artspace organized and executed the 14th annual summer apprentice program. The master artist was laureline kruse, and the project involved the creation of a new mobile museum of american artifacts, in a rehabbed vintage trailer. Participating students represented the following public schools: hillhouse high school, common ground school. Cooperative arts and humanities high school, educational center for the arts, metropolitan business academy, high school in the community, and new haven academy. The students solicited objects for the museum from members of the community and also captured less traditional items- local sounds, interviews and momentos. The program served to highlight the question of who decides what is worthy to include in our cultural institutions. The master artist parlayed her experience working with artspace into a valuable fellowship with national arts strategies.

We create schools, programs and global communities around the common goal of education for all. We accomplish these activities by dedicating significant amounts of time, labor and effort raising money in the u. S. Through youth and professional engagement programs and special events. The funds raised allow us to increase our domestic and international reach and impact. At the conclusion of 2014, we have broken ground on 257 schools across the four countries of laos, ghana, guatemala and nicaragua. Our schools are open to students in each country and the stages of planning and construction are underway in several new communities to aid in expanding our reach in 2015.					The first of our core programs is schools builds. We partner with local communities and governments to improve the state of education infrastructure in communities. Our short term goals are to address the need for improved infrastructure with our long term goals being to improve student attendance, progression, and test scores. The beneficiaries of our school building program are primary school students currently attending school in poor quality structures and primary school teachers currently teaching in poor quality structures. Through the end of 2014, we have broken ground on a total of 257 schools across our geographies.   our second core program is our wash program. Wash is an internationally recognized and utilized program that is designed to provide access to and knowledge about water, sanitation, and hygiene. Unicef adopted wash in 2005 as their primary intervention to tackle hygiene needs in the developing world; pop began wash practices in 2010 in laos. In carrying out this program, we build student and teacher sanitation facilities (sinks and bathrooms) in conjunction with classroom builds. In addition, our staff visit classes twice per month during the school year to teach lessons related to water, sanitation and hygiene. The primary goals of this program are to build and provide access to quality toilets, potable water and hand washing stations in conjunction with pop schools lacking such infrastructure. Additionally, we aim to increase proper hygienic and sanitary behavior in primary students.   our third core program is teacher support. We support teacher development through in-service and workshop training sessions. Our staff visit government teachers in our communities twice per month to aid in lesson planning, methodology training and rapport building with students. Teachers attend workshops for group training and network building. We use a methodology of teaching that focuses on the engagement of the student because more engaged students perform at a higher level. We do this through an expressive pedagogy, which involves usage of facial expressions, motor memory (song, dance, sign, etc. ) and creative didactic materials. The short term goals of our teacher support programs are: to improve lesson planning by assisting teachers in the creation and use lesson plans; to build rapport with students by encouraging teachers to adopt our interactive methodology to better engage students; to support a peer network of teachers through teacher training workshops, and; to provide classrooms with teaching and learning materials. Our long term goal is to increase primary student scores in literacy, numeracy and english across all our geographies. The main beneficiaries of our teacher support program are the teachers and students in our schools and communities. Through 2014, we have supported over 350 teachers in seven communities in laos, 11 in ghana and 16 in guatemala.   our fourth core program is our scholarships program. We support the progression of students from primary to secondary school by providing scholarship packages. Communities are selected as eligible for scholarships based on the results of the scouting rubric; at which point all students in the final grade of primary school are eligible to apply. Students in their final year of primary school with 75% attendance at the mid-year mark receive a prize (reading books, pencils, etc. ) and students with 75% attendance at the end-year mark receive the following scholarship package: tuition for first year of secondary school, a uniform, a backpack with school supplies, textbooks and paid dormitory fee when applicable. The key beneficiaries of our scholarship program are teachers and students in our communities. Since inception of this program, we have provided over 2,500 scholarships to students in need in our geographies. With all of our programs, we extensively monitor and evaluate our program impact. To best judge how effective our impact is, we closely monitor and evaluate (m&e) our programs on the ground. We have local m&e teams who conduct interviews and surveys with village leaders, teachers, students, and parents. This help us to understand the needs of villages in which we operate, our impact on the community, and areas in which we can improve pop operations and programming. Our student database helps us understand who we are serving every year in our pop schools. We document each pop student's name, age, gender, ethnicity, attendance, progression to next grade level, and grade in class. Each year, we track village-wide student enrollment, attendance, retention from one grade to the next, progression from primary to secondary school, and grades and/or test scores. We expect to improve these metrics through the variety of educational programs we offer students and communities. In addition, we follow individual pop students through the years to assess their educational successes and failures, along with their understanding, attitude, and behavior regarding education and elements of wash. These yearly interviews will help us understand the impact that we have on individuals through our programming. Domestically, we expanded our global communities through several updates to our website and through our expanding outreach program across our digital platforms to both youth and professionals. We have an online community of over 550,000 members who stay engaged with our work through updates, posts and blog entries.

Before six-year-old Jesse Lewis was killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School on December 14, 2012, he wrote a message on his family's kitchen chalkboard: "Nurturing Healing Love". The words nurturing" and healing" are a part of the definition of compassion across almost all cultures and being loved is a basic human need.     Inspired by Jesse's words, his mother Scarlett Lewis founded the organization in order to share his message that we can choose love over anger, gratitude over entitlement, empathy over hate, and forgiveness and compassion over bitterness.     The JLCLF's goal is to create a more peaceful and loving world through planting these seeds of wisdom and teaching others how to choose love.	In 2016, after two years of developing a comprehensive Social and Emotional Learning-based curriculum with educators and other experts in the field of youth develpment and compassion-based learning, the JLCLF will launch our Choose Love Enrichment Program (CLEP).  CLEP will be offered online and internationally to educators and communities at no cost. The Foundation will provide the platform to reach every school, every child, every family, and every community around the globe.  We expect to have a positive impact on the climate in schools and to promote a host of academic, social, and emotional benefits for individual students. Ultimately, CLEP will increase a child's health and general well being and will lead to a happier and more successful and peaceful life.	Students, young people, adults, educators, and communities.
