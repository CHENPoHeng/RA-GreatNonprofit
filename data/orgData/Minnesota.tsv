Having bilingual staff who could communicate with students and parents was necessary in order to build trust and foster greater program outcomes.    Education and Training: Adult Basic Education classes include English language and literacy, math, digital literacy and job preparation classes. In 2015, HAP served more than 454 adult learners in these classes. The Hmong Karen Youth Pride out-of-school-time program operated in five elementary and middle schools in 2015 and provided quality after school instruction and in school support to more than 294 students in grades 2-8.

In a classroom environment, we help both children and parents acquire the tools needed to become integrated citizens of Central Minnesota."  Very often, the HANDS ACROSS THE WORLD classroom is the first formal school environment students have attended. Adults learn four communication skills: listening, speaking, reading, and writing; so that they are better equipped to communicate with others, continue their education and secure employment. Children are cared for and taught in a separate classroom.  Our students gain the skills and confidence to move on to community adult basic education. Over two dozen students have enrolled to work on their GED, and many will work towards a technical education at St. Cloud Technical College.  Over 1,000 Adults and their children have been served by HANDS ACROSS THE WORLD since its founding in 2003.   Basic philosophy of our program:  "Peace and Justice will reign in our world only to the extent that people learn to live together with a respectful attitude toward each other. Basic to building a sense of respect for the other is cultivating an interest in and knowledge of the others culture, traditions, as well as political and social/religious expectations. Others living in the same, common environment need a common language, and similar educational experiences to be able to relate in a meaningful manner.  The current refugee and immigrant population transitions occurring in the S. Cloud area, makes it imperative to set up programs that address the needs of both the people-on-the-move as well as those more stable residents in the geographic area.  It is the mission of Hands Across the World to collaborate, compliment, and enhance other existing programs in the area to fulfill the basic language and experiential needs of refugees and immigrants entering this mid-Minnesota scene."

Minnesota Environmental Partnership	http://www.mepartnership.org	651-290-0154	EIN 41-1986433	546 Rice St. Suite 100	St Paul	MN	55103	USA	Environment	Our mission is to strengthen the effectiveness and build the power of our members to achieve teh highest quality natural environment for Minnesotans.	Minnesota	See schedule omep's work is funded through individual investments, member group dues, and foundations. Three of mep's current foundation partners support mep through strategic two-year grants, which were each renewed in fy15. Mep's accounting procedures call for grants to be reported as revenue in the fiscal year in which they are received, or awarded, and released monthly as the terms of the grant are fulfilled, throughout the grant period. Because of this industry accepted accounting procedure, foundation grants intended for and kept for fy16 and beyond appear as revenue in this year's statement of activities and form 990. Core convening, coordination and capacity-building - as a coalition, mep's role is to bring organizations together to network, collaborate, and advocate to build their individual effectiveness, as well as for the coalition-identified priority initiatives. Mep coordinates member efforts so our community-wide resources are used as effectively and efficiently as possible. To this end, mep provides the environmental community the following services and strategic expertise:1. Leadership and expertise on collaborative issue initiatives: mep rallies the environmental and conservation community around priority issues, providing the leadership, expertise, communications and outreach, convening, and technical assistance needed to achieve results. We lead annual legislative initiatives as well as multi-year, multi-strategy campaigns. 2. Communications research, messaging and training: mep conducts annual public opinion research to track concerns and perceptions of our priority issues. Mep uses this data to develop compelling messages that are incorporated into online and printed materials, earned media, and electronic, social media and oral communications. We also provide communications training to our member group leaders and spokespeople. 3. Citizen engagement: mep works to build strong constituencies of environmentally-aware citizens across the state through grassroots organizing, partnering on environmentally-focused events, and efforts that encourage community leaders to act as spokespeople on key environmental issues. We use our minnesota environmental action network (mean) e-mail network and our rapid response phone system to activate citizens at key decision points. The mean is a shared system of mep's and many of our members' list resources that can reach tens of thousands of minnesotans on key environmental issues. Our use of the catalist, an enhanced database of more than four million minnesotans, furthers our ability to reach and engage and educate citizens in strategically targeted areas. We also provide forums for citizens to talk to decision makers in their home districts and at the state capitol. 4. Public education and outreach: we maintain a current media list of more than 300 reporters and publications of interest, and strong relationships with key environmental reporters to tell the story of minnesota's environmental policies. Mep also regularly reaches a broad and active online audience, with over 3,000 visitors to our website and loon commons blog each month, over 2,000 subscribers to our weekly update e-newsletters, and over 2,000 followers on both facebook and twitter. Each medium allows us to customize messages and provide our audience with targeted information. 5. Member services: mep convenes meetings of our members around timely issues and opportunities. We also build the capacity of our member groups by sponsoring trainings and provide targeted technical assistance to the clusters of groups working on priority issues. We help the conservation community "speak with one voice" on key emerging issues. Mep organizes and convenes the environmental and conservation organizations in the state in "clusters," or working groups, including: the clean water, great lakes, mining, and transportation now clusters, the clean energy & jobs campaign and the dedicated fund working group that focuses on safeguarding the state's clean water, land and legacy constitutional amendments. Through these groups, mep gathers members and other partners together to work together, share information and resources, and create shared positions and strategies. This model has proven to be effective at growing a strong, effective environmental advocacy sector, and able to accomplish things that individual organizations cannot. Current programs and accomplishments:simultaneously, this year was uncommonly encouraging and challenging for protecting minnesota's clean air and water. Throughout the 2015 legislative session, and special session, environmental issues were front and center. In the face of multiple proposals that would turn back minnesota's water protections and clean energy advancements, mep's clusters capitalized on the mep collaborative model, bringing together dozens of groups for a coordinated, multifaceted and effective effort that ultimately turned back the worst of the worst. Mep's position and clout as a leader of the environmental and conservation sector, helped influence governor dayton to accept mep's invitation to speak at the coalition's annual members meeting this past august 2015. It was at that meeting, before more than 100 people representing mep's member groups, that governor dayton chose to make a major announcement stating he would be using his executive order to create a new citizens' committee to advise the minnesota pollution control agency (mpca), replicating a board recently abolished by legislative action. Mep built on an already strong relationship with key reporters and editors across the state. Mep was visible in many articles written about key issues, including buffers, the mpca citizens' board, and "dirty water" provisions, and garnered publicity for public events such as a gathering on the governor's lawn, a press conference at the last meeting of the citizens' board, and announcing the reestablishment of the citizens board at the mep annual meeting. Mep also produced the environmental briefing book, making the case for the coalition's legislative priorities, and distributed it to legislators, agency staff, media, and mep supporters. Mep led the production and distribution of 29 sign on letters addressed to the governor, legislators, and other key officials on topics including supporting buffers, urging removal of the "dirty water" provisions, and urging the governor to veto the bill containing the "dirty water" provisions. Mep used its minnesota environmental action network to send 15 action alerts in 2015, eight of which were on clean water issues, including supporting buffers and comprehensive transit funding and opposing "dirty water" provisions, clean energy roll backs. Mep also convened critical meetings with key legislators and constituents in environmental forums, with excellent participation from constituents. Mep also played a major role in convening a celebration of the clean water, land and legacy amendment in january, with nearly 300 attendees, and a public forum on mercury in the st. Louis river in september, with about 75 attendees.   in addition to working on defensive strategies, mep's work focused on: forever green -in 2015, the legislature passed an additional $1 million for the forever green initiative for fy 2016. The minnesota senate had passed $1 million per year for the biennium. Biofuels -an agreement between mep, the water cluster and the bioeconomy coalition of minnesota was forged this spring to create production-based incentives for advanced biofuels that included a requirement for ramping up of perennial biomass use to 50% of the feedstock over five years. Another provision provided incentives for farmers to establish perennial crops in areas with high concentrations of agricultural water pollution. There was broad support for the package deal. The star tribune ran an editorial "adding jobs without hurting water quality" (4/8/2015), praising the solution. Unfortunately, the package fell victim to politics and the working crop lands incentive segment was dropped in final private negotiations. Buffers -in january, governor dayton made a bold proposal that all waterways in the state be buffered with 50 feet of vegetative cover. Mep recruited 30 groups to sign onto a letter thanking the governor for his proposal. Over the following weeks and months, mep activated its network and utilized the infrastructure that allowed good collaboration and work-sharing to support the governor's proposal. Mep produced two blog posts, an action alert that was sent to tens of thousands of minnesotans, and a press release. The star tribune ran two editorials praising the buffer proposal (buffer bill offers flexibility to farmers, 4/15/15; and don't backpedal on buffer strips bill, 5/5/15). In addition, mep joined with hunting, fishing, and 34 other conservation groups to form the buffersnow coalition. Mep was an integral part of creating and distributing 17 "buffer blitz" informational fact sheets to every legislator promoting topics such as the economic value to recreation; flexibility of the proposal, and the science of why buffers work. Buffer requirements were included in the final bill adopted and signed by governor dayton. Though much less sweeping than the original proposal, the new law will accelerate implementation of and compliance with existing laws. Mpca citizens' board -during the final hours of the legislative session, language was inserted repealing the minnesota pollution control agency (mpca) citizens' board, which was established to provide an open and transparent citizen-based decision-making process. After public urging from mep and members, including a meeting on the front lawn of the governor's residence, governor dayton vetoed the ag & environment budget bill citing this provision as a major reason. Unfortunately, the bill he ultimately signed still contained many bad provisions, including the elimination of the citizens' board. Mep and the water cluster continued to shine a light on the unfortunate loss of the board and urged the mpca and the governor to retain the positive qualities of the board. On august 4, 2015, governor dayton chose the mep annual meeting to announce the creation of a new citizens committee to advise the mpca. While the committee won't have the full authority of the previous board it does provide a level of open and transparent discussion. Clean energy -since 2013, mep worked closely with the clean energy & jobs campaign, a broader coalition of environment and labor, to push for an increase in the existing renewable energy standard (res) to 40% by 2030 and improve the yearly energy savings goal for utilities from 1. 5%-2%. We conducted public opinion polling on clean energy issues, in february and july of 2014, which showed overwhelming public support for both an increased res and energy efficiency. However, during the session provisions were added to the house energy bill that would have rolled back, rather than increased the standards. Through the work of the clean energy & jobs campaign, we were successfully able to hold any rollbacks off, but were not able to achieve our goal of a 40% res and an efficiency standard of 2%. Mep and our member groups are regrouping to determine the best possible next steps. In addition, mep is working to support the full implementation of the national environmental protection agency's clean power plan in minnesota. Transportation -transportation generates 24% of the carbon pollution in minnesota, second only to the power sector. Air quality is often worst near areas with bad traffic congestion. These means those living close to major roads and highways confront the highest health risks due to poor air quality. For the past few years, mep worked with the movemn campaign to support a 10-year transportation plan that invests not only in roads and bridges, but also transit and safe walking and biking infrastructure throughout the state. While a comprehensive transportation package did not become a reality this year, mep and our members are now strategizing our next steps to passing a comprehensive and balanced transportation package in minnesota. Sulfide mining -proposed sulfide mines in northeast minnesota, such as the polymet northmet project, threaten our lakes and rivers with significant ongoing pollution. It is now clear that the polymet mine will undoubtedly have long-lasting negative effects; polymet's own data show that ongoing water treatment would be required for 500 years or more after the mine has stopped. Mep has leveraged our position to convene the mining cluster, which was a major catalyst in generating more than 50,000 public comments (98% of which oppose the mine). In addition, we've been publicly highlighting the danger to the st. Louis river. Earlier this year the river was named one of american rivers 10 most endangered rivers because of the polymet project, which we worked to publicize in the media and through our own and members' communications and action alerts.

The woman's club was originated by six women who realized that they could achieve more in the community collectively than they could individually. They began meeting in 1907 and continued growing until they built the building located at 410 oak grove st. In minneapolis. They are responsible in large part for the milk program and lunch program in the minneapolis public schools. The purification of water in the city of minneapolis and had a great hand in the public health nursing program and have donated over four and a half million dollars to programs for women and children in need since 1907. We have hosted national night out at the woman's club of minneapolis annually since 2009. It is held on the first tuesday of august. We have on average around 500 in attendance each year. The woman's club grant recipients and other 501(c)(3) organizations in the neighborhood are invited to set up a table to educate the community on the benefits of their particular organizations. We donate $1,500 to this event and approximately 75 volunteer hours. Community outreach has always been the mission-based foundation of the woman's club of minneapolis. We have continued and even stepped up most of our traditional activities and we have also begun some new ones. Project diva is our newest partnership. Project diva was introduced to us by pam lehan, our general manager. Four of our junior members are on the board of directors of project diva. Project diva is a nonprofit that was founded by a young, african american woman by the name of neda kellogg. Their mission is to mentor at-risk girls ages 13 - 19 to advocate and mentor them. There are approximately 30 girls in the program. We meet with them once a month for what is referred to as "lunch and learns" which are sponsored by the club. We provide a speaker, and an etiquette segment to the class. Our members also mentor the girls on a one to one basis. Right now 6 of our members are mentors to the girls as well as our own executive chef. The woman's club has also provided the funds for our community outreach dollars to purchase uniform shirts that the girls wear to the lunches and events. Another new event sponsored by the woman's club and community outreach was an event called "girls rock the capitol. " it was an all day programs at the state capitol in february, where girls ages 13-18 learned about state government and were given access to women in leadership roles where they learned to advocate for themselves and what they believed in. The woman's club was a $500 "gold level" sponsor which meant that our name and logo were included on invitations, email outreach, programs and on the minnesota women's consortium website. The event received some great press in the local media, and they were very grateful for our support. Each year we host the memorial blood bank at the club two times a year in february and october and supply them with the space, food and beverage to facilitate their mobile crew and the ability to reach others to secure emergency blood donations. The room lent to them is typically rented at a rate of $500 each time (2 times = $1000 annually) and $100 (2 times = $200) in food and beverage which are both donated by the club. Every tuesday there is an educational program that is put on for the benefit of the women of the club. The topics vary, such as history, global issues, etc. The women of this club also renovated and restored "the ard godfrey" house which is the oldest remaining wood frame house in the city of minneapolis. The wood frame house has been restored and maintained by the woman's club since 1990. The members of the woman's club of minneapolis offer educational tours throughout the summer and employ students as tour guides for the house (museum). We house a circulating library within our club and the members volunteer their time in the library. The club offers a meet the artist event every six weeks. A different struggling artist brings in their work to hang in our dining room gallery and the public is invited to view their work. The organization of the woman's club of minneapolis has 42 committees. To name a few; the writer's guild, environment and garden, drama appreciation, music appreciation, four reading groups and the history committee. The club sponsors four prizes in the minnesota history day competition each year: best junior high project on women's history, best senior high project on women's history, best junior high project on african- american history and best senior high project on african american history. Needlework guild - since the 1920's the needlework guild has made thousands of new garments for those less fortunate. The club provides the guild money for fabric, yarn, trims and sewing notions and sewing machine repair. The guild makes the chemo caps and lap robes for the cancer patients and baby layettes for moms that cannot afford to purchase baby clothes. They also make items for the minnesota visiting nurse agency, children's home society and family service's "little red stocking" project and the jones harrison home for the elderly.

PL2V is not a political lobbying organization and does not participate in lobbying efforts of any kind.   The most recent posting by Gunny79 is the same person who for several years has tried to tarnish our name and reputation and now with hacking our Twitter account and posting false tweets.  The six 1 star reviews are from the same group of individuals over and over claiming to be donors who have never donated to PL2V. They have with willful intent mislead anyone who reads their phony reviews in an attempt to sway people away from donating.   We do however post re-tweets from many individuals and veteran groups on Twitter supporting disabled veterans from all across America. This is neither an endorsement of a candidate, group, individual or party as suggested nor a recommendation for any political party or candidate.  In a country where veterans fight for all American's rights including freedom of speech, we will support anyone no matter who they are that supports disabled veterans with PTSD, TBI and MST and their efforts to help these disabled American veterans.    This has included but is not limited to:  The DAV, The VFW and The American Legion of which many of PL2V veterans belong to. This does not mean PL2V endorses any of their positions in the political arena or if they are a political member of any party that it is an endorsement of that person's or groups political party or their political ideologies or agendas.

We also conducted around 10-12 informational postcard drops around the twin cities, put up two billboard messages across the street from the minneapolis public schools district headquarters, we wrote numerous impactful blogs and email blasts, developed widely-shared charts and images, delivered many presentations to local audiences, and made appearances on local radio and television. Finally, we also took the first steps toward expanding better ed's national influence through regularly linking to its materials on our national audiences of intellectual takeout and momthink. Social media pagesin 2014 we also continued to educate our other social media audiences - which consist of the facebook pages of intellectual takeout and momthink- on the principles and virtues necessary for human flourishing. These audiences also continued to grow in 2014, illustrating that our messaging continues to resonate with the american public. By the end of 2014, our aggregate audiences on these pages totaled just under 1. 1 million people. Our weekly reach (the number of people who engage with our content each week) averaged between 3-5 million people. We have thus positioned ourselves to have an expanded role in influencing and shaping public discourse in the coming years. Staff changesas part of our strategic plan, intellectual takeout also made some staff changes. We promoted our director of academics, daniel lattier, to vice president in order to help implement the strategic plan and direct the organization's content development. We also hired two new staff members in the area of development - barbara malzacher and adam stolpestad - to increase intellectual takeout's fundraising capacities, especially in the area of foundations. Looking forwardwe are excited about the progress intellectual takeout experienced in 2014, and are looking forward to a continued implementation of our strategic plan in 2015. As part of this plan, better ed is looking to increase its educational role with legislative issues in 2015, in addition to expanding its informational efforts to other states. We are also planning on developing much more unique educational content for our national social media audiences that will be linked to from new websites for each page. We are also hoping that our fundraising efforts will allow us to hire more staff in the areas of content production and project oversight.

To provide assistance throughout minnesota to positively motivate veterans and their families who are homeless or experiencing other life crises. Macv accomplishes its mission by providing services directly or in collaboration with other service agencies.		Since 1990, minnesota assistance council for veterans (macv) has exclusively served minnesota veterans who are in crisis, at-risk for homelessness or currently homeless. While macv began as a single home for veterans, today it is a multi-faceted social services agency with multiple locations throughout minnesota to meet the complex needs of veterans. Macv not only assists veterans who are currently homeless, but also places a great deal of emphasis on the prevention of homelessness. Macv's history demonstrates a steady growth of programs to fill gaps veterans experience in existing service systems, including emergency assistance, housing, employment assistance, and civil legal help. Macv does not duplicate services already provided or available to veterans through federal, state or county benefits; rather, macv frequently acts as a resource or liaison between government agencies and other service providers to ensure direct, comprehensive services are provided to the veteran without duplication of effort or resources. Macv has four main program emphases: emergency assistance, housing, employment and civil legal services. Macv provides inclusive support services for each program area. - approximately 1,800 veterans (clients) received services in 2014 representing all mn counties; 756 (42%) were literally homeless- 25,000+ contacts throughout the year- operates three regional offices for statewide outreach: mankato, duluth, twin cities- provides 11 transitional homes for veterans; 8 in the metro, 1 in st.

The pilots are now paying $5.25 per gallon of gas.. Wings pays nothing for storage of planes, maintenance costs, training costs or anything else that is associated with keeping the plane and the pilot current. Our pilots are the nucleus of our organization. Take for instance the Schmidt boys. The twin boys, from Minot ND, were born with cerebral palsy. They had previously undergone corrective hip surgery which left them in full body casts. Steve Nelson, the pilot, flew to Minot and St. Paul''s Gillette hospital twice (back and forth, back and forth) that day. His plane is equipped with one stretcher, our only stretcher. The human service aspect of our organization is the main reason why pilots enjoy flying for us. Although reimbursement of the cost of aviation fuel to the pilots is an incentive, it is nothing compared to the hug and smile Steve Nelson received from the mother of the twins after making those 2 flights.		Pilots love to fly for us.  For a pilot to keep their license current, they have to fly a set number of hours.  Wings missions provide documented hours and a charitable human service that is appreciated, usually with a smile or a hug from the recipient.  Although Wings does not usually perform emergency air transport, recipient Melissa Robels? was an exception.  Melissa?s doctor evacuated New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina because his house had been flooded and looted during the aftermath.  The Doctor left behind numerous patients;  Melissa, a young woman with a serious abdominal wound along with spina bifida was one of his abandoned patients.  One of our pilots, Richard Labute, was contacted by the Allina Health System and he along with co-pilot Dan Totushek flew from Buffalo MN to Signature Aviation at Louis Armstrong airport in New Orleans to pick up Melissa.  They then flew back to the Buffalo MN airport where representatives from Abbott Northwestern took over Melissa?s care.   Melissa is currently living in the Twin Cities area with her aunt and as of last conversation, is doing well.  Most of the time, our recipients are not emergency patients.  They are medical patients who receive follow-up treatments for cancer, cerebral palsy, breathing problems or spinal surgery.  All of our recipients have medical insurance.  Most of our recipients are referred to us by social workers and clergy throughout the upper midwest area. They must prove financial as well as medical need.  Our recipients are not able to be transported via van, bus, or train for a number of reasons;  the alignment of their bodies simply cannot make it onto the van, bus or train; their immune system needs to be protected or they or their caregiver, have already missed so much work due to the illness that any more time off for the longer trips would put them on the unemployment line, thus losing medical insurance and their standard of living.  Most of our recipients fit all three of these criteria.  Wings requires two FAA certified pilots on each flight plus a nurse or a family member to accompany the recipient.  The 2 pilots ensure increased safety and the nurse or the family member ensure peace of mind not only for the recipient but the pilots as well.  Our recipients have scheduled appointments for their treatments, sometimes months in advance.   Canceling a flight on behalf of Wings would be detrimental to the recovery of our recipients.   Our program would cease to exist due to the recipient not being able to trust us to get them to their destination on time.

The Ordway piloted a professional development series for teachers, specific to a school location, in collaboration with the Perpich Center. Teaching artists led arts-based lessons that were followed by structured conversations on lesson format and instructional practice. Sixty teachers participated in the three sessions.   Building our Audience:     We increased the number of college students attending Ordway performances through our Campus Connections program. By tracking attendance with special promotional codes, we have been able to determine that 1,706 students from Macalester College and the University of Saint Thomas attended Ordway performances during the 2009 to 2010 season, whereas only 517 attended during the 2008 to 2009 season.    We implemented an advocates program to help diversify our audience. Leaders in specific cultural communities receive discount codes and promotional materials they can distribute to their contacts. For example, Robin Hickman of SoulTouch Productions was contracted as a liaison to the African American community.    We are strengthening our season subscriber base, taking into account the decreased number of shows we had in this past season. For 2008 to 2009, we sold 7,431 season subscriber packages; during the 2009 to 2010 season, we sold 5,220 to date.  Building Contributed Support:     We are building stronger relationships with existing and potential individual donors through benefits such as our Contributors Lounge (for patrons who contribute $1,000 or more annually), our 25th Anniversary campaign, Donor Dinners, and other insider events.    Our Development Committee added two members and has become more active by signing request letters, recruiting new donors, and holding Ordway Fan Club events.    We acquired three new corporate sponsorships last fiscal year: Wells Fargo Bank for the annual Flint Hills International Childrens Festival, U.S. Trust for the Donor Dinners, and Securian for the Contributors Lounge.    We are cultivating potential new corporate sponsors such as Delta Airlines for our Performance Season and Treasure Island Resort and Casino for the production of Guys and Dolls.     We acquired new, national foundation grants this past fiscal year including a Joyce Award from the Joyce Foundation and an education grant from the Japan Foundation.    We maintained most of our foundation donors despite the downturn in the economy.    We implemented a Box Office donation request that all patrons receive when they call to purchase tickets. During fiscal year 2010 we raised over $7,000 through the Box Office.    We have further disseminated the information that the Ordway is a nonprofit organization with our letterhead and all of our fundraising communications.

WATCH	http://www.watchmn.org	(612) 341-2747	EIN 41-1720822	608 2nd Ave South Northstar East Ste 465	Minneapolis	MN	55402	USA	Child Abuse Prevention, Crime & Law, Crime & Legal-Related, Domestic Violence, Spouse Abuse Prevention, Women, Womens Service Clubs	WATCH was created in 1992 as a community response to newspaper reports of a lax, revolving-door justice system which failed to process cases of sexual assault and domestic abuse effectively. Volunteers, recognized by their red clipboards, are trained to monitor these cases as they move through the Hennepin County criminal justice system. WATCH now serves as a national model for court-monitoring programs in other jurisdictions.		In january 2014, watch began its sex trafficking project, which entails monitoring every case of sex trafficking in hennepin and ramsey counties in minnesota. The monitoring in ramsey county represented watch's first-ever expansion into ramsey. The sex trafficking cases are being monitored by watch volunteers from first appearance through sentencing, and include post-sentencing monitoring for any probation violations. While watch is maintaining comprehensive data on both juvenile and adult trafficking cases, the main focus of the study is on sex trafficked juveniles. Following the passage of the minnesota's safe harbor law in 2011, and which was fully implemented in august 2014, watch undertook monitoring juvenile sex trafficking cases to record the volume of these cases, how they were being charged, the demographics of the cases, how the cases were resolved, as well as what the sentences are. In addition to this information, as well as its volunteers' observations, watch also maintains other comprehensive data on how each case is processed and handled. The next phase of this study will involve interviewing law enforcement, prosecutors, defendants, and judges regarding the specifics of particular cases. Watch expects to issue a report on its findings in the fall of 2016, two full years after safe harbor was fully implemented. In 2014, watch recruited and trained more than three times the number of new volunteers than it has during any time in its history, and that trend has continued throughout 2015. With those volunteers, watch monitored more than 3,000 court hearings. To increase its volunteer ranks, watch formed alliances with several local undergraduate and graduate schools. To facilitate its volunteers' experience, watch streamlined its training program, and moved it completely on-line. This allows volunteers to complete training at their convenience, and from any location. Watch also moved its data collection and maintenance system on-line. This means that volunteers can upload their courtroom observations remotely, without returning to the watch offices. This upgrade allows for monitoring outside of hennepin county. Watch completely overhauled and upgraded its website, thanks to a grant from the pohlad foundation and its partnership with reve academy. Finally, watch reinstated its newsletter, renaming it the watch chronicle, in a new, more user-friendly format. The newsletter goes out via email on a monthly basis to 800 donors, judicial system participants, and other watch stakeholders.

We support the development of self-sufficiency in every person, regardless of background, economic status, or level of ability. We strengthen the community by preparing individuals to assume their roles as workers, parents, and citizens.	Minneapolis/St. Paul	Summit academy oic is a non-profit vocational training and educational center based in north minneapolis with over 40 years' experience helping twin cities' residents in economically depressed neighborhoods acquire the tools they need to become educated, employed, and self-supporting. Summit academy is the only community-based vocational training and job-placement program in north minneapolis accredited by the north central association commission on schools and registered with the minnesota higher education services office. At summit academy oic, we believe the best social service program in the world is a job. Graduates from our adult education programs are given the opportunity to lift themselves up from a life of poverty and hopelessness onto a path that will lead to a better life for themselves and their families. Where before, these men and women were limited by chronic unemployment, a complete lack of resources, and in many cases, a lack of faith in themselves, they now have the chance to fundamentally change their circumstances by increasing their income and their quality of life. When adults work full-time living-wage jobs, they become role models to young adults and children, families become more stable, and the cycle that has kept their communities poor and crime-ridden is broken. These positive changes continue to ripple out even further into the larger community as fewer social services and incarceration costs are incurred and graduates begin to pay taxes. After receiving training in community healthcare, energy efficiency and green construction, these graduates have gone on to work in jobs that directly improve minnesota's infrastructure. Summit academy offers adult education and support services that are tailored to the specific needs of the communities we serve. Our career and technology center provides pre-apprentice training in construction (hundred hard hats program), with specific tracks in carpentry, weatherization technology, commercial & green roofing, electrical work, heavy equipment operations and residential rehabilitation technology. The ctc also offers programs in community healthcare with community health worker (chw), certified nursing assistant (cna) training and pharmaceutical technician. These career tracks are all supported with services that develop students' life skills and assist in job seeking, placement, and retention. In this fiscal year (july 1, 2014 - june 30, 2015), summit's career and technology center served 545 adult students, and 281 graduated or remained enrolled to complete their training. Year-to-date summit has placed 279 adults, compared to 295 in the previous period. Job earnings for both programs are at an average of $14. 99 per hour. Current tracking results indicate that 65% of summit's job placements have retained their jobs for more than 180 days.	452 Students Enrolled during fiscal year 2008/2009 (July 1, 2008 - June 30, 2009). 136 Graduates (160 remained enrolled) 112 Students Placed in Jobs Average Placement Wage of $13.05

Our Vision We believe there is great hope for the future to prevent many stillbirths in the United States and around the world and we intend to bring this hope to light.  We envision that through the utilization of technology, education and grassroots efforts, we can empower parents and families to be an advocate for their unborn babies.   We Believe Many stillbirths are preventable.  Expectant parents should be informed about stillbirth risks and educated on ways to protect their pregnancy.  Standard prenatal protocols should include a third trimester ultrasound to identify known stillbirth risk factors and subsequent management through home fetal monitoring when risk factors are identified.  A national stillbirth registry should be created with mandatory participation to accurately collect stillbirth data.  Stillbirth autopsies should be encouraged and performed consistently with established protocols.  Stillborn children should be recognized with a certificate of birth.  Families deserve and are entitled to support and guidance when facing the delivery of a stillborn child.  Stillbirth, birth injury (cerebral palsy and others), premature birth and miscarriages may have some common denominators - finding answers to stillbirth may enlighten the path to reducing miscarriage, premature birth, and birth injury	Nationwide	See Me, Feel Me - Stillbirth awareness and prevention Birth Planning and Companioning International Stillbirth Research Summit Stillbirth Research The Journal of Stillbirth Stillbirth Registry	During 2010 the Star Legacy Foundation accomplished a number of organizational goals including the publishing of a cookbook as a fund raising effort, redesign of the website, board development, the 5th annual Golfing for Garrett benefit and more.  In 2011 the Star Legacy Foundation developed a stillbirth awareness and prevention campaign "See Me, Feel Me" designed to encourage parents to advocate for their unborn child.  (www.seemefeelme.org)  In late 2011 the Star Legacy Foundation will host the first Stillbirth Summit bringing together an international panel of independent researchers to share their research efforts and collaborate on moving the stillbirth prevention agenda forward.		To date the Star Legacy Foundation has donated over $260,000 to the stillbirth research projects.  In addition the Foundation held the first ever Stillbirth Summit in 2011; published a Summary of the Stillbirth Summit and is currently conducting a research project - the STARS Study.

Urban Homeworks Inc	http://www.urbanhomeworks.org	(612) 724-9002	EIN 41-1821520	2015 Emerson Ave N	Minneapolis	MN	55411	USA	Community & Neighborhood Development, Community Coalitions, Economic Development, Employment Preparation & Procurement, Homeless & Housing, Housing Rehabilitation, Job Training	Perpetuate the hope of jesus christ through innovative community development that produces equitable dignified housing, a strategic network of good neighbors and the redemptive development of real estate.	Disadvantaged neighborhoods in Minneapolis and St. Paul, MN.	Real estate development - acquisition of housing:urban homeworks has constructed, rehabilitated and managed scattered, multi-unit and single-family housing in distressed areas of minneapolis and st. Paul since 1995. We are unique in the twin cities in our focus on smaller, multi-unit rental properties. We have committed to this approach to building healthy neighborhoods through multiple access points in the housing ecosystem. Specifically, these properties, along with affordable single-family homes, provide critical access to family-sized rental properties and homeownership for our largest demographic of housing participants - families in need of 3 or more bedrooms. Since the organization was founded, it has rehabilitated, rented and managed over 170 units. Urban homeworks currently has a portfolio inventory of 119 multi-family rental units, 29 single family homes, and 12 vacant lots for future single family new construction. Rehabilitation of housing:our model for rehabilitating housing leverages our housing development and construction process to maximize the economic and social benefit to the communities we serve. Reclaiming abandoned/foreclosed properties is a cost-effective approach to increasing the housing supply in the twin cities. We have looked at our real estate development efforts and determined the investment can do more than just add much needed housing units; our affordable housing investments are directly tied to our efforts to trigger both a housing and economic recovery through partnerships, hands-on training and job creation. Through collaboration, our model is designed to expand economic opportunities and the economic impact of our work in the communities we serve through localized hiring of underutilized local, minority, female and section 3 subcontractors and trainees; deliberate training of individuals with barriers to work and at-risk youth; job connections and job creation. This component of our program ensures dollars invested in housing remain in the community in which they are intended to benefit - thus layering the impact of the housing development investment. All construction training completed on urban homeworks' worksites are done in partnership with our training partners: goodwill easter seals and tree trust's youthbuild programming. Construction skills trainees are male and female localized residents in our service area who are unemployed and low-income households and under employed prior to entry into the program. Many have barriers to full time employment prior to program participation. Construction skills training activities occur on our housing development work-sites. Through deliberate project design, we have embedded high-touch work force development with hard construction skills training. Volunteers are an essential component to our programming. In 2014, 1,188 volunteers worked alongside our subcontractors and trainees, donating 3,183 volunteer days on urban homeworks' job sites and to our programming efforts. In late 2013, as part of our effort to collectively grow the economic impact in our community, urban homeworks launched our urban construction company (uc2). Uc2 is a social venture designed to engage low-income, at-risk youth that have completed construction training through our partner tree trust and wish to work in the construction trades, but lack sufficient job experience to attain full-time employment. Our pilot provides paid, benefited position with deliberate job skill development specific to building codes and core building competencies of concrete/masonry, general carpentry and building processes. As we enter our second summer of the pilot, we have 100% retention of the initial cohort with an additional crew member added during the summer of 2014. The work sites are deliberately utilized as a space to learn with support. The uc2 staff are on-site as mentors and teachers while holding the crew responsible to the work. The hours spent alongside their mentors and their peers shingling roofs, paving driveways, building stairs and decks, etc. Has resulted in a level of experience and commitment that could not have been achieved in a traditional training program. Our model uses the experience of work well done to educate and motivate our crew. These "real-world" skills will serve them well as they enter into the construction trades, continue with their education or another chosen field of work.   rental programs -occupancy of housing:housing - rental programming - our restored units are well-built, maintained, affordable rental opportunities for individuals and families priced out of many twin cities rental markets. Partnerships with local social service organizations provide additional support by serving as advocates for the residents and providing necessary social services. Resources from these social service partners, combined with a supportive landlord and quality, dignified housing, weave a web of support for program participants. Through stable, dignified rental properties, individuals are able to become part of their community support structures, schools and economic opportunities. Housing - ownership programming - project: reclaim preserves existing affordable housing by capturing properties that have not been maintained as viable units by market forces, and restores them to their highest use: perpetually affordable homeownership opportunities that are contributing physical assets for the neighborhood. Project: reclaim mitigates the economic and social impact of underutilized, vacant and/or foreclosed single family homes. Project: reclaim hinges on a responsible contract for deed which allows families to begin living in the home while they participate in financial literacy training carefully designed to provide the opportunity for adequate credit repair and deep financial education tied to financial stability and home ownership. Families accepted into the program are coached extensively by urban homeworks' staff and commit to developing and executing a detailed, individual work plan starting with homestrech classes followed by pre-purchase classes at city of lakes community land trust, financial literacy/budgeting classes at buildwealth mn or lutheran social services and regularly scheduled monthly check-ins with urban homeworks' staff along with quarterly financial reviews to ensure financial goals and benchmarks are being met. The financial education commitment continues for as long as a participant is in the contract for deed program (typically 2-5 years). Unique to our model is our high-touch, real-world application of financial learning. We are connecting instruction to outcomes applicable to individual families. The depth of this combined learning/application experience creates true financial knowledge and long-range planning that extends to reducing debt, decreasing monthly housing related expenses, setting and adhering to a monthly budget, increasing credit scores and finding ways to increase or stabilize streams of income. The impact of our committed approach to financial literacy has resulted in improved financial health for our participants over time: " the average participant initial credit score is 560. " the average participant final/current credit score is 621. " the average credit score increase is 61 points. " the average annual increase is 42 points. (participants' time in programming varies). Northside home partnership is programmatically similar to project: reclaim, but is specific to north minneapolis. In partnership with project for pride in living, urban homeworks will purchase and renovate over time a total of 100 single-family homes. The homes will be rented to families; households will attend financial training until they qualify for a mortgage to purchase the home. All homes will ultimately be sold to owner occupied households. Community engagement:urban homeworks' approach to community engagement is rooted in the goal that all programs we operate are inextricably linked to the authentic expression of the community's vision. Through a continual feedback loop from acquisition through occupancy, we are building a collaborative web of dovetailed expertise to collectively build sustainable, equitable solutions across the social and economic continuum of the twin cities. Engagement work happens on a resident level through informal and formal networks, neighborhood events, connections with resources in the community, participation in urban homeworks planning and work, and many other opportunities as our pods grow organically and respond to real-time conditions. Pod areas are determined by having both high instances of housing instability and a high need for engagement to build community networks. As part of our community engagement effort, we have developed our unique urban neighbors program which places "urban neighbors" in one unit of a small multi-family building, typically a duplex, triplex or fourplex. The urban neighbor community is a faith-motivated, ministry-of presence experience for college students and working professionals. Urban neighbors volunteer 2-3 hours per week under the leadership of other organizations already working in the community. To date, these hours have been served at more than 40 nonprofits including dinomights, kinship, english learning center, american indian oic, neighborhood schools and churches, and many more.   other programsincludes other community development activities not directly related to the rental or real estate development programs, but are in line with the organization's mission.	Community Development in 2012: 252 family members live in Urban Homeworks housing. 56 Urban Neighbors are engaging in a program that challenges presumptions of poverty and the city. 107 community members are receiving training that can change the legacy of their family. 30 rental will be redemptively redeveloped from foreclosure. 8 homes will be completed to rebuild the foundation of focused areas, providing affordable home ownership

Box 26274	Minneapolis	MN	55426	USA	Group Homes	In a given year, over 1.35 million children are estimated to experience homelessness in America.  Homeless children are now among the fastest growing segments of the homeless population.  Federal legislation broadly defines homeless children as individuals who lack a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence.  This definition not only includes children living in shelters, but also those living in cars, motels, trailer parks, substandard housing, shared housing (due to the loss of housing or economic hardship), and other places not ordinarily used as sleeping accommodations for humans.  According to the most recent data available, 25% of homeless students resided in shelters and 50% resided in doubled-up situations.In the 1980''s and 1990''s, federal response to the growing crisis of homelessness in America led to the awareness that only 55% of homeless children (K-12) were regularly attending school.  Data from 2000 reveal that 77% of homeless children (K-12) were regularly attending school, and 15% of homeless preschool children were enrolled in school programs.  Although the 2000 data has shown significant progress in the attendance of K-12 students, one out of every four homeless children is still not attending school and six out of every seven preschool children are not enrolled in early learning programs.  Undoubtedly, much work remains to be done.Compared to their peers, homeless children are more likely to suffer from health problems, developmental delays, learning disabilities, emotional difficulties, and mental disorders.  Furthermore, the high mobility associated with homelessness has been shown to negatively impact a child?s education.  Research findings on mobility and academic achievement reveal that compared to their housed peers, mobile students are half as likely to graduate from high school and twice as likely to repeat a grade.NAEHCY''s mission is to connect all those working in homeless education - educators, advocates, researchers, parents, policy makers, and service providers - in the effort to ensure the academic and overall success of all children in homeless situations.  We fervently believe that education is vital to breaking the cycle of poverty and homelessness; therefore, we work to ensure that vulnerable children receive an education and be afforded the greatest opportunity to succeed in life.		NAEHCY's programs include:(1) Organizing an annual national conference convening educators, advocates, researchers, and service providers to provide professional development and networking opportunities in addressing the educational needs of homeless children(2) Administering the LeTendre Education Fund, which is a scholarship program for homeless youth who have demonstrated academic achievement and are pursuing higher education(3) Monitoring and analyzing legislation impacting the education of homeless children (e.g. Head Start, IDEA, McKinney-Vento)(4) Developing position papers, policy recommendations, and advocacy tools for members, stakeholders, and national partner organizations(5) Communicating with Congressional offices and federal agencies to advance NAEHCY's recommendations(6) Collaborating with national organizations such as housing, homeless, domestic violence, education, child welfare, and faith-based organizations on policy strategy and action(7) Providing professional development training at 60-70 national, state, and local conferences per year, including local Head Start agencies, school districts, homeless coalitions, statewide homeless liaison conferences, and national conferences such as Title I, Head Start, Health Care for the Homeless, Runaway and Homeless Youth, and National Network for Youth.

Community based mentoringbig brothers big sisters of the greater twin cities' (bbbs) community-based program is our original mentoring model, where an adult mentor is matched with a child, typically ages 8 12 at the time of the match. We provide professional support in making that match and ongoing professional support. The parents/guardians are required to be actively engaged with the match. Our matches are professionally supported until the mentee (little brother or little sister) graduates from high school or reaches age 18, or the match closes at the request of one of the participants or the agency. Matches meet two to four times a month at a time and location that works for all participants, and matches engage in a variety of activities that help strengthen the mentorship and assist the childs development everything from enjoying mutual interests, such as playing board games or working on homework to learning new skills or attending a movie or sports game. Additionally, bbbs offers regular match activities throughout the community such as arts introductions, sports clinics, picnics, games, cultural events, and a variety of learning opportunities.   site based mentoringlike the community-based mentoring program, bbbs site-based mentoring pairs children with volunteer mentors, and matches meet at a bbbs-approved location regularly, typically meeting a school weekly throughout the school year, during or immediately after the school day. The site-based program is unique in the fact that not all mentors are adults we have a high school mentors program that pairs high school students with elementary school youth, and we have staff on-site supporting these matches during their weekly meetings. In addition to supporting the little brothers and sisters, bbbs also provides a variety of training, leadership development and career and college readiness services to the high school mentors. The program served little brothers and sisters from 30 different schools in fy 2014, including schools in saint paul, minneapolis, suburban hennepin county, and washington county. Through the beyond school walls variation of our program, we served youth in partner schools to transport them to one of three corporate sites for biweekly mentoring sessions with their bigs.   education and enrichment (e&e)since 2006, bbbs of the greater twin cities has been providing education and enrichment programming to encourage the youth it serves to complete high school and plan for their college and career futures. During the 2013-2014 academic year, 575 youth participated in at least one of bbbs education and enrichment activities. The majority of youth served through the program are in active mentoring relationships and already being served through the community-based and site-based mentoring program, but the education team also serves former littles and former high school bigs (our alumni), and some other youth who come to us through partnerships. The types of services offered include focus on college and career readiness and exploration, college planning and admissions, and health and wellness skills and knowledge development. For instance, bbbs offers individual college counseling (including college application and financial assistance application preparation), a college club with college tours, topical workshops and fairs, career exploration events, referrals to apprenticeship and job training programs, summer work opportunities (such as step up and right track), and sexual health training and programming, focusing on preventing teen parenting, and leadership development opportunities. Mentors and parents/guardians are invited to join the youth during the events to give the youth a wider support system.   other services that support and enhance the three major programs are enrollment of children and volunteers, and program administration, which includes child safety training.

Dads Make A Difference	http://www.dadsmakeadifference.org	651-338-8386	EIN 34-2060325	PO Box 231	Stillwater	MN	55082	USA	Children & Youth, Family Counseling, Leadership Development, Youth Community Service Clubs	Dads Make a Difference (DMAD) addresses two issues that significantly impact the financial stability and self-reliance of families  absent fathers and too-early parenting.  The value of healthy fatherhood is increasingly evident, with research, public policy, and communities all acknowledging the need for children to experience positive relationships with both men and women.  Healthy fatherhood complements and supports healthy motherhood.  Children benefit from the wealth of each parent's life experiences, different styles, and approaches to dealing with life.  Yet looking at male socialization, we often see a scarcity of healthy adult male role models for boys and a lack of education about what it means to grow up to become a positive man and father.  In many ways, our culture fails to provide boys and men sufficient direction and support in order for them to define and adopt healthy expressions of masculinity and fatherhood.  Prior to becoming dads, young men often do not give a great deal of thought or attention to whether they would like to have children, how many, and what they want their families to look like.  As a result, they dont engage in conversations about family formation and planning. Young men need the ability to be partners in conversations about pregnancy prevention and family planning, an important aspect of their development and important to their long-term success.	Minnesota statewide, about 70% metro and 30% greater MN.  We have also done some national replication and have an international presence as well.	DMAD peer education promoting the positive involvement of fathers and educating youth about responsible parenting.	DMAD builds life skills so youth are prepared to think critically about healthy relationships, becoming sexually active, and the consequences of parenting too soon.  Too-early parenting and absent fathers are identified risk factors for poverty.  Youth are educated about the emotional, physical, and financial responsibilities of having children.  Educated youth are more likely to make mature decisions about relationships, take personal responsibility for life choices including their readiness to parent, and understand how children benefit from father involvement and co-parenting.  As DMAD youth transition to adulthood, their communities are strengthened because they are better equipped to make intentional choices about creating families.  DMAD works at the most basic level to empower youth to be self-sufficient and reach their full potential by engaging teens in leadership roles and as the messengers to younger youth.  DMAD works diligently on its outreach to youth of color as they are affected disproportionately by too-early pregnancy and by poverty.  Having the important conversation about when to have a child and who to have that child with is not easy.  DMAD was developed to help young people consider the very important decision about when to become a parent, to include young men in the conversation, and to help young women recognize the importance of a father to their future child. From October 1994 through April 2016, DMAD trained 3,095 teen peer educators from 170 schools and community agencies across the state.  These teens in turn taught the curriculum to about 79,000 middle school-age youth in urban, suburban, and rural settings.	We train high school-age teens, boys and girls, to be peer educators of middle school-age youth using the DMAD curriculum in schools, community agencies, and faith-based groups.	About 500 youth
