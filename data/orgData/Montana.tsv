American Prairie Reserve	http://www.americanprairie.org	(406) 922-0793	EIN 81-0541893	PO Box 908	Bozeman	MT	59771	USA	Environment	American Prairie Reserve's mission is to create and manage a prairie-based wildlife reserve that, when combined with public lands already devoted to wildlife, will protect a unique natural habitat, provide lasting economic benefits and improve public access to and enjoyment of the prairie landscape.	Reserve area management and economic/educational programs  land acquisition - includes a portion of salaries and payment of professional fees dedicated to land acquisition to fulfill the organization's mission  bison program			The goal of American Prairie Reserve (APR) is to create the largest wildlife reserve in the lower forty-eight states, consisting of approximately 3.5 million acres of both private and public lands. APR intends to acquire and manage approximately 500,000 private acres, which will serve to glue together roughly three million acres of existing public land. Multi-jurisdictional management of the eventual wildlife complex will be conducted by the various entities with land ownership and wildlife management authority including the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Bureau of Land Management, Montana Department of State Lands, Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks and American Prairie Reserve. Conservation biologists have determined that a mixed-grass prairie would need to be approximately 5,000 square miles (roughly 3.2 million acres) in size in order to be a fully functioning ecosystem that supports the full complement of native prairie biodiversity and provides room to endure episodic localized natural phenomena like fire, disease and winter ice events. The Reserve currently spans more than 305,000 acres of deeded private land and leased public land.  We believe that connecting people with the landscape in meaningful ways is central to our goal of instilling a deeper appreciation of the prairie and its wildlife in the general public. Visitors to the Reserve will discover a public campground and a variety of trails and interpretive experiences. In 2015, we opened the Enrico Education and Science Center to serve as a hub for students, scientists, and partners conducting fieldwork on the Reserve.  American Prairie Reserve aims to restore a complete and fully functioning prairie ecosystem, the largest of its kind in North America. This is critical to secure long term conservation of the grasslands. We also aim to restore the natural, historic abundance of species in the region. To do such, we rely on our values and innovative and sound science. Our approach is rigorous, collaborative and inspiring. American Prairie Reserves (APR) approach to biodiversity restoration is built around the Freese Scale for Grassland Restoration. Developed by conservation biologist Dr. Curt Freese with Dr. Kyran Kunkel and Dr. Sam Fuhlendorf, the scale identifies the ten major ecological drivers for restoring and conserving biodiversity on temperate grasslands. This scale can be used by land managers trying to achieve a balance between agricultural production and biodiversity as well as those, like APR, which are solely focused on maximizing native prairie biodiversity. Each year, our biologists, along with input from partners and experts, rate all APR properties on the Freese Scale. The total score for a particular area is recorded and retained, allowing for annual comparisons. Armed with this information, we decide what approaches in management could lead to an improved score for a particular area of the Reserve.

Finally, our outreach/education coordinator doubled the amount of student-led discussions about issues that are pertinent to them. Topics included bullying, birth control, healthy sexuality, bystander intervention, and substance abuse. Each year, bmc staff participates in 20-35 activities for education, advocacy and outreach.

To provide montana horse owners with education and assistance to help them better care for and work with their horses.	Provide shelter to abused and in-crisis horses and donkeys: expenses in this program include the annual ranch mortgage payments of $47037 per year. In ten years as an organization we have reached out and helped hundreds, if not thousands, of horses and other equines by meeting our challenges head-on. Since 2014, montana horse sanctuary placed 6 residents in adoptive homes. Adoptions are always a reason to celebrate. Penny went to her forever home august 27, 2014, and is enjoying retirement very much! Donkeys, salley and jazz, journeyed to their adoptive home april 9. They graze on pasture, hang out in a barn built just for them, and take walks with their human family. Lenni, adopted in may, is helping his owner, a 4-h leader, teach youngsters how to ride and care for horses. Holly is enjoying semi-retirement with light rides and grandkid love. The gate is always open if a horse can't stay with its adopter. Roxanne was adopted this year by a kind gentleman. After several weeks he decided he is simply too old to ride a 6-year-old horse. He made the very difficult decision of returning her to the sanctuary. We are able and willing to take a horse back should the need arise. Our adoption contract requires an adopter to return a horse, rather than selling or giving it away. It takes an adopter time to really get to know their horse and although we carefully screen our adopters and have them ride with the trainer who trained the horse, there are always some unknowns. We are glad that none of our past residents ever have to fall through the cracks again. They have a safety net here and that's an accomplishment in itself.   helping law enforcement agencies care for confiscated equines:we are currently providing support to sheriff ludwig in broadwater county. They seized 25 horses and 1 donkey in 2014. We are helping them with finding and screening adopters.   helped law enforcement and horse howners feed 36 horses in three montana counties via our hay grant program. The sanctuary helped horse owners advance their horsemanship skills at a workshop in great falls.   expenses for rehabilitation and restitution funds received.

St Johns Lutheran Ministries Inc	http://www.sjlm.org	(406) 655-5600	EIN 81-0288768	3940 Rimrock Rd	Billings	MT	59102	USA	Human Service Organizations, Human Services	St. John's lutheran ministries is a community of diverse people sharing god's healing presence. Our mission is to provide living opportunities within nurturing environments of hope, dignity & love.	Operations - st. John's is a ministry to the world given by 23 local lutheran (elca) ownership congregations who are committed to caring for people regardless of religious preference, race/national origin, gender/age/marital status, diagnosis/disability, or financial status. Opened in 1963, st. John's started as a 115 bed hud facility and has grown into one of the largest providers of senior housing and long-term care services in the state of montana. We offer a full continuum of care providing low income housing, assisted living, skilled nursing, independent living, and adult daycare services, as well as childcare, rehabilitation/home health, child adoption services and many other support services to enhance the lives of those we serve. Program service accomplishments:skilled nursing services - we operate a 74 bed skilled nursing facility, a 32 bed secure dementia care unit, 32 beds located in two separate transitional care units, as well as 48 skilled nursing beds located in four individual cottages. During 2014, st. John's nursing division cared for 592 residents providing 62,913 patient days of care. St. John's has proven to be an innovative leader in nursing home care through the implementation of programs such as the eden alternative, comfort care vigil ministry, and the green house cottage model with an open door to other service providers from around the country to tour our facilities and exchange information and service delivery ideas. The success of this new cottage model of care is based on two principles, 1) the creation of a home environment serving a small group of elders and, 2) the role of the elder sharath ("servant" in hebrew) in the cottage and the extensive training/education given them to prepare them for this new role. The organization, operations and delivery of care within this new paradigm are radically different from those of the traditional nursing home. Dementia care cottages - located next to the nursing facility are three individual cottages (a total of 36 beds) which specialize in assisted living dementia care. In 2014 the three dementia care cottages provided 11,647 days of care to 48 individuals. Retirement services - our retirement facility requires hud approval of an annual operating budget and rental rate increases. St. John's served 136 people in its retirement facility in 2014 providing 36,865 days of housing and assistance. Our activities program, established to keep our residents active, healthy and engaged, and our pastoral care program, designed to serve the whole person, are expenses that cannot be included in resident rents (per hud regulations). Subsidies of $88,684 were provided by donations received from st. John's foundation. Additionally, low-income residents on medicaid waiver were subsidized $42,728 in 2014. Overall, $131,000 of direct financial support was provided to our low-income retirement residents. Other facilities - the crossings, a st. John's facility located in laurel, montana, includes a 12 unit assisted living dementia care cottage, 13 assisted living apartments and 24 independent living apartments. The crossings served 72 individuals with 16,240 days of care provided in 2014. The willows, a st. John's facility located in red lodge, mt has two connected assisted living cottages (a total of 24 units) and served 26 individuals with 5,752 days of care provided. Medicaid patients - st. John's provides services to all of those in need including medicaid patients. The cost of such care is greater than the related reimbursement. In 2014 st. John's continued as one of the largest providers of medicaid long-term care services in yellowstone county, montana providing 27,591 days of resident care. The gap between our cost to provide care to medicaid recipients and the reimbursement we received in the nursing facility during 2014 is estimated at $1,350,000. Home & community based services/rural outreach - through our rehabilitation department we served 82 patients for a total of 391 outside rehabilitation visits. These patients were located at hospitals up to a distance of 60 miles from billings. In addition, we contracted with our related joint venture, home based services initiative, llc to provide rehabilitation services for its homebound clients; in 2014 we served 119 clients for a total of 816 visits. The senior day services program provides respite for spouses and families from the responsibilities of in-home care giving as well as assisting the elders and their loved ones in making the adjustment from a home environment to resident care with several of the senior day elders transitioning to various st. John's facilities during 2014. The program served 10 individuals with 655 days of care in 2014. Center for generations -we continue to provide child and infant daycare to our staff members and the community, many of whom cannot afford, nor have access to safe, quality child care. St. John's center for generations is accredited, which assures high quality early childhood developmental programs for the children we serve. In 2014 the center for generations served a total of 151 children (96 children from the community, and 55 employee children). The program helps create a nurturing environment through intergenerational activities for our seniors as well. In 2014 st. John's subsidized $100,000 of direct costs to operate the center for generations. Lutheran social services of montana (lss) - with 5 offices in montana, lss has been serving the people of need in montana and northern wyoming as part of st. John's for 6 years. The work of lss is summarized in its motto, "joining hearts in hope". In 2014, lss was involved in bringing hope to the lives of over 100 families. Lss assisted 236 birth-parents and related family members and had a role in the placement of 14 children in forever homes. In 2014 st. John's subsidized $85,000 of direct costs to operate lss. Other subsidies - st. John's also provides college scholarship assistance to many of our staff wishing to pursue their education in the healthcare and social work fields. Through the direct scholarship program, college scholarships totaling $14,500 were provided to 10 students in 2014. Our pastoral care staff administers an employee crisis fund providing cash to employees for emergency needs - a total of $16,000 for 75 employees in 2014. Other community benefits - other benefits st. John's supplies to the community include free programs (health fairs and seminars on aging issues), staff assistance to other 501(c) (3) organizations during the employee's normal work hours, free meeting space to other organizations within the community, clinicals for the training of nurses and physician assistants, internships for other medical disciplines, as well as participation in the fund raisers of other community not-for-profits. The st. John's 2014 summer concert series hosted 5 free community concerts with close to 7,500 people in attendance. We served approximately 4,000 meals to our residents, families, neighbors and community friends. These concerts provide important community socialization for our residents as well as giving back to the community. St. John's lutheran ministries, inc. Supports and encourages health care services by providing financial and managerial consulting assistance to affiliated not-for-profit organizations. We provide management services to sapphire lutheran homes (hamilton, montana) as well as to our joint ventures missions united, inc. (including construction of the wyndstone) and home based services initiative, llc. Summaryoperating st. John's lutheran ministries, inc. Contributes to the organization's exempt purpose as it is in a manner designed to satisfy the primary needs of aged, handicapped, and disadvantaged persons, providing safe housing, health care, and financial security. The need for safe housing is satisfied as st. John's provides residential facilities that are specifically designed to meet the special needs of the elderly. The need for health care is satisfied as st. John's provides long term health care, rehabilitation, and senior day services in an environment designed to maintain the physical, emotional, and spiritual well being of the residents. The need for financial security is met as st. John's (1) maintains in the residence, any person who becomes unable to pay the standard charges and (2) provides its services at the lowest possible cost to remain a viable provider of services to the elderly in the community. While not an all-inclusive dollar amount of total community benefits provided and without an attempt to measure the high quality of services we provide, $1,700,000 of direct community benefit (as detailed in this report) was provided by st. John's in the communities we are privileged to serve.

Founded in 1910, holy rosary healthcare is eastern montana's healthcare destination. Holy rosary operates a comprehensive acute-care hospital, physician clinics, a residential living community, and hospice and palliative care services - providing a complete continuum of care to a 10-county region of eastern montana. As part of sisters of charity of leavenworth health system, a faith-based, nonprofit health system, holy rosary has direct access to best practices, resources, technology, talent and strategic capital. Services include surgical, oncology, and maternity services, as well as 24-hour emergency room and diagnostic and therapeutic services. The extended care unit provides short-term transitional care after illness, injury, or surgery, as well as long-term care for those unable to live independently. In august 1910, the presentation sisters of aberdeen, south dakota, assumed management and operation of the county hospital in miles city at the request of the community, the milwaukee railroad and the doctors associated with the railroad. In 1915, the sisters purchased the hospital, committing to a relationship with the community that would extend for decades. In 1995, holy rosary healthcare opened a new cost effective facility on a 58-acre campus in miles city that allowed physicians and other care facilities to locate in the new hospital building. The building of the new facility and moving into the new facility was a community-wide effort, and was accomplished through the contributions of the staff, physicians, board members, community members and volunteers. In keeping with the new covenant process, sisters of charity of leavenworth health system, inc. (scl health) assumed sponsorship of holy rosary healthcare in 1997. Today, the 25-bed acute care hospital, residential living community and 16-physician clinic all in a single building, serves as a centralized setting for comprehensive health care for the people across eastern montana. Physician specialties include family medicine, internal/adult medicine, general surgery, vascular surgery, women's health, orthopedics, ophthalmology (eye), psychology, audiology, cardiology, neurology, neurosurgery, oral surgery, nephrology (kidney), dermatology, and sleep medicine/pulmonology. Today, holy rosary healthcare serves several eastern montana counties, which cover over 20,000 square miles or approximately 13% of montana. More than half of the people receiving healthcare in miles city, which has a population of 11,000, are from outside custer county. Therefore, holy rosary healthcare's impact on the healthcare delivery system reaches far beyond city and county lines. With a population density of 1. 4 persons per square mile across the seven-county region around holy rosary, clearly this degree of contemporary health care is extraordinary. During 2014, holy rosary healthcare had the following results:admissions - 1,294outpatient visits - 54,609births - 287surgeries - 1,494lab tests - 89,466as part of the montana region of scl health, holy rosary is affiliated with st.

The site of the theater was the original Charles M. Bair family homestead. This house, on the corner of what is now Broadway and 3rd Avenue North, is where Charles' daughter Alberta M. Bair was born.  On November 13, 1931 the Fox Theatre opened its doors to great fanfare on the site. This elegant theater, with its chandeliers, art deco design, dressing rooms and stage, was financed in part by the 20th Century Fox Corporation, which purchased the land from Charles M. Bair. The Fox Theater had the distinction of being the last Art Deco style theater in the United States built by the 20th Century Fox Corporation and designed by Robert C. Reamer.  The Fox served as home for the Billings Community Concerts Organization for more than 50 years. It was also the home venue for the Billings Symphony Orchestra and Chorale. The Fox Theatre offered live plays and musicals that benefited the Fox Committee for the Performing Arts. This Committee was responsible for bringing such stellar performers as Dizzy Gillespie, Ray Charles, George Winston and Judy Collins to our community. The Fox Committees name still lives on in the popular Fox Series offered each season by the Alberta Bair Theater.  In 1978 discussions were held regarding what to do with the aging theater. This discussion included the idea of demolishing the building to build a parking structure. The Fox Committee stepped in and involved other community leaders in a drive to raise enough funds to renovate the building. The community support of the fundraising campaign was overwhelmingly positive.   Alberta Bair was the largest single donor to this campaign and the beautifully remodeled building was renamed the Alberta Bair Theater. It opened its doors to the public on Saturday, January 24, 1987, with a Gala performance by Burt Bacharach.  Thanks to the dedication, vision and hard work of the founding board members, the Fox Committee and numerous community-minded people, the Alberta Bair Theater still stands as a world class performing arts center for all the people of Billings and the Northern Rockies.	More than 100,000 people attend events at ABT annually. Each year, more than 26,000 school children from Billings and the surrounding area attend performances at the theater.

For the third year in a row flammulated owls have been found nesting in the same cavity high in a live ponderosa pine. We banded all four chicks and the female from this nest. A second nest was found in a nest box. This was the second consecutive year that chicks fledged from this box. Neither the male nor the female were previously banded. Our nest site and distribution data is helping the forest service write the environmental analysis for proposed management activities on the lolo national forest. Snowy owl- finishing the 23rd season, our snowy owl breeding ecology and lemming population study in barrow, alaska is the second longest study of its kind in the world. The season started out great and we found 20 nests in the first 2 weeks. Given the number of nests, lemmings must have been numerous and easy to catch in early may. That all changed rather quickly, as lemmings either declined or never reached their potential. With the disappearance of lemmings, some owl nests were abandoned, while in other nests, most nestlings starved to death. It was one of the most dismal breeding performances in 23 years of research. However, some chicks did fledge. We continue advocating that snowy owls and brown lemmings are indicators of a healthy arctic environment in our study area. And, that these species can be used to monitor effects of arctic climate change. Ori staff and co-authors finished the snowy owl species account for the birds of north america project. It is in final editing and expected to be published in 2015 by the cornell lab of ornithology. See recent publications list. Northern hawk owl- in our 9th season, and despite a relatively low survey effort, we found one nest on the west side of gnp. The nest was in the same cavity used and abandoned in 2012. Both adults were caught and banded, and 5 chicks fledged. We also trapped and banded an owl on the east side of the park, but did not find a nest. However, later in the season recently fledged chicks where observed in the same area. Interestingly, we have now banded around 60 hawk-owls in gnp and have only recaptured one. One must wonder how many hawk owls either live in the park, or travel to and from the park. This project was featured on montana fish, wildlife, and parks outdoor report with winston greely. Northern pygmy owl- although our breeding season study began in 1981, it was not organized until 1985. We are researching nest site characteristics with colleagues from montana and have now documented 31 natural nest sites. We hope these data will be important for forest management snag retention policies. Along with our reproductive success study, we have also begun to record growth rates and plumage development. Boreal owl- venturing into the mountains in search of boreal owls is often a practice in misadventure and the 20th year of our boreal owl nest box study proved to be both exciting and productive. Amidst snowmobiles breaking down miles from the parking area, cars and trucks getting stuck in the snow, flat tires, snowstorms, and thunderstorms we located three nests. . All nests were successful and 13 chicks and 2 females were banded. The third female was already banded. She was originally caught two years prior in a different, but nearby, nest box. Our records of site fidelity and natal philopatry, though rare, are important to understanding the life history of boreal owls. To date, ori has found 31 nests and banded about 80 owls, mostly nestlings and females. After the breeding season, we spent some time cleaning out and fixing broken boxes. Northern saw-whet owl- as with the pygmy owls, this study also began in 1981, but was not organized until 1985. We have located 48 natural nest sites and have had the owls use several nest boxes. Interestingly, we have documented nests from cottonwood treed valley bottoms at about 3000 elevation through mixed coniferous forest to about 7,000 elevation. The owls appear to habitat generalists occurring in all forest types we survey. We have been recording reproductive success, growth rates, and plumage development over the years. Northern saw-whet owl migration study- while not like the big years weve experienced in the past, nightly numbers from our 4th autumn migration season project were steady, and total numbers were higher than 2013. At the time of this writing, we have banded 121 owls at this site. We also recaptured two previously banded individuals. One owl was banded almost exactly one year prior. The other owls origin is currently unknown. We hosted two public lectures at the banding station and were pleased with the response and turnout for each night. To the delight of all, the weather was amiable as we shared our research and a few close encounters with wild owls. Long-eared owl- our year-round long-eared owl study, now entering its 28th year, is one of the worlds longest running studies of this species. We have recorded 235 nests and banded over 1750 individuals. After a good breeding year in 2012, 2013 and 2014 were low. Long-eared owl numbers continue to decrease in our study area, and also along one of their major migration sites in duluth, mn. The reasons remain unknown. According to recent population estimates for owls in canada and united states, the long-eared owl population estimate is the lowest for any owl species that regularly breeds in canada and u. S. We encourage all states and provinces to initiate breeding and wintering surveys for long-eared owls. Our paper using plumage color to sex long-eared owls will appear in 2015. Short-eared owl- although we have steadily increased our attention towards short-eared owls over the past several years, we significantly ramped up our efforts in 2014. We embarked on a collaborative effort with the alaska department of fish and wildlife and the global owl project to attach satellite transmitters to breeding short-eared owls in the mission valley. This project arose from discussions with travis booms (ak dfw) who found short-eared owls tagged in nome, ak to spend winter in parts of montana, idaho, colorado, and the dakotas. Four nests were located, two of which successfully fledged chicks. We deployed two satellite transmitters on breeding adult females, but more importantly, we were able to grapple with the logistics of the project and familiarize ourselves with the amount of effort this undertaking will require going forward. We co-authored a paper on the decline and conservation of north american short-eared owl in 2014. Educationlive owl cams- this was our second season with conservation partner explore. Org (www. Explore. Org). We launched three live web cameras in 2014. For the second season in a row, we set a camera on great horned owl and long-eared owl nests in western montana. The cameras were outfitted with infra-red systems, and microphone. As in 2013, hundreds of thousands of people viewed the cameras, and we were once again able to peer into the nocturnal lives of these owls 24/7. We also set a live camera on a snowy owl nest in barrow, ak. We believe this is the first ever for this species. Camera specialists tim and tiffany sears, of ip video specialists (www. Ipvsinc. Com) along with ori crews braved the 20 degree weather over several days to complete the operation. We then worked closely with explore and cornell lab of ornithology. We were overwhelmed with the immediate response to the snowy owl camera. Within the first week, the camera attracted over 200,000 visits. Cornell recorded tens of thousands of hits and visits to the snowy owl social media accounts. We even answered viewers questions during two, one hour live chats from the tundra by iphone, with the cornell lab. As with the great horned and long-eared owl cameras in 2013, we gained much insight into parental behaviors of the male and female snowy owl. For example, we observed the female move her family behind the nest mound for many days to protect them from strong cold easterly winds. This is a rarely observed behavior. These cameras joined the collection of fascinating wildlife cameras that explore. Org has initiated worldwide as part of its pearls of the planet series. Pearls of the planet has given the ori a new avenue to share our research with the public and provide wildlife education. We look forward to continuing this partnership and providing this service in 2015. Visit our website for the latest news about our owl cameras. Excerpts can stil
