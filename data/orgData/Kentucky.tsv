Disabled American Veterans	http://www.dav.org	(859) 441-7300	EIN 31-0263158	3725 Alexandria Pike	Cold Spring	KY	41076	USA		We are dedicated to one single purpose: empowering veterans to lead high-quality lives with respect and dignity. See schedule o for further details. We accomplish this by making sure veterans and their families can access the full range of benefits available to them; fighting for the interests of america's injured heroes on capitol hill; and educating the public about the great sacrifices and needs of veterans transitioning back to civilian life.		National service program: dav's largest operation offers services through its national service program, transition service program, mobile service office program, national employment program, voluntary service program, and state services and disaster relief program. See schedule o for further details. National service program:in 100 offices throughout the united states and in puerto rico, we employ a corps of approximately 270 national service officers (nsos) and 34 transition service officers (tsos) who counsel and represent veterans and their families with claims for benefits from the department of veterans affairs, the department of defense and other government agencies. Veterans need not be members to take advantage of our assistance, which is provided free of charge between january 1, 2014 and december 31, 2014. Our nsos and tsos--all wartime-wounded, injured or ill veterans--provided representation for over 340,000 claims for veterans and their families before veterans affairs, obtaining for them more than $3. 7 billion in new and retroactive benefits. Dav truly is an organization of veterans helping veterans, as all our service officers incurred injury or illness related to their wartime service. Nsos function as attorneys-in-fact, assisting veterans and their families in filing claims for va disability compensation, rehabilitation and education programs, pensions, death benefits and employment and training programs. They provide free services, such as information seminars and counseling and community outreach activities such as the mobile service office (mso) program. Nsos also represent veterans and active-duty military personnel before discharge review boards, boards for correction of military records, physical evaluation boards, the disability transition assistance program, the transition assistance program and other official panels. For service members making the all-important transition to civilian life, dav participates in transition assistance and disabled transition assistance programs. Our tsos provide benefits counseling and assistance to service members filing initial claims for va benefits at more than 100 military installations throughout the country. Over the last year, our tsos conducted 908 formal presentations to 39,569 transitioning service members. During that time, they filed 17,126 claims for veterans affairs benefits. Counsel and representation for active-duty service members during their transition was provided through the military's disability evaluation system. Dav continues its pro bono representation program for veterans seeking review in the united states court of appeals for veterans claims. In fiscal year 2014, the board of veterans appeals (bva) took action on more than 16,220 cases involving dav clients. Each one of those cases was reviewed to identify those in which a veteran's claim was improperly denied. Thanks to dav and our relationship with two private law firms, 1,534 of these cases previously denied by the bva were appealed to the court. The mobile service office (mso) program continues to seek new venues to bring dav service to veterans and dependents in their own communities. By putting our service offices on the road and assisting veterans where they live, dav is increasing veterans' accessibility to benefits. With 10 specially equipped msos visiting communities across the country, this outreach effort generates a considerable amount of claims work from veterans who may not otherwise have the opportunity to seek assistance at our national service offices. During 2014, our msos traveled more than 101,104 miles, visiting 922 cities and towns. Our nsos interviewed 23,645 veterans and other potential claimants during these appearances. Expenses $43,862,735, including grants of $62,311. Revenue of $0national employment program:dav established the national employment department, committing over $800,000 in 2014 to its startup. One key element of this mission is a partnership dav formed with recruitmilitary, a full-service, military-to-civilian recruiting firm. Working alongside our partner, dav uses online and offline products to connect employers, franchisors and educational institutions with veterans who are transitioning from active duty to civilian life, veterans who already have civilian work experience, members of the national guard, reserve components and military spouses. All services are offered free of charge. By co-hosting and sponsoring veterans career fairs in partnership with recruitmilitary, dav is helping to address one of the greatest needs facing our nation's unemployed veterans. Last year, dav sponsored 34 job fairs in 29 cities, creating venues for nearly 2,000 high-quality companies considering the talents of more than 14,000 active-duty, reserve and guard members and veterans and their spouses who attended. Dav's national employment department also works directly with major employers interested in recruiting skilled veterans. It provides a multitude of resources that veterans can access online at jobs. Dav. Org, including a job-search board listing more than 800,000 current opportunities. We are pleased to note nearly 5,000 average monthly visits to our employment resources web page. We anticipate continued growth in veterans' use of this resource in the coming months as we roll out a retooled website that will feature a variety of additional employment and educational resources, including webinars and other guides, and we will highlight certain employers that have demonstrated a firm commitment to recruiting and hiring veterans. Expenses $820,673, including grants of $0. Revenue $0. Voluntary service program: service is the cornerstone of dav's mission of empowering veterans to lead high-quality and fulfilled lives. Our thousands of dedicated volunteers across the country help us to provide the best care, morale and service to our nation's heroes. Dav's transportation network is one of the country's largest voluntary transportation programs. This unique program provides vehicles and volunteers throughout the country to transport veterans to and from their medical appointments at department of veterans affairs (va) medical centers. This program is managed by 192 hospital service coordinators located at 197 va medical centers and is operated by nearly 9,000 volunteer drivers. Since the inception of the program in 1987, dav departments and chapters have donated 2,856 vehicles to the va at a cost to dav of $61. 8 million. In 2014 alone, volunteers traveled 24,356,351 miles, providing 716,302 free rides to veterans and donating 1,723,175 hours of their time. The value of these contributed services is reported as revenue on dav's financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, but is not recorded as revenue on this form 990 in accordance with internal revenue service guidelines. Other dav voluntary service program initiatives include the winter sports clinic, the jesse brown memorial youth scholarship program, the celebrity program, the local veterans assistance program and the va voluntary service program. Expenses $2,197,188 including grants of $1,072,264. Revenue $ 0. State services and disaster relief: we help fund services that our state-level departments provide to veterans and their families. In some cases, these department programs extend, supplement or dovetail services we provide through our nationwide programs. In other cases, departments have created entirely new programs to meet the unique needs of veterans in their states. Grants to departments under this program totaled $4,169,511. When disaster strikes, our national service officers are dispatched to the affected area to provide monetary assistance, conduct benefit counseling and to offer referral services. We provided disaster relief grants in the aftermath of natural disasters and emergencies in various areas around the nation to help veterans and their families secure temporary lodging, food and other necessities. During 2014, almost $90,450 was granted to tornado, flood and fire victims. Since the program's inception in 1968, $9,442,228 has been disbursed. Expenses $4,406,941 including grants of $4,406,941. Revenue $0. Total form 990, part iii, line 4a:expenses $51,287,538 including grants of $5,541,516. Revenue $0.   publications & communications: the national communications department oversees internal and external communications programs, including media relations, publications, contacts with other organizations and a variety of public outreach initiatives to tell dav's story. Our communications staff produces a full-color magazine, news releases, speeches, op-eds, brochures, print messages, public service announcements, videos and other materials that provide information about dav and the full range of free services that empower veterans to live high-quality lives with respect and dignity. In addition to these traditional tools, social media such as facebook, twitter and youtube also enable dav and its members to build an even stronger community to carry out our mission, now and in the future.   membership program: the pulse of dav lies within its members. When a veteran joins dav, he or she joins a vibrant community that stands together to ensure our nation keeps its promises. This steadfast dedication to our cause has made dav what it is today. Dav was founded after world war i because a centralized structure to support veterans wounded in the trenches did not exist. America was not prepared for their return, and something needed to be done. The concept of continued service, of veterans serving veterans, is part of a legacy that is more than 90 years old. Dav has evolved to meet the needs of its members amid the changes that naturally progress with time. Our armed forces have changed along with our society, and dav has evolved to embrace those changes through the years. This enables us to ensure all veterans are able to lead high-quality lives with respect and dignity. Today, social diversity and technology have allowed dav members to continue to play a role as positive advocates for the unique requirements of veterans and their loved ones. We continue to effectively respond to the needs of past and present generations of veterans, providing unwavering dedication to those who have sacrificed for our way of life, often with a life-changing illness or injury. Dav has nearly 5,000 members dedicated to recruiting new ones so that our base remains strong and vibrant well into the future. With 52 state-level departments and 1,351 active chapters nationwide, we closed the 2013/2014 membership year with 1,279,391 veterans in dav.   legislative program: dav's national legislative department is responsible for developing, strengthening and expanding federal policies, programs, benefits and services to empower injured and ill veterans to lead high-quality lives with respect and dignity. Dav works with congress, the department of veterans affairs and other federal agencies that help fulfill our nation's promises to the men and women who served. The guiding principles of our advocacy efforts emanate directly from our legislative agenda as set forth by the resolutions adopted by delegates to our annual national conventions and strengthened by dav's constitution and bylaws. These principles guide our advocacy for disabled veterans in conformance with the collective will of our members. We accomplish our objectives through our efforts in washington, d. C. , and by drawing upon the support of our dav members across the country. During 2014, even though the investment in our legislative program (both non-lobbying and lobbying combined) was quite small, constituting less than one percent of dav's total expenditures, dav's efforts in this arena achieved important results for the men and women who served. Expenses $1,866,829 including grants of $0. Revenue $0. Public awareness outreach: when injured and ill veterans return home from military service, many struggle to regain a sense of normalcy. They must start the long and often difficult process of healing and rehabilitation so they can begin to rebuild the lives they once knew. Many face the search for employment and housing, all while learning how to relate to their families after having been away for long periods of time. Navigating basic health, education and other benefits can be daunting. That's why dav is here to help them every step of the way. Too many of our nation's veterans have yet to access the benefits and services they've earned. Many are simply unaware of what is available to them, so our national service program provides veterans free assistance in working through the claims process at the va and other government agencies. Dav wants to ensure that veterans are fully aware of the wide range of other programs we offer for ill and injured veterans and their families. Our outreach program supplements the efforts already built into our other program services to raise awareness. It offers the american public a greater opportunity to become personally involved in identifying with and assisting the men and women who served our nation. In 2014, $32,355,645 was spent on this large-scale outreach effort, an investment that's making a real difference in the lives of veterans and their families. About $7. 3 million is from the value of donated media, primarily for airing of public service announcements about dav services available to assist ill and injured veterans. Additionally, dav 5k events galvanize local communities across the country to support their heroes and raise awareness about the issues veterans face every day. This past year, we held our second annual dav 5k in cincinnati and launched our inaugural dav 5k event in san diego. In total, almost 4,000 individuals came out to honor and say thank you to friends and family members who served or are currently serving our country. We look forward to even greater participation in our events in cincinnati, san diego and atlanta in november 2015 and will continue to explore opportunities to expand the 5k events to other cities across the country. The value of the contributed media is reported as revenue on dav's financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, but is not recorded as revenue on this form 990 in accordance with internal revenue service guidelines. Expenses $25,048,321 including grants of $0. Revenue $0.

Until recently, most of pmc's physician practices were spread throughout the community and outlying areas.

Some of these are historical, some are based on current events, trends in the ever-changing social and political spectra, and some are art forms of all kinds that offer a forum for individuals to share talents and interests.  School children are able to see and touch artifacts that help explain history, particularly that of our locale, and make it more vivid.  Teachers in the area use the Museum Center in different ways to help enrich their classes curricula. The suitcase portable traveling collection, a miniature museum, has been put together and used successfully at several schools.  Museum Scout classes have been held for fourth graders to familiarize them with the Museum Center, to show them how a museum and research center functions and to explain how different types of art are created.

We will achieve this mission by creating an environment, which rewards excellence and innovation, encourages mutual respect and maximizes resources.		Early childhood education: many hard working families struggle to afford quality childcare and early childhood educational opportunities on top of every day necessities. This creates a barrier in a parent's ability to pursue a career and further education which are the cornerstones of self-sufficiency. According to the northern kentucky education council, only 32% of children are ready to begin learning their first day of kindergarten. Our early education services focus on working with parents and their children to reach all developmental milestones from birth through the start of kindergarten to create a solid foundation for the future while tackling any barriers in the way. During the fiscal year of 2014, there were 834 individuals served through our early childhood education department. After 12 months of enrollment, 97% of bright days children and 83% of hippy children were assessed to be age appropriate in cognitive and language skills.   workforce development: one of the biggest barriers for families trying to achieve self-sufficiency is not having a job or having a job that does not pay a livable wage. Like so many others around the country, our region has experienced tough economic times, record unemployment and the reality that certain careers paths are no longer viable options for employment. In order to thrive, we must continue to invest in creating a strong workforce that has the education and skills to move our region forward. To accomplish this, brighton center has a variety of workforce development programs that help achieve their goals. During the fiscal year of 2014, there were 25,911 served through workforce development. Of those served, 25,504 worked with our career connections program, 75% of dislocated workers retained unsubsidized employment six months after placement. Through the center for employment training, 266 individuals received training and 75% of the trainees maintained their employment for 6 months.   youth services: on a typical night in northern kentucky there are over 3,000 youth and young adults homeless and left to find their own way. They are the silent, unseen population and so vulnerable to the harsh consequences of coming from a broken home. For a homeless teen, education is interrupted or cut off completely along with access to health care, mental health services, legal aid and they often can't get a job without identification or a valid address. Getting an apartment is also out of the question due to their age and lack of income. They come to brighton center's homeward bound shelter scared, hopeless and tired of the constant barriers in their way, but they quickly find hope, support, and the road map to a better life. During the fiscal year of 2014, year homeward bound served 514 homeless and runaway youth and 74% of them were re-united with their families.

Orphan Voice Inc	http://www.orphanvoice.org		EIN 61-1503075	Po Box 910410	Lexington	KY	40591	USA	Human Service Organizations	Orphan voice, inc, is a christian orphan-relief organization that provides spiritual, physical, and emotional support to central vietnam's impoverished orphans, at risk, and special-needs children.		Orphan voice's most prominent ministry deals with the care of orphans. Orphan voice operates promise house, a facility in vietnam, that cares for 19 children who came from destitute and sometimes abusive backgrounds. We have direct management of this facility, with the ability to hire christian caretakers. We provide 100% of the total daily care (nutritional, educational, emotional, spiritual, physical) to these children. Additionally, orphan voice provides 35-40% of the operating budget for the dai loc orphanage, which cares for 32 children. Our contribution to dai loc provides for the daily food needs of the orphanage's children. We also have quartery and semi-annual outreach projects to 4500-5000 other children in 7 orphanages and 12 boarding schools in remote regions. To these children, we provide food, clothes, and shoes, and work teams to provide repairs and upgrades to facilities.   orphan voice serves children with special needs in a number of ways. The organization operates a therapy center that serves 60 special needs children, mostly with cerebral palsy, blindness, deafness, or with limb malacies, and their families. All of the families supported through this program earn less than 50 usd per month. The facility is staffed by three lay therapists. Home-bound children receive home visits once per month for therapy and to train family members in the care of their special needs children. For those families served by the therapy center, orphan voice provides food to the families, delivering 22 lbs of rice, 30 meals of noodles, cooking oil, soy sauce, fish sauce, and milk each month to each family. Select families are also assisted with starting micro-businesses, such as raising pigs, chickens, etc, to help earn more money. Beginning in 2014, orphan voice opened new beginnings school for the deaf, which currently teaches 8 deaf children in the phu ninh district of vietnam who were not served by the public schools due to insufficient resources. These children are taught sign language, as well as traditional school subjects. Orphan voice also continues to help repair cleft lip and palletes in children and infants through its partnership with hue hospital, performing, on average, two cases per month. Our contribution principally takes the form of transportation help and food expense while they are away from home, and payment of the hospital surgery fee. Also beginning in 2014, orphan voice began distributing pet (personal energy transportation) carts, wheel chair-like devices that provide mobility to the handicapped. To date, we have distributed approximately 250 pet carts.   orphan voice works to protect vulnerable children from sexual preditors in a region that is fast growing in international tourism. We do so in three ways. We operate victory house, a transition home for girls who have aged out of orphanages. At victory house, we provide a place to live, food, christian caregivers, and vocational or college education so that the girls can get a good start in life. Victory house currently supports 5 girls. Hope house is our effort to provide care for children who have actually been trafficked in the sex trade and are now recovering. To date, we have had two such cases. Finally, orphan voice conducts montly anti-trafficking seminars at schools in poor areas with high risk of sexual expoitation. These interesting, interactive seminars warn 400-500 junior high school students per month about the dangers and tricks of child sex traffickers, and equip adults to be on the alert to protect the children.   two additional programs round out the services provided by orphan voice: keeping families together is a new program launched in 2014 to intervene in at-risk families to help reduce the number of children abandoned to orphanages. Believing that the best place for a child is in their parent's home, provided basic safety measures are met, keeping families together provides training, encourgement, and, most of all, help and resources for the family to earn a living so that they can remain together.

The resume of louisville third century as a premiere festival producer gained another major achievement in 2014 with the launch of the inaugural louisville dragon boat festival in september of 2014. The festival grew out of our original concept for, celebrasia - a festival-styled, free-to-the-public expo showcasing the traditions and accomplishments of the 25 + distinct asian cultures currently residing in metro louisville. Though highlighted and primarily built around the dragon boat racing, the day-long event aimed to foster a reciprocal interplay between our local, international, oriental and occidental communities, - all and each to the other- through illustrative and patron friendly activities including, sport, the visual, performing, and culinary arts, as a well as numerous locally based commercial, educational and cultural exhibits and demonstrations "celebrating" those communities. The start-up of a new festival event is a rather challenging undertaking and louisville third century was extremely proud to have presented 20 dragon boat teams (21 members each) competing for the rivulet cup; and to have an estimated attendance of 5,000 in its first year. As one veteran of many dragon boat festivals put it, "you're about 5-8 years ahead of most first year events (production values and team count). Projections for 2015 are running at 40+ teams and the creation of at least two new divisions - scholastic and charity. Both divisions are being constructed as fundraising vehicles allowing area non-profits and jcps schools to, in essence, conduct major fundraising campaigns without assuming the financial liability or staffing requirements such a campaign would require. This is keeping with louisville third century's mission to serve as a catalyst and financial resource for other non-profits serving the metro louisville. In other festival activity, l3c did lend in kind /volunteer support( (set up/ clean up/strike), d cor, signage etc. ) for the hospitality centers servicing the belvedere stages at worldfest, metro louisville's three day multi-cultural event,. ). This was a continuation while "handing it off"(catalyst) of previous presenting sponsor status with that festival. So too for light up louisville the city's kick off and celebration of the december holiday season.

Gods Pantry Food Bank Inc	http://godspantry.org	(859) 255-6592	EIN 31-0979404	1685 Jaggie Fox Way	Lexington	KY	40511	USA		The mission of god's pantry food bank is to reduce hunger in kentucky through community cooperation making the best possible use of all available resources.		God's pantry food bank is the largest food bank in kentucky and serves one-third of the state's population both geographically and by population. Our objective is to reach everyone who is hungry or at risk of hunger in the 50 central and eastern kentucky counties we serve. With that in mind, the food bank distributed 26. 2 million pounds of food throughout the 50 counties of our service area in fiscal year 2014. This area covers 16,000 square miles and has an estimated 252,000 residents who are food insecure, which means they lack access, at times, for enough food for an active, healthy life for all household members. To meet the need of these families and others like them, the food bank works in partnership with nearly 400 other nonprofit agencies that operate food pantries, soup kitchens, child hunger programs, senior citizens centers, and other services that provide food at no cost to neighbors in need. Last year 30% of everything distributed by the food bank to these agencies was fresh fruits and vegetables at absolutely no cost to them.   god's pantry food bank was founded in 1955 in lexington, ky. By mim hunt. Although the organization has grown considerably since its founding, it has remained true to its original intent of providing groceries to lexington's neighbors in need. To that end the food bank operates the fayette county pantry program. In fiscal year 2014, 23,469 families were served by the program or an estimated 65,713 individuals - 22% of the city's total population. This program is a partnership between the food bank and three churches and the community action council that provide space and significant volunteer coordination and support to create as many opportunities as possible for low-income families to receive a week's worth of groceries at each visit. This includes an average of 10 pounds of produce per household.   the objective of god's pantry food bank is to reach anyone who is hungry in the 50 counties it serves, but some populations require specific strategies to be successful. To that end, the food bank operates the after school snack, backpack, kids cafe, and summer feeding programs in multiple locations specifically for children ages 0-18. A recent study, hunger in central and eastern kentucky 2014, revealed that at least 50,500 of food bank clients are children.   wokit is a cluster of nine food banks in west virginia, ohio, kentucky, indiana, and tennessee created pursuant to a contractual agreement. Wokit strives to alleviate hunger through a cost effective food bank network which equitably shares resources in the spirit of trusting cooperation. Wokit serves as a means to coordinate the delivery to each of its members, product (donated food) available through feeding america. God's pantry serves as the wokit host food bank. The nine chief executive officers/executive directors serve on the wokit steering committee. Wokit operates under the terms of an annual cluster contract (contract). Under the terms of the contract, the budgeted operating expenses of wokit for the contract period, excluding freight costs, are allocated to each member through dues based on the actual number of pounds received by the member during the previous calendar year. Additionally, each member agrees to reimburse wokit for its share of the freight costs incurred by wokit on behalf of the member.

Green Cameroon	http://www.greencameroon.org	+237 7775 6881	EIN 	Up Court, Buea Town	Buea		41234	Cameroon		The mission of Green Cameroon is to ensure sustainable development and a better planet for our children, by addressing major environmental and sustainable development issues identified in our communities.  Green Cameroon was founded in 2003 with a vision to Conserve Cameroons rich biodiversity by working on practical solutions to solve conservation problems. We pay close attention to sustainable development, rural community livelihood and contemporary environmental issues.   Green Cameroon was formed with a strong commitment to fighting environmental problems in our communities like deforestation, desertification, unsustainable farming practices, improper waste disposal methods, water scarcity, health problems linked to sanitation and general lukewarm attitude towards environmental and sustainable development issues. Green Cameroon helps local community members to live better lives by improving on living standards alongside making scarce resources available for posterity.  Our Vision is; healthy ecosystems and local Cameroonian communities that are well equipped with the necessary knowledge, skills and resources to achieve development without jeopardizing the position of future generations.	Cameroon		Providing environmental education on global and regional issues affecting Africa as well as environmental protection 	Increasing the ability of local populations to benefit and contribute to natural resource management and conservation 	Promoting new and traditional approaches to increasing food production without losing on-farm biodiversity 	Focusing on activities that conserve and protect the local environment and helping to alleviate poverty for communities 	Organising water and sanitation education at schools and health centers	Since its creation in 2003, Green Cameroon has worked with communities, schools and other entities, to practically carry out and promote conservation practices both at national and international levels.  Our series of projects carried out give us an out-standing track record which we are very jealous and proud of.  Green Cameroon won its first award in 2007 (Global Knowledge Partnership) for its work on using ICTs as a solution to environmental problems under the project, Green Technology. After a lot of hard work, we also won the National Energy Globe Award for Sustainability 2012 under our Fuel Efficient Stoves project which involves the building of forest saving stoves for community members of the Mount Cameroon Forest Region. Green Cameroon also initiated and championed the creation of a UN Regional Centre of Expertise on Education for Sustainable development under the name RCE Buea. This Centre was formally acknowledged and accredited this December 2012. Green Cameroons Executive Director is also currently the Director and Board Chair of RCE Buea. Past and current projects such as Green Technology, School Environmental Clubs, Community Trees Campaign, Climate Change Campaign, Green Schools, Community Access to portable water, Save Mount Cameroon and Village Community Development have had a lot of positive impact in communities that all go to the glory of Green Cameroons partnership with communities. In 2011 our first documentary was short and produced by Supreme Master TV, a US based TV station that was impressed by our work and decided to highlight some of our activities through a short documentary which was broadcasted on their station and other social media like U-tube. Green Cameroon since 2006 has joined the international community to fight against climate change through the organization of demonstrations, talks; practical projects and other public events. In 2012, Green Cameroon was one of the organizations that sat to deliberate on Cameroons recommendations to the UN Climate talks.

She immediately began an aggressive and grueling treatment plan and double mastectomy. Her hallmark vivacity and sharp wit carried her through, energizing and motivating everyone in her path. Even as she was left with scars instead of breasts, she continued to spread joy and positivity to everyone around her.   It is that spirt and light which captivated those who saw "The Light that Shines" documentary (attached) capturing her photo shoot in Paris with acclaimed portrait photographer, Sue Bryce. And then, her story went viral.   While living with stage IV breast cancer, Jill's wish was to spread her message of confidence and hope and use her spotlight to give back to women like herself and shine grace upon them. Sadly, Jill passed away from the disease in early February, 2016. She was 38.   Her mission is to help people financially going through breast cancer so they could focus on recover and not financial needs such as mortgage, rent or utilities	Louisville Ky and grant wishes nationally.
