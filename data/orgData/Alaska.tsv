Integral to this mission is a program of training local surgeons and health workers, focusing on the development of sustainable health services for Cambodians.  Around 500 million, or 12% of the world's population suffer from disability. Disabilities bring misery, reduce economic status, destroy social integration and cause untold suffering through stigmatization and marginalization from society.  In the last 30 years international agencies have made great efforts to assist with health-care in developing countries focusing on the principles of 'primary health care'; e.g. sanitation, clean water, Maternal Child Health (MCH), developed at the conference of Alma Ata in 1978. Surgery has been considerably under-emphasized as 'too sophisticated and expensive' for widespread impact.  CSC demonstrates the huge benefits of simple, safe, rehabilitation surgery to developing countries by organising treatment and training programs. CSC is one of few organisations promoting this doctrine, and almost alone in practicing it.	In 2011 alone, CSC performed 3,567 surgical procedures and 11,840 consultations. In 2012, after the completion of our building extension, we anticipate seeing even more patients and providing even more rehabilitative surgeries and care.  Many of Cambodias poorest disabled people have received free surgery enabling them to greatly improve their standard of living. In Cambodia, disabled people experience discrimination due to their physical appearance as well as their perceived mental capacity. If a person is not able to contribute to the wellbeing and livelihood of their family they are looked down upon and neglected.   Patients who receive surgery at CSC are able to lead more normal lives, affecting not only themselves but their families too.		Cambodia	We are a surgical centre that provides rehabilitation surgery. Additionally, we have programs that focus on surgery for obstetric fistulae, meningoencephalocele (MECs), cleft lip and palate, general ophthalmology, hip and spine, and burn victims.

We believe the successful development of each child's spiritual and academic potential is promoted by a combined effort of the christian home, bible-believing church, and school.				It is the goal of north pole christian school (npcs) to work as a ministry to support christian families who desire to see that the christian beliefs, values and world view taught to their children at home and in church are reinforced in the school's academic and extra-curricular activities. The fiscal year ending june 2015 saw that goal realized for 112 students in preschool through twelfth grade. With a staff of nine full-time, three teacher aides, one business office secretary, and one administrator, npcs is able to offer two preschool classes, two full-day kindergarten classes, first, a combined second and third, fourth and fifth grade class, sixth, seventh and eighth grade; and a combined ninth through twelfth grade. We had one graduating senior who is now attending oklahoma baptist university. The annual standardized test (teranova) scores show that kindergarten through grade 12 was performing at or above national norms. Our sat and act test score results were at or above national norms. In addition to the academic program, students participated in several mission projects that allowed them to serve others, to help develop the concept of servant leadership, and to raise local and global mission awareness. Students of all ages collected over 2,200 pounds of pantry items and non-perishable food items for the local food bank. They collected clothing, diapers, beds, and baby formula for the pregnancy crisis center. Our junior/senior high students participated in world vision's 30-hour famine and collected nearly $1,000. 00. North pole christian school also supported love, inc. S adopt a family program.

Love In The Name Of Christ Of The Tanana Valley	http://	(907) 452-3876	EIN 94-3047380	818 26th Ave	Fairbanks	AK	99701	USA		Mobilize the church to transform lives and communities in the name of christ. Local churches come together as a network. It is a cooperative partnership that enables churches to make a lasting impact on individuals, families, and children in need.				The clearinghouse is the foundation of love inc. Volunteers in the clearinghouse screen requests for help for extent of need and legitimacy and refers the request to a local church ministry, church volunteer, or community agency (to avoid service duplication). Through clearinghouse referrals, church volunteers are given opportunities to meet practical needs of the poor and needy in the fairbanks north star borough without regard to race, creed or religion. In 2014, the clearinghouse received 695 requests for help; 126 needs were referred to agencies and 287 needs referred to churches and love inc programs. Church volunteers deliver food boxes, shop and clean for shut-ins, pay for emergency rent, utilities and medical prescriptions, provide gratis counseling services, medical and dental care and so much more!   limited public transportation, a harsh climate and long distances between places of business all contributed to the development of the transportation department. Love inc is the only source of free, door-to-door rides in fairbanks. Since its' inception in 1992 through december of 2014, the transportation program has provided 75,500 rides. In 2014 the transportation department provided 1,166 rides to area citizens through this program. Clients must be first referred to the program through the clearinghouse. Love inc coordinates the ride schedules with volunteers who have set aside one day per week, either a morning or an afternoon, to be available to give rides. Additional rides are provided through church volunteers for clients whose needs didn't fit the eligibility criteria for a program referral.   thanksgiving food box deliveries and meals: each year, the local food bank prepares hundreds of special holiday food boxes with turkey and all the trimmings. Each year love inc provides deliveries of those food boxes to families who lack transportation and means to pick up their own food. Love inc also interviews and selects up to three dozen seniors for home cooked thanksgiving meals delivered to their door, warm and ready to eat! In 2014, 16 seniors received home cooked meals and other seniors had their food boxes delivered to them so that they could prepare the meal on their own. The create-a-gift bazaar: since 1991, the create-a-gift bazaar has been providing a means for teaching crafts to people from all parts of the community. Low-income families are able to provide christmas gifts to their families for no cost. In 2014 approximately 500 individuals attended to include low-income families. The others paid a nominal $10 per person or $40 per family entrance fee. In 2014, 167 volunteers helped the attendees make quality craft items to give as gifts for christmas. Adopt-a-family: churches, civic groups, and businesses "adopt" carefully chosen families needing help at christmas. The families in this program are referred into the program. This is not an assistance that a client can request. Referrals are gathered from school counselors, church pastors and from the love inc clearinghouse. The chosen families are interviewed to find out about their needs-things that would benefit the family such as groceries, fuel, clothing, household needs, etc. As well as "fun" ideas for the kids. Each group, upon being "matched" with a family, are provided with their customized list of needed items and ideas on the most beneficial ways to help each family. In 2014, 50 families including 63 adults and 143 children and six group homes were blessed at christmas through the adopt-a-family program by 46 sponsors. Santa's helpers: volunteers collect new & used toys from the community using drop off locations. In conjunction with the fairbanks community food bank, 236 needy families, including 354 adults and 607 children, received food boxes and toys for children in time for christmas.
