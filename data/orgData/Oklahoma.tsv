All Believe In Me teachers and managers, as well as team members from partner organizations, were invited to attend.  The on-site training allowed direct evaluation of the children and suggestions for accommodations to support and enhance learning.  *  We provide educational assistance to orphaned and impoverished children in China.

Our Believe in Me schools, located inside social welfare institutions in China, teach math, art, music, Chinese, English, and science through a Montessori based method.

GEORGE MIKSCH SUTTON AVIAN RESEARCH CENTER INC	http://www.suttoncenter.org/	918 - 336-7778	EIN 73-1023595	PO Box 2007	Bartlesville	OK	74005	USA	Animals, Wildlife Preservation & Protection	The George Miksch Sutton Avian Research Center (Sutton Center) was founded in 1983 with the mission of finding cooperative conservation solutions for birds and the natural world through science and education. The Sutton Center is a private, nonprofit organization located near Bartlesville, Oklahoma, and has been affiliated with the Oklahoma Biological Survey in the College of Arts and Sciences at the University of Oklahoma since 1997.  The Sutton Center has become a leader in avian research and conservation and has conducted intensive, conservation-oriented, ecological field research on declining grassland birds, developed and applied techniques for the reintroduction and monitoring of Southern Bald Eagles, managed the successful captive breeding of endangered species and performed bird surveys across the world. In addition, the Sutton Center boasts several educational outreach programs using live birds and interactive, internet technology that reach tens of thousands of students and adults each year.	Promote conservation, education, and research of endangered, rare, and under studied birds.	Between 1984 and 1992 the Sutton Center raised and released 275 Southern Bald Eagles in the southeastern U.S. Bald Eagle eggs were removed from nests in Florida and transported to our captive breeding facility in Bartlesville, Oklahoma.  Once at our captive breeding facility, the eggs were incubated, hatched, and the resulting eaglets were raised and released in high quality habitat in five southeastern states. In many cases, the captively-raised Bald Eagles have returned to their release sites to establish territories and nests.  Each year we conduct aerial and ground surveys in the vicinity of Oklahoma release sites to determine nest occupancy rates and productivity. Since 1990, the number of Bald Eagle nests in Oklahoma has increased almost annually to a record 55 nests in 2005. We believe these increases are a direct result of our restoration program, as adult eagles are now returning to breed in the areas where they were released.  In addition, eagles released by the Sutton Center have been observed nesting in Kansas, Texas, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi. As fledglings from these nests reach adulthood, we expect the number of nests to continue to increase.  Partially as a result of our efforts here at the Sutton Avian Research Center, the Bald Eagle population in most areas of the U.S. had increased sufficiently for the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service to remove the Bald Eagle from the Endangered Species List in June of 2007!

Our sanctuary provides shelter,  rehabilitation, and long term to end of life care. We also offer basic education to anyone interested in learning how to take care of equine either already in their care or if they are considering adding an equine member to their family.  Our Philosophy  We believe that the most stress free world for animals is one that mimics their natural environment as closely as possible. Horses were not meant to spend 23 hours a day in stalls. In the wild, horses roam free, and bond together with their herd... that is what they do here too!  Horses are grazing animals and were meant to live primarily on forage. Here in southern Oklahoma, we are blessed with a fairly mild climate. Our horses can comfortably live outdoors all year round with minimal blanketing, and they are supplemented with high quality free choice hay during the winter.  To complement our pastures and hay, we feed the horses with high quality feeds. With high levels of energy from fat and low levels from rapidly digestible starch, readily available minerals, and high quality all plant protein ingredients, it is specially designed to meet the energy, mineral and protein needs of our retired equine friends.	sanctuary, how to care for horses, aged care for equine		at risk equine	5 equine	Red River Valley of Oklahoma

SERVICES OFFERED  Calm Waters was founded in 1992, by a nine-year old boy whose father had just died, and his mother, in partnership with the Baptist Medical Center Outpatient Counseling Department. In 1999, CW achieved 501(c)(3) status. In FY10, CW served approximately 3,000 children, youth and adults whose lives have been affected by death, divorce, and other major grief issues, including incarceration, deployment, deportation and foster care. Calm Waters provides a variety of services, including:  Free Center-Based Grief and Divorce Support Groups are offered to children ages 3  18 and their parents/guardians, and to young adults 19  25 years old. Because childrens abilities to understand and express feelings vary with age, children meet in developmentally-appropriate groups. Led by trained facilitators, participants are guided through a curriculum filled with art and play activities, and discussions aimed at developing healthy coping skills. Adults find support as they meet with other adults, share their concerns and learn from each other how to help themselves and their children through turbulent times. Young adults find peer support in their own group. Groups are curriculum-based, and promote healing in a safe, supportive environment. Divorce groups are held weekly for eight weeks, while grief groups are ongoing, with participants attending twice per month. All children who attend CW support groups must be accompanied by at least one adult.  School-based Support Groups contain the same components as Center-based support groups, but serve students in public schools (pre-k through 12th Grade). Parents do not attend. A wider variety of grief issues are addressed, including incarceration, deportation or the deployment of a loved one, and foster care concerns.  Parenting Through Divorce Seminars focus on keeping children out of the middle of divorce. Offered every two to three weeks, this four-hour, court-approved seminar educates parents on the effects of divorce on children, encourages responsible parenting and facilitates the development of important skills such as communication and conflict management.   Hurting Children Need Hope Counselor/Educator Grief Training day-long workshops teach counselors and educators about grief in children. CEUs provided.  Volunteer Facilitators lead grief and divorce support groups. Facilitators attend a hands-on training covering the nature of grief, small group interaction and CW support group curriculum.
