Breakthrough seeks to demonstrate the compassion of christ by partnering with those affected by poverty to build connections, develop skills & open doors of opportunity. In chicago's east garfield park, where disinvestment has left the neighborhood devoid of opportunity and full of broken dreams, breakthrough is restoring the broken networks of youth and families and empowering adults in the community to achieve self-sufficiency and break the cycle of poverty.				Homeless intervention:breakthrough offers a new model for the delivery of homeless services. The organization is intentional about treating every person in need of its services with dignity and respect. When guests arrive at breakthrough, they receive much more than a bed to sleep in-they receive the tools necessary to achieve self-sufficiency. Breakthrough operates two transitional housing shelters in east garfield park: the breakthrough ministry center for men and the breakthrough joshua center for women. Both facilities first aim to meet immediate needs of food and shelter by providing a clean and comfortable place to sleep and by serving breakfast, lunch and dinner. When guests arrive at breakthrough, they receive a toiletry kit, a space to shower and are granted access to laundry facilities. Once the basic needs are addressed, guests are able to access a bevy of supportive services designed to help them along their path to self-reliance. Supportive services include on-site primary and mental health care, employment training and housing search assistance and placement. Breakthrough's homeless intervention program is designed to empower homeless adults to overcome poverty and enjoy the liberty of self-sufficiency in an environment that restores dignity to people who have already had so much stripped away.   youth development:every day, breakthrough surrounds youth with a network of caring adults to support their growth and expand their opportunities. The relationships that youth build with these adults provide positive influence and can make a huge difference in the life of a child. Breakthrough's youth initiatives began operation in 2000 and have grown to serve over 300 youth each year through programs which include preschool, middle and high school academic enrichment and spiritual development activities, along with athletic programs to engage youth physically. Educators have identified early childhood education as one of the most critical necessities for preparing urban youth for academic success. Breakthrough has two primary academic enrichment programs to help meet this need. Breakthrough beginners, a pre-kindergarten program, equips young children with a strong academic foundation and fosters social and emotional development in youngsters. The nettie bailey student achievement program, named after a local hero and public educator of 27 years, focuses on teaching literacy and is recognized by the illinois state board of education as a 21st century community learning center. To address the spiritual development needs of students, program participants also have the option of participating in weekly bible studies, led by staff and volunteers, to foster spiritual growth and life-transforming experiences. To complement breakthrough's academic and spiritual development efforts, the organization offers an extensive athletics program to engage young athletes in year-round sports leagues while teaching leadership, sportsmanship and promoting healthy lifestyles.   neighborhood transformation:breakthrough seeks to end cycles of poverty in the community by providing ways for people to connect into relational networks of support, to have access to resources and opportunities, and to contribute back to the community. A variety of services, events, and resources are offered towards that end. Through the fresh market, breakthrough offers a dynamic food resource that aims to end hunger in the community. The fresh market provides groceries and various supplies to families in breakthrough's target zone. Through the fresh market community, residents also have access to such services as legal aid, food stamps, housing, employment, financial management, ged, and family workshops. The fresh market also welcomes food and general supply donations.

Special olympics illinois conducts several special events each year to raise funds and help communicate the message about special olympics to the general public. High profile events such as the law enforcement torch run are very successful both in terms of funds raised and increased public awareness. In 2014 there was increased emphasis on project unify. Special olympics project unify is an education-based project, funded by the u. S. Department of education that uses the sports and education programs of special olympics to activate young people across the u. S. In order to promote school communities where all young people are agents of change - fostering respect, dignity, and advocacy for people with intellectual disabilities. Project unify began its sixth year of activities in illinois in 2014. Project unify initiatives include a host of core activities: be a fan - "r word", social networking, sports experience, fans in the stands, get into it (tm), partners club, school enrichment, youth summits, young athletes (tm), unified sports (r), camp schriver, athlete leadership programs, traning and education, youth forums and global youth congress.

Safe Humane	http://www.safehumanechicago.org	(312) 409-4790	EIN 36-4366285	Po Box 7342	Chicago	IL	60680	USA	Animal Protection & Welfare, Animals	Public outreach, education, charitable and scientific purposes: issues related to dogs and other companion animals in communities. Our mission is to create safe and humane communities by inspiring positive relationships between people and animals.				Court case dogs. The safe humane chicago (shc) court case dogs program is a first-of-its-kind in the country, and it promises to improve the welfare of dogs and engage local community members in creating safer, more humane communities throughout the country. It is a collaboration of safe humane with chicago animal care and control (cacc), law enforcement, the criminal justice system, and the animal rescue community and depends on funding from grants as well as numerous individual and business cash and non-cash donations. "court case dogs" (and other such animals) are impounded as "evidence" associated with the criminal court cases of their owners, whether their owners were abusive, neglectful or convicted felons. Each year hundreds of these dogs are trapped in the legal system and suffer from the unjust and incorrect perception that they are "damaged goods. " in fact, they are dogs who have "done the time but not the crime". The court case dog program is a first step toward justice for these animals. What began in january 2010 as a partnership between shc, best friends animal society and cacc to advocate for, support and re-home these animals is now a thriving program managed by safe humane with funding from multiple and diverse sources. Court case dogs are given a second chance at a great life, thanks to a long line of heroes: police; animal control officers; the justice system; court advocates; cacc; veterinarians; shc volunteers, professional dog trainers and behavior consultants; partnering rescue groups; and the families that welcome them into their homes. Shc offers them lifetime behavioral support in the chicago area, free of charge to their fosters or owners. Court case dogs deservedly beat the odds. Whereas about 2% of these dogs made it out of impoundment alive before the program began, the program is saving about 70% of them now. During its first five years ending 12-31-2014, the program has saved 618 dogs, 524 of whom have been adopted and 2 of whom are in sanctuary. With 12 dogs in the program at cacc as of 12-31-2014, 606 have been transferred to 101 partner rescue groups for rehoming. Their average length of stay at cacc (part of which they were not yet owned by cacc because of ongoing legal matters) is now just 16% of the average when the program started: a change from an average of 256 days at cacc to an average 41 days by the end of 2014. Keep in mind that length of stay at cacc is affected by many different actions, decisions and communication, legal constraints, shelter and adopter perceptions, and available resources of a village of professionals, staff, community members and organizations, including the following: offenders / owners at time of impoundment; laws and policies; police; cacc; prosecutors; judges; available veterinary, behavioral, transportation and homing resources; inter-agency communications; social networking; and marketing, all of which is not under the control of any one organization but is monitored by shc and part of our extensive network. Shc is also pleased to report that court case dogs left cacc for rescue or home in 2014 in only 17 days on average after they became city property. In addition, all the court case dogs give back to our communities by being model companions, service dogs, therapy dogs, ambassador dogs, sports stars, and demonstration dogs, among others. You can read their stories on our website (http://safehumanechicago. Org) and on social media. All of this requires recruiting, training, managing and supporting community volunteers, and our staff devotes considerable resources to this. The reason is not difficult to understand. Numerous dedicated volunteers are needed for the program's successes, which can be measured in numbers of court case dogs saved and successfully homed, without returns; the decrease in time they are impounded or fostered; and successful rehoming. In 2014, 96 volunteers donated 3,865. 50 hours to court case dog program activities; between 2010 and 2014, more than 350 volunteers gave 13,517. 75 hours to the court case dogs. But that's not all. Court case dogs are also included in the playgroups that shc manages at cacc, programming reported in line 4d of part iii. In 2014, 122 volunteers devoted 3,203. 75 hours in playgroups with court case and other cacc dogs. Including all activities with the court case dogs at cacc in 2014, 196 volunteers donated 7,554. 25 hours to the program. Since the program started, some 500 individual volunteers have donated 21,860. 75 hours. Demographics of program beneficiaries: a majority of the animal victims were helped by the court case dog program are, of course, dogs and of those, approximately 70% are perceived to be pit-bull types. A handful of cats are beginning to be saved as well. But four-legged animals are not the only ones who benefit. The court case dog program brings numerous community members together to help animals as well as people and their families; and the program serves as a center and a foundation for all the other safe humane programs: youth leaders, lifetime bonds, collaborative justice and community outreach efforts.   program services at chicago animal care and control other than court case dogs (including playgroups, play lots and zarada's cacc medical fund). Safe humane chicago (shc) partners with chicago animal care and control (cacc) in other programming than the court case dogs programming reported in line number 4c of part iii. In 2013 shc continued to manage and maintain playgroups for cacc dogs' mental and physical exercise. As reported in 2012, shc received funding from animal farm foundation to build playlots at cacc and begin running and managing play-groups. In 2013 and 2014, additional funding helped maintain the playlots. In 2014, 122 volunteers devoted 3,203. 75 hours in playgroups with court case and other cacc dogs; since we began managing playgroups in 2012, some 150 volunteers have donated 6,143. 00 hours of their time. Shc also engages volunteers to help adopt out animals or transfer them to rescue groups, provide support for low-cost and free services for companion animals, and provide education and training for community residents or cacc visitors. In addition to the work with the court case dogs and the playgroups at cacc, 7 of our volunteers donated 25 hours to other cacc events in 2014. In addition, through the initiative of a longtime cacc volunteer, safe humane zarada's cacc medical fund continues to save cacc animals. Donations were specifically and solely for use by the medical/ veterinary department for supplies and medical equipment as well as for diagnostics and treatments for individual animals in need. Including all activities at cacc in 2014, 196 volunteers donated 7,554. 25 hours. Since programming started at cacc, some 500 individual volunteers have donated 21,860. 25 hours. Demographics of program beneficiaries. The populations served/included in shc programming at cacc are diverse in species, race/ethnicity, income, education, employment and age; and they live throughout cook and its collar illinois counties.   youth leaders for safe humane chicago. The youth leaders program is a school-year elective that trains chicago public high school students in leadership and public speaking skills as well as animal welfare. Youth leaders give presentations about the humane treatment of animals and the importance of compassion and respect for others to chicago public elementary school children living in some of the poorest, most dangerous, disadvantaged neighborhoods in chicago. Adult volunteers and professionals (such as public speakers, dog trainers, veterinarians, police officers, and social welfare professionals, among others) work with the high school students, teaching them about compassion and respect, animal safety and civic responsibility and providing leadership opportunities as well as hands-on experience with dogs. Youth leaders individualize and deliver a 45-minute interactive, educational presentation to the elementary school children and classroom staff and introduce them to a live dog (a safe humane ambassador dog of the type commonly seen in the neighborhoods with his/her safe humane handler/owner). Consistent with leadership development and positive youth development (pyd) principles, youth leaders are given opportunities to participate in structured activities; develop skills such as teamwork, communication, and leadership; form pro-social relationships with adults, peers, younger children and companion animals; and give back to the community by serving as leaders in an effort to stop animal cruelty and inspire positive relationships with animals and each other, providing access to needed resources for companion animals, and ultimately making chicago a safer and more humane city. The program was developed at payton college prep high school, and a pilot at a second high school, lindblom math and science academy, was completed successfully in 2010 and continues there. In calendar year 2014, only lindblom was able to participate because of a change in the school-day schedule at payton for the school year: at least 3 consecutive hours are required for the program, which takes the youth leaders by bus to the elementary schools or other educational field trips. Shc also benefits from important collaborative relationships with communities in schools of chicago, a nonprofit that addresses the gap between students' needs and schools' ability to respond to these needs by connecting services from nonprofits with chicago public schools, and the city of chicago's office of violence prevention in its department of public health and its safe start program, which addresses childhood exposure to violence (cev) and its prevention. In calendar year 2014, 55 lindblom youth leaders gave interactive, educational presentations to 1,920 elementary school children at 10 different schools, working in 69 different classrooms. Those children reported having 1,867 companion animals in their homes; and the neighborhoods in which they live have among the largest reported number of stray animals and violent crimes in chicago. Of the stray animals, most are community cats and pit-bull dogs. 12 youth leaders volunteered time outside this program to other shc programs. Since its inception in 2008, the youth leaders program has graduated 297 youth leaders who have reached 10,766 elementary school children in disadvantaged neighborhoods. Reaching children in high-risk neighborhoods is particularly important because of the alarming number of chicago children exposed to violence, particularly dog fighting, which is associated with other risks such as family violence, illegal weapons, illegal drugs, gambling and gang activity. The program's successes are measured in numbers reached, the evaluations given to the youth leaders and their elementary school children and teacher audiences, and the continuing impact on a significant number of youth leader alumnae. Moreover, some of our youth leaders continue to volunteer with us or other nonprofit/ community-service organizations during their school breaks, even when they come home from college. Such successful impact is due in large measure to the commitment of safe humane chicago volunteers: in 2014, 55 volunteers gave 311. 25 hours to classroom and event programming; since the fall of 2008 through cy 2014, 150 adult volunteers have given 2,199. 50 hours to the youth leaders program. Demographics of program beneficiaries: the primary population the program serves is the youth leaders themselves: chicago public high school students ages 14-18 of diverse race/ethnicity. The majority are females from low- to middle-income families living in neighborhoods throughout chicago. The secondary but equally essential population the program serves is chicago public elementary school children who are the audience of the youth leaders. They are mainly in the third through sixth grades, ages 8-12, with equal numbers of males and females. They are primarily of african-american and hispanic ethnicity and mainly from low-income or poor families who live in the south and west sides of chicago in communities most impacted by violence (including abuse of both people and animals) and lack of resources for their human family members as well as their companion animals.

For the past 27 years, BACOA has been the primary organization in the Barrington area that assists seniors and caregivers  including family members and friends  as they deal with issues related to aging.   For active seniors, we offer programs, services and activities to help them remain vital, contributing members of the community. For seniors requiring more careand for family caregiverswe form a team consisting of the senior, the caregiver and others. Using the resources of our own staff, as well as other agencies, we work to identify services that will best help the senior remain independent.  Older adults prefer to age in place  to be able to stay in their own community and, in most cases, in their own homes, for as long as possible.  But often they are faced with health, financial and emotional challenges, and adult children and relatives are increasingly less likely to live nearby.  As a result, older adults and their families are becoming more dependent on service providers to help them identify needed resources.		Seniors and family caregivers in the Barrington, Illinois area.	Our focus is primarily in Barrington, North Barrington, South Barrington, Lake Barrington, Barrington Hills, Deer Park, and Tower Lakes. Of the families and older adults we serve, 72% are from the Barrington area, and 10% from adjacent communities.  Another 18% are from outside the area, including other Chicago suburbs and out of state (the majority of which are phone calls requesting information on local services for parents or older relatives).	The Barrington Area Council on Aging's services and programs include information on senior services, caregiver support and education, Meals with Wheels, monthly support groups, Medicare and benefits counseling, a weekly lunch program and leisure activities.	BACOA serves approximately 1,500 people - both older adults and family caregives -  each year.

Milton Road	Wauconda	IL	60084	USA	Developmentally Disabled Centers, Disabilities	The mission of Partners For Progress is to provide alternative equine therapeutic programs to individuals with physical, mental and emotional challenges.  By using quality trained horses, each individual participant rider will have a chance to experience the highest quality therapeutic ride with maximum benefits.	Partners For Progress is committed to: 1.helping each individual that comes to our facility achieve their maximum personal potential, welfare, and self-achievement, 2.paving ground in the field of equine therapy by continually thinking outside of the box for ways to assist these individuals, whether their need be emotional, mental, or physical in nature, and 3.making equine therapeutic programs more efficient and effective, and are willing to share this information - once proven - with other equine therapy programs.  All those who come to Partners For Progress are treated as an individual, and receive an evaluation delivered by a licensed Occupational Therapist, Physical Therapist, or a Speech/Language Pathologist to pinpoint deficit areas which impact the function of daily life. Once that evaluation is completed, therapist, instructor, family members, and participant (if able) work together to generate a treatment plan that is most affective and beneficial for the participants functional gain, allowing for unlimited possibilities.  Our therapists and staff have designed the programs at Partners For Progress to be goal oriented utilizing measurable goals. Overall well-being health is promoted in an attempt to prevent the prevalence and progression of disease and disability. With measurable goals for the participants as well as the programs, progress is easily identifiable for the over 160 participants per week that we serve.  Collaborative teamwork based on purpose is also integral to success for Partners For Progress. With a skeletal staff (compared to other equine therapeutic centers) and 5 years of documented outcome history, the programs at Partners For Progress have been able to attain a 70% goal achievement success rate.  What does that mean? It means that 70% of the goals assessed to our participants are achieved, or for 70% of the opportunities presented the participant will demonstrate moderate or better progress toward the assigned goal. It is quite the moment to see the joy on a participants face when they realize that they are no longer limited due their achievement of a goal.  To support our programs, Partners For Progress provides a quality of horse that falls within the top 5% of therapeutic facilities within the United States. A higher quality of horse allows for more functional gain which is a necessity to all of our participants. This exceptional level of equine quality and ability - which is of the greatest importance to the participant - is maintained through rigorous training, maintenance, and quality veterinarian care.  Because of all this, Partners For Progress has been able to stretch our reach past the therapeutic needs of our participants. We are currently the only therapeutic riding center within the states of Illinois and Wisconsin that maintains a national traveling show team. This team participates in competition with the National Snaffle Bit Association (NSBA) and the American Quarter Horse Association (AQHA), and its participants have achieved honors that include World Championship titles.

We work to provide an environment where the shared experiences help provide hope, strength and understanding.	In 1978, Dr. Edward Baum, a pediatric oncologist at Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago, had an idea.  As a witness to the extended medical treatments of children with cancer, and the social and developmental challenges that can result from missed school and activities--Dr. Baum wanted to create a healing experience for these special kids.  Children's Oncology Services, Inc., and its One Step At A Time Summer Camp were born.  The first summer, 40 campers and 14 volunteers traveled to Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, for the inaugural camp.  For many of these children, it was the first time they connected with other kids just like them--and together they learned to challenge themselves in new ways while giving each other strength and hope along the way. Over the past four decades, Children's Oncology Services has expanded its programming and services to meet the needs of more than 11,000 children and their families.  Today, One Step Programs have expanded far beyond Summer Camp.  Programs include government advocacy trips, skiing, horseback riding, and urban camps right in the heart of Chicago. Through One Step Programs, children learn that they are survivors, not patients, and they are not alone.  Most important, campers often return home with a greater sense of hope, confidence and determination in their own journey with cancer.	pediatric cancer patients and surviviors	midwestern states	Summer Camp, Winter Camp, Utah Ski Program, Springfield-IL Program, Chicago Day Camp, Whitewater Adventure Program, Washington D.C.

They would be supported by a training program that will enable them to provide sufficient help until the patient can be taken to the nearest medical facility or a traveling physician can come to the village. It will be unique, as it will not require literacy to operate  MEDICAL INTERVENTION: Benin Contacts and relationships have been developed with colleagues in Benin that crosscuts various areas: health and illness, poverty and sustainability, environmental concerns, traditional and medical sciences/health treatment and education.

From a small, six-room house, The Hope School has developed into a well-equipped, 24 hour residential facility providing specialized diagnostic services, a school, respite care and community home living. The Hope School, a private, not-for-profit, residential school for children with multiple disabilities, is nestled on 25 scenic, wooded acres in Springfield, Illinois and serves nearly 100 children and youth ages 5 to 21.

During fy 2014 the average census for the hope school learning center was 183 youth.   noll medical pavilion: noll medical pavilion represents a bold step to provide a new source of hope to families in central and southern illinois. Together with nonprofit partners, the hope institute shares a common goal of providing families of children with developmental disabilities and mental illness with access to key primary care and specialized health care services in one location. Often, children with developmental disabilities and mental illness have difficulty accessing essential health care services. Sensory and behavioral issues may mean that treatment for these persons takes longer than it would for more typical patients. As a result, families must frequently travel long distances to obtain the care these children need. In addition to primary care services, noll medical pavilion is the headquarters of the autism program of illinois and also offers services in the following areas: psychiatry, psychology, counseling and dentistry. In fy 2014, new parent to parent programming was developed and implemented at noll medical pavilion, along with additional informational meetings targeting parents. Neighboring school districts began sending students to noll vocational training center. In all, more than 7,000 children and their families from across the region were served in fy 2014. Noll dental clinic: one of the services provided by hope at the noll medical pavilion is the noll dental clinic. The clinic provides comprehensive, compassionate care for all children and adults, with a special emphasis on those with developmental disabilities and mental illness. These patients have a very difficult time obtaining access to oral health services. In fy 2014, noll dental clinic received grant funding to begin moving toward the ability to offer sedation dentistry for its patients. The autism program of illinois(tap): created by the illinois general assembly in fy 2003, the autism program of illinois (tap) has grown to become the nation's largest statewide autism resource and services network. The hope institute serves as the lead agency and fiscal agent for tap, which is a partnership of universities and nonprofit organizations across illinois. With 19 locations, no family in illinois is more than a reasonable drive from the tap service network. Since its creation, tap's focus has been on providing a comprehensive, evidence-based system of care for illinois families. Each tap center provides critical services and has a family and community resource room, where educational materials are available free of charge. In fy 2014, tap centers completed more than 1,500 diagnostic screenings and assessments. 4,741 consults involving 1,758 families were completed. 7,584 persons were trained during more than 1,600 training sessions. Family and community resource centers were open for 27,612 hours, serving nearly 4,000 visitors. The hope health and wellness center: providing the best health care for the children of hope is a top priority. The staff of the hope institute health and wellness center work tirelessly to meet all the health care needs of the children served by the hope institute. Because of the medically fragile nature of some of the children, expertise and attention to detail are vital. Health care professionals are available on the hope campus 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. These health care professionals complete more than 300,000 patient encounters in the typical year and partner with other top health care providers in the region to assure that outstanding care is provided to all children served. Illinois crisis prevention network (icpn): the hope institute, in partnership with trinity services of new lenox, illinois operates the illinois crisis prevention network (icpn) under a contract from the illinois department of human services. The icpn consists of teams of highly trained professionals with extensive experience in the social service community. The teams are made up of skilled clinicians who work with individuals with severe behaviors and are struggling to maintain in their current home or placement. These behaviors can be difficult for families or staff to work with, disrupt their environment and can take an emotional toll on everyone living or working there. Team members can provide strategies to reduce or eliminate these behaviors, training for staff or caregivers to cope and work effectively with the clients and help locate resources in the community. During fy 2014, icpn continued to increase its statewide caseload at the direction of the illinois department of human services.

Rainbows for All Children	http://www.rainbows.org	847-952-1770	EIN 36-3262836	1007 Church Street No 408	Itasca	IL	60201	USA	Counseling, Human Services, Mental Health, Mental Health & Crisis Intervention, Single Parent Agencies	Rainbows For All Children is an international, nonprofit organization that fosters emotional healing for children grieving a loss or life-altering crisis. The goals include helping children to develop and strengthen coping skills, learn appropriate behavior and anger management, alleviate depression, and reduce emotional pain and suffering. These coping tools will build the confidence and self-esteem of these hurting children, improve communication in their families and peer relationships, prevent destructive behaviors such as involvement with gangs, alcohol and drug abuse, and ultimately improve school attendance and academic performance.   Rainbows enriches the lives of youth with a sense of hope, forgiveness, and coping skills to prevent grief from defining their lives. Since 1983, more than 2.5 million were helped through Rainbows and nearly 200,000 youth are assisted each year.  HOW RAINBOWS WAS BORN:  Suzy Yehl Marta, Founder and President of Rainbows, was working several part-time jobs and struggling to keep the family together financially when she had her epiphany: Her boys were hurting  and the divorce was to blame. She tried counseling but quit when the therapist told her they were all doing just fine. Marta searched for a program for the boys but found none. So, with other parent volunteers, she ran weekend retreats for grieving youth through her local church. In three years, 800 kids came  each one broken-hearted, angry, confused and isolated in pain.  Finally, Marta faced a tough decision: Take a good-paying, full-time job, which she desperately needed, or use the knowledge shed gained from the retreats to start an organization for grieving youth, which her kids also needed. She did the right thing and, in 1983, she established Rainbows. The program was based on the four principles that Marta had learned from the kids themselves:      * Adults often dont recognize when children are grieving.      * Children dont know how to grieve, and the consequences of this can be devastating.      * Children dont distinguish between the pain of loss that results from death and the pain of loss that results from divorce, separation or abandonment      * Children can be healed after loss.   Rainbows began with three small pilot programs in Chicago-area schools. Flash forward to 2010: more than 10,000 sites have implemented Rainbows worldwide, with a network of 30,000 trained volunteer facilitators assisted 127,000 children and teens. Rainbows oversees effective, peer-support programs throughout the United States and 16 other countries.  Rainbows has four age-appropriate programs to serve children from pre-school through young adulthood. A fifth program works with single parents. As a nonprofit, Rainbows operates on a shoestring budget and miniscule staff and it also offers Silver Linings, a crisis response program designed for teachers and youth group leaders following community or large-scale disasters. More than 600 editions of the program were distributed nationwide following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 and thousands after the Gulf Coast Hurricanes.  Despite its growth and expansion, Rainbows focus remains clearly centered on grieving youth. For Marta, now remarried and the mother to six adult children, the challenge today is the same as it was two decades ago: To provide grief support to every child or teen who needs help coping with the pain of loss.			United States,	Rainbows collaborates with schools and faith communities to offer grief support groups for youth that have experienced a life-altering loss in their family.

With the guidance of exceptional women, girls have the opportunity to explore their individual strengths and learn to sustain positive relationships in a supportive, creative, and open environment.	In just 10 years, This Is ME has   o  served more than 700 girls between the ages of 7 and 17,  o  delivered more than 70 programming initiatives,  o  introduced participants to countless female role models, and  o  engaged girls in special events, field trips, and productions every year  In the past year alone, This Is ME  o  served 140 girls through 15 programming components and field trips,  o  provided 31 of This Is MEs neediest families with in-kind and financial resources,  o  welcomed 42 new volunteers, and  o  began quarterly training 0pportunities to ensure volunteers understand our mission and approach to serving girls.  We would like to share some of the achievements of these activities and here focus on the weekly school-based programs during the 2008-2009 school year (update to come soon):      * The Hanson Park School Reading Enrichment Program exceeded all four of its objectives:            o At least 60% of participants will express a greater interest in reading. Actual 79%            o At least 60% of participants will improve their vocabulary. Actual 65%            o At least 50% of participants will demonstrate increased confidence in reading aloud.

We made the following strides:            o 69% said the program helped them learn something new about their classmates.            o 62% said the program helped them appreciate someone either they didnt know or didnt like before.            o 100% said they learned something they can apply to their real life as far as having self-confidence, accepting others, or making good choices in their relationships.            o 93% said the program helped make their 8th grade year better than it would have been without it.      * Participants of the 7th Grade Girls Circle at Saint Andrew School who completed their end-of-year evaluation unanimously felt that the program helped them learn something new about their classmates; appreciate someone either they didnt know or didnt like before; learn something they can apply to their real life as far as having self-confidence, accepting others, or making good choices in their relationships; and made their 7th grade year better than it would have been without it. Some comments that stood out:            o I learned that people arent just what they seem like, they go deeper than that.            o I was never really sure about myself; I feel better than I did about myself.            o I learned a lot of them (classmates) were feeling the same way as me, too, just not saying it like me.            o Now I know how I can talk to others without hurting their feelings.            o I know now that some people arent as strong and as put together as they act.            o I know not to judge people because they just want to be accepted and were all the same in the long run in terms of our wanting to be accepted.      * By the end of the 8 weeks that the 6th Grade Girls Circle at Saint Andrew School met,            o 55% of the girls learned something new about themselves.            o 55% leaned something new about their classmates.            o 73% said the program helped them feel better about themselves.            o 64% learned to appreciate someone they didnt know or didnt like before.            o 82% learned something they could apply to their real life.  Girls commented at the end:      * I have good things about myself that people see, too.      * Im more open to myself and other people; Im true to myself.      * Before I attended This Is ME, I doubted myself, but now I feel a lot better.      * I think twice now about what I do.      * Some feedback from participants of the Homework Heroes Program:            o If I didnt have Homework Heroes, Id have to work harder and Id be totally stressed out.            o Homework Heroes (HH) is awesome. Everybody should be in HH and if theyre not, they should sign right up because its a very, very, very good program and it helps you with your homework.            o If you need help with your homework they help you and they teach you lessons about it.

Milwaukee Ave.	Chicago	IL	60622	USA	Education, Educational Services	826CHI is a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting students ages 6 to 18 with their creative and expository writing skills, and to helping teachers inspire their students to write.			Chicago	After school tutoring and writing: it is our belief that great leaps in learing happen when students receive individual attention, which is why 826chi offers free drop-in tutoring monday - thursday from 3:00 pm to 5:30 pm during the school year. While the main focus of the majority of our programs in writing, our volunteer tutors are able to work one-on-one with students on their homework in any subject. Each day, however, begins with a trip to the writing tables, where students respond to a creative writing prompt. Every six weeks students revise one piece of writing, which is then published in a chapbook. Families and community members are invited to join us as we celebrate the release of each chapbook with a student reading. After-school tutoring and writing would not be possible without hundreds of volunteers who commit their time each year.   field trip: on weekday mornings, we welcome classes from schools accross the city for creative field trips hosted on-site, where we work with students to create original compelling stories in just a couple of hours. 826chi can work with teachers to design custom field trips that compliment their curriculum, but in most cases we offer a standard menu of field trip options: memoir writing, images and imagination, choose your own adventure and our most popular field trip, storytelling and bookmaking. During the latter, students are charged with the task of writing a story for admiral moody, our cranky, never seen publisher. Students work as a group, aided by our enthusiastic 826chi volunteers to decide on the characters, setting and plot, until the story reaches a cliffhanger moment - at which point each student writes their own original ending, satisfying the demands of admiral moody. In the end, each student leaves with a bound copy of their own story complete with their author photo. This field trip teaches students about collaborating, self-editing, the bookmaking process and elements of successful storytelling. And it's really a good time for all.   in school support: while we strive to make our center available and accessible to students throughout the community, it is sometimes difficult for students to make it to our programs during the day. Thanks to our amazing dedicatin of our volunteers, we are able to make it to them. Groups of volunteers are available to work one-on-one with students to provide guidance and feedback for research and writing projects, including literary journals, newpaper articles and college application essays. We work with teachers throughout the year in projects of varying length - from a couple of weeks to an entire semester - to support their writing and literacy curriculum. During 2010, 826chi provided 1,214 students with writing support in the classroom.   education, general/other: tutor children ages 6 to 18 in their creative and expository writing skills

Through a continuum of housing options, comprehensive support services and opportunities for change provided by dedicated volunteers and staff, women succeed in achieving their goals of stable housing, sustainable income and greater self-determination.	Since the agency opened its doors in 1985, over 3,500 women have benefited from the programs and services of Deborah's Place. In fiscal year 2010, the housing programs and supportive services provided by Deborah's Place helped 450 women work toward their goals of permanent housing, sustainable income, and greater self-determination. The number of women served was a 17% increase from the previous fiscal year. Highlights of the impact Deborah's Place had on these women include:  *53 women moved directly from the streets to the agency's supportive housing programs.  *97% of our supportive housing residents maintained their housing at Deborahs Place (163 women) or relocated to stable housing in the community (25 women). These women have truly broken the cycle of homelessness.  * Zero women were evicted or terminated from our programs, demonstrating our commitment to harm reduction and Housing First strategies.  *54 women obtained or maintained sustainable income through employment or public benefits.  *100 percent of participants accessed critical services that helped to reduce barriers to maintaining stable housing, including 191 who received health services, and 409 who sought educational or social-emotional opportunities through the agenc's Learning Centers.	Deborahs Place served unaccompanied adult women who are homeless or at risk of homelessness.

Deborahs Place also provides daytime supportive services to off-site women who are currently homeless or at risk of homelessness.   * Health Services:  Through on-site mini-health clinics, Deborahs Place staff and partners coordinate womens healthcare and provide referrals to free or low-cost health services.  On-site healthcare and health education reduce health crises that may require costly emergency room visits and helps women who have not accessed traditional healthcare due to barriers including lack of health insurance, mental illness, substance use, and resistance to care.  * Education Services:  Group activities, field trips, and one-on-one engagement provide women access to the humanities, life skills training, social-emotional development, and basic adult education including GED preparation and computer instruction.  * Employment Services:  Assistance with resume-writing, job searches, and career coaching helps women to obtain and maintain employment.  * Therapeutic Services:  Licensed clinical social workers and masters-level student interns provide counseling and crisis intervention for women with mental illness, addictions, and dual diagnoses.   Art therapy is also provided at multiple sites.  * Comprehensive Case Management: Unlike the traditional medical model, case management at Deborahs Place is an individualized and participant-directed process, comprised of collaborative interventions that assist each woman in meeting the goals she has established for herself.  Guided by the Recovery Model, case management services use an asset-based approach emphasizing each womans individual strengths so that case managers can link women to resources  both inside and outside of Deborahs Place  to help them reach stability and self-sufficiency.	Over 400 women go through the doors of Deborahs Place each year, and we strive to ensure that once housed in our programs, not one will return to the streets. Kathy, a former participant of Teresas Interim Housing and the Rebecca Johnson Apartments, described how she broke the cycle of homelessness at Deborahs Place in a recent letter to our Executive Director: I enjoy my life now. I find a purpose to get up in the morning and am more capable of handling challenges that life brings my way. In the letter, she described her personal journey: Finding her dream job (the longest I have ever been employed with one employer before, she wrote), living in her own apartment, and approaching completion of her doctorate degree. This would never have been possible without the support and encouragement that I received from Deborah's Place.  Like Kathy, women come to Deborahs Place for assistance reclaiming control over their lives and discover not only the tangible reward of a key to their new homes, but also their inner strength to recover from homelessness.

Paws Chicago	http://www.pawschicago.org	(773) 935-7297	EIN 36-4219778	1997 N Clybourn Ave	Chicago	IL	60614	USA	Animal Protection & Welfare, Animal Services, Animals	Paws chicago's mission is to build no kill communities, starting with a no kill chicago; to end pet overpopulation; and to transform animal welfare by setting higher standards. Since its founding, the number of pets killed each year in chicago has been reduced by 77 percent. Paws chicago's lifesaving success is rooted in the no kill model, which can be replicated and scaled in any community. The foundation of all lifesaving is community engagement. By raising awareness about pet homelessness and engaging people in lifesaving efforts, we can make lasting change for animals. Paws chicago's mission-critical programs - our no kill pillars of prevention, adoption, animal health & behavior, and volunteers -- sit atop this foundation. These are the robust programs that are essential to building no kill communities.				Animal health & behavior:committing to the life of each treatable pet and providing all medical treatment and behavioral enrichment needed to optimize health and wellbeing is one of the most critical elements of no kill. Because of our expert veterinary and behavior teams, we are one of the few shelters in the country that can treat and rehabilitate a large volume of sick, injured and behaviorally challenged animals. In 2014, we had a 97. 37 percent save rate, even while taking in a vulnerable population of animals. Shelter medicine: the medical center-the first stop for homeless animals when they arrive at paws-treats the most serious cases onsite. We also utilize a robust foster network for pets receiving more simple treatment. In 2014, thousands of animals were treated at our medical center-2,191 pets had upper respiratory infections alone-and 3,467 pets went into foster care. More than 41,000 vaccinations, microchips and blood tests were provided in 2014. Training & behavior enrichment: in 2014, we celebrated the opening of our training & foster care center. This 3,000 square-foot space is now home to our innovative dog training and enrichment programming and a hub to expand our geographic reach to new foster families. Through this center, our team of behavior professionals and trained volunteers provide our homeless dogs with one-on-one and group training, agility and enrichment. And it's making an impact. In 2014, 122 behaviorally challenged dogs found new loving homes. Expanding the medical center: with the progress we are seeing in chicago, healthy animals are being saved in record numbers at the city pound, which means we are seeing a sicker population of animals in need of rescue, requiring enhanced medical resources to treat. To save more lives, paws chicago is launching a major expansion of our medical center and shelter medicine program to triple our capacity to take in, isolate and treat sick and injured animals.   prevention & spay/neuter:spay/neuter services: with the paws chicago lurie clinic located in little village and the gusmobile spay/neuter van, which brings life-saving solutions directly to neighborhoods most in need, we performed 18,290 spay/neuter surgeries in 2014. Seventy-two percent of client surgeries were provided free of charge. Preventing unwanted pets from being born is key to building a no kill chicago. The majority of stray, feral and unwanted pets originate in low income, under resourced communities. Important pet resources like free spay/neuter surgeries, information on pet care and training and affordable medical care are all necessary ingredients to reducing pet homelessness and building a humane community. Trap-neuter-return program: paws chicago's feral cat trap-neuter-return (tnr) program is critical aspect of our targeted spay/neuter approach. It is aimed at proactively sterilizing and managing the free roaming cat population, the source of thousands of unwanted kittens born each year. Tnr reduces the number of animals entering the sheltering system each year while also saving kittens and finding them adoptive homes. In 2014, paws performed 4,763 spay/neuter surgeries on feral cats. Outreach efforts: expanding our reach and meeting people who would never knew about paws chicago's support and resources is the key objective of our outreach efforts. In late 2014, we launched two paws for life outreach programs to connect families in need with resources and information to help them better care for their pets. Our first neighborhood of focus was englewood, where more than 49 percent of the population lives below the poverty line. The team achieved spay/neuter conversion rate of 89 percent of all unaltered pets they met. We also began counseling and offering resources to individuals coming to the city pound (animal care & control, or acc) to give up their pets, preventing animals from entering the sheltering system.   adoption:rescuing homeless pets and uniting them with their new families is at the forefront of what we do. Through paws chicago's adoption centers, offsite events and innovative programming, 5,952 animals found loving homes in 2014. While saving pets from the local community is paws chicago's primary mission, because of the progress we have made in chicago, we are able to rescue at risk animals from other states. Our dog spay/neuter efforts have been so successful that in chicago all the puppies at the city pound are being rescued, and there are more families wanting puppies than the chicago rescue community can provide. To meet adoption demand, we have developed relationships with groups in tennessee, oklahoma and mississippi to save puppies who would otherwise be killed. Pippen fasseas adoption center: the pippen fasseas adoption center in lincoln park, which opened in 2007, redefined animal sheltering as the first cageless, state-of-the-art, no kill shelter in the midwest. Innovative on-site adoption events like our spring and holiday 36-hour adopt-a-thons raise awareness and bring in the community, resulting in more lives saved. Glenn l. Felner adoption center: paws chicago's first satellite adoption facility-the glenn l. Felner adoption center- opened in december 2014 in highland park. The opening of the north shore center represents an important step in paws chicago's mission to expand lifesaving and build no kill communities. Located inside the highland park petco, the center was responsible for 76 adoptions in its first month of operation. In 2015, we are working to find new families 500 additional homeless pets. Offsite adoption events: through our angels with tails off-site adoption events in chicago and various suburban locations, we bring adoptable animals to high-traffic shopping centers and retail stores where people will stop, play with the animals and think about adopting. Paws chicago also hosted additional offsite adoption events almost every weekend during 2014.

Pff patient registry: the pff patient registry is a collaborative effort that will bring together multiple stakeholders including patients, health care providers, and researchers. The registry is an electronic database of patient information that will be de-identified (made anonymous) and independently managed by a data-coordinating center. The goals of the pff patient registry are to provide a robust dataset of clinical and quality of life (qol) data on the full spectrum of pulmonary fibrosis patients, help shape and improve clinical care patterns to advance patient outcomes, serve as an invaluable tool in support of research to improve qol and outcomes and to aid awareness of and enrollment into clinical trials.   pff care center network:the goal of the pff care care center network is to elevate the standard of care for patients with pulmonary fibrosis. The pff care center network connects leading medical centers throughout the us that have expertise in treating fibrotic lung diseases. The institutions that comprise the network use a multidisciplinary approach to deliver comprehensive patient care. These specialized care teams include individuals with expertise in pulmonary medicine, rheumatology, radiology, pathology, gastroenterology, and thoracic surgery. This multipronged, collaborative approach is critical to managing a complex disease like pulmonary fibrosis and ensuring individuals receive an accurate diagnosis, obtain quality clinical care, and acquire important support services.   research:the pulmonary fibrosis foundation (pff) places enormous importance on creating an environment that will assist in the development of effective treatments for pulmonary fibrosis (pf). We are developing this environment by directly funding research, promoting advocacy efforts, encouraging collaborative relations between industry and academic researchers and developing solutions to bridge existing gaps in pf research. The pff research fund supports projects that offer a high likelihood of improving the understanding of pf in the following areas: basic science, translational science, clinical medicine/research and social science/quality of life. The pff research advisory committee administers the peer-reviewed process which funds multiple grants including four $50,000 grants per grant cycle.   1 outreach and awarenesspff ambassador program-the pff ambassador program empowers patients, caregivers, and health care professionals as spokespersons for the pf community on behalf of the pff.

Umoja Student Development Corporation	http://www.umojacorporation.org	773-312-3898	EIN 36-4263664	954 West Washington Blvd, Suite 225	Chicago	IL	60607	USA	Education, Educational Services, Vocational & Technical Schools	Umoja partners with Chicagos most challenged public high schools to create positive, youth-centered environments that increase student attendance and engagement, reduce violence, promote academic success and increase graduation and college enrollment rates. Founded in 1997 at Manley High School  a school on the west side of Chicago with a 99.8% African-American and 97% low income student population  Umoja has supported driving a 67% increase in the graduation rate, a dramatic increase in the college enrollment rate from less than 10% to close to 60%, and a 45% decrease in out-of-school suspensions. By building a web of dynamic relationships where schools, families and communities partner to bridge the gap between the talents and ambitions of low-income youth and the resources they need to thrive, Umoja equips young people to succeed in college and confidently claim their future.		Nearly 100% of Manleys 2012 seniors applied for college, collectively submitting almost 1,000 college applications and 87% received college acceptance letters. 	Manleys Class of 2012 collectively earned more than $1 million in scholarships.

Project: VISION, Inc.	http://www.projectvisionchicago.org		EIN 20-0293881	2301 S Archer Ave Unit #3	Chicago	IL	60616	USA	Children & Youth, Youth Development Programs	Project: VISION, Inc. is a nonprofit organization founded in 2003 with a mission to provide youth of Chicagos Chinatown and Bridgeport communities with tools for educational, personal, and civic development. In the fall of 2004, volunteers piloted a homework tutoring program in borrowed space at the local library and Boys and Girls Club. Since then, Project: VISION has moved on to its own space in Chinatown and has reached over 300 youths with its programs while remaining primarily volunteer-run and continuing to provide all programs free to youth.  Project: VISION takes a holistic approach to youth development, with a goal of helping each youth achieve success in all areas of life by providing positive role models and positive activities. We strive to help youth build strengths, develop skills, gain confidence and positive attitudes that will help them succeed in school and beyond as future community leaders.		Project: VISION serves youth ages 12-21 in Chicagos Chinatown, Bridgeport, and surrounding neighborhoods. Youths seek out our organization for many reasons and needs; some are looking for a means to connect with peers and mentors, and some seek to receive homework help, while others want to get involved in the community. Still, our community is often overlooked as underserved; in reality, many of the youths Project: VISION serve are from economically and socially disadvantaged backgrounds. Currently, 96% of Project: VISION youths are Chinese American, with 90% from low-income first generation immigrant families. While many families come to this country seeking better opportunities for their children, language, long work hours in service-oriented jobs, and little understanding of the American education system are all barriers to the parental involvement youth need. This leaves many youth in need of guidance, support, and encouragement, which after school programs like ours can help provide.		Since the beginning of the 2011-2012 school year, Project: VISIONs programs have served 65 youths, providing services to an average of 50 youths each week in several core programs. Programs take place in a 1200 square foot facility consisting of two classrooms, one general tutoring area, library, and computer area with three student workstations. The Youth Center is open from Mondays-Thursdays from 2-7pm.   The After School Homework Tutoring Program is the cornerstone of Project: VISIONs programs as education is the key to future success and eventually to building a stronger community. Tutoring is available at the Youth Center during all hours of operation and is staffed with volunteer tutors available for homework help and one-on-one tutoring. In addition to fostering academic success in terms of helping students improve grades and test scores, the program also strives to help students develop effective academic skills and build appreciation for learning that will serve them well as they move on to college and beyond. So far, in the first semester of this school year, 40 students have benefited the program, increased from serving 30 students over the entire last school year, attesting to the need for this program. The program retention rate is 85%, and on average each student receives six hours of tutoring per week (increased from an average of five hours per week last year). Upon enrolling, each student now completes an initial assessment, consisting of a set of three academic goals and objectives. After the first semester, preliminary estimates show that 70% of tutored students are meeting at least one objective under each academic goal. Furthermore, student surveys show that participants recognize the benefits of the program: 89% feel the program helps them do better in school, while 72% feel more confident at school, and 56% feel tutors help them improve their study skills.   Every Project: VISION student should aim to attend college, and the College Prep program has helped many students achieve this. We continue to send 100 percent of our high school seniors to college after preparing them with programs such as ACT test prep classes, college application, essay writing, and financial aid workshops throughout the school year. The ACT prep program has been particularly successful; over the years, the program has prepared over 100 students for the exam, with over 70% achieving a 2-point or greater improvement in composite scores.   Leadership opportunities and community service are fundamental to positive youth development. While many youths seek service opportunities to fulfill school requirements (Chicago Public School high school students are required to complete 40 community service hours prior to graduation), Project: VISION strives to foster a sense of social responsibility in youth that goes beyond obligation. Project: Youth Initiative is a service learning program that aims to provide meaningful service learning opportunities that help youth learn about the problems in their community, develop positive attitudes toward service, and understand the importance of volunteerism. These are the experiences that will encourage youth to stay involved and help them grow into active community members willing to give back to others. Each semester, Project: Youth Initiative provides three service opportunities to students. Last school year, 50 youths participated in community service projects, collectively earning over 500 service learning hours, and this year, 30 youth have already collectively participated in 270 service hours after one semester. Youths engaged in many projects including recycling projects, community health fairs, production of an anti-tobacco public service announcement, and a community anti-obesity campaign. These meaningful projects have helped youth build positive attitudes toward community service. For example, after participating in an anti-tobacco service project, 90% of students stated that they learned something new and that as a result of the program are encouraged to continue volunteering in the community!

The  DIVEHEART VISION: It is our hope to bring the disabled dive industry up to the level of the disabled ski industry by 2020.   For example: fifty or more years ago if an individual in a wheelchair rolled up to a ski resort in Colorado and wanted to downhill ski, there were no opportunities.  Today, many ski resorts and operators around the world cater to skiers with disabilities, giving them the opportunity to experience the excitement of Alpine skiing.   We believe that as individuals with disabilities discover that scuba diving is an activity that they can easily participate in, the tide will rise and the growing demand will necessitate that dive retailers, manufacturers, instructors, operators and resorts recognize and meet the need.				Diveheart has programs for children, adults and veterans with disabilities.

To achieve this goal, COFI has developed a unique model of leadership development and organizing, Family Focused Organizing, that has successfully brought residents of historically disenfranchised communities into public life, often for the first time.  COFI implements Family Focused Organizing through three programs:(1) Citywide organizing: COFI provides leadership training and organizing assistance to Parents Organized to Win, Educate, and Renew Policy Action Council (POWER-PAC), a citywide organization of 250 low-income African American and Latina parents.  POWER-PAC is working to improve discipline and reduce conflicts in Chicago Public Schools, and to restore recess in the schools to promote healthy child development.(2) Local organizing: COFI provides leadership training, staff training, and organizing assistance to groups such as Austin Wide Parent Leaders, Cabrini Mothers in Power, Family Focus in Englewood and Lawndale, and Nuestra Familia to develop local leaders, build parent teams, and facilitate neighborhood-level community organizing in Chicago's low-income Latino and African American communities.  (3) Shared learning: Through its Institute for Family Focused Organizing, COFI provides staff training and consultation with organizations nationwide who are interested in integrating the Family Focused Organizing model into their work.  COFI also develops and circulates publications about Family Focused Organizing.

Through repeated failures in the classroom and the development of destructive habits, at-risk youth have lost faith in the possibilities that await them. To accomplish this goal, young people must be in a caring, inclusive learning environment that promotes their best effort and reinforces personal respect. 99 ODDS is a program that will focus on the growing number of people that are either falling through the cracks at school or in the community.

The hotline offers individualized risk assessments, comprehensive referrals, and the latest information about hiv/aids and stds to callers from all over the united states and even from abroad. With a database of 2,600 statewide referral services, health educators provide callers with a wealth of information regarding local health, social and support services. Yearly, we reach more than 10,000 diverse callers. Hiv testing and prevention: coh launched its highly successful hiv testing and prevention program in may, 2008. In fy14, we performed 3986 tests (1% positivity rate) reaching msm, hrh, mtf and spanish-speaking persons. The program provides free, rapid, and confidential hiv testing to clients on an appointment or walk-in basis. Clients who test positive for hiv, or who need additional support services, are linked to internal or external providers. Hiv support services: coh offers msm, mtf, hiv+, and spanish-speaking individuals who come through our testing program up to eight hours of free, short-term therapy/supportive counseling. This helps newly diagnosed individuals acquire a deeper understanding of their status and transmission risks, and lessens their anxiety. It has also proven to be an effective, safe opportunity for the health educator to elicit information about sexual and needle-sharing partners as well as to follow up on referrals to primary care. In fy14, 248 hiv+, high risk hiv negative and potentially high risk negative clients were provided with 200 hours of individual or couples counseling. Clients wanting more long-term mental health treatment can enroll in coh's behavioral health services, where hiv+ clients are eligible for low-cost or free therapy through our ryan white part a grant. Clinical health educators also offer five weekly hiv+ support groups, one for 18-34 year olds, two for 35+, one of mixed ages, and one hiv+ art therapy studio group. The model for the groups was developed after a thorough review of group services already available on chicago's north side. Because many groups in our area are open and peer-led, we developed a closed, therapist-facilitated model as an alternative. Group topics include disclosure of hiv status, medication, side effects, symptoms of hiv disease, dating, relationships, sex, safer sex, confidentiality, availability of medical and social services, aging, and substance use. In fy14, 75 unduplicated hiv+ clients were served through seventeen 10-week groups. In cy12, coh launched new risk reduction counseling and online programs targeting high risk adults on the north side of chicago and high risk youth throughout the city.   youth servicessince 1978, center on halsted has served the needs of lgbtq youth in chicago.

Currently, The Building Fund is dedicated to supporting the capital and operating expenses of The Young Apostles International School of Ghana, West Africa. In its support of access to education, The Building Fund seeks to create and sustain opportunities at the schools it serves by funding the completion of buildings and classrooms, donating supplies to classrooms, teachers and students, providing scholarships for students, and engaging volunteers with the schools.	In its brief history, TBF has seen great change in the students, teachers, and volunteers that we work with both at home and abroad. At the Tuskegee International School of Accra, Ghana, TBF has funded the completion of two classrooms, provided annual scholarships for students, engaged volunteers in the classroom, and secured the donation of computers and over 250 lbs. of school supplies. Our success has been measured by the increased enrollment of students, attracted by the opportunity to earn scholarships and learn in classrooms with adequate supplies. At the Young Apostles International School of Daban Panin, Ghana, TBF began its work by securing a donation of over twenty-five thousand books to the school, as well as school supplies and scholarships for its students. Our next step is to build a library that will increase the accessibility of resources for the students, the school, and its community.	Our current project is focused on the construction of a library at the Young Apostles International School of Daban Panin, Ghana where we have secured a donation for nearly 25,000 books from Books For Africa.   Daban Panin is a rural, yet accessible, community encompassing an area of approximately 15 square miles. A rapidly growing and underserved community of framers, traders, artisans and civil servants; the community is expected to continue its rapid growth as transportation network systems in the area improve. Increased educational resources are needed to provide for this growing community and the construction of a library at YAIS would provide resources for nearly 29,270 people and 25 primary and secondary schools. With a literacy rate of only 45% and with the majority of the population falling between the ages of 15 and 30, a library is a timely and invaluable resource.	West Africa

Box 46576	Chicago	IL	60646	USA	Health	Founded by Chicago parents Mike and Mariann Stanton in 2010 after the sudden death of their four-year-old son Danny, the Danny Did Foundations primary mission is to prevent deaths caused by seizures.  The Foundation advances public awareness of epilepsy and Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP), strives to improve communication about SUDEP between medical professionals and families affected by seizures, and advocates for the mainstream acceptance and use of seizure detection and prediction devices that may assist in preventing seizure-related deaths. Epilepsy affects nearly 3 million people in the United States and 65 million people worldwide. One in 26 Americans will develop epilepsy during their lifetime. But what few people understand, including many people with the disorder, is that seizures can be fatal. More people die as a result of seizures than from fires and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) combined. The causes of death can vary and include drowning, other accidents and status epilepticus (prolonged seizures). In addition, thousands of deaths occur annually from SUDEP, a fact that is little known and too rarely addressed in public and in medical circles. The name of the Danny Did Foundation originates from the last line of Danny Stantons obituary, written by his dad: Please go and enjoy your life. Danny did.	The Danny Did Foundation has provided support to families in all 50 states and eight countries. In Danny Stanton's name, we continue to be a source of practical support for patients and parents who are coping with the challenges of epilepsy.
