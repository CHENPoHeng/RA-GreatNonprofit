Hospice Of North Iowa	http://www.mercynorthiowa.com/hospicepalliative-care	(641) 422-6208	EIN 42-1173708	232 2nd St Se	Mason City	IA	50401	USA	Hospices, Human Services	Providing care for terminally ill patients	Hospice of north iowa (hni) began in 1981 and cared for its first patient in the fall of 1982. It was one of the first hospices in iowa and remains one of the three largest hospices in the state. In 1997, hni became a wholly owned subsidiary of mercy medical center-north iowa, which is now a division of mercy health services -iowa,corp. Hni served 800 patients during fy14 in a 10-county service area across north central iowa. The hni office is located in mason city and includes a 6-bed inpatient unit.   the mission statement for hni is as follows:we, hospice of north iowa and trinity health, serve together in the spirit of the gospel as a compassionate and transforming healing presence within our communities. Hospice of north iowa provides compassionate care for all those affected by end of life.   see schedule o for additional information. Community benefit:hospice provides end of life care to all patients regardless of their ability to pay. Most patients are covered by medicare. However, reimbursement by medicare for hospice services does not cover all costs. As a result, hni provides a subsidy to medicare to cover the costs of providing the medicare benefit to its patients. Hni provides bereavement services to anyone from its service area who wishes to access these services, regardless of whether the individual has been involved with hospice during the death of a loved one. These services are provided free of charge. Hni also provides a multitude of educational programs to the community each year on subjects related to advance directives, end of life care, the medicare hospice benefit, and bereavement. While some of these require a small fee from participants, most are completely subsidized by hni and are free to participants. The following are specific examples of programs and services provided to the community:bereavement support groups-hni offers bereavement support groups in mason city, hampton, and charles city on a regular basis for anyone in the service area who is grieving-regardless of prior involvement with hni. Education for professionals-hni staff provide education in such topics as pain and symptom management to professional staff in nursing homes and small area hospitals. This not only improves care to hospice patients but also to other patients with similar problems in these facilities.

Founded in 2008, RHI has established Restoring Hope Village in Welkom South Africa.  RHI is unique in that its mission is not simply humanitarian in the feeding, clothing and educating of children.  The vision driving RHI is focused on the principle that Jesus Christ transforms lives.  Children who previously had very little hope are introduced to the giver of eternal hope.  Meeting physical, spiritual and emotional needs starts with an eternal relationship with Jesus, and flows from there to impact every aspect of a child's life.  RHI would love to share these stories of transformation with you.   RHI is committed to sound fiscal management.   Through the faithful service of volunteers and committed board members RHI keeps its home office expenses very low.  During each year of operation over 95%  of funds received by Restoring Hope International are used directly for ministry expenses. Partnering with RHI ensures that your contributions are used effectively where they are needed most.	Funds are used to provide food, clothing, housing, education and love in and around Welkom, South Africa, through Restoring Hope Village.

Someday Foundation	http://www.somedayfoundation.com	(563) 875-2442	EIN 26-0350804	950 11th St Ne	Dyersville	IA	52040	USA	Health	Helping others in their time of need.	The someday foundation was created by two high school friends who experienced firsthand the loss of family members to cancer. Realizing that while individuals are facing many challenges from a recent diagnosis, life still goes on. Doctor appointments take place, therapy & treatments are on-going, all taking time and resources. Along with that, bills still need to be paid, house payments need to be made, and the list goes on. In short life keeps rolling along. The someday foundation strives to assist with the "everyday" things and relieve some of the pressures that come with that. Many times our recipients find themselves unable to work, or are reduced to limited work schedules. That has a huge impact on their financial situation. Many find, like we did, that there are not a lot of resources to help, and if available, there is a lot of red tape or stipulations that come along with receiving help. The someday foundation cuts out the red tape by having a simple application completed and approved by our board of directors. The someday foundation has made a difference in the lives of many. Our annual fund raising events in dyersville, iowa & madison, wisconsin have enabled us to generate money to help those that are facing a catastrophic life changing event. Since 2001 the someday foundation has raised over $245,000 and has been able to assist over 350 families and individuals in their time of need. The pink ribbon open is an annual golf fundraiser raising money for local nonprofit groups that help women coping with cancer.
