We value our youth of today to make a better tomorrow.  We must educate through healthy eating exercise, and invent ways to make our program interesting.  One of the ways we plan to implement our food program is by teaching children how to turn lemons into lemonade.  This can apply in our homes, our schools, our churches and yes, our community. Most children do not have the concept of how they can take a cucumber and make pickles.  Most of our children are not aware that they can take the hull from a peach and make jelly.  We would like for part of our healthy eating program to have a pilot program that will teach youth how to grow and maintain a garden and how to can vegetables or just grow a tomato to pull and eat from the vine.  We want to educate them on the process by hands on experience of each child, during our after school program.

Goodwill's mission is primarily supported by revenue from the collection and sale of donated goods in our 39 locations across the state. Over half of our locations have onsite career coaches to assist anyone with finding their next great job. Goodwill has helped thousands of people with disabilities and disadvantages secure part-time or full-time employment with earnings that meet or exceed minimum wage. Our average wage for people placed in jobs is $9. 50, but our salaries for persons placed in jobs range from $7. 50 per hour to $80,000 annually. Goodwill is a carf accredited organization, and the first service program, designed to serve individuals with the most significant disabilities was also the first to receive carf national certification. Our organization supports over 14 different programs across the state of arkansas. These programs range from youth and family services to reentry and support services for job seekers, and have changed the lives of thousands of arkansans each year.   in 2015, goodwill served 17,245 people and placed 4,751 people in employment. This represents a 40% increase in persons served over 2014 and a 72% increase in people placed in jobs over the prior year. The amount of services provided statewide was over 145k, an average of 8 direct and supportive services per person. Our specialty programs from persons with disabilities continue to have great success with job placement and retention rates above 90%, and our transitional employment program has a 92% success rate. Our new programs include youth and family services, free financial coaching, and a trade school entitled, the academy at goodwill, with 10 courses leading to a certification or credential. -the work activity program provides individuals more time for job experience activities and training and support from on-the-job coaches once they are employed. These coaches work one-on-one with the individual and slowly decrease their support as the individual becomes more independent and capable of handling all of the job duties successfully, without assistance or monitoring. The work activity program provides social activities to enhance quality of life for those persons with significant disabilities and to continually provide opportunities for community integration, for individuals beyond traditional working age. -the horizon's program was created as goodwill realized a community need to serve young adults with autism spectrum disorder. This new job training program allows individuals to identify their strengths, learn new skills, and prepare to find a productive niche in the workforce, in their communities. Goodwill carves out occupational pathways, empowers individuals, and gives young adults and their families the opportunity to enjoy full and productive lives.   goodwill's transitional employment opportunity (teo) program offers job readiness training and job placement services for people after incarceration to help them find work, launch careers, and rebuild lives. Through the teo program, goodwill offers an environment that supports individuals who are at least 18 years old with non-violent and non-sexual criminal offenses who want to reintegrate into the community and make positive contributions.   assessment program

The main function of Stray Central is to spay/neuter, vaccinate, tend to the medical/emotional needs, and provide a safe haven for as many homeless, unwanted, and abused/neglected companion animals as possible until they can be adopted into loving, forever homes.  Our second purpose is to be a devoted refuge where cats with severe medical, emotional, and/or behavioral problems can spend their remaining days with love, understanding, and without the threat of euthanasia.  Stray Centrals third, but no less essential role is to be a source of information for pet owners and to educate the public about the importance of spaying/neutering their pets and all other aspects of responsible pet ownership.  We are a cat-only rescue.  By not having a shelter facility, were not equipped to take in other animals  but that doesnt stop us from doing what we can to help any creature in need!  While we do occasionally rescue dogs and other animals, we simply arent set up to care for them.  In those situations, we work with other rescue groups that are better prepared to assist them.   Stray Central is not a shelter.  Instead, we are network of dedicated foster homes where our rescued cats live with and become a loved member of the foster parents families until they find their forever homes.  Because we are not a shelter, we have the advantage of being a no-kill organization  but it also limits the number of cats we can take at any given time.	We were incorporated in 1999 and our IRS 501(c)(3) nonprofit status was granted in 2000.  Since that time, we've helped save the lives of over 2,000 companion animals!  With even a small donation from you, we can save even more! :-)	companion animals	almost 200 companion animals (mostly cats)	northwest Arkansas, southwest Missouri, and eastern Oklahoma	veterinary attention, spaying/neutering, vaccinations, and most importantly, adoption into loving forever homes!
