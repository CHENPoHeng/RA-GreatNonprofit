Ymca Of Southern Nevada	http://www.lasvegasymca.org	(702) 877-9622	EIN 88-0059266	4141 Meadows Ln	Las Vegas	NV	89107	USA	Human Services, Physical Fitness & Community Recreational Facilities, Religion, Religion-Related, Sports, Young Mens or Womens Associations	The ymca of southern nevada has served the local community for over 69 years through its mission to put christian principles into practice through programs that build healthy spirit, mind and body for all. Our programs for youth development, healthy living and social responsibility are designed to meet the most pressing challenges of our community. Such challenges include increased rates of obesity, especially in children, affordable quality childcare and a significant economic downturn.				Programs for youth development: the ymca of southern nevada is committed to nurturing the potential of every child and teen. We help young people form positive skills and relationships that lead to healthy behaviors and educational achievement. Programs such as preschool, school-age childcare, after-school enrichment and sports help children develop skills and healthy living habits now and into the future. In 2014, the y served more than 19,000 children and teens, comprising 40% of our overall membership. Our childcare programs include before- and after-school care, day camps on school staff development days and summer camp. For all of those programs our staff focuses on asset building and youth development. Instruction covers character building, healthy living and physical activity. After-school programs include homework assistance and a healthy snack. In 2014, in partnership with vegas pbs and andson foundation, the y expanded our summer learning loss program to all four branches. Students can lose up to three months of learning during the summer months, starting their new school year off behind where they left off. The y offers summer reading and stem-based classes for all summer campers ages 5-11 as part of their summer camp experience. In 2014, more than 1,500 children attended y summer camp. We also continued our state-licensed preschool program and started researching the possibility of adding a full-day preschool class at one of our locations in 2015. Established in 2010, our affordable program exposes 3-to-5-year-olds to an educational process of learning through creative play. Preschool includes songs, stories, letter and number exploration, creative and dramatic play, and motor development in nurturing environments. The y's four core values of caring, honesty, respect and responsibility are incorporated into every activity. Our goals are aligned with united way's commitment to education and focus on school readiness. We are proud to be a community partner using the onlinecor. Net assessment instrument. A respected institution for swim lessons, the y teaches children to swim with an emphasis on safety and health. Swim lessons build skills, promote safety and boost confidence as children progress at their own pace, which breeds success. Our parent-child program offers learning opportunities for babies as young as 6 months. In a desert climate with a large number of personal and community pools, knowing how to swim is the key to preventing drowning and the earlier one starts, the better. In 2014, 38% of the y's swim lesson participants were under the age of 5. In addition, the y offers free community swim days including a partnership with paragon pools' float like a duck event providing pool safety tips and resources to anyone who comes. Family programs foster togetherness in a safe, welcoming environment. Our 2014 we continued the tradition of our healthy kids day, hosted events like our annual halloween at the y and offered family fun nights and additional community events at no or low cost.   programs for healthy living:the y is a leading voice on health and well-being, as we bring families together, encourage positive lifestyle choices and foster connections through fitness, sports, fun and shared interests. In 2014, we served 51,200 men, women and children through healthy living activities. We provided $411,000 of direct financial assistance to families for health enhancement and wellness programs. As a result, people of every age and fitness level receive the support, guidance and resources they need to achieve greater health in spirit, mind and body. It's critical as our nation struggles with an obesity crisis, families grapple with work/life balance and individuals search for fulfillment. Our programs are inclusive and designed to meet the needs and interests of those we serve, including special populations. We develop programs to meet special needs populations and families by building meaningful relationships and creating small communities of participants with like goals, backgrounds and needs. This model improves the likelihood that participants will continue their health and wellness activities and meet their physical and emotional goals. Examples include traditional fitness classes revamped specifically for older, active adults such as senior yoga therapy and adult pickleball, aquatics classes for cardiac and stroke patients, bodypump and boot camp classes for the seriously fitness minded, family wellness classes and health seminars. The y also offers y-kids classes designed specifically to help youth get active and form healthy habits while having fun. Classes are scheduled in the 5-6pm and 6-7pm hours when parents come to the y after work. The program allows parents to focus on their wellness goals while their children are engaged in structured activities that offer fun and variety. During a week, a child may cycle, swim, play racquetball or tennis, climb and do youth hip-hop aerobics or yoga. Kids learn skills, gain confidence, make friends and burn calories. This enables parents and children to both reap the benefits of a healthy, physical workout at the same time and in the same facility. The result is less time traveling to multiple locations for classes and more family time together. In 2014 we continued our work on the y's diabetes prevention program launched in 2011. Based on research funded by the national institutes of health and the centers for disease control and prevention, this program reduces the risk by 58 percent. Participants in the program learn how to eat healthier, increase physical activity and lose a modest amount of weight in order to reduce their chances of developing the disease  programs for social responsibility:the y is committed to supporting our neighbors and providing opportunities for people of every age to give and join in. Y initiatives help southern nevada address important issues and the support of our volunteer and donors make our work possible. Through partnerships with other organizations we are able to provide our facility and other resources to help them extend their reach and services into the community. Partnerships include bringing our y after-school programs directly to charter and private school campuses so students wouldn't have to be taken off-site, working with the united way on preschool curriculum, and working with other nonprofits to promote awareness for the summer food service program. In addition, we proudly provided portions of our state-of-the-art facilities so other civic, nonprofit and worship groups could affordably host gatherings and events. These community service events helped them further their missions and provide their knowledge and services to the community at large. In 2014, approximately 10,000 individuals attended worship services, job and health fairs, financial and tax preparation seminars at our y locations. At the center of our efforts that make our programs possible, is a dedicated group of volunteers. This group includes our local volunteer board of directors, comprised of 30+ influential leaders representing all industries. They champion our y annual campaign fundraising efforts that in 2014, thanks to support from private and corporate donors, brought in over $800,000. Half of those funds were used to provide direct financial assistance to 34,000 individuals who used it for memberships, summer camp, youth programs, sports leagues swim lessons and dozens of other activities designed to help people reach their full potential. The rest subsidized memberships and programs, keeping the y affordable and accessible for individuals of every age, ability and fitness level and enabling us to keep our promise to the community that no one was turned away due to an inability to pay. The y also offers american red cross lifeguard training and certification. In 2014 we certified 426 lifeguards. These guards gained marketable skills, making them attractive job candidates for the y and las vegas' recreation centers, water parks and resortsthe y is proud to be a partner in the department of defense and armed services ymca's military membership program which offers free y memberships to qualified military groups and their families. For those who don't qualify for the dod program, the y offers our own 50% off membership fees to all military personnel, veterans and their families. In 2014, active military personnel and veterans made up 19% of the y's membership. Supporting our commitment to create healthier communities, in 2014 the y continued its participation in the summer food service program (sfsp). During the summer, kids are at an increased risk of going hungry. More than 180,000 low-income children locally receive free or reduced-price meals through the national school lunch program. Yet only 6% of these children participate in sfsp in clark county which provides free meals to children during summer when school is not in session. The y served more than 23,000 lunches in the summer of 2014. This included not only children participating in y summer camp or other y programs, but any child in the community.   other revenue including investment, interest and similar items.

Womens Resource Medical Centers Of Southern Nevada Inc	http://www.wrmcsn.org	(702) 366-1247	EIN 94-2944732	2915 W Charleston Blvd Ste 1	Las Vegas	NV	89102	USA	Christianity, Counseling, Family Planning, Health, Mental Health, Religion, Reproductive Health Care, Reproductive Rights	Women's resource medical centers of southern nevada exists to save the lives of unborn children by sharing the love of jesus christ through spiritual, physical, emotional, and educational support to our clients.				Introduction thank you for taking the time to become familiar with the women's resource medical centers of southern nevada (wrmcsn). This organization originated in 1985 with the purpose of serving families in the community of southern nevada who are faced with a pregnancy that they did not plan. The mission remains the same today just as the statement proclaims, "women's resource medical centers of southern nevada exists to save the lives of unborn children by sharing the love of jesus christ through spiritual, physical, emotional, and educational support to our clients. " statistics from the center for disease control and the alan guttmacher institute indicate that 93% of all abortions occur because of social or economic reasons and that 50% of women who have had an abortion in the past are more likely to have another. Since 1985 we have personally met with some of these women and we have found that the majority of them would not choose abortion if they simply had someone to assist them in their circumstance. The wrmcsn acts as that support as we embrace these women and give them the education and resources that they need to be able to make a choice for life. All of the services that we offer are free of charge to our clients. As our mission statement proclaims, we are driven by divine love there is no worldly profit for this organization. The wrmcsn is a place where god's love is extended to those who are faced with the choice of death. Most of them do not know that his grace and mercy is abundantly poured out upon his creation to all those who will receive his gift of reconciliation. Many of our clients receive god's gift with joy and we are able to see the fruit of this ministry extend to both the lives of unborn babies being saved and the eternal life of the mother and father. Community impact according to time magazine, pregnancy centers are playing an important role in why abortion rates have lowered in recent years: "that would seem to be evidence that the quiet campaign for women's hearts and minds, conducted in thousands of crisis pregnancy centers around the country, on billboards, phone banks and websites, is having an effect. . . "(why have abortion rates fallen? " time, january 21, 2008. ) "today, it's still worthwhile to pass laws restricting abortion, but time and money spent on providing and promoting compassionate alternatives saves more lives. " (marvin olasky, "lessons from the past," world, january 17, 2009. ) las vegas has been listed as one of the top five "at-risk" abortion cities in our nation. Right here in southern nevada, over 6,000 clients a year receive: - pregnancy tests. - ultrasounds. - crisis counseling. - material resources such as maternity/baby clothes, diapers, formula, car seats, cribs and other related items that they need to support them with their decision to choose life. - parenting education. - abortion recovery program for women and men. - education on the benefits of abstinence outside of marriage. - prenatal/fetal development education. - male clients receive fatherhood counseling from a male mentor. Client approval ratings in order to ensure the highest level of client service, private and confidential "exit interviews" are conducted after every client visit. The women's resource medical centers of southern nevada has always been able to achieve the highest standard of service and in 2014 the client approval rating was 97%. The clients of women's resource medical centers of southern nevada also indicate that they would recommend the organization to a friend. The number one source of new clients among all other forms of advertising is "word of mouth. " "when i first came to the women's resource center and found out the news that i was expecting, i was not getting along with my family and was thinking that i didn't want my baby coming into the world with all of the problems. I was thinking that i had made a mistake. The following week i came to get my ultra-sound and heard the baby's heartbeat. I thought that even though my mom loves me, i was her mistake. Thanks to god i have a husband who supported me. My baby helped bring my mom and me together. He truly is my little angel and every time he smiles i thank god for the women's resource center because if i hadn't heard the baby's heartbeat i don't know if he would be here. " ~ america "i would like to thank women's resource center for saving the life of my precious baby. I was going to abort her, but now she is five months old. Thank you for the continuing support of providing diapers and supplies for my baby. From the bottom of my heart, thank you again for the help. " ~ herminia "when i first came to the women's resource center, i was shocked to find out that i was five weeks pregnant. It was a hard experience telling my parents that i was having a baby at such a young age. I was fifteen turning sixteen. My mom was disappointed about my pregnancy. My whole family was angry until they met my son. The anger went away and happiness came to all of our lives. We are now married and hector loves being a dad. " ~ keily "i wanted an abortion because i am muslim and my family would not accept me if i came home to africa pregnant and not married. The women's resource centers did not do abortions, but they gave me a free pregnancy test and an ultrasound. They told me that jesus was god and that he loved me. I could not have an abortion after seeing my baby on the ultrasound screen. Thank you so much. I love my little girl, samira, and i can't imagine her not being here. " ~ meme "in the beginning i didn't want to have the baby because we couldn't afford it. I asked my friend for help and she brought me to the women's resource center. The center gave me what i needed. I had an ultra-sound and saw my baby for the first time and that is when i decided to keep her. It was good that i came to the center that day. I am so thankful for the center and god for all the things that you have helped me with" ~ marcelina "when i came to the women's resource medical centers to have a free pregnancy test i did not know what i would dothanks to the staff i made a decision to have my baby and when i came back for my ultrasound i found out i was having twins if it were not for the women's resource medical centers i don't know what i would have done i am so thankful for all the help and resources they have given me and for helping me make a decision for life" ~ rushina "i was 36 and single and did not have any children; i was looking for an abortion fast as i was driving i saw a sign that said 'free pregnancy test' so i went in. It was confirmed that i indeed was pregnant. After spending some time at the women's resource medical centers they made me feel like it was not a disaster and i left with the idea that there might be a 'miracle' growing in me and not a 'mistake'. The center introduced me to christ too i look at my beautiful son and i thank god everyday that i saw a free pregnancy test sign"~ tammy "i have had multiple abortions. I was a drug addict who was in and out of jail. I came to the women's resource medical centers and my counselor showed me how to restore my relationship with christ and told me how much he loved me and my unborn child. I made a decision not to abort. I am so thankful that i walked through those doors"~ karen income sources the women's resource medical centers of southern nevada is a faith-based, non-profit 501(c)3 organization that is 100% funded by our local community.

As an intermediary organization, Nevada Public Education Foundation convenes local, regional and statewide organizations doing similar work to maximize resources and effort; seeks to consistently measure and improve programs and services; and organizes public and private support to sustain the work and ensure that young people receive the education and resources they need to become productive, contributing members of society.	To date, the Foundation has made a huge impact on Nevada's youth. In addition to collaborating in the recent launch of the Washoe Ready for Life Community Compact, as well as launching a similar collaborative in Clark County this October,  the following are just a handful of its initiatives: * Hosted two RFL Nevada Dropout Prevention Summits to improve Nevadas graduation rate * Created the Nevada Compact to implement goals from the Summits and reflect a  shared commitment to education * Supported RFL Southern Nevada's efforts in hosting three Funders Forums to leverage opportunities and maximize impact * Supported local RFL collaboratives in Clark, Washoe, Churchill, Lyon, Storey, Nye and Esmeralda counties * Focused efforts to graduate all with short-term goal of 10% increase in the graduation rate by 2013  * In 2010, NPEF connected Clark County School District (CCSD) with United Way of Southern Nevada in response to a high school partnerships grant opportunity presented by AT&T. This connection resulted in a $100,000 grant to plan a family engagement project at five pilot high schools. Upon seeing results from the planning phase, UWSN funders implemented these efforts and plan to support the project for an additional four years. * RFL Southern Nevada worked with the Clark County Continuum of Care to align priorities and reach disconnected youth. As a result of this relationship, the Continuum successfully received a $3.1 million grant to provide housing and wraparound services to homeless youth ages 18-24 through St. Judes Ranch for Children project.	Through its Ready for Life (RFL) initiative, the Foundation has created a collaborative cross-agency effort to improve Nevada's success at engaging and graduating "ready for life" students and reengaging those who prematurely left school. Dozens of public and private organizations are partnering in the belief that as they work together, students will be more likely to complete high school and gain appropriate post-secondary education or training to become productive, contributing members of society.		Ready for life is a collaborative cross-agency effort to improve nevada's success at engaging and graduating "ready for life" students and reengaging those who prematurely left school. The funds under this program are used for research, training, technical assistance, and facilitation of collaborations, as well as grants to community collaboratives and partner organizations for planning, capacity building, and direct youth service activities.

One of our greatest accomplishments to date would be our involvement in the 2013 legislative session where we worked tirelessly to convince Nevada legislators to protect dogs of all kinds within the state from Breed Specific Legislation. Known then as AB110, the bill was passed and signed into law in October of 2013. NRS 202.500 now includes language that bans any jurisdiction within the state from declaring a dog dangerous or vicious based solely on breed. Our Spay & Neuter Assistance Program has made significant headway as well. As of August 2015, we have paid for all or a portion of more than 350 spay and neuter surgeries of "pit bull" dogs. With an average of 12 "pit bulls" being euthanized each and every day by our local shelter, this program aims to lower those statistics by curbing the number of puppies being born to an uncertain future. Our Owner Support Outreach strives to help struggling dog owners with basic resources in an effort to keep dogs at home, with their families and out of the shelter/rescue system. We do this by providing supplies such as dog food. This program is open to dogs of all types. Since 2012, we have given out more than 7700lbs of dog food to owners in need. We have provided training advice to owners who are at their wits end, paid pet deposits and given out crates to keep dogs safe and out of trouble. We also work to make harsh conditions as humane as we can for dogs living on tethers, as well as those who must live outdoors all of their lives. We have fixed fences, helped with building dog runs and provided owners with dog houses so that outside dogs have adequate protection from the elements.	people and their dogs	the Las Vegas Valley	educational outreach, low cost spay/neuter for "pit bull" and "pit bull" mix dogs and owner support.	educate over 1000 school children, gave away more than 2500lbs of dog food and fixed more than 100 pit bull & pit bull mix dogs.
