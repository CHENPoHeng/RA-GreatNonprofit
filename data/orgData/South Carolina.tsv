The properties include working farms and forestlands, waterways and watersheds, hunting properties, hummock islands, vibrant marsh tidal ecosystems, blackwater streams and longleaf pine restoration areas.					Land protection:the lowcountry open land trust experienced a banner year in 2014, completing 22 land protection projects to permanently protect an additional 11,927 acres, bringing its total protected acreage to 103,031 acres. Eighteen of the projects were conservation easements granted by private landowners, four fully donated, one amended to add acreage and thirteen purchased in bargain sale transactions with grant funds provided by the charleston county greenbelt bank, the dorchester county conservation commission and the south carolina conservation bank. In addition, the land trust launched an unprecedented campaign to raise $6,860,000 through grants and donations to purchase two tracts of property totaling 35 acres adjacent to the majestic angel oak, an iconic lowcountry treasure threatened by intense development pressure. Planning for the publicly-accessible angel oak preserve is underway. The land trust also partnered with the boeing company in a unique and innovative mitigation project by purchasing the 1,682-acre keystone property in the cooper river corridor in order to offset wetlands losses resulting from boeing's plant expansion.

Carolina basset hound rescue is a volunteer-staffed nonprofit organization and was founded in 1993 in raleigh, north carolina. Cbhr has grown from a fledgling organization with only a few volunteers to a federally recognized non-profit organization. Over the course of 20 years cbhr has rescued, rehabilitated, and rehomed over 2,000 basset hounds. The carolina basset hound rescue program is comprised of four main areas: fostering, adoption, donations, and events. Fostering and adoptiononce our volunteer staff is notified of a basset in need, arrangements are made to retrieve him from the shelter and provide him veterinary care. Following a check-up by the veterinarian, he will then move into his assigned foster home. The foster home will help him blossom into a loving, well-mannered family member. Adoptions are completed once his medical needs are met and he is once again healthy. Donationsthe cbhr program would not be able to rescue the dogs it does without continued financial supports from our friends. There are many ways to contribute and you will find one that matches your donation style by visiting our donation page. A minimum donation is requested at the time of adoption. However, most adoption donations equal only half of the average expenses of each of our dogs. Kind and generous supporters of our work must make up the rest. Eventseach year cbhr participates and hosts several events throughout north and south carolina. These events are a great way for us to showcase our dogs and for the volunteers to catch up with their basset-loving friends. They are lots of fun, but do take volunteer manpower and time to be successful. We would love to meet your smiling face at an event soon. The world of rescue is hard, sometimes sad, but also wonderfully warm, inspiring and touching. Our many volunteers passionately give their time, energy, love and money to make this endeavor successful. The rewards of a drool-y basset kiss that says, "thank you, you gave me a chance i would have never had" makes it all worth it.

Prevention is the core mission of Greer Relief. The combination of hunger prevention, homelessness prevention, and one-stop access to human service agencies has provided a network of collaborators ready and willing to better the community. Emergency assistance is only a safety net of support for those in need.   The threat of going hungry, losing their housing, having their power disconnected, or needing a prescription filled prevents our neighbors from focusing on the bigger picture of life: getting or retaining a job, furthering their education, or nurturing their children. They have more immediate needs that affect their ability to make the next step.   Once the crisis is answered, we take the opportunity to offer referrals including connecting them to the new RENEW program. RENEW, Reaching Every Neighbor Every Way, is an education and life skills program critical to improving the life and health of our neighbors. It includes a network of community supporters who produce and execute classes or training on many topics including nutrition, food preparation, personal health, job seeking tools, and financial stability. The RENEW program incorporates incentives to encourage participation of our neighbors in need. For instance, participants might receive a gift card for healthy purchases after attending a nutrition tour through the grocery store. Hosting educational and life skill programs and engaging them in the process will create a network of success to set them on a path of healthy living.   In 2014 Greer Relief assisted 1,278 unduplicated people in 496 households with emergency financial assistance.	prevent hunger & homelessness.	4,385 people in 1,699 households	the Greater Greer Community	Case Management Food Assistance Financial Assistance to prevent homelessness Prescription Assistance to alleviate financial hardships

Educationtuw's education initiatives are aimed at helping young children to achieve educational success and graduate high school prepare for a career or continuing education. Tuw believe education is the first step toward becoming healthy, happy and productive citizens. Tuw invested $2. 7 million in education programs, including $1. 4 million in its innovative, research-based links to success initiative. The initiative fosters collaboration between agencies and "high potential" schools around a common agenda and shared metrics. During this last period, 6,008 students attended links to success schools. Of those students, 3,422 or 57% received "linking partner services. " further, 58% of links students scored at or above proficiency in english language arts and 53% were at or above proficiency in math. "linking partner services," such as weekend feeding programs family counseling, and family navigator services provide children and families necessary supports so that children can focus on learning and overcoming challenges that prevented them from entering school ready to learn.   community impactthe community change led by tuw is supported through hundreds of workplace giving campaigns, individual giving, corporate and foundation grants, federal and state grants, and fees for services. In 2015, tuw created a strategic learning and evaluation system designed to ensure that the organization continues to add value to partners and the greater community with continuous quality improvement and progress toward goals. The community investment process, an open and competitive process guided by over 100 volunteers, is the process through which tuw volunteer leadership decides which strategic investments are most likely to result in measurable change in each of its focus areas of education, financial stability and health. The investment process is underpinned by three principles the guide all investments: fiscal responsibility, measurable results and alignment. Volunteers are trained by staff to invest community dollars in programs that measurably improve lives and align with tuw priorities. This is the last year of a three-year investment process (2012-2014) focused on supporting human services organizations aligned with community impact goals outlined in the 2011 agenda for community impact. Trident united way invests approximately $7 million in mission-related services annually.

Each of these steps is underpinned by financial education. Tuw invested $1. 7 million dollars in programs that help people build financial assets.

At these sites, palmetto goodwill, family services, inc. , and tuw provide coordinated, comprehensive financial stability services designed to help families move themselves up the ladder to self-sufficiency. Each organization provides a different set of services. Tuw provides administrative oversight and coordinates basic needs assistance; family services offers financial education and home ownership classes; and goodwill focuses on employment and workforce readiness skills. Tuw also serves as the backbone organization, creating a common agenda and shared metrics. The results so far have been impressive. The prosperity centers and financial stability funded partners provided 14,943 individuals financial stability services in 2015. Individuals accessing employment and employment training services grew from 30% to 49% and free tax preparation services grew from 12% to 14%. When the centers opened, 78% of total clients were requesting access to basic needs services. Now the mix is such that 23% of total clients are requesting basic needs supports. This reduction in proportionate demand for basic needs services, in comparison to increase demand in services that strengthen income and stability, suggests that the individuals accessing center services are moving down a developmental path toward greater financial stability.   connecting the communitytuw informs and mobilizes the community, with particular emphasis on volunteerism in the tri-county region. Its connecting the community focus is anchored by 2-1-1 hotline, which allows residents of the lowcountry to get or give help 24-hours-a-day. Employing the state's most comprehensive and up-to-date database of community resources, 2-1-1 hotline is free and confidential, and received 37,710 calls in 2015. Most of the calls are for help with basic needs, but 2-1-1 also answers for other community services. In 2015, tuw's connecting the community's largest episodic one-day volunteer effort was its annual day of caring event, which involved over 6,800 people from 145 companies throughout the tri-county region. Healthtuw's health investments focus on helping people make good health choices and on reducing the incidence of preventable chronic diseases. In 2015, 10,025 individuals received health services from partners funded by tuw. One notable example is tuw's partnership with musc children's care network to provide preventative care for low-income, uninsured children in the lowcountry. The clinic is strategically located on a bus line, accepts walk-in appointments, and has a bi-lingual staff. The program is demonstrating measurable results: 92% of all new patients correctly identify a primary care provider after six months and 79. 5% maintained medical home relationship.

In 2014, gwilsc provided job training & employment services to 57,981 veterans and individuals with disabilities as well as other barriers to employment and placed 1,596 individuals into new jobs in the community. The ability to provide these programs and services is a direct result of the revenues generated through the sale of donations in retail stores. Over 90% of revenues generated go back into services for people. Gwilsc operates programs designed to help people train for and find jobs that will lead to economic independence. Gwilsc provides job opportunities at thirty retail store locations, 15 government and commercial contract sites, and in outside employment with other companies through good people staffing. In addition, gwilsc serves the community through various programs to help homeless veterans, youth, seniors and supportive employment(for disabled).					Goodwill's donated goods program provides job training and employment opportunities for people with disabilities and other barriers to employment.

To this end, goodwill helps people earn a living, improve their lives and strengthen their families and communities.   goodwill's workforce development division offers job training and employment services through training programs, job link centers, and special community programs. Goodwill provides career counseling, vocational assessments, job readiness and soft skill training.

Goodwill operates 2 annual community outreach programs: the golden angel tree program is designed to reach out to area seniors who are disabled or economically dependent on government programs. Many of the seniors who receive services through this program live alone, in local nursing homes or residential care facilities. Goodwill depends on the kindness of community donations and monetary contributions for this program. In 2014, goodwill provided gifts of food, winter outerwear, blankets, towels and toiletries to 1,281 disadvantaged seniors throughout beaufort, berkeley, charleston, colleton, dorchester, florence, horry, orangeburg and sumter counties.

Food and agriculture: south carolina's rural landscape is primarily agricultural. In order to protect and enhance agricultural land, the conservation league works to support rural agrarian economies by promoting and advocating for policies, plans, infrastructure, and protection programs that promote sustainable agricultural practices in these threatened communities. Examples include policy work promoting water efficiency, local procurement and financing, and responsible water withdrawal practices. We work directly with farmers, government agencies, businesses, nonprofit organizations and communities to ensure that farmers are able to continue farming for generations to come. As part of this work, the conservation league operates a local food hub, growfood carolina, a project dedicated to providing sales, marketing, warehousing, planning, outreach and distribution services to local farmers within 150 miles. Since its inception in 2011, growfood has channeled more than $1 million back to farmers, directly supported more than 70 farm businesses with more than 1,800 acres of farmland, and provided local produce to thousands of local customers.   energy and climate: electricity is a necessary fixture in our daily lives, and its production and distribution have vast environmental footprints. New technologies, fuel sources, and strategies for meeting demand hold great promise for minimizing these impacts. We promote the implementation of progressive local, state, and federal energy policies related to renewable energy, energy efficiency, and climate change. We have been a leader in passing some of the most progressive solar energy legislation in the nation, been at the forefront of regulatory reform, and have been instrumental in garnering support for issues involved with the negative impacts of offshore gas exploration and drilling along the sc coast.   land and community: balancing unbridled growth is central to the conservation league's mission. We help to influence the way developers, citizens, and public officials view and value their communities and landscapes promoting thoughtful, balanced development and land conservation in the right areas, at the right scale. From restructuring zoning codes to rerouting highways, we provide technical, professional and other assistance to residents of the region to help them preserve the south carolina coast.

We are required by law to report unsafe housing, child abuse, medical neglect, physical abuse and other types of abuse to appropriate jurisdiction.  In addition, we've created a creative therapy program, "Baked Goods" which gives survivors the opportunity to use creative therapy to help build trust in one another. It also allows them to receive some basic job and social training skills, as well as the ability to overcome obstacles that might arise in their lives.

PO Box 31258	Charleston	SC	29417	USA	Community Improvement & Capacity Building, Disaster Aid, Disaster Preparedness & Relief Services, International, International Development	WMI's mission is to provide sustainable access to safe water and an opportunity to hear the "Living Water" message in developing countries and disaster areas. Our vision is that no person should perish for want of safe drinking water or an opportunity to hear the "Living Water" message.					Community development: water mission takes a comprehensive approach to combating the global water crisis by providing safe water, sanitation and hygiene (wash) solutions for entire communities in need. Water mission is the micro-municipal provider for communities that do not have access to safe water and adequate sanitation. In order for safe water, sanitation and hygiene projects to have lasting benefits, services must be accessible to all, safe to use, and sustainable in the way they are managed. Water mission's holistic approach to community development builds on local resources and relationships to create such an environment. (continued under "community development" in schedule o) community development, continued: water mission has more than 160 indigenous water, sanitation and hygiene professionals who live and work in communities we serve to implement solutions that last. To date, the organization has implemented over 1,700 safe water projects and installed over 18,500 healthy latrines (pour flush toilets).   disaster response: the living water treatment system (lwts) originally designed in 1998 by water mission's co-founder and ceo, dr. George greene iii, phd, pe, is a miniature water treatment plant that utilizes rapid sand filtration and chemical disinfection for the production of safe drinking water at a rate greater than 10 gallons per minute. It is designed for rapid deployment in the aftermath of a disaster and has minimal supply chain requirements. Using the lwts and other appropriate technology, water mission has provided over 1 million people with access to safe water following a disaster or emergency situation. (continued under "disaster response" in schedule o). Disaster response, continued: water mission has provided relief following some of the world's most devastating disasters including ebola relief in liberia in 2014, typhoon haiyan in the philippines in 2013, the 2010 haiti earthquake, the 2008 sichuan china earthquake, hurricane katrina in 2005, and the 2004 tsunami in south east asia, as well as many smaller disasters. In 2015, water mission responded to the need for safe water following record high historic flooding in central and southern malawi, the april earthquake in nepal, the burundian refugee crisis in tanzania and the emergency flooding situation in our own backyard of columbia, south carolina.   engineering innovation: water mission designs and utilizes the latest innovative technologies in the implementation of safe water and sanitation projects. Water mission engineers design customized solutions to fit the unique circumstances of each community served. The process water mission uses to provide safe water includes: developing a water source, testing the water quality, treating the water to ensure it is safe, storing and protecting the water, creating access points to distribute the water and providing power, using solar panels when possible. Utilizing solar power is just one way that water mission ensures the sustainability of safe water projects. (continued under "engineering innovation" in schedule o). Engineering innovation, continued: to date, water mission has installed over 800 solar-powered pumping solutions in communities around the world and utilized over 800,000 watts of solar power. Water mission currently has over 20 engineers working both at the international headquarters and abroad. These engineers are continually performing research and conducting product and process testing to refine how projects are implemented in the field. This research has resulted in four patents granted to water mission on various equipment used to provide sustainable safe water and sanitation solutions.   impact research: water mission takes an innovative approach to conducting research on the effectiveness of safe water, sanitation and hygiene (wash) interventions. This research includes routine monitoring of field activities, remote monitoring of water supply systems, evaluation of project performance data through an online management platform, and focused impact studies. Water mission researchers carefully analyze how implemented wash solutions are alleviating poverty and contributing to the overall well-being of the communities where water mission works. This allows the organization to adapt the approach taken based on discovered successes and failures. Advocacy: one of the primary goals of water mission is to educate the public about the global water crisis. This is accomplished by organizing events and creating educational programs that provide a call to action for sustainable solutions. One such event is the annual walk for water. In 2015, 25 walks were held around the world to raise awareness about the global water crisis.

GET IN THE FIGHT!  Join this special force TODAY!  Email:    INFO@HIDDENWOUNDS.ORG  Hidden Wounds Fireteams primary mission is to identify the target; PTSD, TBI, Depression, Violence. To engage the enemy by teaching the community the warning signs of PTSD, suicidal behaviors and provide educated resources, personal experience, in order to lead maneuvering actions and destroy the stigma that each of these afflictions can have among our military personnel.     MISSION:  To keep veterans alive by joining Hidden Wounds as a volunteer willing to take calls from veterans suffering from PTSD, TBI, depression and a need to connect. To show veterans and their loved ones that they are not alone! To connect veterans who need help to professional trained counselors and other services. To raise awareness for PTSD, TBI, psychological post war challenges, and suicide prevention including the warning signs, symptoms. To Promote Care Partners, a new program the VA is rolling out to encourage veterans to have the HIPPA paperwork signed so Hidden Wounds, a friend or family member (care partner) is allowed to be informed of their health conditions.  This gives care givers permission to call and keep the loved one informed. This will also allow the VA to speak with Hidden Wounds in full detail as to the health status of the veteran. To fight stigma and encourage veterans to get help by letting them know that they are suffering from a war injury, and like any other injury, it takes treatment and time for it to heal. To open your eyes and ears in the community and with veterans to learn how Hidden Wounds can better serve our clientele! To screen and engage additional volunteers To promote Hidden Wounds with brochures, flyers, events, e-blasts, blogs, etc. To think outside of the box! To use your talents to save lives, have fun and promote Hidden Wounds, PTSD, TBI, VA and suicide prevention awareness! Hidden Wounds Fire Team Core Values:  Respect, Honor, Courage and Commitment  Respect: Many military people gain a lot of respect when they are in the service due to rank and accomplishments. When they get out, they expect to be treated with the same respect. Unfortunately, the civilian world doesnt see them this way and the veteran feels like he has no one to turn to that would understand this feeling. As Fire Team, we recognize their accomplishments and the fact that each one of us has a talent that carries over to the real world. We help them see and understand their self worth and that they do not need a rank on your sleeve to gain respect.  Honor: While in the military, people have a sense of honor, duty and valor.  When they get out of the service they feel that the world outside has no honor and that no one has a sense of duty. Normal people just dont know what these things mean to a soldier, sailor or Marine. We help them see, through counseling and service work, that just because you do not wear a uniform anymore does mean that they do not have honor.  Courage: To ask for help. No one gets anywhere without help. It takes a strong person to ask for it. While on the battle field courage was a common everyday occurrence but here at home, veterans feel that to admit they need help makes them feel weak and if they are weak than they can not move forward. We provide them a way to show that courage by helping others who need it, whether it is through volunteer work, or simply taking phone calls. It takes courage to admit that you have had some of the same problems as someone else and turning it around as experience to help someone else.  Commitment: We, HW FT, are committed to helping those who have served our country and community. When they were sworn in to protect and defend our country against all enemies both foreign and domestic, they took an oath that they would keep us safe. We are taking the same oath to help keep them safe and to educate them on the Hidden Battlefield that waits for them at home.

Historic Charleston Foundation	http://www.historiccharleston.org	(843) 723-1623	EIN 57-6000599	Po Box 1120	Charleston	SC	29402	USA		Historic charleston foundation is dedicated to preserving and protecting the historical, architectural and cultural character of charleston and its historic environs, and to educating the public about charleston's history and the benefits that are derived from preservation.					Preservation services - historic charleston foundation (hcf) is one of the nation's oldest and most respected historic preservation organizations. Founded in 1947 by a group of concerned local citizens, the foundation continues its important role in revitalizing charleston and preserving the city's historic architecture and neighborhoods. Hcf is currently one of the most innovative and effective preservation advocacy organizations in the united states. The foundation created the nation's first revolving fund for neighborhoods, saving and protecting 91 historic structures, and stressing the importance of revitalizing entire neighborhoods rather than just individual buildings. Its ansonborough project is credited with inspiring community-based conservation efforts in historic neighborhoods throughout the nation. In 2014, hcf celebrated the 300th anniversary of mulberry plantation, one of the foundation's best success stories. Threatened with foreclosure and ultimate division, hcf purchased the property and sold it to preservation-minded buyers. The deed of easement given to the foundation by the owners is the most comprehensive ever donated to the foundation. Last year, hcf purchased the elizabeth williams house at 35 legare street and is in the process of stabilizing the property and searching for preservation-minded buyers. The foundation's neighborhood impact initiative is an arm of the revolving fund. Established in 1995, the goal of the project is to be a catalyst for the preservation of entire neighborhoods by rehabilitating deteriorated properties with architectural merit, while also preventing displacement of residents. Recently, hcf provided funding to restore a house on romney street in the central peninsula area. Additionally, hcf worked with new israel reformed episcopal church which owned an abandoned lot on romney street, taking the garden from "blight to bright" by clearing the lot and planting a vegetable and berry garden. The romney urban garden quickly has become a popular neighborhood meeting spot. Historic charleston foundation also is known as an innovator in historic easement and covenant programs. The foundation holds 445 easement and covenant properties, which protect historic buildings in the city and outlying areas as well as around 2,079 acres of open land of historic significance. Properties protected by easements and covenants held by hcf are as diverse as the magnificent william gibbes house in charleston to auldbrass near beaufort, sc, the only plantation designed by frank lloyd wright. Through its dedicated easements manager, the foundation provides technical outreach to all of our easement and covenant property owners, helping with appropriate conservation techniques for issues ranging from brick re-pointing to window restoration to the cleaning of architectural stone. Historic charleston foundation has an active advocacy arm that continually monitors and addresses preservation and development issues across the city of charleston. The preservation department attends weekly zoning and design review hearings to provide hcf's position on projects, and meets regularly with property owners, developers, and architects to review their proposed projects and provide input. Special projects include research and documentation of historic properties, national register nominations and assisting the city with the development of new preservation policies. In 2014, the foundation began taking a look at both the revolving fund and the neighborhood impact initiative programs to develop innovative, multi-pronged strategies tailored to meet the needs of 21st century charleston and its neighborhoods. This included an intensive workshop with experts from other cities who face similar revitalization challenges, work on a detailed action plan and identifying target neighborhoods and community partners to engage the community in the preservation of the neighborhood and community life. One of the many ways historic charleston foundation seeks to protect charleston's architectural, historical and cultural integrity is through scholarly research and documentation. The margaretta childs archives include historic building documentation, photos, drawings, and other materials that are useful to those researching historic charleston. The online catalogue contains records for 2,080 books in the foundation's library and 6,154 items from the archives, making the foundation's archives and library even more accessible. Historic charleston foundation also is an advocate for archaeology and has sponsored investigations at its own museum houses as well as plantations and other historic sites in and around charleston. Archaeological digs help to answer questions about charleston's history that the documentary records alone cannot provide. Work has begun on the excavation of the laundry at aiken-rhett house museum. This is particularly exciting as the location is a place where enslaved african americans both lived and worked. There is high hope that the artifacts will help tell a more complete story of the lives of the enslaved workers. The foundation's president and ceo chaired a tourism management advisory committee comprised of city staff and tourism officials throughout charleston. The plan, which will come before city council for adoption addresses livability, quality of life, tourism management and mobility and transportation issues for residents and visitors. As part of this effort, hcf brought gabe klein, a transportation and mobility expert to charleston to assess these issues and make recommendations for improvement. One of the most significant contributions that historic charleston foundation has made to the city of charleston was the development of a new preservation plan in 2007-2008. The plan emphasizes that preservation encompasses more than saving historically significant buildings. Rather, it states, "preservation is a social, economic and cultural endeavor that incorporates how new development is added within the historic district and beyond into outlying areas of the lowcountry. " sound preservation planning is all the more necessary as the range of historic resources located in charleston has become much broader as the city has grown. The preservation plan for charleston provides a pioneering policy framework from which the city and the community as a whole can grow in a preservation-centric and sustainable manner for many years to come. Historic charleston foundation works diligently to ensure the implementation of the preservation plan. In 2014 hcf challenged preliminary approval of the clemson architectural building, the spaulding paolozzi center, citing incompatibility with the neighborhood. Ultimately, plans for the center were withdrawn. As part of the on-going monitoring of the preservation plan, historic charleston foundation attends all board of architectural review and board of zoning appeals meetings. Additionally, hcf staff have met with dozens of developers in advance of city building approval meetings, providing feedback and guidance on conceptual plans to ensure proposed development is consistent with city plans, that building materials and design are follow high standards and that the development is compatible with surrounding structures.   public programs - as part of hcf's mission to educate the public about the benefits of historic preservation, the foundation provides two spring events which allow visitors to learn about and visit the city's finest historic private houses and gardens, as well as study and/or purchase some of the nation's most impressive antiques. The charleston antiques show takes place during the first weekend of the foundation's long renowned annual spring festival of houses and gardens, which runs mid-march to mid-april. The spring festival is an award-winning series of heritage tours and educational sessions, which in 2014 provided a rare opportunity for 16,724 visitors to enjoy behind-the-scenes peeks at some of the most magnificent private interiors and gardens in order to learn more about charleston's old and historic district, an area celebrated for its history and architecture dating from the 18th century. The festival coordinates the efforts of nearly 150 homeowners who have granted hcf the privilege of sharing their properties, and more than 630 community volunteers who make these tours possible. Proceeds from the festival support preservation programs throughout charleston and its historic environs. Established in 2004, the charleston antiques show has quickly become a premier destination for seasoned collectors as well as those who enjoy seeing and learning about the decorative arts. Around 30 nationally renowned dealers feature a diverse range of antiques from the 17th to early 20th centuries, including american, asian and european furniture, silver and porcelain, textiles, ceramics, vintage jewelry and clothing and garden furniture. More than 2,300 visitors in 2014 enjoyed learning about antiques and collecting through educational programs and exclusive behind-the-scene-tours with experts. The foundation offers a lecture series tied to our friends program, which offers donors the chance to engage regularly in unique educational events. In 2014, lectures offered topics on independent women in colonial charleston, charlestonians and their grand tours, louis manigault's trip around the world and green planning initiatives for charleston in the 21st century. Additional education opportunities are offered to children through field programs and summer programs at both museum houses. "children's discovery tours" highlighted topics like revolutionary charleston, pirates, period tea parties with alicia russell and gullah culture.   museums - hcf fulfills its educational mission through the interpretation of its collections and two outstanding museum houses: the nathaniel russell house, c. 1808, at 51 meeting street, one of america's most significant neoclassical federal townhouses; and the aiken-rhett house, c. 1820, at 48 elizabeth street, where visitors can step back in time to experience life in antebellum charleston. More than 83,200 visitors toured the museum properties in 2014. Historic charleston foundation purchased the nathaniel russell house, c. 1808, a national historic landmark, in 1955. Visitors continue to admire the grand federal-style townhouse of prominent merchant nathaniel russell. Completed in 1808 when russell was 70 years old, the lavishly ornamented house serves as a testament to the great wealth he accumulated over his distinguished lifetime. Then as now, the russell house is considered to be among the finest dwellings in charleston. The house also stands in contrast to other contemporary charleston residences with a unique geometric floor plan and fine architectural detailing. The interior boasts a spacious reception room with intricate glazed doors, an elegant free-flying staircase, and elaborate trompe-l'oeil decoration from the first to the third floors. Painstakingly restored to its 1808 appearance, the russell house also serves as the ideal exhibition space for hcf's outstanding collection of fine and decorative arts. Currently, historic charleston foundation is raising money for a soft furnishings renovation of the nathaniel russell house museum. As part of the renovation, experts have examined window casings and found evidence to support the design and installation of appropriate period textiles for the dining room. Additionally, an intrinsic study of the second floor bedroom wall surfaces and architectural elements is guiding the restoration of the bedchamber. The soft furnishings renovation will include new bed hangings, wall finishes and a period carpet for the music room. In addition, the museum also features several reinstalled period rooms and two exhibitions. The original kitchen building, where enslaved members of the household both lived and worked, is now devoted to interpretive programming and features the exhibition, the russell family and the enslaved. A new collections gallery was also installed titled, an era of opulence: the decorative and fine arts of early charleston. The exhibition highlights fine and decorative arts and allows guests to learn about some of the trades in charleston during the mid-eighteenth to early nineteenth century, including the time frame of nathaniel and sarah russell's tenure in charleston. Featuring luxury goods both imported and made in the city, the objects tell the story of refinement and diversity in the lowcountry. Also operated as a museum house is the aiken-rhett house, c. 1820, built by john robinson and greatly expanded by governor and mrs. William aiken jr. In the 1830s. The property, which remained in the family until 1975, has survived as a unique time capsule, virtually unaltered since 1858. Original dependencies include the kitchen, slaves' quarters, stable, coach house and privies. Together with the main house these structures combine to form a rare and unique 19th century urban complex. The buildings and the artifacts within them poignantly illustrate the connections among all members of the household, those who lived in the main house as well as those who lived and worked as enslaved african-americans on the property. Historic charleston foundation has adopted a unique approach to its stewardship of the house. Thanks in great part to a prestigious save america's treasures grant, hcf has restored and thus protected the building's exterior to its 1858-1860 appearance. The preservation plan for the original historic interior is stabilization and conservation. This rare approach enables the interpretation of the house's continued habitation and its changes over time as new technologies, such as gas lighting and electricity were adopted. The period finishes, such as original 19th century wallpapers, alone make the aiken-rhett site one of the nation's most important house museums, and the intact decorative layers help us better understand nineteenth-century conceptions of refinement, patterns of consumption and decorative preferences in the carolina lowcountry. Unlike the majority of other historic house museums, all objects in the house are original to the house. Many of the objects currently on display in the aiken-rhett house were purchased by gov. Aiken and his wife, harriet lowndes aiken. During their residency, the house went through several decorative periods as the couple kept current with the latest fashions. While the majority of the furnishings in the house were in the plain grecian style, gothic-inspired and rococo revival objects were acquired and added to their collection over time. Linking the interior and exterior, it is no coincidence that these items closely relate to the gothic elements found in the outbuildings. In 2014, restoration of the art gallery was completed. This room dates to 1858 and houses the aiken family's art collection. The collection is the only known extant example in the southeast with its fine art collection largely intact. Archaeological analysis was undertaken to ensure the walls look today as they appeared in 1858. Recently, hcf has embarked upon a climate study funded by a humanities sustaining cultural heritage collections planning grant to assess the non-controlled environment on the collection exhibited at the aiken-rhett house museum. Further educational research was conducted at the aiken-rhett house leading to new educational opportunities for visitors. A digital rendering of the double drawing rooms using 3d laser scanning technology was produced which allows guests to envision how they would have appeared at their peak. The image includes nineteenth-century paint finishes, wallpapers, furniture, artwork, curtains and carpets. This approach allows the foundation to continue its "preserve as found" philosophy for the aiken-rhett house and at the same time educates visitors about how the rooms would have appeared.   retail/licensed products - historic charleston foundation began its licensed products program in 1972 as an innovative way to extend the foundation's restoration and preservation efforts beyond historic architecture and interiors to charleston's material culture as well. The program strives to keep charleston designs alive and make those designs available to a broad audience. Items selected for inclusion are those whose origins are steeped in charleston's history, culture, decorative arts and architecture. The licensed products of historic charleston foundation range from furniture, china, mirrors, jewelry, porcelain, decorative accessories and historic paint colors. Many of the original objects, which are reproduced or are used for inspiration, may be seen in the historic museum house collections of historic charleston foundation and other museum collections in charleston. The shops of historic charleston foundation showcases the licensed products of the foundation as well as an extensive selection of books on charleston history, architecture, gardens and culture. Within the shops of historic charleston foundation is the frances r. Edmunds bookstore, providing the most comprehensive selection of books on charleston and lowcountry history in the city. In addition, the shops include a wide range of decorative arts and gift items, including china; jewelry; formal, casual and garden furniture; lamps; mirrors and a palette of historical paint colors inspired by residences in charleston's old & historic district, as well as the rural lowcountry sea islands. The market shop of historic charleston, which opened in the summer of 2011, is the anchor shop in the great hall of the historic charleston city market. With displays that demonstrate the foundation's mission and a selection of the items found in the main retail location, the shop allows the foundation to reach a wider audience with the millions of annual visitors who go through the market each year.
