We redeploy veterans in their communities so the legacy of this generation will be one of action and service. The Mission Continues focuses veterans spirit of service and harnesses the skills they learned in the military through two action-orientated programs: the Fellowship Program and the Service Platoon Program.	Through the Fellowship Program, post-9/11 veterans continue serving through six-month community service fellowships. For 26 weeks, Mission Continues Fellows volunteer for 20 hours a week at a nonprofit organization of their choice. They also complete a curriculum designed to propel them into their next phase of life, whether its meaningful employment or higher education. Fellows receive a living stipend while serving.  Mission Continues Service Platoons are teams of 30 to 45 veterans, of all generations, and active duty, guard and reservist service members. Platoons work together on the local level to tackle a specific mission in the community. In Washington, D.C., a platoon strives to reduce hunger among inner-city youth. In Phoenix, a platoon aims to eradicate veteran homelessness. Twenty-five platoons are launching across the country in 2014, solving problems here at home.	The Mission Continues has awarded 840 fellowships to post-9/11 veterans across 48 states. These veterans have contributed more than $7 million worth of services.   91% of Fellows said they increased their professional network through the experience, and 100% of Fellows believe they are pursuing a meaningful new mission.	A Mission Continues Fellow is a post-9/11 veteran who has accepted the challenge to continue their service to our country by serving their community.	Fellows have served at more than 500 nonprofits, including the Boys and Girls Club, Equest Therapeutic Horsemanship, Growing Washington and The Humane Society,	We serve veterans nationwide.

Wyman Center, Inc.	http://www.wymancenter.org	(636) 938-5245	EIN 43-0653263	600 Kiwanis Dr	Eureka	MO	63025	USA	Camps, Children & Youth, Sports, Youth Development	More than 30 years of youth development research is identifying key factors that help young people prepare for success in family life, social relationships, economic self-sufficiency and civic life. At the same time, researchers and demographers, as well as concerned parents, educators and youth work practitioners, have good reason to be concerned about the struggles faced by many of today''s parents, families and schools, the very places that once contributed so wholesomely to the development of young people. To address this urgent need, Wyman is preparing young people for success in three critical areas of life: healthy family and social relationships; economic self-sufficiency; and community involvement. We''re accomplishing this by teaching youth to be productive in school and work; to connect to community and family; and to be able to navigate in diverse environments and make healthy choices. Wyman''s philosophy, grounded in the most current national research, is that keeping young people "problem free" is simply not enough. We must help them be "fully prepared" to lead successful lives and build strong communities.	Wyman's signature programs include the Wyman Teen Leadership Program and the Wyman Teen Outreach Program. The Wyman Teen Leadership Program engages teens from economically disadvantaged circumstances year-round for five years beginning in eighth grade. The program is guided by a progressive leadership theme, and teens gain the experiences, skills and values needed to prepare to act as contributing students, family members, employees and citizens. One hundred percent of our last graduating class, graduated from high school on time and went on to post-secondary education. The Wyman Teen Outreach Program (TOP) is a national after-school program for teens whose effectiveness has been proven in over 20 years of operation. TOP is currently being administered in over 400 organizations and schools in the United States, Virgin Islands, and United Kingdom. Based upon the principles of youth development, an approach that provides teens with the necessary supports and opportunities to prepare for successful adulthood and avoid problem behavior, Wyman TOP has proven effective in increasing academic success and preventing teen pregnancy and other negative behaviors among program participants. Teens that complete Wyman TOP experience: 60% lower rate of school dropout 33% lower rate of pregnancy 14% lower rate of school suspension 11% lower rate of school course failure TOP teens gather weekly throughout the school year for open discussions about relevant issues such as peer pressure and making good decisions for the future. Wyman TOP teens also participate in regular community service learning and neighborhood improvement projects.

Project Appleseed recruits and organizes parent help and support in local schools and school districts by providing schools with Project Appleseed?s Parental Involvement Toolbox through the organization?s web site.   Leave No Dollar Behind Project Appleseed has established a model 10 year, $50 million capital campaign to renovate the historic University City High School in St. Louis.

Special olympics missouri (somo) serves individuals with intellectual disabilities each year, by combining the health, fitness, social, and emotional benefits that result from participation in sports. Somo will substantially increase its capacity to serve these individuals through a state-of-the art training for life campus. This world-class, 44,000-square-foot facility will be built on 16. 5 acres in jefferson city, mo, centrally located for more than 120,400 individuals in the state who qualify for and would benefit from somo programs. Research shows developed economies like the united states have reduced physical activity levels by as much as 32% in fewer than two generations. The science is clear. Physical activity does more than create good health. It contributes to leadership, productivity and innovation. Special olympics provides training for life. One-third of somo athletes have autism spectrum disorder and another third have down syndrome. There are an estimated 120,400 individuals with intellectual disabilities in missouri. Athletes who participate in special olympics can double the likelihood to find and keep employment, making it far more than a sports organization. The motor skills of our children participating in the young athletes program improved at twice the rate of children who were not involved. Special olympics is the largest public health platform for people with id in the world, partnering with healthcare professionals in missouri to offer free screenings. Special olympics is proud to have 83% program expenses for 2014. This is especially impressive during a capital campaign while continuing to serve over 16,5000 children and adults with intellectual disabilities with the invaluable assistance from 21,040 volunteers. Special olympics received over $2. 2 million in contributed goods and services that are budget relieving. While this amount is excluded form the form 990, somo believes this is integral to our success. According to a recent athlete survey, 64% of somo athletes live below the federal poverty level and an additional 7% live below 133% of the federal poverty level.   the healthy athletes program is an initiative developed by special olympics, inc. , with a mission of improving the overall health of our athletes through various health screenings. This program offers athletes the opportunity to improve their health in an environment that is focused on the needs of individuals with intellectual disabilities. Screening programs include funfitness, healthy hearing, fit feet, health promotion, opening eyes, special smiles, and medfest. With the help of local volunteer health professionals, medfest provides athletes with physical examinations. Medfest exams also address questions and concerns of athletes' parents and guardians. All healthy athletes programs are provided free of charge to all special olympics athletes. 1,448 athletes were screened during 2014. $1 of healthy athlete expense results in $5 of service (pro bono). These programs were mainly funded by donated services in 2014, which were valued at $23,260.

After evidence-based program development and research, we evolved our traditional one-to-one tutoring model to create the impact initiative in january 2015. The impact initiative is a collaborative, community-based literacy effort. It improves efficiency and reduces barriers to access by placing our classes in a variety of locations in the metro. We meet students where they are, both academically and geographically. Literacy kansas city's impact initiative strives to help more adult learners more quickly through ticket to read classes, family reading program classes, and digital life skills instruction. Ticket to read classes meet for a minimum of three hours a week for a total of twelve weeks. Classes are offered at different levels, and students are placed in class according to their testing results. Each class is led by an instructor with the help of volunteer tutors creating a safe, team-oriented learning environment. These small group classes allow students to engage in peer learning, individualized and relevant instruction, digital literacy, and more. Ticket to read classes occur at a variety of days, times, and locations throughout the metro. We work hard to ensure that even the busiest learner has a close and convenient class option. The family reading program combats inter-generational low literacy with a parent-child approach to learning. This family-centered approach teaches the parent to reach the child, increasing the literacy of the whole family. Families can build award-winning home libraries by earning a book each week. The gears program was designed for the remedial reader. Along with class meetings, students are placed in a group of 2-3 with a tutor and meet with them twice per week as part of their instructional learning. During the spring term (january - may) of gears there was an average increase in the students reading level of . 81.

Tenth Life provides veterinary care, foster homes, and adoptive placement to stray cats and kittens, prioritizing those with special needs. We work to end unnecessary euthanasia and cat homelessness through educational outreach, community programs, and collaborative partnerships.  We believe that every cat, regardless of emotional or physical limitations, deserves the chance at a fulfilling and happy life. If a veterinarian determines that a cat is in a state of incurable suffering, Tenth Life relieves them of their pain through gentle and humane euthanasia. This decision is never made because of a lack of space, preventing negative behaviors, or because a cat's medical needs are difficult or expensive.  Tenth Life feels strongly that all pets should be spayed and neutered. An unbelievable number of companion animals are euthanized each day because there are not enough homes for them. The only way to make a difference in this tragedy is education. To learn more about the importance of spaying and neutering, please read our reasons for promoting it on our website.

HOME WORKS! The Teacher Home Visit Program	http://teacherhomevisit.org/	(314) 727-2727	EIN 45-4572322	225 Linden Ave	Saint Louis	MO	63105	USA	Education, Educational Services	HOME WORKS! The Teacher Home Visit Program partners families and teachers for childrens success.	HOME WORKS! has three models: our School-wide teacher home visit model, our Fellowship teacher home visit model, and our Parent Teacher Learning Team model, all which train, support, and help pay teachers of students performing below grade level to make home visits to engage parents in their childrens education.  The School-Wide Model requires two mandatory trainings, two teachers per visit, two visits per student per year, two Family Dinners at the school, and two staff in each school to ensure program fidelity and data collection.   The Fellowship Model was developed in response to teachers who wanted to make home visits, but were not in participating schools. Pairs of certified teachers in schools across the region attend training, complete at least 20 home visits together, record data on each visit, and attend three meetings to share observations, best practices, and ideas.   The Parent Teacher Learning Team (PTLT) model was developed as an alternative to the School-wide model and has three main components: one training and one home visit, three classroom meetings, and one 30-minute in-depth, two-way individual conference.	Last school year, 2014-15, 340 teachers in 27 schools in eight rural, suburban, and urban Missouri districts made 3,630 home visits.   Past Accomplishments include grades and attendance increased and office referrals decreased in most of our schools; 90% of all parents surveyed felt very comfortable contacting their childs teacher; students, parents, and teachers all reported improvements in homework completion; and average attendance rates for HOME WORKS! students receiving free or reduced lunch, students with poor attendance, and African American students increased, but decreased among nonHOME WORKS! students.  Our two science teachers are across the hall from each other. One has visited every one of her students, the other one has not-yet. They both gave the same homework assignment. 87% of the students in the home visiting class turned in the assignment on time. Only 30% of the students in the other class did. Home visits are having an enormously positive effect in our school.

In simple terms, the mission of the Front Porch Alliance is to partner with the residents of an urban neighborhood that has long been forgotten and give them the hope and determination to take back their community from the crime and blight and drugs that have consumed it over the past 35 years and made it a less than acceptable place to live and to raise a family. The first step in accomplishing this mission was to sit down with the residents and have them identify their priorities - we were willing to do whatever we could to help them create a more livable neighborhood but quite honestly we could not begin to understand what it felt like to walk in their shoes so it was evident we needed to listen first. After the priorities were identified - education, beautification, economic development and health - we were able to move forward, working alongside them to develop programs that addressed these concerns. As for our ultimate goals, we would like to see the crime rate measure at zero, to see each child receive an excellent education, to see each able resident have a job, to see each home be well-maintained, and to see each family thrive in a wholesome, nurturing environment. We''ve made great strides but there is still much to be done.	6-week summer program for youth ages 14-16 in which they learn economic education skills that help them develop their own businesses. They write a business plan, conduct market research, determine what product they wish to produce, develop a budget, buy their supplies, and then create and sell their products at different venues in the neighborhood. After repaying the loan they took from the Front Porch Alliance to purchase production supplies, the members of the companies divide the profits from their sales. This year, two of the five companies provided a service rather than a product. One did tuck pointing and landscaping for the residents of this urban neighborhood (at an affordable price) and the other painted houses under the direction of a qualified adult coach. In 2009, 56 youth participated in the program, a 27% increase from the previous summer.	We offer a multitude of programs to assist the residents in taking back their community - life skills classes, tutoring, family support, computer classes, health initiatives, minor home repair - but the greatest accomplishment is that we have given them hope, combined with the knowledge that they deserve a better life than they have been living and the tools to make that happen.	The people we serve are the residents of an urban Kansas City neighborhood.  The majority of these residents are senior citizens, many of whom are raising their grandchildren, and the rest are mostly single moms with a number of children.  Nearly 45% of these children live below the poverty level.	500	Urban neighborhoods in urban Kansas City, Missouri

WHAT IS PTS Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTS) can be terrifying. They may disrupt your life and make it hard to continue with your daily activities. It may be hard just to get through the day. PTS symptoms usually start soon after the traumatic event, but they may not happen until months or years later. They also may come and go over many years. If the symptoms last longer than 4 weeks, cause you great distress, or interfere with your work or home life, you probably have PTS.
