Craft Emergency Relief Fund, Inc.	http://www.craftemergency.org	802-229-2306	EIN 13-3273980	PO Box 838	Montpelier	VT	05601	USA	Arts & Culture, Arts Services, Emergency Assistance, Mutual & Membership Benefit	CERF+ safeguards and sustains the careers of craft artists; and provides emergency resources that benefit all artists.	US craft artists for emergency relief and professional development services. All US artists for emergency preparedness programs.			Through cerf+'s emergency relief and recovery programs, the organization distributed assistance in the form of 46 grants, 2 no interest loans, and 23 brokered donations of equipment, materials, and services to a total of 55 artists. Assistance totaled 157,043. Cerf+ also managed 32 active, no interest emergency recovery loans and provided emergency response counseling and referrals to 207 artists. During this time, cerf+'s maximum grant went from 3,000 to 4,000.   in fiscal year 2014, cerf+'s preparedness and resiliency building programs largely focused on three areas: increasing information about and access to business insurance; educating the next generation of makers about career protection; and spearheading a national movement in the arts sector to improve the overall safety-net for artists before, during and after disasters. Through these efforts, we served 951 individuals with business strengthening counseling (including education about business insurance) along with workshops/educational presentations on safeguarding artistic careers. Cerf+'s career protection curriculum training expanded with nine (9) participants from seven (7) nationally-recognized independent art schools and college art departments. This "train the trainer" program introduces faculty and career services staff to techniques of integrating the topic of risk management into their professional practice courses and workshops. Since the launch of this training program in 2012, eleven (11) schools have sent representatives. In the 2013-14 academic year, we estimate that more than 300 students (in bfa, mfa and certificate programs) received instruction in strategies to safeguard a creative career. Graduates of the 2012 and 2013 pilot workshops not only have exchanged teaching materials they have produced, but they are also promoting the importance of this curriculum to their colleagues both within and beyond their institutions. More than 900 people attended the nineteen (19) workshops and conference presentations cerf+ staff provided. In addition, our staff served as career-strengthening resources for artists by having our information booth at several conferences and art shows, such as the national council on education for the ceramic arts (nceca) and convergence, a conference of the handweavers guild of america in fiscal year 2014, cerf+ continued to provide a leadership role in building new alliances between the arts sector and the general emergency management field. Our national advocacy efforts to change the interpretation of artists' (and other self-employed workers) eligibility for post-disaster tool and equipment replacement by the federal emergency management agency (fema) continued to be one of two policy position priorities adopted by the national voluntary organizations active in disaster (nvoad). Cerf+'s director of programs was a featured presenter at nvoad's annual conference describing efforts within the arts community to become more disaster resilient and highlighting how the arts sector can contribute to recovery in communities after disasters.   in fiscal year 2014, cerf+ continued its role as co-chair of the national coalition for arts' preparedness and emergency response along with south arts, a regional arts organization based in atlanta, ga. During this time, the coalition steering committee worked with two consultants to produce a seven-year strategic and operational plan for its evolution from an informal task force to a sustainable/stable national network of arts responders. We have begun to implement the plan as well as initiated planning for a new arts responder network in illinois. Cerf+ also was one of the chief planners for a fall 2014 day-long summit of grantmakers in the arts to discuss how to address the human needs of artists in the wake of disasters.

In 2014, we performed 360 screenings: * 188 dental and oral health in special smiles * 58 flexibility, functional strength, aerobic capacity and balance in fun fitness * 114 nutrition, physical fitness and wellness in health promotion * the uvm college of medicine partnered with sovt to research and develop a year-round nutrition and fitness plan for athletes, which resulted in a detailed report outlining barriers to and opportunities for athletes to eat healthier and exercise regularly. In the 2015/2016 academic year, students will continue the project and produce a guideline for distribution to athletes and coaches. The athlete leadership program provides training and support for athletes who desire to expand their participation in special olympics both on and off the competition field. Through alp's, athletes receive training and have opportunities to hold positions of leadership and influence. In 2014, five athletes participated in an alp's global messenger (public speaking and self-confidence) training program, and sovt made a priority to offer speaking opportunities and other leadership roles to these athletes across the state.

These porfessional development progras provide adults with picture books, guides, material and training, transforming reading with children into multidimensional and powerful learning experiences.				Vermont center for the book supplements professional development, extends learning into the home, supports literacy in the early grades, and promotes cooperative relationships among the many agencies and programs providing services to children and families. The goal of all this work is to increase children's knowledge, school readiness, success and self-esteem by building the knowledge of parents, educators and librarians. All programs provide these adults with picture books, guides, materials and training to transform reading with children into multidimensional and powerful learning experiences. Vcb offers mother goose cares about the early years, mother goose cares about math and science, mother goose cares about social studies or mother goose cares about math and science/social studies (combo) courses at locations across the state. In addition, vcb offered day-long refresher workshops in math and science to educators who had previously taken a mother goose cares course. All course offerings include training plus books and materials for use with children ages 0-7, depending on the course. All mother goose cares courses are accredited for both undergraduate and graduate credit through the union institute of vermont.   what's the big idea? Was developed by vermont center for the book with funding provided by the national science foundation. All of the what's the big idea? Content (activities, family programs, discovery centers, etc. ) was first tested by 57 librarians from houston, the state of delaware, the clinton-essex-franklin library system in upstate new york and two vermont towns. These four systems provided a mix of librarians from large and small, urban and rural librarians. During the pilot phase of the project these librarians engaged in four conferences focusing on "big" ideas critical to children's acquisition of basic math and science skills and concepts: patterns and relationships, numbers and operations, change over time and geometry and spatial sense. A national advisory panel informed the development of the program. The participating librarians converted what they learned into hundreds of programs in local libraries using project-created informational resources, books, and manipulatives. In addition, they enriched their circulating collections and outreach with what's the big idea? Circulating kits for families.

With our new, expanded adult day care and day health rehabilitation facility, bpi's staffing needs have also increased. This has created more jobs for the local economy. We knew that with the facility expansion our personnel budget would need to increase also. Bpi has historically had an excellent history of long term staff retention. Multiple staff members have been with bpi 20 years or more. Staff are not just hired, they are added to our "bpi family" it generally takes about a year to truly learn the intricacies of the job and the philosophic operation of our organization.

With the new building as a substantial resource and with its professional and compassionate staff, bennington project independence continues its proud tradition of helping families share the care.   health services: kitchensin designing our new adult day center, the provision of fresh, high quality meals for our participants was paramount. Many of our participants are no longer able to prepare their own meals and have nutritional issues that can affect their health. The food we serve for lunch at bpi may be the only well-balanced meal some of our participants have each day. Bpi has a full-featured, modern commercial kitchen. We received design recommendations from several accomplished local chefs and restauranteurs. The result is an efficient and modern kitchen capable of feeding not only our participants but of serving several hundreds of people should our facility ever need to be used as an emergency shelter for our community. Bpi has an amazing nutrition manager who understands the unique dietary needs of older persons and younger adults with disabilities. She is committed to making well balanced, nutritious, home-cooked meals and healthy snacks. She works closely with our activity program to ensure that our meals dovetail with the activity themes of the day. They complement each other beautifully and provide a flavorful addition. Besides the full commercial kitchen, bpi included a full residential-style kitchen that is completely handicapped accessible. The counters and sink can accommodate participants in wheelchairs. An induction cooktop was included to ensure the utmost in participant and staff safety in cooking. The country kitchen was designed to promote independence and safety. Our participants enjoy relearning or polishing up their cooking skills. Our homey country kitchen is a delightful place for our participants to relish the joys of home cooking and a place to share family memories and recipes. Having our own kitchen has been an incredibly positive addition to the services and comprehensive care that we are able to provide for our participants. Bpi is a congregate meals site where the public can make a reservation to enjoy lunch at the richard a. Sleeman center. Exercise the exercise program at bennington project independence is part of a larger initiative to ensure that bennington project independence is a resource for the entire community. This can be seen in the strength and balance class that is a free fitness class for the community conducted weekly at the dr. Richard a. Sleeman center. Though the original focus was for persons with parkinson's disease, it has evolved into a popular option and enhancement to bone builders classes for adults in the community.   transportation:a major factor in the success of bpi's adult day program is the ability to provide our own personalized door-through-door transportation for our participants and families utilizing our own handicapped accessible vehicles. Our small fleet of three lift-equipped vehicles allows our expert transportation staff to be flexibly responsive to ever-changing participant, family caregiver and in-home service provider needs and schedules.

Since 1977, vlt has permanently conserved more than 544,000 acres. This land includes more than 790 working farms, hundreds of thousands of acres of productive forestland, and numerous parcels of community lands. This conservation work changes the lives of families, invigorates farms, launches new businesses, maintains scenic vistas, encourages recreational opportunities, and fosters a renewed sense of community.				Conservation workto protect farms and forests from the pressures of development, the vermont land trust uses conservation easements - a legal tool that limits development on productive farmland and forestland, and other meaningful natural and community places. While some landowners choose to donate their development rights, many others sell them for full or partial value. Landowners continue to own, manage, and pay taxes on the land and can sell their land; however, the conservation easement permanently remains on the property.   stewardship workwhen the vermont land trust conserves land, it promises to look after it forever. The more successful we are at conserving land, the greater our stewardship responsibility. Partnership is at the core of our stewardship program. In an average year, our stewardship staff will visit 100% of conserved parcels and meet with nearly 90 percent of the 1,300-plus owners of land conserved with vlt. During these visits with landowners, staff will often walk the land and discuss issues such as whether any significant land-use changes are planned. By building these relationships, we believe we reduce the number of violations of conservation easement terms.   atlas timberlands projectthe atlas timberlands project is a joint undertaking of the vermont land trust and the nature conservancy. Together, the two organizations own and manage approximately 23,000 acres of timberland in the northern green mountains. The management of this land provides direct experience with the challenges of owning and managing timberland for economic and biodiversity values. This experience has a direct impact on our ability to understand and address concerns of owners of conserved timberland. All of the land is open to the public for hiking, hunting, and other non-motorized recreation.   the brewster uplands conservation trust is a project to manage 1,000+ acres for public access recreation and educational purposes.
