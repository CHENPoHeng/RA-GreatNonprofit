Prairie lakes healthcare system is a rural, regional medical center serving ten counties in northeastern south dakota and western minnesota. The organization is committed to providing accessible, high quality, cost-effective healthcare while effectively managing the transition to new payment and care delivery models. Over the past decade, plhs successfully recruited specialty physicians in order to build new services that were needed in the region. In the past year, 6 new physicians were recruited including a urologist, an ent surgeon and a pulmonologist. This is the first time full-time pulmonology services have been available in the community. Plhs contracted with a new private practice radiology group of over 70 physicians that provide teleradiology services and weekly on-site procedural radiology services. Radiology services were enhanced with this addition of fellowship-trained subspecialty radiologists trained in body, breast, nuclear medicine, interventional, musculoskeletal and neuroradiology. Plhs also continued to increase the number of rural outreach clinics from 10 to 14. These clinics provide access to specialty physicians in rural communities in the plhs service area. Working with other physicians in the community, plhs initiated a clinical integration collaborative. The collaborative will select areas for focused improvement such as care coordination, referral coordination, chronic care management and access expansion. The organization's commitment to improving quality and patient outcomes was acknowledged by the receipt of several awards. For the second consecutive year, plhs received the american college of cardiology foundation's ncdr action registry platinum performance achievement award. The award recognized consistent adherence to recommended treatment guidelines for cardiology patients and performance at the 90th percentile on selected performance measures. Plhs also received the 2014 women's choice award as one of america's best hospitals for emergency care. The award granted to only 241 hospitals in the nation, was based on publically reported measures of emergency care deemed most important to women. Plhs received no penalties for avoidable hospital admissions as part of the federal government's hospital readmission reduction program. Plhs received a number of recognitions that recognized financial stability and performance. Cleverley + associates, a leading healthcare firm specializing in operational benchmarking, awarded prairie lakes the community five star designation based on performance in the following areas: financial viability and plant reinvestment, hospital cost structure, hospital charge structure and hospital quality performance. Plhs was named a 2014 healthstrong hospital by ivantage health analytics. Prairie lakes was among 547 hospitals nationwide selected for this honor, ranking in the top 13% of the 4,299 hospitals studied. The purpose of the healthstrong hospital study was to provide a comprehensive comparison of acute care hospitals across a continuum of quality, population health, outcomes and financial indicators. The 2014 healthstrong hospitals highlights top performing hospitals rated as part of ivantage's hospital strength index. The hospital strength index is a comprehensive rating system of hospitals and the results recognize the top performing hospitals-measuring them across 66 different performance metrics, including quality, value-based outcomes, patient perspective, affordability, financials and efficiency. In may 2013, cms released hospital price ranges of 100 common treatments. The report showed wide variations among hospitals in prices charged for the same procedures. Plhs consistently had the lowest prices among the state providers for procedures performed at the hospital. For the past decade, the organization has made a concerted effort to benchmark favorably to other providers on pricing.

The benefit of such a return could multiply and cascade down through an ecosystem, humans included, that has become fractured and an economy that needs stimulation, thus also allowing for the sustainability of the grasslands. Sha continues to develop and implement ways to harvest bison in culturally appropriate and ecologically acceptable to native american persons, and to provide education concerning native american culture and religious values as relating to bison. The goal of sha is to bring the harvest of buffalo back to the land and will allow the small producer, typically native american, with little or no access to capital,to bring his value-added product to a wide market of meat purveyors. Presently, a producer with a small herd has little or no options when it comes to converting his animals to cash. Harvested 656 buffalo for local buffalo producers.
