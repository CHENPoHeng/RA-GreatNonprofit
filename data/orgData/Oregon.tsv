The Oregon Foundation for Reproductive Health	http://www.accessebc.org	503-223-4510 ex 	EIN 93-0803636	PO Box 40472	Portland	OR	97240	USA	Civil Rights, Health, Public Health, Reproductive Rights	The Oregon Foundation for Reproductive Health (OFRH) is committed to the prevention of unintended pregnancies through the Emergency Birth Control (EBC) Access Project. The project is designed to increase access to, and awareness of, Emergency Birth Control, through three education and outreach components  to pharmacists, to health care providers, and to consumers as well as the general public.	OFRH has had considerable success with the EBC access efforts thus far.  OFRH first focused on pharmacists, who are on the front line of access, as EBC can be sold by the pharmacist over-the-counter without a prescription. We worked with the Oregon Board of Pharmacy to secure one of the premier policies in the country designed to prevent pharmacy refusals.   We also worked with the Oregon Department of Human Services to develop a reimbursement plan for pharmacists dispensing to low-income women and co-sponsored, with the Oregon State Pharmacy Association, an education program that trained over 400 pharmacists through a traveling training module and one-on-one project pharmacist outreach. This training and education has increased the number of pharmacies stocking and dispensing EBC in rural Oregon by almost 40% to date.    Borders Perrin and Norrander developed our public education campaign pro-bono, including volunteer models and photographer.  With the benefit of their professional design work, we did an initial printing and have distributed over 2,000 educational pieces to reproductive age women in Lane and Marion Counties, and an equal number of materials on college campuses, and through community organizations.  We also do direct outreach and distribution to primary care providers and pharmacists in rural areas encouraging them to display our posters and educational materials in their waiting rooms or service areas.	Rural & Underserved Oregon Women	Oregon	The oregon foundation for reproductive health (ofrh) created and promotes an initiative to dramatically increase women's access to preventative reproductive health care including preconception care and contraception. We researched and analyzed gaps in access between primary care and reproductive health services and developed a mechanism for pregnancy intention screening to increase preventive reproductive health services, thereby increasing the number of pregnancies that are wanted, planned and as healthy as possible. Ofrh developed the one key question (okq)initiative to be integrated in primary care policy within health care reform. This will change primary care service delivery so that all reproductive age women are routinely asked by their primary care clinician: "would you like to become pregnant this year? " if the woman answers "yes", she can be offered screening for pre-existing conditions and medications known to effect the health of a pregnancy, including a folic acid prescription. If she answers "no" she can talk about using contraception, whether she is satisfied with her method, and offered options as needed. This will enable more women to access preventive reproductive health services such as preconception care and contraception within a primary care setting. We successfully completed our first okq feasibility study at oregon health and science university's richmond clinic, and a small pilot study at a rural health center in john day, or. Due to the success of our feasibility study we have identified multiple pilot study sites for okq and have gained local and national attention. Okq has a registered trademark for intellectual property so as health centers across the country and within oregon implement the initiative, we serve as a clearinghouse for the various approaches to implementation, barriers experienced and solutions developed in response to those barriers. Ofrh offers technical assistance, custom tailored consultation, and an implementation toolkit including provider and patient educational materials, to all interested in implementing this new practice of pregnancy intention screening. Ofrh has presented okq at over 50 conferences including the association of reproductive health professionals (arhp). We also published "one key question: preventive reproductive health is part of high quality primary care" in the highly regarded peer review journal contraception. Ofrh is a charter member of the oregon preventative reproductive health advisory panel which will develop a tiered set of standards for the delivery of service within primary care, and of the national arhp metric advisory committee which will recommend a national metric for ensuring these services are routinely provided in primary care. We have studiously monitored and tracked oregon's health care reform process. Health care reform efforts in oregon presented us with a window of opportunity to ensure that preventative reproductive health is integrated into oregon's primary health care policy. To that end, we have consistently provided data-heavy testimony and grassroots advocacy at state-sponsored health care reform meetings, meeting with key policy makers and providing critical data at every point of influence. As a result, we secured a women's health domain for contraception and preconception services as an incentivized metric for coordinated care organizations (cco) such that ccos will be held accountable for "effective contraception use among women who do not desire to be pregnant". We also made sure that the standards for patient centered primary care homes included those for reproductive health. Ofrh is engaged in education and outreach to women on enrolling for insurance through the health insurance exchange or to gain medicaid coverage. We have supplied best-messaging to use in outreach that addresses the motivators and barriers for women to enroll. Our community partners in this effort benefit from our expertise on "women focused" messaging and we will continue to advocate for reproductive health services to be included, comprehensive, and accessible within the exchange. Ofrh is a grantee of the ms. Foundation for women and raising women's voices; both provide research and best messaging to address women's needs in health care reform. We also receive guidance from a 60 active member community advisory council. These members are community leaders in diverse areas and offer expertise from areas outside health care. Ofrh is part of the oregon outreach and enrollment alliance with community partners from across the state. We collaborate as a watchdog to cover oregon's policies and processes and build cross-movement alliances to advocate for inclusion and accessibility of coverage. Ofrh specifically provides women-centric messaging and reproductive health focused information to a broad range of community partners. Ofrh maintains membership in the allies for healthier oregon coalition and oregon health equity alliance; a collection of progressive advocacy organizations that bring policies most affecting communities of color and health disparities to the awareness of key policy and decision makers. This coalition provides the opportunity to coordinate our advocacy efforts with other statewide organizations. Ofrh has the endorsement from 27 oregon professional associations and organizations for the one key question initiative as well as the american public health, the governor's office, and us senators merkley and wyden. A representative from each organization participates in the okq coalition to help navigate barriers to implementation in the health care system. Through extensive use of social media we have provided weekly public education on reproductive health care and supplied information to endorsing organizations, community partners, and more than 5,000 oregonians. We also manage the spring adam fund, the only fund in oregon that provides transportation and lodging for women traveling to portland for abortion care. We continue to work on the emergency contraception access project, which increases women's pharmacy access to emergency contraception. We provide a policy watchdog role to ensure against pharmacy refusal. Other organization documents publicly available-one key question implementation manual-one key question patient brochure (spanish, english)-one key question: preventive reproductive health is part of high quality primary care was published in the highly regarded peer review journal contraception.

We envision a West with thriving, resilient wildlands, waters, and wildlife; a region powered by clean, renewable energy; and communities that are rooted in an ethic of conservation.   We combine our legal skills with sound conservation biology and environmental science to address major environmental issues in the West in the most strategic and effective manner. We work at the national, regional, state, and local levels; and in all three branches of government. WELC integrates national policies and regional perspective with the local knowledge of our 140+ partner groups to implement smart and appropriate place-based actions.  WELC has a highly experienced team of expert attorneys, conservation biologists and Western policy experts. We work close to the ground, with offices in Oregon, Montana, New Mexico, and Washington. As a public interest law firm, WELC does not charge clients and partners for services, but relies instead on charitable gifts from individuals, families, and foundations to accomplish our mission.	We have secured critical victories for the environment and communities of the American West.  Our top victories of 2015 are:   Safeguarding Imperiled Canada Lynx Through New Trapping Rules in Montana: We established a "lynx protection zone" in occupied lynx habitat in northwest Montana and the Greater Yellowstone region. The protection zone restricts the size and placement of traps that catch and sometimes kill lynx, and requires bobcat trappers to check their traps every 48 hours. According to the best available science, these changes will significantly reduce or eliminate the risk of accidental lynx trapping, and the likelihood of injury or death if an animal is caught. In Montana, we were also able to maintain the closure of the wolverine trapping season for an additional two years.  Protecting Old-Growth Forests, Spotted Owls, and Salmon: We defeated a 50-year logging plan for 150,000 acres of forest in Siskiyou County, California, which allowed aggressive logging of spotted owl habitat and granted permits to harm or kill endangered species. The logging would have also impacted federally protected salmon, steelhead, and the fisher, an animal proposed for listing under the Endangered Species Act.  Securing a Historic Win for Climate Change: Representing eight youths, we filed a lawsuit against the State of Washington demanding that the state take serious action on climate change by using the most recent climate science when crafting its plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions.  The King County Superior ruled in our favor to have the Washington Department of Ecology to reconsider its denial of the youths' petition. This is the first case in the United States in which a state agency was ordered to consider the best available climate science when regulating carbon dioxide emissions.

Our goal is to improve decision making and generate more opportunities for all Oregonians.	In 2000, The Oregonian editorialized, what makes the Center valuable is not rhetoric, but economic analysis that adds up to a powerful argument.  On our 10th anniversary, The Oregonian added, the Oregon Center for Public Policy can claim to have improved public debate in Oregon  and the situation of thousands of Oregonians.  	Our research improved Oregons Working Family Child Care and Earned Income Tax Credits, putting more money into the pockets of low-income working families with children. This wasnt just the right thing to do. Investments in their well-being help children succeed academically, creating a foundation for a brighter future for them and our state.  	Our research has helped defeat ballot measures and other proposals that would have reduced tax revenues while skewing the tax system to benefit the wealthy at the expense of all other Oregonians. As a result, we helped prevent deep cuts in spending on education, health care, and other services essential to the economic security of Oregonians.  	Our research made the case for Oregons ballot measure that boosted the minimum wage and promised annual cost-of-living adjustments. Increasing the minimum wage is one of the most important things a state can do to lift working people out of poverty.  	Our research explained the positive impacts of ballot measures that raised income taxes on high-income Oregonians, set a new corporate minimum tax and new tax rate for the most profitable corporations. These measures prevented deep budget cuts without dampening Oregons economic performance.  	Our research has created momentum for a Basic Health Program. This could help Oregon move even closer to the goal of extending affordable, quality health coverage to all Oregonians.  	Our research and analysis about hunger and food stamp policies led to Oregon implementing a food stamp outreach effort and adopting policies so more Oregonians could qualify for food stamps.

Ethos believes that music beats the streets and based on empirical research, music education can dramatically increase academic achievement. The organization is dedicated to providing these academic benefits to students across Oregon, regardless of socioeconomic status or geographic location.

Ospirg Foundation Inc	http://www.ospirg.org/foundation	(503) 231-4181	EIN 93-1150763	1536 Se 11th Ave Ste A	Portland	OR	97214	USA	Environment	With public debate around important issues often dominated by special interests pursuing their own narrow agendas, ospirg foundation offers an independent voice that works on behalf of the public interest. Cont'd sch o ospirg foundation, a 501(c)(3) organization, works to protect consumers and promote good government. We investigate problems, craft solutions, educate the public, and offer oregonians meaningful opportunities for civic participation.				Ospirg foundation conducted public interest research and education on the following campaigns: 1. Making health care work for oregon as the cost of insuring an average family of four hit 20,000 a year, according to one estimate, another recent study confirmed that at least 30% of all health care spending is wasted on unnecessary procedures and inefficiency. Continued on schedule o. Ospirg foundation is working to ensure that the health care industry does more to cut unnecessary waste and focus on preventive care that gets results, rather than passing the costs of this waste onto consumers. In fiscal year 2014, ospirg foundation continued working under a contract with the oregon department of business and consumer services to conduct in-depth analysis of significant health insurance rate hike proposals, as part of oregon's rate review process. Since 2010, additional scrutiny by state officials has cut over 180 million in waste from health insurance premiums for individuals and small businesses. In addition, ospirg foundation saw progress towards our goal of requiring insurers to more clearly quantify their progress in lowering costs and boosting prevention, and holding insurers accountable to strong benchmarks through oregon's rate review program. In part thanks to research and public education conducted by ospirg foundation the previous year, insurers were required to disclose more robust information about these cost-containment efforts, and there is a strong likelihood this aspect of the program will become even more robust in coming years. To see this through ospirg foundation ran a joint public education program with the oregon state public interest research group, educating over 70,000 oregonians face-to-face about this effort; gathering over 20,000 petition signatures to governor kitzhaber and state officials; and distributing information to 100,000 households about options available under the new health care law. 2. Tax transparency and accountability how government collects and spends money is critically important. Tax and budgeting decisions are the most concrete way that government declares its public priorities and balances between competing values. Tax dollars should only be used to promote the public interest. When tax dollars are given to private interests, to stimulate economic development for example, it is critical that the public can clearly see whether or not they are getting their money's worth. Yet, until recently, the details of over 600 million in state corporate tax subsidies were kept out of reach from the public. As a result the public had virtually no way to evaluate these subsidies. Ospirg foundation, working closely with the oregon state public interest research group, helped pry open critical details from some of these programs after a series of public records requests to the state that culminated in an oregon department of justice order to disclose the information. Shortly after, governor kitzhaber's administration committed to disclosing most of the remaining critical details of all the major economic development subsidy programs on oregon's transparency website by the close of 2013. However, it took all of fiscal year 2014 to hold the kitzhaber administration to this commitment. Ospirg foundation continued to provide the policy analysis and background to inform administration officials, the public and members of the media of the importance of the administration's actions. Our efforts paid off; by the turn of the year more information was posted than ever before about corporate tax subsidies - setting an important precedent for future efforts.

The StandUpGirl.com Foundation is nothing short of a miracle. Founded in 2001, this amazing website now reaches about 300,000 young people each month  well over 3 million girls each year.

Based on the relationship between monthly advertising spending, visits to the site, and emails from young women who choose life for their baby, the life-saving potential of this website is only limited by the funds available!

Basically our dollars are spent in copying, mailing, distributing flyers, mailbox, costs associated with travel expenses of the retreat facilitator and his assistant, retreat center fees, food, transportation and scholarships for those who wish to attend but have no money. In addition, we make an annual donation to the retreat leader for his teachings for which he does not charge as he is a mendicant monk.   Please visit our website: http:/www.fallenwarriorsfoundation.com  You can find videos there as well on the right side of the page. Just click Media!  History:   When I was 18 I carried a machine gun and fought as a Marine in the Vietnam War. When I came home the country had exploded with the anti-war movement and I was suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. I tried many things to ease this illness but healing did not come for decades.   Writing helped, but traveling back to Vietnam, to my original point of pain was critically important. Thus, the Fallen Warriors Foundation grew out of a trip my wife and I and our two children made to Vietnam in 1993.   My wife felt that if I carried medical and educational supplies and toys I could replace some of my muscle memories and other thoughts associated with my tour as a Marine. We carried these supplies and donations and they helped replace the thoughts of carrying a machine gun and killing enemy soldiers.   I followed that trip up with several more to Vietnam. Each trip consisted of carrying medical supplies. One year we took back a group of Vietnam Veterans who also carried donations. We took them to their former battlefields on a mission of healing. Then we led a group of doctors and nurses to Vietnam to help provide care to the poorest villages.   Over the years Fallen Warriors Foundations has delivered ton's of donations of medical supplies such as kidney dialyses machines and computers and other critical supplies.   We built a clean water system to deliver fresh water to a village than had none. We donated funds for students to attend school and even sponsored a Vietnamese student to come to the US to study, at a time when it was very difficult to leave Vietnam.   We have held annual retreats for the past fifteen years for veterans and their loved ones and have put on special events such "Feasts for Peace", where veterans and former war protesters meet to reconcile.   We staged theater presentations and have written articles on remembering veterans that have been published in newspapers across the country.   We have been active in working with incarcerated veterans by creating a speakers buereau, lecture on ways to deal with PTSD, such as setting up meditation programs.   We have also provided small stipends for veterans when they transition out of prison back into the community. Jack Estes, President and co-founder.

Our work focuses on youth at the margins of our society.  Our work empowers youth with creative tools - tools they will use to make themselves stronger through a carefully structured process of creating art. As they develop creative skills through challenging and difficult work, they gain new ways of seeing and coping with the world.	Since programming started in 2004, PlayWrite has coached over 500 kids through the process of creating original art.  Their new works of drama and music have reached audiences totaling over 7,000 people, who've been able to share their own stories of experiencing the magic that happens when a young artist is given the space and the encouragement to create something amazing.	We work with high-school-aged youth 'at the edge:' students in alternative living and learning communities who, for various reasons, have been unable to thrive in mainstream school settings.  This ranges from high school students attending night classes, to Native American youth living in tribal communities, to young pregnant and parenting women receiving support in a secure facility.  We bring our workshops to them, coaching their own inner artist to create something fantastic, and to turn everything going on in their own minds into works of art.	Currently, we serve youth living across the Portland Greater Metro area.	Our core program is a two-week writing workshop in which trained coaches work one-on-one with high-school aged students in the process of writing an original play.  At the end of the two week process, professional actors perform staged readings of these two-character pieces.  Graduates of our core program are also invited to part-take in a song-writing workshop, where students create lyrics for their characters and then work with professional musicians to find the right tunes.  We also offer weekly drop-in writing groups for graduates of our core playwriting workshop.  Students gather in a relaxed community setting to share and discuss each others' new works of drama, poetry, fiction...whatever they bring to the table that week!	Each year, we reach approximately 100+/- youth directly as participants of our workshops, of which there are about 10 per year, each of which has 8-10 participants.

Across much of Africa anti-poaching tactics have remained largely unchanged for decades. Small groups of undertrained and poorly equipped rangers are sent out for days on end to conduct patrols in remote and dangerous locations. Modern-day poachers have evolved and routinely utilize military tactics and equipment to kill high-target species, such as elephants, rhinos and gorillas. In the cross-fire, rangers are also killed. Seeing this shortfall, the IAPF set out in 2009 to fill the gap.  The IAPF has a structured approach to conservation, employing the relevant tactics and technology to defend wildlife from the ever increasing threat of poaching within protected areas. Anti-poaching however is only a portion of the conservation solution. To be a part of successful projects, the IAPF works alongside partners who specialize in community engagement and development, research and development, wildlife rescue and biodiversity management.   Anti-poaching protects community assets, creates jobs, promotes training and education and reduces habitat destruction. In the many water stressed countries of southern Africa, future generations will depend on these critical natural environments for their very wellbeing.	Since inception in 2009, the IAPF has worked to close the gap between highly sophisticated criminal poaching networks and undertrained and poorly equipped rangers. This work has generated impactful and impressive results in Zimbabwe, Mozambique and South Africa through programs such as Eco Ranger, Anti-Poaching Intelligence Group, Anti-Poaching Training and Patrols, Game Reserves United, Victoria Fall Anti-Poaching Unit, and IAPF Air Support. In 2016, due to a determined IAPF presence between poaching forces in Mozambique and the South African border validated poaching losses in adjacent areas of Kruger National park were reduced by 80% versus 2015.

The purpose of the Center is to offer instruction in Zen practice and Buddhist teachings, and to provide a place where people can form a community that supports Zen practice in everyday life.			Greater Portland, Oregon Metro Area	Residential practice: residential practice is an opportunity for members to live in the center, part-time or full-time. Dharma rain zen center residents commit to becoming an intimate part of the residential community as well as deepening their relationship to the larger drzc sangha. They commit to spending more time and energy doing formal practice within the context of sangha than is usually possible outside of residency. During their term of residency they seek out and accept guidance from the center teachers, soto zen teachings, and the dharma inherent in the center's training matrix and traditions. As much as personal commitments allow, residents attend daily zazen, communal meals, wednesday evening and sunday morning programs, work practice days, monthly fusatsu and in-town retreats. Four shared and/or private rooms were available to live in community with our two abbots and four ordained priests.   adult retreats & workshops: approximately every six weeks, the center holds a retreat. These range from one-day retreats on saturdays (zazenkai) and weekend retreats to a week-long intensive sesshin, a term which means "examine the heart. " retreats include meditation and services, tea, class, work periods, and some also include an opportunity for discussion and questions. Periods of focused practice are an ancient and vital part of buddhist, and especially zen, tradition. At retreat we have an opportunity to focus on deep meditation and inner reflection. The longer retreats include the opportunity for private interviews with teachers, lectures and special ceremonies, as well as formal meals (oryoki) and longer periods of meditation. Only direct program costs for meals and materials are shown.   children's programs dharma garden: dharma school - during the school year from sept-may, twice a month children's classes are held during sunday service. Through stories and songs, art projects and games, discussions and ritual, children in our dharma school are offered opportunities to deepen their understanding of themselves, the teachings of buddhism and the practice of the dharma in their daily lives. Dharma camp - mandala on the mountain is a week long summer camp, for kids aged nine through eighteen who are interested in buddhism. Dharma rain zen center has been running these camps since 1994. Campers come from a variety of traditions and have different levels of familiarity with buddhism. The mountain retreat encourages mindfulness while exploring nature and enjoying traditional summer camp activities such as hiking and campfire skits. Dharma camp has grown to include campers from across the united states. This year we hosted 46 kids from six states with 15 staff members on hand, a 3:1 ratio. Pre-school program: drzc has received a dedicated donation to begin a pre-school program for 3-5 year old children. Our development team has undertaken the task of researching a program model and writing a business plan. The frog song pre-school has a projected start date of september 2015.   planting zen in siskiyou square: dharma rain has purchased a 14 acre brownfield, this parcel of land was a former landfill site. The vision for the site and our method of arriving at it both stem from our core mission to help people bring ever more awareness to their lives. We will build a traditional buddhist temple layout with a central core of human-scale buildings enveloped in a fabric of wooded areas, inviting paths, gardens and a small cluster of residential units.

The first organization in East Africa that has coordinated anti-poaching teams operating on both sides of the Kenya-Tanzania border, Big Life recognizes that sustainable conservation can only be achieved through a community-based collaborative approach, which is at the heart of Big Lifes philosophy :  Conservation supports the people and people support conservation.   Big Lifes vision is to establish a successful holistic conservation model in Amboseli-Tsavo that can be replicated across the African continent.	KENYA  * In Kenya, approximately 220 rangers are spread across 22 permanent outposts, four mobile units, one Rapid Response Unit (RRU) and two permanent observation posts covering roughly 1,678,000 acres (425,000 hectares).   In 2014, Big Life rangers patrolled just over 100,000 kms by vehicle and 93,722 kms on foot. As a result, they dealt  a number of crimes ranging from poaching to habitat destruction to community crimes. In total, there were 539 people arrested for 185 incidents. 804 poaching or habitat destruction tools were impounded: 166 snares, 18 poisoned arrows, 98 bullets and two guns. In addition to the tools, one rhino horn, five pieces of ivory, more than 550 woodcarving pieces, and 92 kgs of bhang (marijuana) were also confiscated.  TANZANIA  * Big Life Tanzania, operating through its partner Honeyguide Foundation, works across critical ecosystems of northern Tanzania, focusing on five community conservation areas or Wildlife Management Areas (WMAs): Enduimet, Lake Natron, Manyara Ranch, Randilen, and Burunge.  Across the WMAs, Big Life, Honeyguide and partners employ and/or manage 139 local community rangers to monitor and protect wildlife. These rangers operate out of nine outposts and mobile units, covering more than 5,000 square kilometers.  Community rangers, in 2014, arrested 100 people for poaching (trophy and bush-meat), habitat destruction, and community crimes resulting in the confiscation of 80 poaching related items.  Of the 45 bush-meat arrests, ostrich eggs and zebra meat were the most common, with 16 and 13 incidents respectively. Other primary targets include gazelle, giraffe, bushbuck, eland, and wildebeest.   MAASAI OLYMPICS  * The second Maasai Olympics was held in 2014 thanks to a number of supporting organizations. Maasai Olympics athletes compete for medals, not lions, and received huge international attention. It is Big Lifes hope to harness this success and build an interim program that will help promote conservation education and provide an alternative to lion hunting. Maasai tribes historically identify leaders and demonstrate bravery through lion hunts, but there are simply not enough lions left for the tradition to continue.   PREDATOR COMPENSATION FUND  * In 2003, in response to an imminent  and virtually certain  threat of local lion extinction, Maasailand Preservation Trust (MPT), in close collaboration with the local community, conceived a first-of-its-kind predator compensation programme. The intention was to better balance the costs and benefits of living with wildlife and thereby replace conflict and retaliation with tolerance and cohabitation.  This novel conservation strategy remains one of the most far-reaching and effective projects yet conceived by MPT, the first project of its kind implemented in Maasailand. Predator compensation, due to its unmatched success, now operates on two neighbouring group ranches.

Rural community leaders, businesses and organizations committed to community-based land stewardship.		Forests: decades of fire suppression and litigation over logging have left degraded forests and dying towns. There is an urgent need to increase the pace and scale of restoration projects, and create jobs that make our forests resilient to the increasing threat of abnormal wildfire, insects, and disease. Sustainable northwest has changed the conversation to jobs for the environment by bringing people together to create durable solutions that restore our northwest forests.   water: the competing needs of our cities, agriculture, fish, and energy production have led to water scarcity and pollution in the pacific northwest. Efforts to address water challenges in rural areas are often hampered by planning, financial, and social barriers. Historically, the response has been conflict, litigation, and emergency assistance. This has left our water-dependent ecosystems and communities imperiled.   rangelands: decades of fire suppression have allowed western juniper to overtake rangelands, using precious water, and destroying habitat for sage grouse and other wildlife. By sustainably harvesting western juniper we are restoring rangelands to their natural state, and returning more water and a healthy wildlife habitat to the high desert.

SMART's proven model engages community volunteers across the state to read one-on-one with PreK through third-grade children for one hour per week during the school year. SMART students also receive up to 14 new books to take home and keep each year. Funded overwhelmingly by private sources, the SMART program complements reading curricula and instruction, and is intended to build confident, lifelong readers who enjoy reading and use it as a tool for learning. Learning to read is one of the most important steps in a child's life, laying the foundation for future knowledge and education. Prevailing research proves that shared book reading and the availability of books in the home during a child's formative years are the strongest predictors of early literacy skills. SMART provides both. During the 2015-16 school year, SMART delivered one-on-one reading support to 10,100 children and gave away 163,557books. This was possible in part thanks to 5,000 volunteers statewide who together contributed over 126,000 hours of volunteer time. Over the past 24 years, SMART has served 188,000 children with the help of over 125,000 volunteers. Through SMART, children have taken home more than 2.4 million books and spent nearly 4 million hours reading one-on-one with trained volunteers. Most importantly, we know the program works. An independent study by the Eugene Research Institute found that fifth-graders who participated in SMART as first-graders were 60 percent more likely to meet state reading benchmarks than similar students who did not participate. In annual surveys, teachers, parents, and school administrators consistently say that SMART makes a significant impact on students reading skills, confidence, motivation, and enjoyment. Join us as a volunteer and make a difference in the life of a child in your community.	10,000 children

Writing workshops: we held 43 writing workshops in hospitals, schools, prisons, homeless youth shelters, treatment centers, low income housing buildings, senior centers and other health care and social service settings. We offered these 8-10 week generative writing workshops free of charge to more than 500 adults and young people experiencing financial insecurity or isolation. We held workshops in partnership with 37 different agencies to bring writing to places where people live, study and receive services. We provided journals, pens, snacks, bus tickets and accommodations to remove obstacles to participation. 98% of participants reported improvements in writing and listening skills as well as a decrease in isolation. We also held 26 sliding scale and market rate workshops open to the general public and 13 one-time workshops tailored to specific groups. A participant in our workshop at boys & girls aid told us, "i have a new coping skill! I was nervous because i thought i was bad at writing but the group kept encouraging me and supporting me. I felt every time i wrote i got better and better. The energy was really positive and i had the freedom to express myself the way i wanted to. It really helped me. "  publications: we published three professionally-designed books and one chapbook of participants' unique and powerful writing. We printed and distributed more than 1,100 books: "a world where the rules were my own" (spring); "5th and pine/quinto y pino" (summer); "mile marker" (fall); and "a perfectly good airplane", featuring writing by students in the i have a dream workshops. These publications were truly community endeavors, with more than 70 volunteers helping to produce each book/chapbook. Workshop participants each received a free copy of the book in which their writing was published. Books were also made available at local bookstores alongside literary journals and at public libraries, the county jail, a state prison and at schools. We also featured writers and their work on our website and through social media. We also created community broadsides of writing by participants in our prompt workshops. Oregon poet laureate peter sears wrote in an introduction to our summer anthology: "i can't help but feel, when i read the pieces in this anthology, that it is the act of writing itself that imparts a certain strength, a certain integrity. Even when these voices painfully register the feeling that no one sees or appreciates the experiences of the writer. . [these writers] become more than what they might be perceived as being. "  community readings: in 2014, we held 3 large and 17 smaller readings with a combined total of more than 1,600 audience members. Our large community readings were open to the public and were free of charge. These readings brought participants from all of our workshops together with each other and with the general public to share their work. These events promoted respect for diverse voices and provided the opportunity to share the stories of individuals experiencing isolation because of economic, cultural, physical, social or other barriers. The range of stories at each reading was vast. An unmistakable spirit of support, compassion, respect and enthusiasm for the writers and the written word permeated each reading. Our writers and audiences are among the most diverse in portland. Workshop participant felicia padgett said, "[the reading] felt like i was a part of something way bigger than me. I was excited. . . Seeing people who have gone through really hard times do something good for themselves. I cried, just because people come from messed up places and it's really hard for people to get up there and read their writing. I was nervous and i'm sure everyone else was. It was amazing. "  in preparation for our program expansion into washington county we added 1 fte in 2014. The additional staffing made meetings with writers, businesses, agencies, volunteers and donors possible as we gear up for 10 writing workshops in the summer of 2015

During a biblical archaeological tour in 1976 at the ancient walls of Nineveh, founder Bettie P. Mitchell answered the call to go and teach nothing but the Kingdom of God.  Our Mission: Empowering people to live and love as Good Samaritans  Our Vision: To develop relationships worldwide that demonstrate the love of Jesus in Action  What we do every day:   Through thousands of loving volunteers in over a dozen offices in the Pacific Northwest (OR, WA, ID), Good Samaritan Ministries (GSM) provides services to men, women, professionals, couples and really anyone in need of heartfelt healing, encouragement, or empowerment.  As a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization all Good Samaritan services are provided through donation support and volunteer effort.  GSM offers similar services internationally.  Located in over 20 countries, our centers touch the lives of those in need by providing encouragement through service such as widow and orphan programs, care for the elderly, counseling/mentoring, empowerment classes, education for children, and MUCH more.	A GSM Counseling Testimony: Everyone Is Welcome 24 SEP 2013 A good friend recommended GSM because it doesnt require payments (donation-based) and because it is Christ-centered. Before I retired from teaching, an international student came to me seeking help for a personal problem. I knew she needed more professional help than I could give. Although the student was not Christian, she felt safe and comfortable there. She asked if I would sit with her during her counseling sessions. I agreed, and I concluded that if I ever needed counseling, GSM would be my choice. Some years later, a personal need did indeed arise and I immediately contacted GSM.  Recently, I received counseling services again as lifes challenges arose.  GSM has been the best place for me because it helped me address my concerns from a spiritual as well as a psychological perspective. In counseling services Id received before, I usually felt left on my own between sessions. At GSM, my counselors offer to pray with or for me at the end of each session was so valuable, encouraging and supportive through difficult times.  Michelles Journey: From Considering Divorce to. 28 MAY 2013 I was losing hope and desperately wanting to leave my husband because our problems seemed insurmountable. I was seriously considering divorce. Michelle is the mother of two teenage daughters at home. At church, Michelle and her husband had been referred to GSM for classes and counseling.  While waiting in the lobby at GSM, I was completely struck by the warmth and a culture of love in the office waiting area, Michelle said. Many of the staff members I found out later were volunteers. I was completely touched by this and experienced that same warm loving feeling every time we arrived.  Learning to Listen and Share our Hearts: As told by Michelle, we began the six-week marriage workshop led by Bettie and Jerry Mitchell in 2011. They shared very openly of the challenges that they faced during their ~60 years of marriage. Bettie made us all laugh, and I loved how she was able to get to the heart of sensitive subjects. It was exactly what I needed to hear! We were also given very practical tools for effective ways of communicating that we still use today. I love the card game it brings honesty and clarity, without judgment or strife to our marriage! Blessing to you Jerry and Bettie!   A mother - Leah & Sams Story 09 MAY 2013 GSM is a place where children have the opportunity to learn how to express their emotions in a healthy way and mothers find support.

Oregon Humane Society	http://www.oregonhumane.org	(503) 285-7722	EIN 93-0386880	1067 Ne Columbia Blvd	Portland	OR	97211	USA	Animal Protection & Welfare, Animals	The oregon humane society's mission is to foster an environment of respect, responsibility, and compassion for all animals through education, legislation and leadership; to take care of the homeless, to defend the abused, and to fight with unrelenting diligence for the recognition of the integrity of all animals.				Sheltering and adoptions - the oregon humane society continues to maintain one of the highest adoption rates in the country - 11,402 total adoptions for 2014. The animals that found new homes constitute an overall 98% adoption rate. Through the second chance program, the society saves more lives by accepting animals from shelters and animal control agencies across oregon, washington, hawaii and california. These shelters usually face the dual problem of too many abandoned animals and too few adopters. In 2014, 5,776 animals were accepted from 73 organizations. There are three measurements that must be taken together to adequately assess the performance of an organization's animal shelter programs: total number of animals admitted for rehoming, the percentage of animals released alive (save rate), and the average length of stay from arrival to disposition ("los"). Considering only one factor in the absence of others could lead to a false conclusion of success when just the opposite may be true. For example, a shelter could have a high save rate, but if only 100 animals were admitted and 100% were adopted, but the average length of stay was 365 days, you might think of them differently than an organization that accepted several thousand animals, had a 90% save rate, and the animals took an average of two weeks to rehome (a 14-day length of stay). These three metrics together can be used as an assessment of impact and efficiency of animal rehoming program. 2014 adoption rates* the society adopted 4,924 dogs - 99% of all dogs received by the shelter; * the society adopted 5,757 cats - 97% of all cats received by the shelter; and* the society adopted 721 other animals - 94% of all other animals received by the shelter. 2014 save ratesin addition to the adoption rate, the oregon humane society also maintains data on the save rate, calculated according to the asilomar standard. The save rate accurately reflects the many options for pets that come to the shelter besides adoption - for example, animal transfers to other rescue organizations and animals that are returned to their owners. * the society saved a total of 12,010 animals, with a save rate of 98%; * the society saved 5,119 dogs - 99% of all dogs received by the shelter; * the society saved 6,040 cats - 98% of all cats received by the shelter; and * the society saved 851 other animals - 97% of all other animals received by the shelter. The oregon humane society calculates the average length of stay by including the day of arrival through the day of disposition (adoption, transfer, euthanasia or return to owner), but not including time spent in foster homes or the time animals are held for the purpose of criminal prosecution. 2014 length of stay averages* dog/puppy combined was 8. 7 days. * cat/kitten combined was 9. 0 days. Adoption outreachbringing pets into the community for adoption is another way that the society maintains such a high save rate. * a total of 364 animals found homes directly through this program; and* there were 78 events that included pets available for adoption; and* the program reached over 115,000 people in 2014 through events and permanent outreach locations.   medical services - during the year ended december 31, 2014, the society performed 13,555 surgeries in the animal medical learning center (the "amlc"), including 12,053 spay and neuter surgeries and 1,502 other essential and emergency surgeries. In addition, the amlc provided 7,546 medical exams for pets and taught 74 veterinary students.   community awareness - educating the community and promoting animals and programs are crucial to helping the society achieve its mission of finding a home for every animal. In addition to a vibrant education department, the society's public relations and marketing department strives to promote humane lessons through the media, special events, and real-time photos of animals available for adoption on the society's web site. In 2014: * visitors to the shelter totaled 138,585 - a 22% decrease (on average, 386 people visit the society each day - open 359 days); * adoptions averaged 32 per day; * incoming phone calls numbered 260,025; * the society issued 55 media releases; * the society had 855 television and radio news stories that aired; * community events numbered 146, with 78 of them featuring adoption outreach; * the society's magazine reached 30,000 readers; * the society's web site averaged 6,580 daily visitors; and* the average stay on the society's web site was 5:58 minutes.

We use environmental law, science, collaboration and education to defend healthy ecosystems and help build sustainable communities.				Oregon and california conservation program ks wild's oregon and california conservation program is designed to fulfill the group's mission to protect and restore the biological diversity of the klamath-siskiyou region. This area, stretching from roseburg, oregon in the north to redding, california, in the south, and from the pacific ocean to the cascade range crest, contains some of the most ecologically distinctive wildlands along the west coast of the lower 48. The organization's focus is on more than 8 million acres of federal public lands in the region administered by bureau of land management and the u. S. Forest service. Created in response to a history of ecologically unsustainable land management practices, including widespread cutting of old-growth forests, road building, cattle overgrazing and suppression of natural fires, ks wild operates as a public lands watchdog organization. Ks wild participates in the public planning process defined in the national environmental policy act through technical input and public engagement to support ecologically beneficial land management projects and oppose threats to forest health, clean water and biodiversity. Ks wild also achieves its mission through a variety of local, regional and national campaigns that address a range of land and water conservation needs - including conservation of endangered species, clean water protection and wilderness advocacy. Over the past year, ks wild secured expansion for the oregon caves national monument in southwest oregon. Growing from 400 to 4,000 acres, the new oregon caves national monument and preserve now extends into the headwaters of cave and lake creeks, which serve as drinking water sources for the park's visitors. In addition to the designation of the first underground wild and scenic river in the united states, the river styx, ks wild is also worked to permanently retire 31,000 acres of public land grazing allotments within and around the park's new borders. Ks wild also continued to serve on the pacific wolf coalition, which consists of group of non-profit conservation groups across oregon, washington, and california whose aim is to help wolves recover in their historic native habitat and foster appreciation for this important predator in our forest ecosystems. Ks wild built a public engagement campaign to protect the smith, illinois and pistol rivers from industrial nickel strip mining.   rogue riverkeeper ks wild's rogue riverkeeper program protects and restores clean water and aquatic habitat within the 3. 3-million acre rogue river and adjacent chetco river watersheds. Home to the fourth largest metropolitan area in oregon and a flourishing whitewater industry as well as numerous runs of anadromous salmonids and fishing opportunities, the rogue basin is known as a world class place to raft, fish and live. Within the rogue basin, rogue riverkeeper is unique as it's the only organization filling that niche. In 2013, rogue riverkeeper was successful in leading the effort to reform suction dredge policies for the state of oregon's waterways. Rogue riverkeeper's work to protect the rogue includes watchdogging government agency actions on the clean water act and energy issues, advocating for permanent protection of southern oregon's natural wonders and seeking restoration and long-term vitality for the rogue river and its tributaries. As stresses mount from increased development, amplified water demand and the effects of climate change, the rogue riverkeeper program could not be more timely or necessary. Through enforcement of the clean water act and other environmental laws, rogue riverkeeper works to ensure that our nation's water quality laws are not ignored. Throughout 2014, ks wild's rogue riverkeeper participated in the governor's study group to establish new protocols for mining in oregon's waterways. Progress was made in developing new safeguards to protect critical salmon habitat in the state. Rogue riverkeeper continued to act as a regional effort to stop development of a fracked gas pipeline across southern oregon. The federal energy regulatory commission released their draft environmental impact statement, which rogue riverkeeper analyzed for adequacy of and water protection.
