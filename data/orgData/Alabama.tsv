Using litigation, education, and other forms of advocacy, the SPLC works toward the day when the ideals of equal justice and equal opportunity will be a reality.				The southern poverty law center (splc) seeks justice by supporting victims of civil rights abuses and hate crimes, and promoting the civil and human rights of groups most affected by bias and discrimination in our society: minorities, immigrants, guest workers, children, the poor, and the lgbt community - both in the deep south and nationwide. Its case docket focuses on holding hate groups accountable for murders and other violent acts committed by their members; ending workplace exploitation of immigrants; challenging unconstitutional or discriminatory laws and policies affecting immigrants, minorities and the lgbt community; and working to reform juvenile justice, mental health, and education systems that fail children and routinely push students out of classrooms and into the criminal justice system, disproportionately harming african-american and latino students living in poverty. The splc attorneys focus on these critical civil rights issues from five splc offices in the deep south.   the splc's public information and education efforts seek to combat hate and bias in our society, expose extremism, and reduce discrimination and injustice. The splc provides information about hate groups and other extremists, their activities and their crimes to the public, law enforcement, policymakers, human rights organizations, and the media with the goal of preventing hate and extremism from entering the mainstream. The splc provides information and training materials to tens of thousands of law enforcement officers nationwide and conducts in-person training with thousands of officers per year. The splc also seeks to foster equality in the classroom and support tolerance education by providing award-winning, anti-bias materials to more than 400,000 teachers and schools nationwide. The splc educates the public on the structural causes, and impacts, of inequality and uses a multifaceted approach of community education, mobilization, media and legislative advocacy to combat bias and discrimination against minorities, immigrants, the poor, the lgbt community and other vulnerable members of society. All of the splc's work is provided free of charge.	Civil Liberties, Civil Rights, Intergroup & Race Relations, Minority Rights, Race	
Victory Health Partners Inc	http://www.victoryhealth.org	251-460-0999	EIN 63-1260841	3750 Professional Pkwy	Mobile	AL	36609	USA	Victory Health Partners (VHP) is a 501 (c) (3) nonprofit faith-based health care organization.

Specifically, these are low income individuals, who are unable afford private insurance and do not qualify for government funded insurance. VHP offers high-quality healthcare to these individuals who qualify - regardless of ethnicity or creed.	Low income uninsured adults ages 19-64		20 counties in Alabama, 5 in Florida, and eight in Southern Mississippi	VHP offers a community solution to a community problem. By offering patients general medical care, including laboratory visits, X-rays, EKGs, and counseling, Victory provides a medical safety net to offset a major medical incident. Patients are qualified based on their income and family size. They pay a small co-payment that includes their appointment and any laboratory tests. In addition to primary medical care, Victory offers a Dental Clinic, Medication Dispensary program, Incontinence Clinic, Pulmonary Clinic, Wound Care Clinic, Womens Wellness Exams, MRIs, Minor Surgeries, Diabetes Education Program and Sleep Apnea Clinic.

VHP orders mammograms and PAP smears for its female patients and free colon screenings for those who qualify through a free state program.

The AHDCs latest project is the Ashland Community Garden.  	We have become increasingly aware of the lack of opportunities for our residents to participate in gardening. Most elderly residents were once farm owners and/or avid gardeners & growers, while our younger generation residents have never had the opportunity to learn, or a place to plant. There are few programs for them to participate in anything other than school or city league sports; both provide valuable team skills, but little beneficial technical skills. We also see the good and bad effect that technology is having on all generations; it does provide some valuable skills, but is often a distraction (video games, smart phones, tablets, etc.). A community garden project is an excellent way for all generations to become more self-sufficient. Technology is great, but we cannot eat it. If technology disappeared, we can survive from the garden. Our older residents are excited about working with the younger ones to share the knowledge and skills necessary for gardening to become a valuable and rewarding experience. We will be teaching youth how fun it is to produce something that can go directly to the table, and be a great benefit to their familys health and economics.   Future projects will focus on job/skills training programs, and homeownership opportunities.

E-mail and website communications (and phone calls) help others who cannot attend meetings feel connected to the support group.  We put together 230 bags for patients receiving treatment.  These are distributed in late November through early January.  Some of the items in the bags were lip balm, hand sanitizer, toiletries, toothbrush and toothpaste, magazines, pens, tissue, candy, and a handwritten note of encouragement.  We joined with a local ovarian cancer foundation for a stand-up comedy fundraiser.  Many patients were able to attend at no cost.  We sent flowers, cards, and balloons to uplift patients.  We called many newly diagnosed patients.  For awareness:  We lit the Alabama State Capitol in teal (the GYN cancer ribbon color) on September 4th.  The lighting ceremony featured patient, physician, advocacy, pastoral, and family speakers; Alabamas First Lady Dianne Bentley proclaiming the day as GYN Cancer Awareness Day in Alabama; and, a band whose family members had been affected by these cancers.  We filled a 56 passenger bus with people from greater Birmingham and Huntsville for the trip.  Other people from around the state joined us at the ceremony.  We designed a tee shirt for this event and partially underwrote the cost of the trip.  We manned an awareness table at several local events and at the four days of the Southern Womens Show.

Alabama Blues Project	http://www.alabamablues.org	205-752-6263	EIN 63-1265205	712 25th Avenue	Northport	AL	35476	USA	Our mission is the preservation of blues music as a traditional and contemporary art form through interactive programs that educate and entertain. With educational programs, live performance, exhibits, and the development of archival and curriculum materials, we increase awareness of the role blues music has played in the development of popular American music, with a special focus on Alabamas contribution to that history. We pass on Alabamas blues culture to children while teaching self-esteem, discipline, cross cultural understanding, interaction, and teamwork.	Our blues camps serve children between the ages of 8-17. While we are open to the entire community, we make a special effort to recruit at-risk children. Our camps are often very diverse. Any school may bring the Alabama Blues Project in for a program. We especially travel to schools in rural areas where funding for arts and music has been cut. Our Alabama blues preservation programs benefit the state for tourism and blues lovers from everywhere!		Blues Camps in the West Alabama are and School Programs nationwide	Educational programs about blues music	Arts & Culture, Arts Education, Children & Youth, Children & Youth Services, Cultural & Ethnic Awareness, Music	The Alabama Blues Project is a non-profit 501(c)3 organization which started in 1995 with a mission to educate the public about the importance of our wonderful Alabama blues heritage. Through programs that educate and entertain, the Alabama Blues Project has grown into an award-winning organization celebrating past and present Alabama blues artists while helping to preserve the rich blues culture of this state.  The late, great, legendary blues man Johnny Shines realized the importance of blues education and often visited schools in the Tuscaloosa, Alabama, area. He became our inspiration for creating the Alabama Blues Project's educational programs. We now present a wide range of blues education programs, workshops, and school residencies across our state and beyond.  These education programs have become part of a wider movement of innovative arts and education programming throughout the country. The ABP is proud to have been the recipient of several awards for its arts programming, including the Druid City Arts Award, the Blues Foundation's "Keeping The Blues Alive" award, and the national "Coming Up Taller" award from the Presidents Committee on the Arts and Humanities.  The importance of the multi-cultural and interdisciplinary character of teaching about the blues cannot be overstated: it is an outstanding way to connect to America's social and musical history. Through a study of the blues, students learn that "black history" is American history, and that the blues is the result of the blending of African and European musical cultures. While learning blues history, students also learn about geography, history, politics, economics, the study of culture, and music appreciation. Lyrics spark history lessons, and songwriting is used to develop creative-writing and critical-thinking skills. The active involvement and sense of achievement gained from engaging in performing arts foster self-esteem and confidence in students. They develop skills in communication and teamwork by participating in the performing arts with fellow students. Because the blues began as an African American art form, students witness a slice of America's cultural heritage and learn to respect the contributions of diverse groups within the fabric of society. The arts should be at the core of any well-rounded curriculum, and at a time when cuts for arts education have become widespread, blues education programs offer a way to bring the arts back into schools in a relevant form.  The blues originated as a uniquely Southern art form, so students of the blues learn about the impact our region has had on modern American musical culture. Our programs emphasize regional artists, which helps to build cultural self-esteem, a sense of history, and a mutual respect between the races. Studying the blues is a perfect way to jump-start students into a deeper appreciation of the music they hear every day by linking it to the roots of American music. Students can then more easily make connections to other forms of music, such as rock and roll, country, and rap, which evolved from the blues. As our unique blues heritage is revealed to us, we can develop a sense of cultural pride in ourselves as Alabamians.  Despite the crucial role the blues has played in the evolution of American music, it is not currently in the mainstream of modern popular music. Like jazz and classical music, the blues is rarely heard on commercial radio, though it can be heard on weekly blues shows thanks mostly to public and university-owned radio stations. It has been many years since a blues song became a Top 40 radio hit, and children rarely have the opportunity to hear blues music performed live. Blues education programs like ours are designed to counter these effects while providing the many benefits outlined above.  The state of Mississippi and cities such as New Orleans, Memphis, and St. Louis, are among the many areas that have celebrated and promoted their unique blues history. Mississippi presents many annual blues festivals throughout the state and actively pursues international blues tourism. There are an increasing number of blues museums across the state which document and celebrate regional blues musicians and blues culture. The University of Mississippi's Center for the Study of Southern Culture publishes the internationally renowned monthly magazine "Living Blues" and is also building an impressive blues archive. A new Mississippi Blues Trail celebrating significant blues sites and contributors to the state's blues music tradition has been launched through the Mississippi Development Authority's Tourism Division Heritage Trails Program and The Mississippi Blues Commission.  In contrast, it seems that Alabama is only beginning to recognize and celebrate its rich blues history. We would like to stimulate and encourage a greater awareness, understanding, and appreciation of Alabama blues throughout the state and beyond so we can help bring attention to the many outstanding Alabama blues men and women who have worked so hard to create this wonderful music.

An independent evaluation by the University of Alabama has shown there is a marked improvement in safe behaviors for those who attend our programs.  Highlights include:  A rigorous evaluation of the program was conducted by the University of Alabama Institute for Social Science Research.  This evaluation was funded by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).   Results indicate Safety Day participation has an effect on safety awareness and behavior in children.  When comparing three-month and one-year follow-up interviews to pre-event responses, there is a significant increase in knowledge and safe behaviors for the participants.  Knowledge scores for each age group in the sample show similar results, regardless of age.  The data also indicate indirect benefits of a Safety Day.  As children and adult volunteers disseminate the information learned, the community as a whole has a stronger sense of safety awareness.  Results also show enhanced community strength and cohesiveness, due to the cooperation of individuals and organizations to achieve a common goal.  A new multi-year evaluation, funded by NIOSH and conducted by the University of Alabama and University of Kentucky, will conclude in 2011.  It also includes an analysis of the benefits of follow up boosters after the Safety Days.

Individual hounds are treated for heartworm if they are positive, as well as other medical challenges that may arise during their examination. After complete medical evaluation and treatment, each dog is placed in a loving foster home until a forever home can be found. The financial survival of BHRA is due solely to adoption fees (which, typically, do not cover vetting costs) and donations from the public. All funds received go strictly to the care and vetting of these precious hounds; no administrative fees are claimed.
