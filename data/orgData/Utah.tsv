Provide a sliding-income-scale spay / neuter / vaccinate program for pets. Conduct an ongoing foster and adoption program at many public locations. Actively and aggressively encourage spaying / neutering of all pets. Provide public education and information regarding the responsibilities of pet ownership. Conduct a feral (non-tame) cat program, tavrm (trap, alter, vaccinate, return, & maintain), including veterinary care and neighbor liaison aid. 					Foster and adoption program: caws placed approximately 675 cats and dogs in adoptive homes during the reporting period. Program includes public adoption events almost every weekend, best practices screening, refundable adoption fee upon request, and requirement that the animal be returned to caws, at any time, if the adoption does not work out. Follow-up contact is made on adoptions. We have taken back animals that have been in adoptive homes for more than 8 years. Expenses include veterinary care, spay/neuter, foster expenses, avid friendchip chips used to identify all caws pets, and boarding of animals when necessary. Revenue is adoption fees.   sliding income voucher program for spay/neuter and veterinary care: caws provides a sliding income scale voucher program for animal spay/neuter procedure through a network of participating veterinarians. Caws volunteers work with requesting pet owners to determine the amount they can contribute. The veterinarians provide a charitable rate, and caws covers the balance. Caws has a similar program for pet owners whose pets need veterinary care, including care for abscesses, dental cleaning, and injuries. Caws requires that the pet be altered, if health allows and the pet is not already altered, as part of the sliding income veterinary program, even if caws must cover that expense. This program also includes help with euthanasia costs if the animal is too injured or ill to be saved.   caws rescue aid: at times people find a stray cat or dog and would like to bring it into their home, but the animal needs significant veterinary care. Caws provides help using a sliding income scale voucher program. Caws requires proof of a good faith effort to find the pet's owner, which includes posting fliers in the area and at local shelters, and having the animal placed at the shelter for the required time. After the noted actions have been taken, caws helps these people with costs that allow them to bring this animal into their family. During 2014, we helped approximately 30 people bring unclaimed animals into their homes, helping them with the costs of spay/neuter, vaccines, blood work for older cats, dental cleaning, and heartworm tests.   feral cat program: provides support for feral cat caregivers, including spay/neuter procedures, veterinary care for illnesses or injuries, vaccines, food, boarding, and euthanasia as humane for ill or injured feral cats.

During 2015-16 we launched our first Research Fellowship Program.  This year we were able to provide five research fellowship awards ranging from $40,000-$60,000, twice what we were able to fund in research the prior year.  This years awards included three named fellowships in memory of courageous individuals whose lives were cut too short by this devastating disease, and one grant in collaboration with the Conquer Cancer Foundation of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. In future years we hope to partner with additional professional associations and charitable foundations to expand our research funding.  Over the past four years, we also have provided over $115,000 to the International Hepatobiliary Neoplasia Biorepository (IHNB) to develop a resource bank of clinical information and biospecimens from persons having or at risk for hepatobiliary cancers, including family members of patients. The IHNBs goal is to create a unique resource to enable future biomarker discovery and validation studies; to partner with researchers from other institutions by sharing biospecimens and data for collaborative research efforts which are critical to advancing the field of cholangiocarcinoma; and to actively enroll fifteen centers into the study by the end of 2015.  Over the past three years we have provided $190,000 to the Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) project. The GWAS is an approach that involves rapidly scanning markers across the complete sets of DNA, or genomes, of many people to find genetic variations associated with a particular disease. Once new genetic associations are identified, researchers can use the information to develop better strategies to detect, treat and prevent the disease. Such studies are particularly useful in finding genetic variations that contribute to common, complex diseases, such as asthma, cancer, diabetes, heart disease and mental illnesses, as well as cholangiocarcinoma. In 2014, we established the International Cholangiocarcinoma Patient Registry (ICPR). The mission of the ICPR is to collect patient information about the incidence and prevalence of cholangiocarcinoma and related disorders. To date, over 450 patients or family members have completed registry profiles. The ICPR will also assist in the screening of appropriate participants for research studies and clinical trials. Ultimately, the goal of the Registry is to assist, accelerate and support research of bile duct cancer into earlier and more comprehensive diagnosis; life-extending therapies and treatments; new and repurposed drug trials; protocols and medications addressing debilitating treatment side-effects; possible end stage complications; and ultimately efforts leading to a cure.  It is the only registry of patient health information solely related to cholangiocarcinoma in the world.  It provides an unprecedented resource of data about family history, risk factors and more to the medical and scientific communities, and patients as well. 	Individuals with bile duct cancer and their families.	Approximately 5,000 people are diagnosed with bile duct cancer in the US each year.  	Based in Salt Lake City, UT, we are the only US nonprofit organization dedicated to funding research and supportive patient and family services for individuals diagnosed with bile duct cancer.	During 2015, we will fund over $300,000 in research. We also will be hosting our 3rd Annual Conference in 2016.  Additionally, we provide a variety of patient services. One such resource is a 136-page book titled 100 Questions and Answers About Biliary Cancer which is offered free upon request in both digital and printed formats. Our informational tri-fold brochure Cholangiocarcinoma is published in four languages, English, Chinese, Japanese and Spanish.  We also have a double-sided page fact-sheet in English that can be used as a poster.  Our twice-yearly newsletter is distributed to over 8,000 email subscribers. We have developed a Biliary Emergency Information Card to address an emergent need to facilitate physician-to-physician communication, assuring prompt and definitive medical treatment in a biliary emergency. Instructions on the card include specific emergency treatment guidelines and a Quick Response (QR) code that medical personnel can scan for additional information and resources. Patients and caregivers can easily download and print the card from the CCF website (http://cholangiocarcinoma.org/biliary-emergency-information-card/) and carry it in their wallets to give to health care providers. This card educates patients on symptoms of a biliary emergency and empowers them to be an active participant in their own care.  Patients and family members are encouraged to call our phone number to speak with our President, Executive Director, or Chief Advocacy Officer who are all available to personally answer questions regarding current treatment options, clinical trials, leading medical institutions/teaching hospitals treating cholangiocarcinoma, and more, as well as to lend and ear and provide emotional support during this difficult time. During 2014, our website received nearly 230,000 hits (4,500 per week) from 112,000 unique users. Users stayed on the page for an average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds, looking at an average of over five pages per visit. Our website provides a wide variety of services to patients and family members including a patient-authored blog, a robust internet discussion board (with over 91,000 posts, 3,400 registered users, and over 13,000 topics of interest), e-publications, and other resources to help patients, families and medical professionals learn about diagnosis, current treatments and the latest research as well as links to organizations offering financial assistance to individuals.  The website also connects users to our social media pages including Facebook (8,300 likes), Twitter (700 followers), as well as Instagram, Linkedin, Vimeo and YouTube.

The poor in developing countries are trapped. They lack education, good nutrition, and a safe place to raise their families. They cope with harsh social, economic, and environmental hardships.  Poverty problems are extensive and complex. Inherited hunger, chronic malnourishment, and stunted growth have negative long-term effects on a childs working capacity and intellectual performance. These serious effects reach far into adulthood. Such nutritional problems are prevalent in developing countries. Illness, disease, ignorance, abuse, and degrading customs are prevalent, too.   Because there is no formal economy, a majority of the populations in developing countries cant find work.

Some express ideas and concerns about important social issues. In addition to studio work students are introduced to local exhibits, galleries and related events. Also as a part of the program, kids set up and present free exhibits of their work at public art centers, galleries, libraries, etc.

The vision of the organization is to build a diverse community of people who are committed to conserving the natural and cultural treasures of the colorado plateau. We will soon build our new campus the canyon country discovery center, a portal to place-based learning about the colorado plateau. We achieve our mission and vision through four education, service, adventure, and conservation programs: 1-the bioregional outdoor education project-a place-based environmental education teacher training program for all k-8 schools on the colorado plateau. 2-canyon country youth corps-an employment, education, and leadership program for primarily navajo youth ages 15-25, who complete public lands service					Bioregional outdoor education project (boep): the long-term goal of boep is to educate a generation of teachers and students about the colorado plateau bioregion and its natural processes through outdoor, place-based,hands-on learning. Boep is doing this by creating permanent science/math/language/culture outdoor education programs in all k8 schools on the colorado plateau. Boep offers a yearlong set of opportunities for teachers (2 years per school) to engage in learning that will improve their understanding of science/math/ language/culture content and teaching skills. From july 2013 to june 30, 2014 boep worked with 11 schools in total: 2 in utah at montezuma creek elementary in montezuma creek, ut, lake powell school at bullfrog, ut; 2 in colorado at ignacio elementary school and southern ute indian montessori academy, in ignacio, co along with southern ute education center and 2 of their roving teachers; 3 in new mexico at ojo amarillo in farmington, nm, mosaic school in aztec, and mesa verde school in farmington nm; and 3 in flagstaff, az at flattstaff junior academy elementary and middle school and eval marshall magnet elementary school. The teacher break down by state is 3 az schools/6 teachers, 3 nm schools/6 teachers, 2 ut schools/2 teachers, 2 co schools and the ute ed center/5 teachers. This is equal to 11 schools total and 19 teachers, plus 206 more teachers were emntored and 1,073 students were impacted. Teachers in az, co, ut, and nm were a mix of native and non-native teachers with a primarily navajo and ute student population, in schools located on or near the navajo or southern ute reservations. The colorado and utah and new mexico schools were primarily an anglo staff with a mix of anglo, native american (ute and navajo), and hispanic students. In the 2013-2014 school year, the regional coordinators completed 307 school visits, 11 district- wide in-services, 16 visits with district personnel or school staff regarding boep, and 13 place-based trainings.   canyon country youth corps in 2014 ccyc operated 8 work crews, providing seasonal employment to 59 youth and accomplishing 74 crew-weeks of work (equivalent to 22,039 person-hours of labor). Ccyc ran one crew in the spring season (approximately mid-march to late june), three youth crews in the summer season (month of july), and four crews in the fall season (beginning august to mid-november). 2014 quick work and education completed stats -21,622 hours of service work on the colorado plateau -1,081 hours of education and training -55 corps members enrolled -248 acres of habitat restoration/improvement -17 miles of trail maintained or restored -72 new water bars built -75 rock stairs installed -1 mile of fencing installed, maintained, or repaired -1. 5 miles of new trail built at canyon country discovery center -28 crewmembers chainsaw trained to us forest service s-212 equivalency -16 fall crewmembers received wilderness first aid certification -4,000 plants planted in riparian areas project work highlights--spring and fall crews river restoration work ccyc participated in two river restoration projects in 2014 on the dolores river at disappointment creek and escalante river near escalante, utah. These projects were both accomplished by fall crews. Work involved the removal of the woody invasive species tamarisk and russian olive from riparian corridors in these watersheds. The dolores and escalante river projects were directed by collaborative partnerships representing many stakeholders (the dolores river restoration partnership and escalante river watershed partnership). These partnerships leverage the skills and abilities of their members to plan restoration activities, using the best available science, securing funding sources to support the work, performing the physical labor, and monitoring and evaluating the results. Ccyc is a founding member of both partnerships, and has been intimately involved in the fundraising, education, outreach, and physical labor in both projects. Ccyc is the pioneering conservation corps for riparian restoration work on the price and san juan rivers. As the land management agencies involved look to expand these two projects in the future, they will base their best practices and protocols off of the experience gained by utilizing our crews on the ground from 2012-2014. Fencing/protection along with the projects above, our crews also worked with local land management agencies to construct several cattle exclosures in selected areas around moab to help monitor cattle grazing impacts on soil and plant life. These exclosures, 2-3 acres in size, were constructed of barbed wire fence and allow the selected areas to re-vegetate free from disturbance. These areas will be studied by moab blm biologists the over the next 10 years, to see how well they recover. Spring crews also finished replacing the fencing around our new campus, the canyon country discovery center. Project work highlights--summer crews natural resource management in san juan and grand county, utah during 2014, ccyc ran three summer crews that hired predominantly local and native american youth. These crews worked in partnership with the local usfs and blm completing trails and fencing projects in the region. Crewmembers had the opportunity to learn about careers in the federal land management agencies, experience resource management work, and build valuable work experience and relationships with local land managers. These crews were the primary vehicle by which ccyc pursues its mission to educate and involve local youth in the land management process, as well as encourage them towards natural resource management careers with better tools and new attitudes towards public lands. Natural resource management and outdoor recreation provide many of the best employment opportunities in the local area, and ccyc aims to assist its local youth participants in taking advantage of those opportunities through these summer crews. During this reporting period, ccyc operated a total of 3 crews (8 members each) in san juan and grand counties. Involvement in these projects allowed ccyc to accomplish: protection of 1 spring near in dark canyon wilderness -construction of new fence near geyser pass in the la sals -1. 5 miles of trail maintained/rehabilitated on burro pass trail in the la sals -5 miles of new trail constructed on the burlifriends trail in the la sals -4 weeks of trail construction at canyon country discovery center monticello, ut  southwest ed-ventures (swed): in 2014 we had a total of 64 participants on 5 trips.

Funds raised through children's miracle network hospitals campaigns and programs are unusual for two key reasons:1. Funds stay in the community where they are donated; and2. Hospitals receive the funds as unrestricted, meaning they can use donations however they see fit, hospitals assess their current and future needs to determine where help is needed most. Funds are most commonly used for equipment purchases, research, charitable care and education. The children's miracle network hospitals donation structure providescontributors with the assurance their donations help kids in the localcommunity for the most pressing needs. In 2014, the combined efforts of children's miracle network hospitalsand its partners raised more than $337 million to help kids at memberhospitals. Children's miracle network hospitals donations aredistributed as discretionary funds to each hospital, allowing them toaddress the most critical children's healthcare needs in theirrespective communities. Each year, the 170 member hospitals of children's miracle networkhospitals provide medical care to more than 10 million children throughmore than 32 million patient visits for cancer, heart problems, birthdefects, cystic fibrosis, diabetes, muscular dystrophy and many otherserious illnesses and injuries. The list of what children's miracle network hospitals funds havepurchased is exhaustive, but the following examples are just a few waysdonations have made an impact in communities throughout north america:medical equipmentfrom premature infants to growing teenagers, children's hospitalsprovide the vast majority of highly specialized care for children withcomplex and rare conditions, in addition to routine and emergencycases. All equipment must be customized to kids of every age and size,greatly multiplying the expenses incurred at children's hospitals. Facilities and equipment that children's miracle network hospitals funds have provided includes:st. Louis children's hospitalcmn hospital's fundraising supports the child health outreach efforts of st. Louis children's hospital through their healthy kids express, mobile pediatric units that provide health care services for children in underserved communities. Funds also support child life services, music therapy, art therapy and school programs. Cmn hospitals helps local kids at ssm cardinal glennon children's medical center by supporting the bob costas cancer center, dana brown neonatal intensive care unit and the knights of columbus development center. Cmn hospitals fundraising supports the child life program at children's hospital erlanger which is integral to providing the specialized, family centered care our patients need. Cmn hospitals funds have also enabled the renovation of all 49 inpatient rooms at children's hospital at erlanger. Cmn hospitals fundraising supports expansion of our services to children in a 30,000 square mile radius currently underserved. We are expanding outreach of subspecialists by taking providers and services closer to patients in their own communities. Researchresearch efforts at children's hospitals have led to new discoveriesand deeper understanding of pediatric illnesses and injuries, which areswiftly translated into advances in clinical practice and betteroutcomes for patients. The children's discovery institute, a partnership between st. Louis children's hospital and washington university school of medicine, will accelerate cures for the most life-threatening diseases of childhood through collaborative and interdisciplinary research.   children's miracle network hospitals has cultivated relationships witha wide range of national corporate and media partners to createawareness of the needs of children's hospitals and public educationprograms. National public awareness is generated through radio andtelevision programming, often focusing on the stories of children andtheir families who have experienced serious illnesses or injuries andwere cared for at a local children's hospital. Key children's miracle network hospital public education and awarenesscampaigns in 2014 include:-children's miracle network hospitals telethons;-children's miracle network hospitals radiothons;-children's miracle network hospitals champions program, where onechild from each state is selected to serve as an ambassador, meetingwith media, congressional representatives and others to share theimportant work of children's hospitals;-children's hospitals heroes segments produced by fox owned & operatedstations;-community event outreach from the hundreds of miss americaorganization titleholders who serve as ambassadors for children'smiracle network hospitals, the official charity platform of theorganization; and-out-of-home advertisements through the ooh for good program that call attention to charitable needs of children's hospitals. Children helped in 2014more than 10 million kids are treated at member hospitals every year. A few examples of patients who have benefited from children's miracle network hospitals funds:kenzie may be tiny, but she is mighty. Just after turning 1, kenzie suddenly collapsed, paralyzed. Her spinal cord was swollen, putting pressure on her vertebrae and skull. Surgery relieved the pressure so kenzie could move again and doctors concluded she had achondroplasia, also known as disproportionate dwarfism. Kenzie has had no serious problems since that surgery, and doesn't allow her short stature to limit what she can do. In fact, she wants to do everything: sing, dance, play with her dolls, help cook and feed the family's rabbits, cats, dogs and horses. She is simply a little person living in a big person's world. While her size and doll-like features turn heads, her family uses others' curiosities as an opportunity to educate them on her condition and all she has overcome. As for the energetic kenzie, nothing holds her back. "i do it myself," she insists. Cmn hospitals funds support a variety of pediatric specialists, including those who treated and diagnosed kenzie. Sept. 20, 2014 is a day taylor's family won't soon forget. While driving home from a visit to grandma's, a deer appeared in the headlights and they swerved, hitting a utility pole. Everyone was startled but appeared unharmed. Taylor, then age 5, began coughing and said his stomach hurt so, as a precaution, he was transported to the hospital. His intestinal injuries were so severe that the surgeon summoned his family to say goodbye. Just then, taylor's heartbeat returned and he was stabilized. The next few weeks were touch and go as he had multiple surgeries, but taylor's internal organs miraculously began showing signs of healing. Taylor now has scars and subsequent issues that will keep him returning to the hospital for the rest of his life, but all signs point to him being active again soon. He's enjoyed keeping up with his schoolwork - especially math - and can't wait to get back on the basketball court and soccer field. State-of-the-art operation room technologies, a pediatric radiology program and child life services made possible by cmn hospitals donations saved and improved taylor's life after a car accident. Deonc loves clothes, shoes and fashion shows as much as any girl her age, but she's not just any girl. She refers to herself as "mommy's special, smart girl. " deonc was born with jarcho-levin syndrome, a rare genetic disorder with fewer than 120 cases reported since 1938. Most children with this condition never make it past their second birthday because their chest cavity is too small to accommodate growing lungs. Despite her initial prognosis, deonc continues to defy the odds and is paving the way for other children born with this condition in the future. She now attends a mainstream elementary school and although she has a long road ahead of her, doctors hope that one day she no longer will need a ventilator. They are certain she will live life to the fullest because she never lets anything stop her. Cmn hospitals donations helped cover deonc's medical expenses after her father lost his job and along with it, the family's health insurance coverage. About the networkas an umbrella organization for 170 children's hospitals, children's miracle network hospitals provides comprehensive education, support, information and resources to its network for raising funds, creating awareness and public education programs for children's healthcare needs and the important work of the hospitals caring for them. To join the network, a hospital signs a membership agreement and is provided with an annual education conference; regional conferences, monthly national conference calls; online education, information and networking tools; publications, training and program content for radio and television sponsors; and training support for affiliates in national programs as appropriate and necessary to achieve the organization's purposes.

Since 1973, The Association has worked tirelessly to enhance communication with the community, assuring people living with epilepsy no longer have to live in fear that: their seizures will be joked about, they will be discriminated against and/or they are the only ones with the condition. Currently, 106,000 people in Utah have a diagnosis of epilepsy and, it is estimated, this number will increase significantly as the population ages.  Epilepsy is, simply put, an electrical disruption in the brain. 1 in 10 people will have a seizure in their lifetime and 1 in 26 (1) will be officially diagnosed with epilepsy.  It is the third most common neurological condition behind Alzheimers and Stroke. Its prevalence is greater than cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis and Parkinsons disease combined (2). The earliest recorded mention of epilepsy dates back to 1067 BC to a Babylonian tablet of medicine (3) housed in the British Museum. It is a condition as old as man himself.  The Association holds several fundraisers, an educational conference, support groups, a camp for teens with epilepsy, Seizure Smart complimentary training, and many other events to help raise awareness throughout the year.
