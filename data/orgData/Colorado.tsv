WRV volunteers have completed over 766 stewardship projects and more than 18 leadership development trainings. The events involved over 4,432 volunteer leadership roles, 34,163 volunteer attendances, 3,129 trainees, and the in-kind contribution of $8.3 million in labor and expertise to Colorados natural heritage.    WRV volunteers helped repair trails and stabilize streambanks and watersheds from the devastating floods of 2013, the Fourmile Canyon Fire, and the High Park Fire, thus protecting homes and lives from repeat flooding and mudslides in the Big Thompson and St. Vrain watersheds. Streambank and watershed stabilization also reduced the introduction of costly new noxious weed populations, protected water quality, and stopped or slowed rapid erosion.  At a wide variety of sites, from urban greenways to ranching easements on the plains, to high alpine areas which were eroded by over-recreation, volunteers planted over 300,000 native plants and trees. The benefits include rebuilding topsoil; preventing erosion; improving water quality; providing shade to residents and recreationists; improving wildlife habitat; stopping or reversing establishment of noxious weeds, which are expensive to treat and damage crop value for nearby producers; and even improving the view.  Working with land managers, WRV volunteers have closed and re-vegetated over 163,489 ft of habitat-fragmenting closed/unused roads. This effort helped restore water quality (dirt roads dump sediment into streams during runoff, hurting fish and municipal water filtration equipment), wildlife populations (roads provide easy access to poachers and predators, an unfair advantage that reduces survival rates), and rural residents who sustainably hunt or enjoy wildlife watching as part of their quality of life.  WRV volunteers have restored over 58.8 acres of wetland across multiple counties. Because wetlands are foundational to our water resources in this arid region, and are vital to the health of our communities and waterways, volunteer efforts helped support wetlands crucial functions, such as: the trapping of floodwaters, recharging groundwater, removing pollution, feeding downstream waterways, and driving the economy due to their provision of fish and wildlife habitat.  Time spent in nature provides demonstrated mental health benefits, especially for children. WRVs volunteer efforts and Youth & Inclusiveness Program have helped Colorado children both individually and generally, by maintaining open space and trails where they can explore the outdoors, and by helping educate them and introduce them to these areas individually to help create healthy, responsible, active habits to last a lifetime. WRV volunteers have completed over 45.6 mi. of trail work, supporting recreational outlets and healthy commuting options, and provided over 2,533 hrs of youth stewardship education to diverse youth.

After exploring several possibilities, Rayburn decided that the best setting for the proclamation of the Gospel was at a Young Life club, held in the home of one of the kids. Club involved lively singing, a skit and a short talk about Jesus Christ. He believed every kid had a right to hear the message of Jesus Christ and decide how to respond to the Gospel. Young Life leaders provide kids with factual information for making good decisions. Leaders work hard to provide teenagers with the basic facts concerning Jesus Christ. The information is presented in a non-threatening manner in terms that kids can understand.Young Life leaders have the highest regards and respect for a young person's right to choose where matters of faith are concerned.		middle school and high school kids and college students.		all 50 states of the U.S. and in over 100 countries internationally.	Young Life's efforts to reach out to every kid, everywhere have resulted in a number of specific ministries. Each of these apply the basics of Young Life to meet kids just as they are through friendship and faith. In alphabetical order our specific ministries are: Capernaum: Young Life's ministry to kids with disabilities, named after the town where Jesus performed many miracles. College: Young Life's outreach to college students both in the U.S. and internationally. International: Young Life's outreach to high school and middle school kids in more than 100 countries around the world. Small Town/Rural: Young Life's ministry to kids in one-high-school towns of fewer than 25,000 people. Urban: Young Life's minsistry to racial and ethnic minorities, focused on kids who live in high-density communities and who are historically, socially and/or economically disadvantaged. WyldLife: Young Life's ministry to middle school kids. YoungLives: Young Life's ministry to teenage moms. Young Life provides healthy, creative fun. From weekly clubs to seasonal camping experiences to daily outings with leaders, Young Life is known around the world as an organization that knows how to have fun. Club meets once a week and has been described as "controlled chaos." Leaders combine songs, humor, and group interaction to create an hour of energetic fun where kids can express that teenage tendency to push the limits-but within the controlled context of a safe environment. Campaigners is the name for Young Life's Bible study program. Kids often meet in small groups with a Young Life leader during the week to discuss their ideas and question about faith and begin exploring the Bible. These groups were named from a term we've kept around since Young Life was called "The Young Life Campaign" in the early '40s. Camping is one of Young Life's specialties. Kids can discover adventure and prove their prowess by climbing through a ropes course in the tops of trees, barreling down a water slide from hundreds of feet up the side of a mountain, riding horseback along scenic trails, water skiing, parasailing, racing go-carts around muddy tracks and enjoying what Young Life leaders promise to be one of the best weeks of their lives.

From our beginnings as a small food pantry and thrift shop in 1984, we have grown to become a comprehensive human services agency serving the Tri-Lakes region of Colorado.

The Nurse-Family Partnership program is based on the pioneering work of Dr. David Olds. In the Nurse-Family Partnership (NFP) program, a registered nurse provides a first-time mom living in poverty with home visits throughout pregnancy until the childs second birthday.  The NFP nurse becomes a trusted resource to help the young mother have a healthy pregnancy, improve her childs health and development, and achieve economic self-sufficiency for her family.   There is more than 30 years of proven evidence from randomized, controlled trials  the most rigorous research method for measuring the effectiveness of an intervention.      The following outcomes have been observed among participants in at least one of the trials of the program:  -Improved health and development: 48% reduction in child abuse and neglect.   -Improved pregnancy outcomes: 79% reduction in preterm delivery for women who smoke, and reductions in high-risk pregnancies as a result of greater intervals between first and subsequent births.  -Reduction in juvenile crime: 59% reduction in child arrests at age 15.  -Increase in children's school readiness: 67% reduction in behavioral/intellectual problems at age six.  -Increased economic self-sufficiency: 83% increase in labor force participation by the mother by the childs fourth birthday.    NFP continues to measure the programs effectiveness of each program by collecting data on the outcomes achieved by the moms enrolled in the program.  These outcomes are tracked to ensure local delivery of the Nurse-Family Partnership is making a measurable difference in the lives of the families we serve.   Its a true high-impact investment -- not only for the mom, but for her child and the community.  Independent research shows a communitys return-on-investment can be over five dollars for every dollar invested in Nurse-Family Partnership.  The research is clear -- investing early in a childs health through Nurse-Family Partnership improves the childs development and opportunities for success later in life.

Our partners' gifts accomplished so much for orphans in 2010. Here is just a brief list of how God used their gifts:  	Over 2,000 children sponsored with more than 3,500 registered to our programs 	Nearly 1,000 volunteers visited their children this year on mission trips 	Clean water for 22 CarePoints and 6,000 children in Uganda and Swaziland 	Over 550 tons of food and meals for 3,180 children in Swaziland 	Shoes and school uniforms for hundreds of children in Ethiopia, Uganda, and Swaziland 	Protection for 400 children at Ministry Centers in Russia for girls at-risk for prostitution 	Christian discipleship for well over 10,000 children in 9 countries 	Opening of new projects in India, Haiti, Guatemala, Moldova, and South Africa.	We serve the poorest and most vulnerable orphans and children by connecting communities of U.S. Christians (churches, businesses, social networks, etc.) to long-term, community-centered orphan ministry opportunities.	10,000		HopeChest programs focus on empowering every child in our care to survive, thrive, and succeed within their home culture.   -	SURVIVE: Stabilizing vulnerable orphan communities HopeChest supports  CarePoints in three African countries. A CarePoint provides every child with 1-2 meals per day at least 5 times per week. We serve an estimated 40,000 meals per week to approximately 6,000 children. HopeChest provides each CarePoint with a development plan to include projects such as well drilling, kitchen construction, new school classrooms, water purification and storage systems, and medical clinics. Long-term plans include helping the community develop self-sufficiency through livestock programs and agricultural development.  HopeChest delivers ministry through a combination of indigenous, local Christian leaders and U.S. supporters and volunteers. God desires every orphan to know Him as God the Father. All evangelism and discipleship activities unfold within the context of long-term relationships that focus on modeling the love of Christ in action. All CarePoints receive regular discipleship visits that are reaching over 6,000 children on an annual basis. Funding from HopeChest supports a network disciplers who are committed to forging long-term relationships with orphans and role model a healthy Christian lifestyle to the children. These individuals are trained by  HopeChest, and equipped to teach basic character education rooted in biblical principles. Through authentic relationships, supported by the foundation of regular and nutritious food, children learn to trust our ministry staff and begin the process of transitioning toward adulthood.  -	THRIVE: Advancing Education Once the communitys  basic needs are addressed, HopeChest introduces education and basic healthcare initiatives. At this stage, a strong emphasis is placed upon education. According to data provided by UNAIDS, the longer a girl in Swaziland stays in school, the less likely she is to have sex before age 18.  Girls who make it to university or "tertiary" education have less than 20% likelihood of having their first sexual encounter before age 18. For girls with no education: over 80%. 4 in 5 girls with no education are exposed to sex before age 18. Sadly, nearly 2-in-5 girls with no education will have sex before age 15. In a country with a 26% HIV rate, when you have sex and who you have it with is a very big deal.   Education is one of our tools in preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS through sexual contact at a  young age.   At this phase, HopeChest is active in funding school fees for books, uniforms, report cards, and other expenses required of students. Because these children have no family resources to pay these fees, many cannot attend school. Some will work to earn money for food and water.   -	SUCCEED: Releasing them into the world as full, whole, and healthy adults Through education, life-skills training, and transitional living services, HopeChest helps children make the complex transition from orphaned child to whole adult. The most mature set of these programs exists within our Russia ministry, which has been operating continuously since 1994. In that time, HopeChest has developed internationally recognized transitional living and orphan support programs for older children.   Briefly, these programs are designed to reduce the prevalent at-risk behaviors seen specifically amongst Russian orphans. Those would include criminal activity, drug/alcohol addiction, lack of school attendance, unemployment, or abandonment of their own children. Here are just some of our outcomes compared to national data on Russian orphans:   	85% reduction in criminal activity 	76% drop in drug & alcohol addiction 	75% rise in college enrollment  	0.7% unemployment (vs. 15% nationally)   Right now, over 400 children are being helped through their rough transition from orphaned child to independent young adult. Including 45 young women who have demonstrated a 96% decrease in pregnant orphans abandoning their children to become orphans.    Compared to national averages, the children enrolled in the HopeChest programs are faring much better on all measures. This support is delivered through the following programs:  Ministry Centers Ministry Centers provide daily activities focused on building community, trust, and healthy relationships. In addition to providing unstructured time, the centers provide group and individual counseling, seminars on relevant topics, computer skill labs, and other camps and trainings for orphans. HopeChest operates four Ministry Centers, with a fifth planned for 2011.  Transitional Living Programs Independent Living and Family Center Programs offer safe and secure housing to older orphans. In Family Centers, children live in group-home settings for 3-5 years as they finish their college education. The Independent Living Program offers young adults the opportunity to live in an apartment and receive weekly supervision and counseling from HopeChest staff as they establish themselves in their first real jobs.  Young Mothers Program The Young Mothers Program reaches pregnant orphans with the resources they need to keep their babies and start a family of their own. Over 1/3 of children born to orphan in Russia will become orphans themselves, and the Young Mothers Program aims to break that cycle.  This program has resulted in a 96 percent decrease in child abandonment within our program.  Jobs for Life Jobs for Life is new program providing job skills training to young adults in Russia and pairing them with businesses willing to hire on orphans. HopeChest provides the training needed to increase the potential employees value and lower training costs for the hiring employer.

We support, educate and advocate.	2009 Milestones  On January 1, the Terminal Patients Right to Know End-of-Life Options Act, AB 2747 (Berg-Levine) goes into effect in California. Read more about the Terminal Patients Right to Know End-of-Life Options Act here.  Compassion & Choices calls on the Obama Administration to repeal last-minute regulations allowing denial of medical services based on health care worker religious beliefs.  On March 5, Washingtons Death with Dignity Act begins implementation.  As the health insurance reform debate heats up in Washington and around the country, Compassion & Choices aggressively responds to mis-information campaign launched by opponents of end-of-life choice to undermine a key provision of health insurance reform. Recent action and statements indicate the end-of-life consultation provision may survive in a final health care bill. Read more about end-of-life choices in health insurance reform here.  On October 7, Compassion & Choices Legal Director, Kathryn Tucker, files suit in Connecticut on behalf of two Connecticut physicians, Gary Blick and Ron Levine, asserting that the Connecticut statute which makes a crime of assisting someone to commit suicide does not reach the conduct of a physician providing aid in dying. Read more about Blick at al v. Connecticut here.  On October 29th, Congressman Earl Blumenauer of Oregon stood with leaders of the House of Representatives as they unveiled House Resolution 3200, Section 1233, the Life Sustaining Treatment Preferences Act of 2009 that would provide coverage under the Medicare Program for consultations regarding POLST.  Senator Jay Rockefeller champions end-of-life care in his in his report to the Senate Finance Committee's health care reform legislation. Compassion & Choices continues work to assure end-of-life choice remains a key component of final health insurance reform package.  On October 13-14, Compassion & Choices hosts Dignity & Choices, A Symposium on End-of-Life Advocacy in Washington, DC. Two days of discussion, exploration and study, Dignity & Choices provides an opportunity to promote principles and practices that focus on patients. Physicians, social workers, nurses, attorneys and advocates for end-of-life choice filled the National Press Club to hear aspects of end-of-life care rarely discussed and illuminate the way forward. Watch video highlights from Dignity & Choices here.  On December 31, the Montana Supreme Court ruled in favor of the landmark case brought by Compassion & Choices (Baxter v. Montana) affirming that it is not against public policy of the state of Montana for a physician to provide aid in dying to a mentally competent, terminally ill individual. Read more about Baxter v. Montana here.  2010 Milestones  The Older Womens League (OWL) devotes its 30th anniversary Mothers Day Report to end-of-life choices and hosts a Capitol Hill policy briefing on the issue. The report features a piece, Aid in Dying: A Matter of Elder Justice and Civil Rights, by Kathryn Tucker, Compassion & Choices Director of Legal Affairs.  On June 2 Blick et al v. Connecticut is dismissed without reaching the merits, on sovereign immunity grounds, denying plaintiffs the opportunity to make their case to distinguish committing suicide from a mentally competent terminally ill patient ingesting medications to bring about a peaceful death.  New York passes the Palliative Care Information Act (PCIA) in August. The law, drafted by Compassion & Choices and modeled after a similar measure in CA, requires healthcare workers to provide information and counseling on end-of-life options..  Compassion & Choices files the groundbreaking lawsuit Hargett v. Vitas seeking accountability for the unnecessarily painful death of 43-year-old mother of three, Michelle Hargett-Beebee, who was never informed of the availability of palliative sedation. This is the first case in the nation to allege that failure to tell a patient about palliative sedation falls outside the standard of care.  2011 Milestones  Legislative opponents introduced SB 116 in Montana, to nullify the Montana Supreme Courts landmark ruling in Baxter v Montana, a case litigated by Compassion & Choices. The Montana Medical Association testified in official opposition to the measure. On February 16 the Montana Senate Judiciary Committee declined to adopt this measure, preserving the option of aid in dying for Montanans.  A bill amending Washingtons Death with Dignity Act, SB 5378, fails to pass out of committee, in response to Compassion & Choices proactive efforts and voter support. SB5378 would have amended the section of DWDA specifying deaths under the Act do not constitute suicide.     Compassion & Choices launches successful public campaign throughout Oregon to defeat HB 2016, a bill requiring all terminally ill patients who request aid in dying to undergo psychiatric evaluation.  The Oregon House HealthCare Committee holds no hearing or work session on HB 2016.			Nationwide

Nationally, TWP is actively involved with helping to improve the lives of Native American families living on the reservations of the Great Plains. There, where the winters are extremely long and harsh, Native Americans commonly spend more than half of their income on their exorbitant utility bills. Together with our reservation-based partner, we have built 850 economic solar heating systems, saving tribal families 20-30% on their annual heating bills, and trained more than 175 tribal members in residential and facility-scale renewable energy applications. We have also planted trees and shrubs around the home sites for more than 160 additional families, further lowering heating costs and associated emissions by acting as an important wind blocks during the frigid winter and providing much-needed shade during the sweltering summer.   Internationally, TWP works extensively in Central America and Haiti. Together, with our country-based partners, we support 8 community tree nurseries that produce over 650,000 trees annually to aid in reforestation efforts, planting over 4.3 million trees to date. We have built 47,800 clean cookstoves. Each cookstove decreases a familys need for firewood by 50-70%, as compared to standard open fire cooking, and reduces carbon emissions by at least 1.5 tons per year. When vented to the outside of the home, these improved cookstoves also decrease indoor air pollution, which is responsible for the death of 1.9 million women and children globally every year.	low-income, rural and peri-urban communities in Central America, Haiti and on Native American Reservations in the U.S.		Latin America and U.S. Native American Reservations	Clean Cookstoves Program, Reforestation Program, Solar Energy Program, Tribal Renewable Energy Program

Bottle schools are schools built using eco-bricks: plastic bottles stuffed with inorganic trash. Entire communities come together to build more sustainable educational infrastructure for their future.  Hug It Forward also strives to raise awareness in developed countries about trash, consumption and the power of community. This mission is equally important to us as facilitating the construction of bottle schools in developing countries.	As of February, 2015  communities have completed 51 successful bottle school projects, at an average cost of $6,500 per classroom. In May 2012 we completed our first project outside Guatemala, in El Salvador.	Bottle schools provide children with a sense that they have the ability to shape their future and their world and helps them to think outside of the usual constraints of an impoverished lifestyle. Building a bottle school gives a community the confidence to choose and shape its own future.	in 2014, 19 communities realized the dream of a safe, clean and comfortable school for generations to come	Central America	Bottle school construction. In 2014, hug it forward facilitated the construction of 17 schools in guatemala. Due to the method of construction, these schools are known as "bottle schools". Bottle schools are schools built using post-and-beam construction, with concrete columns and beams reinforced with rebar. The walls are filled with "eco-bricks" as insulation, made from plastic bottles stuffed with inorganic trash. Entire communities come together to build a more sustainable educational infrastructure that replaces dilapidated, unsafe and dangerously overcrowded schoolrooms, which are often made from adobe, corrugated metal, or cornstalks, with dirt floors. Before hug it forward issues any funding for materials, the community has to show full commitment to the project by collecting all of the 7-10,000 plastic bottles required for their new 2-3 classroom bottle school, and stuffing them with inorganic trash from their immediate environment. Teachers and village leaders are responsible for organizing the process of bottle collection and overseeing the volunteering of labor. The local municipality contributes by paying for skilled labor, and the ministry of education pays for all teachers, ensuring that these institutions also have ownership in a sustainable project.   environmental education program. In conjunction with bottle school projects, hug it forward facilitates an environmental education program for youth, working with all the communities that participate in a bottle school project. The program directly impacted 958 students in 8 communities in 2014. Children collect inorganic trash and create the "eco-bricks" that are needed to build a bottle school. They build their school with their own hands, giving them real ownership and pride in the realization of the project. Environmental education is an essential part of the bottle school process, ensuring that the project's impact will be sustainable and that communities remain free of trash long into the future. Through the environmental education program, children learn to understand the difference between organic and inorganic trash, along with the major risks of plastic pollution in their environment and in the world. The intention is to leave a lasting impact, helping to grow awareness of environmental sustainability for future generations.

(A4T), is an international registered non-profit organization dedicated to the capacity building of Afghan people through its programs in Afghanistan.  Our concentration is in improving the capacity of those we serve in our sustainable education, health, vocational training and agriculture programs to become self sufficient and contribute to the economy of their families and country.					Elementary and secondary education:1) a4t girls home schools (sheik yassin, wardak province), a4t is the first organization providing education for girls in sheik yassin, wardak province. Students come from different villages to attend school in the five home schools which follow the curriculum of the ministry of education. In 2013 a4t provided elementary education to 222 girls students in grades 1 to 8. The school principal and two teachers helped the school in the afternoon. After receiving approval from the local shura (community council), the 9th grade was added in 2014 taught by an elder male teacher from the boys' school, which was the only solution for these girls due to lack of female teachers at that grade level. The principal and two female teachers continue teaching 7th and 8th grades. A council of school principals in wardak province held meetings with the a4t principal, who also comes to kabul twice in a month to discuss improving their schools. A4t planned and monitored a 2-month teacher-training program for five home school teachers in early 2013, when schools are closed for winter. The program, held at 'farda-e-afghanan' school in kabul, was funded by the 'rebuilding afghanistan foundation' nonprofit. The main objective of this program is to build the capacity of teachers. Courses included: improvement on teaching skills and methodology, academic classes, rules and students' personality genesis (personality of children). 2) since a4t transferred, on june 1, 2012, its school in kabul to a new school, the farda-e-afghanan ('tomorrow's afghans') private school, a4t has continued in a supporting role for the poorest of students to supplement tuition payments. Tuition support was provided for 73 poor female students in 2013, who had been part of its earlier accelerated program. This program was funded in the first half of 2013 by a grant from the zakat foundation of america, and from an anonymous donor in the second half of the year. This donor also supported the school's 4th annual science fair. It was held november 3, 2013 and it is one of the best programs at the school. The fair's three winning teams were part of the tuition support program, (and former a4t students). 3) the dudley family grant program (stipend for university and community college students): this program is funded by henry and margy dudley. Since it began in april 2011, 33 qualified afghan women students from different provinces (from very poor families) have received a small stipend for their higher education needs at different private and government schools, community colleges and universities. This will enable them to have better job opportunities. Of the 33 students, 22 have graduated from their programs. Most are supporting themselves working in ngo's, private schools, private hospitals and other companies. A4t was supporting 14 students in this program at the beginning of 2013. Then from august on, a4t supported 11 students, as two of them graduated and one was absent. Funding continues and the program has expanded in 2014.   the abdullah omar health post in shiek yassin, chak district, wardak province:in 2013 a4t provided 6,233 patients of all ages, in 15-25 villages in the district, with checkups, health care information, medical treatment by doctors and medicines. Services included 1,551 vaccinations for women and children and midwife services for women and newborns. Our midwife treated 1,053 patients, in our private midwife facility next to the health post, where 28 babies were delivered during 2013. A small fee is charged for services and medicines, except for the poor who can't pay. Funding of this program in 2013 was from individual donors.   agriculture and vocational training programs: george washington university financed a specialized water/environment advocacy program, using technology and other forums, culminating in personal attendance at the bishkek, tajikistan conference (28th sept to 2nd oct. 2013). The a4t country director and 4 afghan women, selected for their provincial environmental experience, were the first ever representatives from the organization's office in kabul, to attend an international conference. Funding continues and the team will participate in another conference in 2014.   a4t's offices are on the first floor of the same building as the guesthouse, which is on the second floor. This includes the offices of the country director who oversees all a4t programs and the staff working in the building including: director of operations admin /hrmanager, finance manager, guest house manager/logistics manager and a cook, cleaner and guard. The office is used for weekly meetings between the office managers and guesthouse staff, monthly meetings of all the stream managers of the projects, monthly meetings with the advisory committee, for interviewing candidates for staff positions or for one of the projects, for preparing all the forms, paperwork and taxes required by the afghan government of the projects or guesthouse, reviewing project proposals, preparing the annual budget for theorganization and a monthly revenue and expense report for all operations for the board, writing a monthly activity report with photos of all projects and office and guesthouse activities, preparing other financial reports and analysis about projects for large donors of ourprojects, writing grant proposals/applications for funding projects, working with a4t volunteers, storing and preparing supplies for our projects, preparing the tax worksheets with the board treasurer for the irs form 990, conference calls with board members and/or affiliateorganizations we work with, meeting with tour groups and volunteers staying at the guesthouse about a4t programs and needs; solving many challenges facing our organization daily, etc. A4t guesthouse is used by: a4t staff who operate our programs, our organization's board members traveling to kabul to oversee our projects, a4t volunteers, by our staff for teacher training, capacitytraining of staff, capacity training for water project, by academics on a graduate school program, journalists, and by volunteers in humanitarian projects supported by orparallel to our mission.

Hoping to see a time when no individual is struggling to have basic necessities and there is no fear in seeking out help. What We Want To See Change     It is our biggest wish and highest aspiration to provoke a younger audience to support and help the less fortunate. Through that we want to promote awareness about this pressing issue. Also, the three of us coming from fortunate families see how crucial it is to help the less fortunate. As we discussed the steps to this project, we all agreed that no individual should live without being clean and healthy. It should be a right, in our opinion, to be able to brush your teeth along with being able to put a bandage on a wound.  If a society cannot help the many that are poor, it cannot save the few who are rich JFK. We believe that the power of youth is strong and important. And we ask for support from any individual so that we may help someone in need.      We all are different, we all make mistakes, we all are human. The street is not a place to live for anybody, and that is one of the main reasons we started this organization. We want to help, but we need your help and support.

We provide life-saving options to a wide variety of abused, abandoned, or neglected animals that have nowhere else to turn. Our outreach in the community, through adoption events and humane education, aims to increase awareness of our relationship with and responsibility to the animals that share our world. Volunteers at the sanctuary get valuable hands-on experience in the growing field of animal welfare along with sustainable living practices. Not only do they make a difference in the lives of the animals they help, but they are also making a positive contribution to their community by donating	The sanctuary began with 25 animals on 15 acres with minimal facilities and a few volunteers. There were no large benefactors that started this organization, it has grown over the last three  years through very hard work and hands on daily chores, sometimes lasting late into the evening. Thanks to a very dedicated group of volunteers who stayed with us through a very rough beginning, our sanctuary is now situated on 640 acres and includes a small barn in need of repair, a quonset building for machinery, a small garage, 600 square foot house, and pasture, and we are caring for more than 150 animals on a daily basis. Denkai has in the past actively operated using sustainable energies. Denkai has doubled its income in the past year, largely through our website. Individuals who have heard about our organization can log onto our website to learn more about our efforts, and can easily make monetary donations through Network for Good.   Approximately 90% of our donors have never physically visited the sanctuary, and have learned about us by visiting our website, via media exposure or through public outreach activities.  The newest acquisition is the adoption center located near Greeley, CO which enables the large populations of surrounding areas to have ready access to approximately 70 adoptable animals.  Since 2005, Denkai has provided rescue, rehabilitation and permanent sanctuary to over 1000 animals.  The Sanctuary has offered educational programs to area schools such as the Fort  Collins Lab School and Meeker Elementary School.      Denkai has responded and provided relief to national emergency situations such as the CA wildfires and hurricane Katrina.  Denkai responded to a horse slaughter plant in Dekalb, IL and rescued horses right off the kill line as the plant was closed due to newly implemented restrictions banning the slaughter of horses in the US.	Active adults between 18 and 70 years young nation-wide.  Youth Groups ages 6 -18 in the Rocky Mountain Region.	Denkai Animal Sanctuary is unique in that it aims to provide a combination of services for animals in need, atrisk youth, and environmental awareness.    This will be accomplished through hands on educational opportunities.	Denkai has helped several regions of the US including CA and the victims of hurricanes in the coastal regions of the south.	I.    Current services offered through the Sanctuary include: A.    Adopt common companion animals, namely dogs and cats, to suitable homes, as well as adoption of other animals including horses, pot-bellied pigs, and other adoptable livestock. We define "adoptable" as: Dogs and cats that are eight weeks of age or older and livestock that are one year of age or older that at or subsequent to the time the animal is impounded or otherwise taken into possession, have manifested no sign of a behavioral or temperamental defect that could pose a health or safety risk or otherwise make the animal unsuitable for placement as a pet. The animals are adoptable if they have no signs of disease, injury, or congenital or hereditary condition that adversely affects the health of the animal or that is likely to adversely affect the animals health in the future. Healthy/adoptable animals may be old, deaf, blind, disfigured or disabled.  B.    Provide a permanent sanctuary for animals that are deemed as non-adoptable. Non-adoptable animals are defined as any animal that does not fit into the definition above. C.    Provide education and outreach on proper animal care to current and potential animal owners.   D.    Assist law enforcement in investigating and prosecuting cases of animal neglect and/or other abuse. E.    Provide volunteer opportunities for the young and old in the local and national community.  We are especially focused on reaching at-risk youth and serving as an approved site for court-ordered community service hour projects.

The cloud foundation executive director, ginger kathrens, is regularly invited to speak at national and international meetings and conferences advocating the preservation of wild horses and burros. The foundation has been featured on abc, nbc, cnn, and pbs, educating a national audience about the need to preserve wild horses and burros. Tcf attends bureau of land management (blm) national meetings regarding the management of wild horses and burros. Kathrens and other tcf board members give public comment on the need to reform the management of wild horses and burros both on the range and in captivity. Tcf comments on all environmental assessments, which deal with the planned removal of wild horses and burros from public lands. Tcf director kathrens writes articles for national and international publications on the issue. Tcf speaks at schools, creates educational materials, and produces educational videos and still presentations regarding wild horses and burros. Tcf collaborates with other organizations to promote the protection of wild horses and burros.   since its inception (2005) tcf has directly rescued dozens of mustangs that were bound for dirt holding areas managed by the government or were on their way to killer buyer auctions. The foundation has facilitated the adoption and purchase of dozens of other once wild horses. Tcf has provided training or retraining of once adopted wild horses that were subsequently rescued either directly or indirectly by tcf. Tcf maintains two family bands of wild horses on privately owned, leased pastures in montana. These "freedom family" wild horses live much like they did on the pryor mountains. Tcf provides scheduled visits to see the freedom families for purposes of photography and education about the behavior and complex social interactions of wild horses.   tcf has, since its inception (2005), legally challenged the blm in the pryor mountains of montana to reduce excessive removal of wild horses; actions which tcf argues threaten the genetic viability and long-term survival of this unique spanish herd. Tcf is awaiting the verdict in their current suit against both blm and the u. S. Forest service in which tcf argues that the current boundary of the pryor wild horse range must be expanded so that the herd can utilize grazing that the herd has traditionally used for hundreds of years. Tcf successfully petitioned the court to become an intervenor on behalf of wild horse herds in southern wyoming, which are scheduled for elimination by the blm in 2013 and 2014. In addition, tcf is or has participated in lawsuits to preserve wild horse herds in colorado, nevada, and oregon.

We envision a world of self-sufficient, localized communities that are part of an interdependent global system, where individuals act as stewards and live with respect towards their local environmental, economic, and social systems. The sum of these communities' efforts contributes to a shift in societal values and ultimately a world that lives within the ecological limits of the planet.	Since 2009, we've helped over 300 low-income families learn how to grow organic vegetables in their backyards, providing them with the skills and resources to become healthy and self-sufficient.   In 2012, we helped 40 Somali Bantu refugee families start a 1.5 acre urban farm where they are reconnecting to their ancestral roots and farming for the first time in over 20 years.   With our promotora model, many well-paying, respected jobs have been created in the Westwood community, and the model empowers individuals to transform their own lives and those of their neighbors through our leadership development and training programs.  In the summer of 2014, we launched the Westwood Food Cooperative (WFC), which is the first food co-op in Denver since 1982, and one of the first in the nation to be owned and operated by residents from a low-income community. The Westwood Food Cooperative will ensure that all residents have access to healthy, affordable food, as well as the opportunity to become member owners of their cooperative, thus retaining profits within the community.   We are currently in the process of opening a neighborhood Grocery Store and Food Hub that will support a vertically integrated neighborhood food system, from seed to plant, to retail and processing. This Food Hub will be the economic center of our community food system, providing the ability to aggregate, process, market and distribute neighborhood-grown produce, as well as local and regional producers.

In 2016 we will officially launch the Ekialo Kiona Community Radio, a for youth by youth station serving the rural shores of lake victoria.	OHR is based on Mfangano Island, Kenya. Mfangano Island, in the heart of Lake Victoria, is home to approximately 19,000 people of Suba and Luo descent. The small beach villages that line the shores of these islands are accessible from the mainland only by a 3-hour ride on wooden outboard canoes. Fishing and subsistence farming are primary occupations for the majority of residents. People here speak English, Swahili, Luo, and Subaa language spoken nowhere in the world other than the shores of Lake Victoria. Currently, Mfangano Island has no electricity and only one road that circles the base of the island. Mfangano is a place of stunning beauty and generous people. The warm communities of Mfangano face many serious and immediate health challenges. With local HIV prevalence estimated at over 30%, Mfangano Island is struggling to address the impact of one of the most critical concentrations of HIV/AIDS anywhere in the world. At the same time, poverty and disease has forced these vulnerable communities to make dangerous changes to their local environment in order to squeeze out enough to survive. Deforestation on the mountain and over-fishing in the lake have taken a huge toll, threatening annual rainfall and draining the local economy. This is a decisive time to address the serious environmental and health threats facing people living along Lake Victoria. With out immediate and effective action, the indigenous Suba language and way of life may disappear within in a single generation.

We have a petting zoo with multiple farm animals such as alpacas, chickens, goats, sheep, bunnies and a miniature pig.

The children also thoroughly enjoy feeding, petting and playing with the farm animals when they come to Downs On The Farm, as well as the fun events held at the farm throughout the year.    We also do animal rescue for those mistreated, neglected and unwanted animals in need of finding loving forever homes.  These animals will be provided with veterinarian care by our sponsored vet as well as the best of care and food will be provided.  The animals will be adopted out to loving homes unless health is not permitting and then they will be welcome to live on the farm as we care for them with their own set of special needs.  We spay and neuter all pets before adopting them into new homes therefore we can help the overpopulation of unwanted pets in our community and state.  We also enjoy seeing the special needs children connect with our special need rescues. We have combined our two loves into one very special non-profit organization.
