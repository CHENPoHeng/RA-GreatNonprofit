Many of these boys were brought to us after having been expelled from school or having failed because of these issues. Grace House was developed as a residential program that would house this teen for an extended period of time 1 - 2 years. Through educational and remedial work, through extensive counseling and therapy, and through family counseling, through recreational activities, and through family type dynamics we have been able to redirect these boys. Part of our success has been in educating parents on how to be better parents and how to cope with these issues. Our boys are now on the honor role at school and most have plans to attend college. Our goal is to return the boy to his home after having redirected the boy and changed the home.

As Jesus tells us in John 15:16, You did not choose Me, but I chose you.  I appointed you that you should go out and produce fruit  You have heard Gods call and we can help you answer that call.  Our volunteers share the love of Jesus with overlooked people in remote locations around our world and help with human needs such as medical, dental, clean water, construction, educational and other basic needs.  Our lives have been changed for the better by what Christ did for us.  We now want to help others with their physical needs but more importantly to show them how they can have lasting peace in their lives.   God has put within each of us a desire for excitement, a need to rise above the mere everyday existence, a passion for adventure.  We might suppress the burning urgency of this passion so that all that is left is a small glowing ember.  Or we may try to satisfy this need with vicarious, second hand adventure such as Facebook and YouTube.  But that God-given desire is still there.  It is still part of our basic make up.  Its part of our DNA.  God has also given each of us a purpose.   We are here for more than to just get all we can get.  Each of us have God-given talents and skills  evangelism, medical, teaching, prayer, listening and caring.  Our purpose and true satisfaction is found in using our unique gifts to help others, especially those who are not able to help themselves, those trapped in systems of spiritual darkness, poverty, and injustice..  XMAs calling is to combine these two often suppressed life needs into an Adventure with a Purpose.  On an extreme missionary adventure youll get all of the adventure you want but its not just adventure for adventures sake. Its an adventure with a purpose.  It could be preaching or showing an evangelistic film to the unreached, showing love to abandoned children in a small village orphanage in Honduras, a medical/dental team working in villages along an Amazon tributary in the Peruvian jungle, giving educational assistance to a pastor or teacher in a remote village in the mountains of Asia, or maybe helping rural Central Americans improve their standard of living with farm assistance projects.  Most importantly, through all of these and other activities, showing others how Jesus can give purpose, peace and meaning to their lives.	Worldwide

With an eye on the future, audubon remained committed to providing outstanding guest experiences, educational opportunities, and developing partnerships to protect the wonders of nature. At audubon zoo in 2014, a new petting zoo named watoto walk opened and cool zoo opened for a fourth season. A female colobus monkey and a pair of critically endangered false gharials were born. The zoo also welcomed a new addition to its southern white rhinoceros herd and huey and roux, two rescued california sea lion pups, joined the zoo family in february. Audubon aquarium of the americas received accreditation by the association of zoos and aquariums (aza) in march of 2014. The aquarium underwent a thorough review to ensure it has and will continue to meet ever-rising standards, which include animal care, veterinary programs, conservation, education, and safety. Aza requires zoos and aquariums to successfully complete this rigorous accreditation process every five years in order to be members of the association. In 2014, the aquarium welcomed caroline, a three-year-old sand tiger shark, and added dwarf cuttlefish to the living in water exhibit. Audubon butterfly garden and insectarium added blue death-feigning beetles, madagascar hissing cockroaches, atlas moths, and two new exhibits to boudreaux's bait shop-one called frogs and one called toads-in 2014in july of 2014, audubon aquatic center staff released a rehabilitated alligator snapping turtle into the mandalay national wildlife refuge in houma after caring for it since 2012. In december, the aquatic center took in 27 cold-stunned kemp's ridley sea turtles for care by audubon nature institute's louisiana marine mammal and sea turtle rescue program. Kemp's ridley sea turtles are among the most endangered of the sea turtles. In january of 2014, audubon launched the restoration of audubon louisiana nature center, a project that will reestablish the eastern new orleans attraction as a treasured green space for family recreation and environmental education. The nature center has remained closed since its forests were severely damaged and its interpretive spaces were destroyed by hurricane katrina. By year-end, flood-damaged buildings were demolished, the fema environmental assessment was completed, and bid drawings for the construction of a new interpretive center, planetarium and boardwalks were completed. Audubon nature institute launched audubon park conservancy, a new effort to raise much-need annual funds to support the daily care and operation of audubon park. Entergy imax theatre brought excitement to the theater's gigantic 5 1/2-story screen with a mix of educational and blockbuster films during the year including kenya 3d: animal kingdom, island of lemurs: madagascar 3d, great white shark 3d, and interstellar. The combined attendance at the zoo, aquarium, imax , and butterfly garden and insectarium totaled 1. 94 million visitors, up 2% from 2013. Revenue from admissions totaled $15. 28 million. Audubon nature institute's program service total for operation and management of all the facilities was $28,484,560 which includes salaries incurred by audubon nature institute employees. These salary costs were reimbursed by a management contract with audubon commission. Audubon looks to the future with optimism, ready to embark on new adventures and meet the challenges ahead.
