Starfish Initiative is a college access and readiness program serving economically disadvantaged high school students in Marion County, Indiana.  We believe that mentoring is the key to improving the educational attainment and future of todays youth. To that end, we match every student in the Starfish program with a college-educated, volunteer adult mentor whose job is to help walk their student into college. Thanks to the guidance of their mentors, 100 percent of the Starfish Scholars who completed the four-year program have graduated from high school and 98% have been accepted by colleges or universities across Indiana  and beyond.  Starfish was founded in 2003 by a group of local businessmen, concerned that many of the academically promising but economically disadvantaged students in Indianapolis were not getting the preparation for post-secondary education they needed to be the future leaders of the community. They founded Starfish Initiative  the name taken from the famous Starfish Story  to help economically disadvantaged students. Currently, Starfish serves approximately 340 students in 40 public, private, charter and magnet high schools.  Improving the educational attainment of promising, economically disadvantaged students is one of the regions greatest needs. According to a 2009 study by Americas Promise Alliance, only 30 percent of urban high schoolers in Indianapolis graduate, putting Indianapolis as 50th of the top 50 cities in the country for graduation rate. Each dropout costs the state of Indiana about $3,000 a year for the rest of their lives, a great public cost, at a time when economic growth and development and a well-educated workforce are of paramount importance.  With a commitment to long-term, community-based mentoring, leadership training and college access programming, Starfish Initiative is uniquely placed in the community to improve graduation rates, post-secondary educational access and make a difference for students and their families  one at a time.	the Greater Indianapolis Area	a college-educated mentor for each low-income/high-achieving high school student that will help them reach college and career success.

We do this practically by providing a pathway out of poverty through education, vocational training, and business development.		Vocational trainingas young adults begin their transition into the world of independence they need marketable skills. The culinary training center (ctc) and other similar programs to be developed in the future will provide the skills needed to become full members of society and provide hope for a better life. Cgi's largest project to date involves the development of a culinary training center in cambodia which will serve as a reintegration strategy to support the efforts of local shelters and orphanages. Students are enrolled in a two-year training program (cont'd on sch o) that will prepare them to enter into the most distinguished kitchens in cambodia. The ctc plays a significant role in establishing a successful strategy for developing future employment opportunities for orphans, at-risk, and formerly trafficked women. Cgi has developed the bytavi project. This program is so much more than simply teaching someone to use a needle and thread. The women on the bytavi team earn wages four times the poverty level in cambodia, and, they are able to provide food and shelter for their families, send their children to school, and purchase medications and supplies essential to good health. Girls who are part of cgi's newly renamed "imprint project" participate in an intensive 18-month life skills program that focuses on spiritual formation, general education, and vocational seamstress training. Cgi works with other nonprofit ministries to assist girls who have been rescued from trafficking and those who are at high risk.   care for children at riskthe majority of children and families with which the center for global impact (cgi) works live in desperate poverty and struggle to meet even the most basic of needs. Many face serious risks presented by homelessness, hazardous labor, and in some cases even forced prostitution. Through trusted international partners cgi is able to care for these children and their families through the provision of food, clothing, basic medical care, and educational support. We extend assistance to them regardless of religious beliefs, gender, or ethnic background and on a non-profit basis.   micro-enterprise developmentmany of the families with which cgi works are poor, but they are also resourceful, hard-working, and determined to solve their own problems. Unfortunately, without employment and without business capital, these families are often forced into a cycle of debt that prevents them from moving beyond their current situation. Center for global impact provides capital and training to assist families in the development of small business ventures. These ventures are tailored to each individual situation and include a wide range of possibilities including dairy, poultry, mushroom, and honey production, as well as retail sales and sewing.

Clean Socks Hope, is a faith-based 501 (c)(3) tax-exempt, publicly supported nonprofit that helps under-served communities with programming that includes a low income food cooperative called the Midtown Neighborhood Network. Without viable transportation, many families face a 1 to 2 hour round trip trying to find healthy food options. This phenomenon is referred to as a food desert. Meaning, the Midtown community of New Albany, Indiana has no local grocery or department store and its lack of transportation issues causes our neighbors to walk or ride their bike past acres of alcohol, lottery tickets and processed food options. This is an open invitation to crime, drugs and sex trafficking.   We partner with the under-served neighborhoods beginning with its residents, then its churches, nonprofits and businesses and finally local government to provide innovative and holistic development that produces flourishing communities where God's peace is present. We refer to this as Spiritual Gentrification. Our goal is to designate a 10-year master plan and when that community is up and thriving, move to the adjacent or to the next neighborhood in need and replicate the process. Weve been offering our Christmas Store and Food Cooperative to the Midtown community for over 3 years with one caveat. The families must have skin in the game equal to the benefits they receive.	Our passion, purpose and focus as a group has evolved and since 2010 has focused on impoverished children (the average age for the homeless in America is 9 years old) and their parents (almost always a single mother with an average of 2 children to care for). We work in partnership with Northside Christian Church on Oak St. and Hope Southern Indiana (formerly Interfaith Community Council) and area "like thinking" missions and organizations, churches and grass root organizations.	720

Ymca Of Terre Haute	http://		EIN 35-0868217	200 S Sixth St	Terre Haute	IN	47807	USA	Human Services, Young Mens or Womens Associations	Ys help people develop values and behavior that are consistent with Christian principles. Ys are for people of all faiths, races, abilities, ages and incomes. No one is turned away for inability to pay. YMCAs' strength is in the people they bring together.  In the average Y, a volunteer board sets policy for its executive, who manages the operation with full-time and part-time staff and volunteer leaders. Ys meet local community needs through organized activities called programs. In its own way, every Y nurtures the healthy development of children and teens; strengthens families; and makes its community a healthier, safer, better place to live.  YMCA programs are tools for building the values of caring, honesty, respect and responsibility. Longtime leaders in community-based health and fitness and aquatics, Ys teach kids to swim, offer exercise classes for people with disabilities and lead adult aerobics. They also offer hundreds of other programs in response to community needs, including camping, child care (the Y movement is the nation's largest not-for-profit provider), teen clubs, environmental programs, substance abuse prevention, youth sports, family nights, job training, international exchange and many more.  Organization: Each YMCA is a charitable nonprofit, qualifying under Section 501(c)(3) of the U.S. Tax Code. Each is independent. YMCAs are required by the national constitution to pay annual dues, to refrain from discrimination and to support the YMCA mission. All other decisions are local choices, including programs offered, staffing and style of operation. The national office, called the YMCA of the USA, is in Chicago, with Field offices in California, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Ohio, Indiana, Minnesota and Texas. It is staffed by 241 employees. Its purpose is to serve member associations.  International: YMCAs are at work in more than 120 countries around the world, serving more than 30 million people. Some 230 local US Ys maintain more than 370 relationships with Ys in other countries, operate international programs and contribute to YMCA work worldwide through the YMCA World Service campaign. Like other national YMCA movements, the YMCA of the USA is a member of the World Alliance of YMCAs, headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland.  History: The YMCA was founded in London, England, in 1844 by George Williams and about a dozen friends who lived and worked as clerks in a draperya forerunner of dry-goods and department stores. Their goal was to help young men like themselves find God. The first members were evangelical Protestants who prayed and studied the Bible as an alternative to vice. The Y movement has always been nonsectarian and today accepts those of all faiths at all levels of the organization, despite its unchanging name, the Young Men's Christian Association.

YMCAs are at the heart of community life in neighborhoods and towns across the nation. They work to meet the health and social service needs of 16.9 million men, women and children. Ys help people develop values and behavior that are consistent with Christian principles. Ys are for people of all faiths, races, abilities, ages and incomes. No one is turned away for inability to pay. YMCAs' strength is in the people they bring together. In the average Y, a volunteer board sets policy for its executive, who manages the operation with full-time and part-time staff and volunteer leaders. Ys meet local community needs through organized activities called programs. In its own way, every Y nurtures the healthy development of children and teens; strengthens families; and makes its community a healthier, safer, better place to live. YMCA programs are tools for building the values of caring, honesty, respect and responsibility. Longtime leaders in community-based health and fitness and aquatics, Ys teach kids to swim, offer exercise classes for people with disabilities and lead adult aerobics. They also offer hundreds of other programs in response to community needs, including camping, child care (the Y movement is the nation's largest not-for-profit provider), teen clubs, environmental programs, substance abuse prevention, youth sports, family nights, job training, international exchange and many more. Organization: Each YMCA is a charitable nonprofit, qualifying under Section 501(c)(3) of the U.S. Tax Code. Each is independent. YMCAs are required by the national constitution to pay annual dues, to refrain from discrimination and to support the YMCA mission. All other decisions are local choices, including programs offered, staffing and style of operation. The national office, called the YMCA of the USA, is in Chicago, with Field offices in California, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Ohio, Indiana, Minnesota and Texas. It is staffed by 241 employees. Its purpose is to serve member associations. International: YMCAs are at work in more than 120 countries around the world, serving more than 30 million people. Some 230 local US Ys maintain more than 370 relationships with Ys in other countries, operate international programs and contribute to YMCA work worldwide through the YMCA World Service campaign. Like other national YMCA movements, the YMCA of the USA is a member of the World Alliance of YMCAs, headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland. History: The YMCA was founded in London, England, in 1844 by George Williams and about a dozen friends who lived and worked as clerks in a draperya forerunner of dry-goods and department stores. Their goal was to help young men like themselves find God. The first members were evangelical Protestants who prayed and studied the Bible as an alternative to vice. The Y movement has always been nonsectarian and today accepts those of all faiths at all levels of the organization, despite its unchanging name, the Young Men's Christian Association.		The ymca is a leader in nurturing the potential of every child and teen. Every day, the ymca helps young people deepen positive values, their commitment to service, and their motivation to learn. Our ymca programs, such as after school care, summer camp, childwatch, and youth dances offer a range of experiences that enrich cognitive, social, physical, and emotional growth.   ymcas focus on healthy living by advocating health and well-being from the inside out - the spirit, mind, and body. The ymca provides people with the supportive relationships and enviroments they need for their successful pursuit of health and well-being. This is particularly important as our nation struggles with an obesity crisis, families striggle with work/life balance, and individuals search for personal fulfillment. We bring families together and offer sport, recreational, and social networks that build relationships and strengthen bonds. Our programs are accessible, affordable, and open to all faiths, backgrounds, abilities, and income levels.   our ymca provides a variety of programs to enrich the local community. Our ymca stives to set an example of a healthy lifestyle to build the foundation for future generations to thrive. Annual memberships and fund drives are an intregral part of our dedication to social responsibility.		All Ages and Demographics in our service area.

(cont'd on sch o)outreach, inc. Is a christian ministry in indianapolis reaching out to homeless and at-risk young adults with the compassion of jesus christ. Outreach accomplishes this by providing street outreach, a youth drop-in center, holistic social services, emergency/referral services and case management; operated in an environment of god's love.		Street outreach:our street outreach takes us to hidden places where homeless and runaway youth live: the streets, wooded areas, bridge underpasses, parks, and abandoned houses. As we meet the youth on the street, we provide a listening ear and address their immediate physical needs of food, clothing, first aid, and safety. For those who desire to come off the streets immediately, we take them to a shelter. Through this combination of listening and meeting physical needs, we establish relationships built on trust. The relationship is foundational because it allows us to work with the youth, empowering them to make the choices which are necessary to come off the street.   case management (cont'd on sch o):life changes can begin with very specific needs such as assistance in obtaining id's, birth certificates, social security cards, transportation, passes, receiving leads for jobs or housing, and referrals for medical prenatal programs. Through these initial services, the social worker and vocational/educational resource manager of outreach, inc. Start to build a relationship with the youth. Working through emotional and spiritual struggles they help to develop a more comprehensive, long-term service plan with goals and objectives. Time is also spent on life and social skills that most of us take for granted such as money management, employability, and home economics. Connecting with ged completion assistance, vocational training programs, and postsecondary educational opportunities are important steps in these life changes. The outreach inc. Staff also helps youth reunify with their families when that is appropriate, connect with churches, and network with other service providers and community resources. The youth we assist are usually afraid to access other mainline social services or have little access to them because they are not in school, do not have a phone, or do not have an id. Outreach, inc. Serves in the gap to walk along side them as they connect with needed resources and rebuild their lives. Street youth in crisis are able to access us 24 hours a day via our toll free hotline number. As a result of this availability and reestablished trust, they call us in their most desperate times, including even while contemplating suicide, allowing us to support them through their pain.   g. O. A. L. Program (cont'd on sch o):our g. O. A. L. Program (graduation, occupation, address, and lifestyle) supports at-risk high-school students in marion county, by assigning a case manager whose focus is on offering specific needs unique to each student. Walking with students through their high-school journey, our case managers offer relational and spiritual support to normalize their high school experience and support student's retention through high school. Homeless students who are provided with positive supports are significantly more likely to graduate high school and rise above the cycle of homelessness. Outreach has developed a program to help homeless students graduate, engage in post-secondary educational opportunities, get a job and change their life. We provide resources such as advocacy, bus passes for transportation to school and employment opportunities, assistance in obtaining identification, offering primary support for medical needs and insurance gaps, even caps and gowns - everything necessary for students to earn their diploma. As we empower students to become self-sufficient by offering assistance to meet their basic needs, we also allow them to develop life-skills necessary to navigate the pathways of life. By assisting them to develop and maintain healthy relationships with our staff, we offer an example of setting boundaries and healthy relational development. Our main focus is on developing and emphasizing educational opportunities; as a result 90% of our students who graduate go on to post-secondary education including college, vocational school and military service.   drop program:our drop-in center includes a clothing and hygiene product pantry, a food pantry, laundry facilities, shower facilities, and meals. The youth can come to the drop-in center to access services, have a safe place to hang out, and to work with staff and volunteers on the issues that will help them remove themselves from street life. Many youth come just to talk. Our bible study group provides a casual forum for kids who are asking questions about god, christianity, and their own personal spiritual beliefs. When someone seeks our help, we provide all our services regardless of their personal beliefs, lifestyle, or practices.
