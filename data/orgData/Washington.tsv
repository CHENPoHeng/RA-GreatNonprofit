Center for Infectious Disease Research	http://www.cidresearch.org	(206) 256-7200	EIN 91-0961784	307 Westlake Ave North Ste 500	Seattle	WA	98109	USA	Education, Health, Specifically Named Diseases, Technology	Our mission is to make transformative scientific advancements that lead to the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases.			From humble beginnings as a small laboratory in Issaquah, Washington with an initial staff of five, the Center for Infectious Disease Research has become the world's largest center focused solely on infectious disease research.	Throughout our 40-year history, the work performed at the Center has contributed to numerous breakthroughs advancing the science of vaccine, drug, and diagnostic discovery. Yet challenges still exist in developing effective, accessible, and reliable interventions. Success will require high-impact collaboration, innovative approaches, and cutting-edge technology, all of which are components of systems biology. Our singular focus on infectious diseases and integration of systems biology uniquely positions us as a leader in the fight against these pathogens. Our three tenets help focus our scope - on the people who are affected by, and fighting these diseases; on the cutting edge science developing future interventions; and on the hope derived from our research for the potentiality of global health. Please go to our website, www.cidresearch.org, to learn more about our work and how, with your support, we can create a healthier more hopeful world.	Some of our more notable achievements include: discovering RNA editing; identifying agents capable of killing TB; developing a malaria vaccine candidate currently in human clinical trials; sequencing 3 parasite genomes; and creating a revolutionary vaccine candidate for HIV/AIDS.    We are proud of our progress. But for the 14 million people who died last year from these diseases, progress was not enough. Just as was the case 40 years ago, there are still no vaccines to prevent or drugs to treat most of these infectious diseases. This is not only tragic; it is unjust.

CONSERVATION CANINES - University of Washington Foundation	http://conservationbiology.net/conservation-canines/		EIN 94-3079432	407 Gerberding Hall	Seattle	WA	98195	USA	Education	To distinguish between multiple, concurrent pressures facing wildlife over a large geographic range. The Conservation Canines program addresses this need by combining the precision and efficiency of detection dogs to readily locate wildlife scat samples with the ability to extract a wide variety of genetic and physiological indicators from scat. These indicators provide information about species abundance, distribution, resource use, and physiological health all in relation to the environmental pressure(s) the species is encountering. Scat detection dogs are able to locate samples from multiple species simultaneously across large, remote areas and have a lower bias compared to traditional wildlife detection methods. No other method can acquire such a vast amount of reliable information in so short a time, making this approach incredibly valuable for conservation and management planners.					We've trained our dogs to locate over 35 different species and we are just getting started!

Amara has been serving washington since its founding as medina baby home, a traditional orphanage, in 1921. While amara's services have evolved over the past 90 years to meet urgent and emergent needs, its focus on finding permanence and stability for vulnerable children has never waivered. Its vision is a home for every child. Amara served 634 families and 193 children in 2013.				Foster care and adoption services: there are currently thousands of children living in temporary foster care in washington. Many of these children are legally available for adoption and are waiting for what every one of us needs most - a loving, safe home and a forever family. Many more of these children are in need of families that can nurture them until they reunify with their birth parents or relatives -- families that are also committed to adopting the children if the state determines reunification will not be possible. Amara takes a comprehensive, supportive approach to recruiting, training, assessing, licensing, and otherwise preparing each potential foster and adoptive family to provide a lifelong nurturing home to children who have suffered the trauma of abuse and/or neglect, and still suffer the grief of having been removed from their birth family. Amara also serves at-risk newborns relinquished directly to amara; children whose birth parents believe an adoptive family will better provide them the protection, attention and care needed to learn and grow. Amara is committed to addressing racial disproportionality within foster care, to maintaining birth family ties whenever possible, and to finding homes for children who have historically been more difficult to place.   pregnancy & parenting services: amara's provides no-cost, compassionate pregnancy options counseling for women and their partners facing an unplanned pregnancy. Our social workers work one on one with clients and offer unbiased information about all choices available, referrals for housing and other basic needs, help in locating and obtaining medical care, and provide ongoing support through their pregnancy and beyond, regardless of their parenting decision. If the woman and her partner decide to create an adoption plan, the organization works with them to choose an adoptive family, create an open communication agreement with the adoptive parents, and cope with the emotional loss of placing a child for adoption. If they choose to parent, amara will work with them toward establishing a foundation for healthy parenting, linking them to long-term support when available.   communications: communications plays a crucial role in attracting and engaging prospective adoptive parents for vulnerable children. In addition, communications is charged with elevating the community's awareness of the needs for safe, loving homes for children in foster care. Lastly, amara's communications work is aimed at debunking the commonly held myths and misperceptions about the children in the foster care system. Amara is committed to being an active voice for permanence for children in foster care, and directs its communications efforts there.

Since our inception in 1986, our local chapter has granted wishes to more than 5,100 children. This year, we will grant approximately 300 wishes to local children throughout Alaska and Washington.  A childs most heartfelt wish may vary from a family trip to Hawaii, to the gift of a backyard playset, to the chance to be a superhero for a day. Regardless of the dream, each wish strengthens family bonds, enriches community spirit, and makes a life-changing impact on the emotional and physical health of a critically-ill child.				Wish program - the make-a-wish foundation of alaska & washington grants the wishes of children between the ages of 2-1/2 and 18 years old with life-threatening medical conditions to enrich the human experience with hope, strength, and joy. The power of a wish is truly transformative and long-lasting. It offers the child something to yearn for that's not steeped in the language of hospitals, trauma, or pain. In a world that has become chaotic and uncontrollable for them, make-a-wish alaska and washington provides wish children and their families with a unique opportunity to exercise some control when they alone determine their heartfelt wish. It provides the family the opportunity to celebrate something joyful together, without any worry or hassle. This gift is unparalleled and unique to make-a-wish. It is something that no medicine, no doctors and no nurses can provide. Wish kid brody's mom, melissa, says it best: "make-a-wish gave our family a feeling of hope for the first time in a long time. We had a sense of togetherness. No business, no school, no doctors, just us. We made so many memories that we will never forget and will forever be treasured. "eighty-nine percent of medical professionals say that receiving a wish positively influences a childs health. Seattle childrens hospital pediatric nephrologist, sangeeta hingorani, has seen the power of a wish first hand. "we can offer the kids lifesaving therapies, but make-a-wish gives them a little bit of their life back," said dr. Hingorani. Jeff beck, a pediatric palliative care physician at seattle childrens also understands the importance of wishes as part of a childs overall treatment plan. "patient care at its best includes care for the mind and the spirit in addition to the body," said dr. Beck. "a wish experience goes to the essence of caring holistically for a young person facing a serious and life-threatening illness. Providing the opportunity for a child and the family to shift their focus from the clinical condition to the experience of a wish provides rest to the mind and vitality to the spirit. Since 1986, our local chapter has granted tranformational wish experiences to more than 5,500 children. During the 2013-2014 fiscal year, 336 wishes were granted for children living within the chapter's territory.

International Snow Leopard Trust	http://www.snowleopard.org	206.632.2421	EIN 91-1144119	4649 Sunnyside Ave N #325	Seattle	WA	98103	USA	Animals, Environment, Natural Resources Conservation & Protection, Protection of Endangered Species	Founded in 1981 in Seattle, WA, the Trust is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization whose mission is to protect the snow leopard and its mountain ecosystem through a balanced approach that addresses the needs of the local people and the environment.Snow leopards range over two million square kilometers of mountain in Central Asia, including the formidable Himalayas. Experts currently estimate as few as 3,500 exist in the wild, fewer than the world''s tiger population. As an "umbrella" or keystone species, snow leopard conservation has far-reaching importance as it leads to the protection of hundreds of other plants and animals sharing the cat''s ecosystem. The International Snow Leopard Trust is the oldest and largest organization focused solely on saving this important species. The Trust works nationally and internationally to raise awareness about endangered species, and to empower people living within snow leopard range to become stewards of their environment. To this end, the Trust conducts educational outreach, scientific research, and community-based conservation.	protect these endangered cats and their natural habitat	Our partner communities in China, India, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, and Pakistan - and the snow leopard of course!	five snow leopard range countries	Snow Leopard Enterprises, which provides herders with the financial assistance, logistical support, equipment, and training they need to turn raw wool into high-quality, felted products such as rugs and clothing. The Trust purchases these products directly from the herders and sells them worldwide to increase awareness about snow leopard conservation. Herders agree to help the Trust protect snow leopards, their prey, and the habitat they all share.    The Trust also helps communities establish livestock insurance programs, where herders can pay a premium to insure their goats and sheep against predation by snow leopards, bears, and wolves - making the financial impact of losing animals much easier to bear, and leading to increased tolerance towards these predators.  Through its Ecosystem Health project, the Trust also helps establish livestock vaccination programs in snow leopard habitat; lowering livestock mortality rates and helping herders further secure their livelihood.

Providing people with safe water systems, latrines, and hygiene education is the 1st step to ending the cycle of poverty and death.The lack of access to safe drinking water and sanitary latrines is the top public health problem in the world and the number-one killer of children in the world. Lack of access to clean water has a devastating effect on women and girls who are traditionally responsible for water collection.Water 1st wants to unite people to fight this worldwide, silent catastrophe. We believe the global water crisis will be solved when we build a community of concerned individuals and motivate and mobilize them to take simple, effective actions.People living in extreme poverty have many needs, but we believe water comes first. Water projects are the foundation on which strong communities are built. Through provision of sustainable water, sanitation, and health projects, our goal is to address the most fundamental issues of childhood death, poverty and gender equality.	build water and sanitation systems for the world's poorest communities		Honduras, Bangladesh, and Ethiopia	Water first international provides grants to non-governmental organizations (ngos) based in developing countries in order to support the implementation of projects that include provision of drinking water, hygiene education, and sanitary latrines. The organization works with ngos in some of the poorest communities in the world to support sustainable, community-managed solutions to water supply and sanitation problems. In 2014, the organization completed 228 projects serving 16,922 people. Every project incorporates water, toilets, hygiene education, and community development. In oromia, ethiopia, the organization began funding the dawo kara project, which will be completed in 2015 and will serve 3,750 people. In bangladesh, 240 water systems serving 16,039 people in urban slum settlements in dhaka, chittagong, and khulna were completed. In the rural lempira communities of san bartolo, capuca, and portillo el paraiso, honduras, 882 people have piped water and toilets at every individual household. Additionally, our local partner initiated five additional projects that will be completed in 2015. As of december 2014, the water first community contributed over $11 million to support 1,200 water projects, benefiting 123,265 people. The organization's goal is to maximize cost-effectiveness by leveraging local resources. In the urban slums of dhaka, chittagong, and khulna, bangladesh, for example, beneficiaries pay 100 percent of the capital costs of their projects through two-year loans. The loans are repaid to the local non-governmental organization, who is the recipient of water first's grants. Repaid loan funds are revolved and used for additional water and sanitation projects and create a sustainable source of funds for water first's bangladesh partner. In honduras and ethiopia, beneficiaries and the local government contribute cash, labor, and local materials, which are valued at up to 25 percent of the total project cost. The organization's honduras partner now has the capacity to provide assistance for water system construction, expansion, and repair on a loan basis, further leveraging local resources.

West Seattle and surrounding areas	TNR, Foster Care, Adoption	Since FAF began in 1997, we have placed over 4,000 cats and kittens into safe and loving homes.  2014: We adopted out 98 cats in 2014, down from 2013, but adult cat numbers were up.  Over 25% of our adoptions were adult cats.  We ended the year by adopting out two very special ones, Midge and John.  There were fewer kittens in 2013 and they came later.  Hopefully the focus on spaying and neutering is finally paying off.  2012: FAF was able to help at two adjoining addresses in the Highland Park area of West Seattle this spring. A total of five feral female cats, all nursing were TNR'd. One male cat was also altered. 11 kittens were trapped and put into foster care. The kittens were all able to find new homes after they were spayed/neutered.  FAF and FCAT trapped 12 feral and one friendly cat living on the property of a home in Skyway. All were spayed/neutered and returned.  FAF delivers 50 lbs of cat food monthly so the family is able to feed the cats healthy food, not rice as they had been eating. FCAT provided a huge Dogloo for shelter.  We received a call about hungry kittens at a property in Burien.  We were able to TNR four adult cats on the property. Seven very sick kittens were put into foster care first with FCAT and then an FAF foster home. All seven are now healthy, altered, and looking for new homes. FAF and FCAT were able to provide shelter to the remaining four cats. The elderly, disabled caretaker was very thankful.  2011: Our goal for 2011 was 150 adoptions. We came just shy of that goal with 123 adoptions. We were also busy with TNRabout 120 ferals TNRd.  2010: In 2010 we had a total of 125 adoptions!

Our Place Community Ministries provides emergency services for families who are unable to meet their basic human needs of food, hygiene products, clothing, household necessities, bus tokens and utility assistance for free. We have an on-site laundry center, also free of charge. Our Place teaches classes to help clients find long-term solutions to their poverty and move toward self-sufficiency, including teaching parents how to cook healthy for the future of their children.All of our clients live in poverty. They are some of Spokane's poorest and most vulnerable citizens. We know our clients must often choose between paying their rent, their utility bill and buying food and hygiene items. By providing emergency services for families who are unable to meet their basic human needs due to the recession and other economic challenges, Our Place prevents homelessness.Our Place is a member of Second Harvest Food Bank. We provide food once a month to people living within the boundaries of this program and to all homeless. Second Harvest's geographic area stipulates we may give food only to families living south of Montgomery to the Spokane River and west of Division to the river. Our Place aims to distribute about 20 pounds of food per person. A typical food basket consists of some protein, produce, canned veggies, grains, eggs and maybe something fun like ice cream, when it is available. We are also an outlet for WIC and senior boxes (food packages delivered monthly to seniors). Our Place is a member of Northwest Harvest and we receive a shipment of food from them once a month. Generally it is food with a good protein value. We are able to distribute this food to anyone in Spokane and to clients who need food more than once a month. Our hygiene bank provides supplies once a month to homeless and clients in our service area. Food stamps may not be used to buy these products including toothpaste, toothbrushes, bar soap, deodorant, toilet paper, feminine hygiene products, laundry soap, combs and brushes, razors, shampoo and diapers.Part of our emergency services program is to provide utility assistance to those facing shut-off. Clients set up an appointment and bring in their Avista or Spokane city utility shut-off notice. Depending upon the amount of funding we have available, we apply $50 or $100 toward their bill to prevent loss of power and water. People who cannot pay their utility bill generally cannot stay in their homes and must vacate. When we surveyed our clients, many told us they would have been forced to leave their homes. One client wrote, "Without your assistance, I would have been homeless."We assist clients with their emergency transportation needs in the form of bus tokens, so they may go to their jobs, school or medical appointments. We distribute 20 bus passes per day. Our free laundry facility helps anyone in the city who needs laundry services. We have two washers and four dryers. Clients are able to go into the community, attend job interviews, and school without odors, or wearing clothes saturated with stains. Many clients do not have their own washer and dryer. Many also lack the funds to use a commercial facility, or they lack the transportation to even get to a commercial facility. When we surveyed our clients, they told us they used to wash their clothes by hand in their sink or bathtub.Our Place's clothing bank distributes donated clothing, bedding and household necessities. Our need is greatest during the winter months, when many people come in for warm clothes and blankets to help keep their heating costs down. We provide the homeless with sleeping bags and warm clothing and for all who come here in need, blankets and warm bedding to help

Our work with youth is meaningful, relationship-rich, and context-driven.  Kitchen Garden Project -- Each spring and summer, KGP staff & volunteers build dozens of raised-bed gardens for qualifying families at their homes.

After successfully running our youth employment program for the past 13+ years, we are excited to take things to the next level. GRuB is co-creating a pilot project with Matt Grant, principal of Olympia High School, where disengaged students will come to GRuB for part of their school day. These students will experience the transformational outcomes of the GRuB employment program at the GRuB Farm while earning high school credit. If this initial pilot project is successful, OHS and other interested area high schools will begin engaging their students within this innovative model at their own sites. Students, principals, educators, and superintendents are all showing great interest in the venture. They know their schools have hundreds of students who are incredible young people looking to find their voice and direction. We know at GRuB that what these students need is to be a part of meaningful change in their community.

MEOW places approximately 1000 - 1500animals into permanent homes each year. Adoption fees from $65 to $95 help defray the cost of care for the animals. Donations from interested individuals, organizations and business provide additional financial support. Our application process ensures that every adopted animal is placed in an environment where there is appropriate space, human contact, and a commitment to safeguard and care for the animal for its entire lifetime. Our standards are high. The welfare of the animals is paramount in the placement process. Cats and kittens come from various sources and situations: orphans found under a deck, a stray or abandoned cat crying at the door, someone has developed allergies or is moving to a place where the cats are not welcome. Some come from the rescue community, finding tame cats and kittens feeding with feral colonies. Newborn or senior, healthy, ill or injured, all are welcome at MEOW . Incoming cats and kittens are examined for general health, illness, injury, parasites and tested for feline viral diseases and provided appropriate medical care. Daily care of cats and kittens is done both in the shelter and in the foster homes of volunteers, sometimes involving bottle-feeding orphans, often requiring intensive medical care of ill animals. MEOW provides a safe haven and socialization as well as proper nutrition and a clean environment while the animals await adoptive homes. Our volunteers speak with the public, interview prospective adopters, and provide education concerning the care of pets on such subjects as spaying/neutering, introducing a new pet into the family, addressing behavioral issues, proper daily care and well-cat/kitten care. Each year MEOW is faced with the impossible and each and every day we recommit ourselves to something we truly believe in, the motto we adopted at our inception,"all nine lives are precious".	Since our beginning in 1997, we have rescued and placed more than 19,000 pets into loving homes. We currently are caring for more than 100 kittens and many senior and special needs cats in foster homes in addition to the approximately 80 cats and kittens in our shelter.

Our unique training empowers youth to not only have a vision, but also guides them through working with a team to make that vision happen, all while having fun doing it.  Everything we do has two guiding principles. The first is the impact to the communities we serve. NGA serves both domestically and abroad by creating a sustainable difference though education programs, community projects and partnerships with local businesses.   The second is the impact to our participants. Can you imagine spending months planning, fundraising and dreaming of your own volunteer project in Rwanda? At 19?

Our therapy animal program serves all people, but our teams most commonly visit patients at hospitals, residents at nursing homes, students at schools of all levels, and children at libraries.	In 2015, Pet Partners had 14,000 registered therapy animal teams across the United States who brought comfort and healing to those who need it most.	National	Pet Partners demonstrates the human health benefits associated with the Human Animal Bond through animal-assisted interactions. Our almost 14,000 registered therapy animal teams visit in hospitals, retirement communities, hospice, libraries and other venues. Pet Partners is committed to an innovative approach to program development not only to have the best prepared and supported therapy animal teams, but to also bring the health benefits of the Human Animal Bond to more people.  Pet Partners' Therapy Animal Program trains and screens volunteers and their pets for visiting animal programs in hospitals, nursing homes, rehabilitation centers, schools, and other facilities.  The Pet Partners program was established in 1990 to ensure that "both ends of the leash," people as well as animals, were well-prepared to participate in animal-assisted activity and therapy programs. Pet Partners is the only therapy animal organization that requires volunteers to reevaluate every two years, ensuring the safety, knowledge, and welfare of the animal, handler, and client.    Most domesticated species can qualify to be an animal partner with their handler.  While dogs make up the largest number of teams, we also register teams with cats, rabbits, guinea pigs, horses, mini-horses, bird, llamas, pot-bellied pigs and others.	In 2016, Pet Partners has already accomplished so much. A few examples include: two new and innovative webinars: Canine Body Language and Infection Control; an endorsement from Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA); 20 practicums to train evaluators who help determine if prospective volunteers are eligible to become a therapy animal team; 1,766 new teams registered as of August 2016; and ongoing support of our 14,000 therapy animal teams across the U.S.

Since our inception in 2007, over 6,500 young people have been trained and released to lead ministry, reaching over 75,000 with the Good News of Jesus Christ. Now, YMI is working to increase our impact. By 2020, we will develop 20,000 young Christian leaders who will reach a quarter of a million people with the Gospel.  Developing these young Christian leaders is our passion. Why are we so passionate about this? The Church, particularly the Church in North America, is in need of more young people who are truly leaders in ministry. These young leaders are unafraid of sharing Jesus Christ with others, while being able to mobilize the Church, maximizing the impact made for Christ in the communities they live. Young leaders bring new vision and vitality.  Where there is new vision and vitality paired with experience and training, effective ministry effort can take place, growing the local church. This is exactly what the Church needs and this is what YMI intends to hand back to local churches as we work with young people.  In nine short years, YMI has transformed from a volunteer-led, West Coast-focused ministry to a nationwide operation with global reach. Throughout it all, we have been able to maintain our distinctive culture, methods, and outcomes. We have a clearly defined mission: to empower young people to continually live and share their faith in Christ in the global communities they serve. We have a clearly defined method: we accomplish our mission by pairing training with authentic ministry opportunity, allowing young people to lead ministry and grow. These two things lead to a clearly defined outcome  what we offer back to the Church: more young Christian leaders who love to share Jesus.

Through activities and experiences that are girl-led, cooperative and allow them to learn by doing, girls: 1) unleash their potential: girls discover their unique strengths and interests, and learn to think critically, communicate their ideas and work with other people, developing a strong sense of who they are and what they can offer the world. 2) transform their world: girls become leaders who stand up for others, have strong personal principles and improve their community through activities such as service learning, advocacy and anti-bullying training. 3) build their future: girls envision the future they want to live in and set goals to make their dreams a reality. Activities include stem exploration, developing business skills, career exploration and college planning. According to a 2012 girl scouts of the usa study, 63% of women who participated in girl scouts for six or more years consider themselves competent and capable, compared to 55% of non-alumnae. 48% attained college degrees, compared to 28% of non-alumnae.

These reports enable people to learn about the whales of the Pacific NW, and enable them to get to the shorelines to watch as they pass by. And most importantly, the sightings data is shared with researchers up and down the Pacific Coast, adding important data to studies being done to protect the Endangered Southern Resident orcas, humpbacks, Gray whales and other cetaceans.  Orca Network has also been actively engaged in efforts to keep orcas out of captivity, with our focus on Lolita, or Tokitae, the L pod/Southern Resident orca captured off Whidbey Island in 1970, living in the smallest tank in the country at the Miami Seaquarium ever since.  Orca Network also oversees the Central Puget Sound Marine Mammal Stranding Network, responding to hundreds of calls about stranded or dead marine mammals, conducting necropsies and testing to determine cause of death, which helps researchers understand the health of our marine mammals and ocean ecosystems. We also conduct countless hours of education at the Coupeville Wharf, events, and on the beach, especially during seal pup season.
