Entire state of Georgia	A non-profit 501(c)(3) organization, healthmpowers was founded in 1999 to address growing concern over the health of our youth. With a mission to "promote healthy behaviors and environments by empowering students, school staff and families to improve health and academic achievement," the organization has established a 13-year track record of improving student health knowledge, behavior, physical activity, bmi and school policies--all without taking away valuable class time. Healthmpowers is nationally recognized as an evidence-based program by usda's snap-ed, using the guidelines established by the center for disease control and prevention (cdc) as the foundation of our multi-year program. In addition to the multi-year program, healthmpowers launched a childcare program in 2014, and is the training partner for the georgia department of education, georgia department of public health, and georgia shape. The organization continues to work collaboratively with other national and state organizations including centers for disease control and prevention, shape america, alliance for a healthier generation, presidential youth fitness program, action for healthy kids, georgia shape, and children's healthcare of atlanta. During the 2014-15 fiscal year, healthmpowers served a total of 442 schools, 3,099 teachers, and 265,806 students through the multi-year elementary school program, the child care pilot program, "power up for 30" trainings in partnership with the georgia departments of education and public health, and georgia shape grantee trainings. Independently audited financial information from the fiscal year showed that 93% of expenses were directly related to program services. The multi-year healthmpowers program is a school-wide intervention that includes trainings, direct services and resource materials to empower schools with the tools they need to sustain positive health and environmental outcomes on their own upon completion of the program. The program is structured to provide maximum resources and benefits to underserved populations. In the 2014-15 school year, the multi-year program served 45,161 students and 2,196 staff in 80 snap-ed sponsored schools. The average free and reduced lunch rate was 84%, indicating that a large portion of the population is underserved. The value and impact of this work extends beyond the services healthmpowers provides. During 2015-15, healthmpowers' team members provided approximately 2,762 hours of direct nutrition and physical activity, while approximately 45,753 additional hours of nutrition and physical activity instruction were provided by respective participating school staff using the resources, lessons and training provided by healthmpowers. Results from both the additional instruction and increased physical activity include an 87% improvement in student nutrition and physical activity behaviors; a 69% improvement in student's pacer fitness test which measures aerobic fitness; and a 78% of students maintaining or improving bmi percentiles. The childcare pilot served 6 centers, 48 teachers, 441 students, and 55 family members. Each pilot center completed the growing fit: nutrition and physical activity assessment at the start of the year and at the end of the year to examine center policies and practices. By the end of the first year, all childcare centers improved, on average, eight different polices or practices. In less than one year, most centers were able to improve their programs in nutrition education, caregiver and family nutrition training, and the eating environment. Due to these positive results, the program will continue and expand in 2015-16 school year. Since 2013, healthmpowers has served as the training partner for power up for 30, reaching over 500 schools. Power up for 30 is a statewide initiative supported by the georgia departments of public health and education to increase physical activity during the school day in georgia. Elementary schools are provided a one-day, eight-hour professional development workshop, technical support, physical activity resources and recognition opportunities. Outcomes demonstrated that schools participating in the power up for 30 initiative made statistically significant improvements in providing students with more pa time, resulting in improved cardiovascular health outcomes. Compared with schools that did not participate in the initiative, power up for 30 schools saw increases in before and after-school student physical activity programs, days of recess, classroom physical activity time, and more students achieving the "healthy fitness zone" for aerobic capacity.

Project GRAD Atlanta has successfully impacted high school graduation rates by helping students and their families understand that college is attainable. As a result of GRADs proliferation of a college-bound culture, more than 2,000 Brumley-GRAD Scholarship recipients have earned the opportunity to attend two-year and four-year colleges across the country.  Project GRAD Atlanta is proud to be a scholarship-granting nonprofit organization that has awarded over $2 million in scholarships to date.				College access: to expand the program services of project grad atlanta (pga) in the atlanta public schools to provide students enrolled in five additional high school; douglas, jackson, mays, therrell, and best academy with the opportunity to receive college access support services in the form of college advisement.   college readiness: the mission of the college programing department is to provide programs and opportunities for students enrolled in project grad atlanta high schools (grades 9-12) within the atlanta public schools by engaging students and parents in activities that foster positive attitudes, academic achievement, college preparation, access to financial resources; therefore promoting high school graduation, college enrollment, and college graduation. The specific goals of college readiness are: 90% of entering freshman graduating in four years; 60% of graduating class earning the dr. George w. Brumley, jr. -project grad scholarship; and 80% of brumley-grad scholars enrolled in college within the first year. The project grad atlanta high school programming department is to provide project grad high schools with college readiness programs, workshops, college tours, sat or act preparatory classes, tutoring and academic support, college admissions workshops, financial aid and scholarship assistance for students and parents, summer institutes for commuter and residential sites, summer enrichment program referrals, and provides additional financial support for school initiatives to include professional development for staff. In addition, the curriculum develops and promotes student-centered activities which help project grad students with the college application and preparation processes and foster high school graduation, academic achievement, career development, parental involvement and college attendance. An essential part of college readiness is promoting the brumley-grad scholarship for students who maintain an overall 78 or above numeric grade average, complete requisite college preparatory courses, attend two (2) summer institutes, and graduate from a project grad feeder high school on time (within four (4) years). Successful students who meet these criteria earn up to four (4) years of scholarship support to attend an accredited 2- or 4- year college or state-approved technical school of their choice anywhere in the united states. As of june 30, 2015, 170 project grad scholars from the class of 2015 qualified for the $4,000. 00 brumley-grad scholarship.   scholar support: the college programming department assists project grad senior scholars with their decision to attend college and make a successful transition from high school to college. In an effort to foster this change, during the summer of 2015, for the first time, the college programming department will offer a "summer melt workshop" to encourage all brumley-grad scholars slated to attend college for fall semester, to follow-through with those plans. Brumley-grad scholars who successfully complete high school and attend college are provided various forms of personal and group assistance in becoming responsible college students who successfully graduate from college. With a goal of fifty percent of brumley-grad scholars completing college at the associate or bachelor degree level, the initiatives of the college programming department impact college students' persistence. College programming works to ensure the success of the brumley-grad scholars enrolled in college. In 2014-2015, 887 brumley-grad scholars were enrolled in a postsecondary institution at some point during the year. Additionally, brumley-grad scholars enrolled in college, are provided $500 scholarships for up to eight semesters, to help defray tuition expenses. In fy2015 project grad atlanta disbursed $444,512 in scholarship funds. Additionally, eight (8) brumley-grad scholars were employed as teacher assistants to serve in the classrooms and share their experiences with the high school students that participated in the 2015 college institute.

It was a difficult time for her as she felt isolated, alone, and dependent on those around her.    Her father, a physician in Atlanta, heard about an organiztion that trained service dogs to help people in wheelchairs.  The program, which was located in California, had a long waiting list and worked mainly with those in their own region, so her father decided to start a similar program in Georgia.  Three weeks after the first planning meeting for Canine Assistants, her father was hit and killed by a drunk driver while he was taking a walk.  Determined to accomplish her dream and complete what her father had started, it took Jennifer and her mother ten years of hard work and dedication to open the program.  Fortunately, Jennifer no longer needs a wheelchair, yet she fully understands the needs and concerns of others with physical disabilities.  We no longer want people with disabilities to feel isolated and dependant on others.  The dogs trained at Canine Assistants can turn lights on and off, open doors, pull wheelchairs retrieve dropped objects, summon help, and provide secure companionship.  Yet, even more important than the physical skills they possess, is their ability to eliminate feelings of fear isolation, and loneliness felt by their companions.  One Canine Assistants' recipient made the value of this skill quite clear when asked by a reporter what she like most about her service dog, immediately she responded, "My service dog makes my wheelchair disappear."

"For I know the plans I have for you," declares the Lord, "plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future."  (Jeremiah 29:11)  Empowering an emerging generation to "get to the heart of the matter," and end the life-crippling barriers that prevent long-term success. By addressing root issues from their past and present, we teach them how to build a stable foundation for their future. With a holistic approach to stability and impacting them with the Love of Jesus Christ, the end result is a long-term reduction of issues such as illiteracy, juvenile delinquency, school drop-out rates, addictions, crime, incarceration, abortion, broken families, divorce and more.  After years of serving adult homeless men and women, we found that when the majority of them were young they were either in numerous foster homes, from broken homes, had absent parent(s), or for some other reason never formed a solid foundation in life. As a result, they experienced decades of financial, physical and emotional instability. Even when they did find shelter and food, they continued to navigate through life lonely and without hope.  This is why we now focus on the younger generation. Many young people today are at a disadvantage due to the breakdown of the family in our society. We often find children having children, with no idea how to be a parent. How can that young parent possibly give to their child what they never had? And so the cycle continues, with more and more young people who never received the love, affection, affirmation, stability or healthy structure they should have had.  While many of the young people we meet are indeed homeless, others simply have no hope. Through Homes of Purpose & Empowerment (HoPE) and our Power of Love Outreaches (POLO) we provide hope to the children, teens, young adults and young families that come across our path. We empower them with self-worth, a new perspective, hope and a future.	Through our housing programs, we have been able to make a lasting difference in the lives of many homeless, including young men, women & families, with a success rate of 79% moving on to various forms of stable housing.   Since 2008, prior to and including serving the younger generation, we served over 1400 homeless men, women & families and helped them find a place to call home.  We proudly achieve our goals with 93% of all funding going directly to our homes & outreaches.	the younger generation who come from foster care, group homes and broken homes	92	Metropolitan Atlanta	Homes of Purpose & Empowerment and POWER OF LOVE OUTREACH

Emphasis is placed on drug awareness and prevention since these are the number one enemies of all time in America. In addition, school dropout rates among teenagers is alarming. As a result, a program was enacted to encourage the continuation of the educational process through alternative methods such as vocational and night schools. We also encourage individuals to pursue a graduate equivalent diploma (GED). It was soon realized that working with teenagers ages 15 to 18 was not as productive as desired. Most teenagers have already formed opinions about life, and were greatly influenced by their peers rather than authoritive figures. In 1988, the focus was changed to a younger age group, and NUCUP adopted the motto: "It is Easier to Build a Child, Than to Repair an Adult".					Updates coming soon.

Habitat For Humanity International Inc	http://www.habitat.org	(800) 422-4828	EIN 91-1914868	322 W Lamar St	Americus	GA	31709	USA	Christianity, International, International Relief, Religion	Seeking to put god's love into action, habitat for humanity brings people together to build homes, communities and hope.					In fiscal year 2015, habitat for humanity served more than 1. 5 million people, or 300,000 families through a variety of programs, products and services. More than 2. 2 million people volunteered. In the u. S. And canada, habitat for humanity served roughly 30,000 people. More than 11,000 affiliate community projects were performed. In total, 1,448 local affiliates serve in all 50 states. Affiliates in puerto rico, guam and the u. S. Virgin islands, and 60 affiliates in canada round out the u. S. And canada service area. Examples in the u. S. And canada include: as communities continue years of long clean up and rebuilding from tornadoes and hurricanes, disaster response continues to serve alongside affiliates to insure individuals and families have the opportunity to recover into home. In fiscal year 2015, hfhi's disaster risk reduction and response department worked alongside affiliates to serve 458 u. S. Families through repairs, rehabilitations or new construction. Notable responses in the past year include the rebuilding of tornado damaged communities in arkansas, alabama and oklahoma, the ongoing recovery efforts in new york city and the jersey shore following superstorm sandy, and continued efforts to rebuild the gulf coast even after recognizing the 10th anniversary of hurricane katrina. Disaster corps volunteers contributed 4,839 hours of service over 22 deployments this year, supporting affiliates responding to and preparing for disasters. Habitat continues to increase its footprint in disaster risk reduction and response activities globally through the "pathways to permanence" framework, providing community-based interventions that support incremental progress toward permanent, durable shelter, while reducing the vulnerability of families and communities. Habitat's network of home improvement stores and donation centers continues the charge of developing staff through restore association program. The association program is offered hfhi as a way to pool resources, strategically grow the habitat restore brand, and help improve local operations. Affiliates who join the program choose levels of service. Full membership is $300 per month, per store to access services such as training and national donation procurement. The optional program offers the flexibility to meet a variety of needs for 147 members. In addition to the restore association program, restore opened 21 stores in new markets and added 11 stores to existing markets in fiscal year 2015, bringing the total to 851. About 40,000 volunteers were engaged in fiscal year 2015 through student-led, student-initiated programs such as campus chapters and collegiate challenge. Through these initiatives, which engaged youth and young professionals ages 5 to 40, volunteers are educating and advocating on behalf of the cause for affordable housing. More than $6. 9 million was raised toward assisting in providing others with decent, affordable housing by partnering with hfhi and local affiliates, as well as tithing toward habitat's international affiliates. Sixteen new affiliates adopted the neighborhood revitalization model this past year, bringing the total number of engaged affiliates to 241. The program's holistic approach continues to expand habitat's traditional partnership with homeowners and volunteers, as the program creates buy-in from neighbors, community leaders and local organizations to achieve a broader impact.   international program: in more than 70 countries, habitat for humanity international works with national habitat organizations and other partners to expand access to decent, affordable housing. The international work is divided administratively into three geographic areas: - asia and the pacific served 175,845 individuals with construction solutions in fy2015, and 4,300 additional individuals with housing support services. - europe, asia and the middle east served 126,565 individuals with construction solutions in fy2015, and 83,385 additional individuals with housing support services. - latin america and the caribbean served 160,140 individuals with construction solutions in fy2015, and 42,687 additional individuals with housing support services. In each area, approaches vary dramatically according to local needs and opportunities, but habitat programs in fy2015 shared some common themes: rebuilding after disasters. Habitat for humanity was involved in timely, multi-faceted disaster response and risk reduction around the world in fy 2015. When a magnitude-7. 8 earthquake struck nepal in april, more than 850,000 homes were destroyed. Habitat staff, volunteers and people from the affected communities quickly began to remove rubble, and in may, the first temporary shelter kits were distributed. Construction of permanent homes began in july, and habitat aims to support hundreds of thousands of families through both temporary and permanent shelter solutions. On the other side of the world, heavy spring rainfall in chile led to rivers overflowing, flooding and landslides. Soon after, the calbuco volcano erupted, generating heavy ash emissions. Habitat chile, in alliance with the chilean red cross and shelter box, distributed more than 1,500 emergency shelter kits to families in the affected areas. These kits included tools and materials to help them rebuild their homes. Expanding the use of housing microfinance to enable incremental housing improvements. For example, habitat microbuild india housing finance company pvt. Ltd. Is a housing finance company established as an initiative of hfhi and the mumbai-based financial services company ask group, with the aim of providing access to credit for housing improvements. Microbuild india has so far invested us$1. 42 million, serving more than 3,800 families. In el savador, the inter-american development bank approved a loan of us$5 million to habitat el salvador to improve the housing conditions of low-income families by offering them financing opportunities. With the proceeds of this loan, microloans will be awarded to 8,000 families over the next seven years for home improvements such as access to drinking water, electricity, and construction of bathrooms, kitchens, floors and ceilings. Working with vulnerable populations. These included the roma in romaina, hiv and aids orphans in several african countries, and women without secure land tenure rights in brazil. Habitat chile's program "our children return home" helped families with children who have special needs or severe illnesses by building, adapting or improving their homes. Linking improvements in housing with health, water and sanitation issues. Habitat entities worldwide focused on these issues, including the water for lives project by habitat brazil that helped 700 individuals have access to safe, usable water, and the finote salam water project in ethiopia that brought safe drinking water to a community of 2,100 for the first time. Encouraging environmental sustainability. According to the world bank, an estimated 2 million people die each year as a result of cooking over an open fire. To help families who live in extreme poverty and who cook over an open fire, habitat guatemala offers, at a subsidized rate, adobe stoves with a metal chimney that helps to filter harmful smoke from the house. Its design also allows for better heat retention, so it uses less wood, resulting in less deforestation and greater savings for the family. The smoke-free environment reduces burns and accidents. During fy2015, 250 stoves were installed in guatemala and 159 in mexico.   public awareness and education: through every possible medium - electronic, visual, spoken and printed - habitat for humanity strives to put shelter on the hearts and minds of people in such a powerful way that poverty housing and homelessness become unacceptable. Habitat world magazine, with a circulation of about 1 million, is the flagship publication, and habitat. Org is the primary electronic vehicle for sharing habitat's vision and information about its mission with the public. Habitat is also very active on many social media platforms, and produces and distributes public service announcements. A brief sampling of some of fy2015's events and activities: - the 31st annual jimmy & rosalynn carter work project brought together more than 8,000 volunteers to build and repair homes in dallas and fort worth, texas, in october 2104, just days after president carter's 90th birthday. - habitat's 2015 shelter report, "less is more: transforming low-income communities through energy efficiency" researched the benefits of improving energy efficiency among lower-income households, and made the case that too many families face the challenge of energy costs that are excessive compared to their overall incomes. - in observance of the united nations-designated world habitat day on the first monday in october, habitat affiliates across the united states and organizations around the world staged special events to raised awareness and educate individuals and communities to call for programs, policies, and systems that make possible a world where everyone has a decent place to live. - habitat provides a variety of programs that enable hundreds of thousands of volunteers to work alongside homeowners in building and repairing safe, decent, affordable homes. Among these are global village trips, including a group of u. S. Vietnam war veterans who returned to vietnam to build homes with vietnamese partners; care-a-vanners, hundreds of retirees in mobile homes who crisscross the country helping others; women build; and collegiate challenge.

To qualify for bert's big adventure, children must be between the ages of 5 and 12, live in "the bert show" radio listening area, prove financial need and have never been to walt disney world . Following the annual trip, bert's big adventure provides year-round support through initiatives such as the reunion adventures, the fairy godparent volunteer program and additional charitable services. The trip and programs allow the participants to create lasting bonds with others facing similar challenges as their own, experience activities that otherwise could not have been afforded, and enjoy the time spent together with family as the focus turns from the child's illness to making lasting memories.					This trip is an annual, five-day, all-expenses-paid trip to walt disney world for children with chronic and terminal illnesses and their families. Each year, we take 12 to 15 families, including all individuals living under the same roof as the child. From the limo rides and chartered flight to the character-filled parties and princess makeovers, the trip is nothing short of magical. Throughout the trip, each family is accompanied by a bert's big adventure liaison, allowing them to get the most out of their once-in-a-lifetime experience. While the true impact is difficult to measure numerically, the words of our bert's big adventure children's parents speak volumes. "the five days we spent with bert's big adventure were the best of my life. It wasn't just a trip but more of a magical journey that will provide a lifetime of warm, loving memories for my family i was humbled at the continued generosity that poured out towards all of the children. I witnessed disabled children dancing and trying to do things they aren't 'supposed' to be able to do. Bert's big adventure just pushes on with perseverance to make these children so happy that they are moved to do the impossible. At the heart of bert's big adventure's success is a purpose to provide these kids something they wouldn't be able to obtain elsewhere this overwhelmed me because the greatest gifts a child can receive are to be heard, to be listened to and to be loved. Too many typical people in our everyday world ignore these kids regularly if by simply not knowing or understanding a better way. "-tara malone, mother of noah, bert's big adventure 2012in 2014, 12 children and their families for a total of 72 persons were taken to disney aboard a chartered airplane for 5 days on a vip all-expense-paid trip. Accommodations, meals, special events, and transportation were at the expense of the foundation. A team of three medical staff were included in the trip (2 doctors and 1 nurse), along with additional support staff that included the bert's big adventure staff members, contracted videographers and photographers, and six volunteer members of the radio staff of the bert show. The atlanta renaissance airport hotel provided overnight accommodations for the families the night prior to the flight out of atlanta. This facility also provided a breakfast banquet in the banquet room for the morning broadcast and send off party pro bono.   a child with chronic or terminal illness may stay in the hospital for as long as three months at a time. The fairy godparent volunteer program provides support in the form of volunteers who visit each hospital-bound bert's big adventure child daily to bring fun crafts, a meal, spend time with the parents, provide a shoulder on which to lean, or just conversation. One visit may be focused on the child's needs; another visit might focus on the parents' needs. Desiree gilmore is the mother of abby gilmore, a bert's big adventure child who has spina bifida. Desiree loves this program and it is evident in here quote here: "those girls have cried with me and given me so much comfort. We enjoy their visits so much. Without them. . . Sometimes i don't know if i would have made it through our time at the hospital. We love, love the fairy godparent program. They are a blessing to the kids but they don't know how much of a blessing they are to the parents, as well. " in 2014, bert's big adventure's fairy godparent program served 18 hospitalized children totaling nearly 200 visits. There were 71 active volunteers performing these visits to the bert's big adventure children from all prior walt disney world trips. The expenses included in the cost were for direct small gifts for the children and food for the parents while staying with their children. The balance of expense involved the required uniform shirt, orientation and training for the volunteers.   the reunions are outlets for social activity and connection to people who are sharing similar experiences, which can make a world of difference to the families. Our reunion adventures invite bert's big adventure families of every program year and take the form of quarterly outings, such as a summer pool party, a trip to the fox theatre, the atlanta steeplechase or a holiday celebration with santa. These events are equally beneficial to children and adults, as everyone has a chance to share, connect and enjoy intimate family time away from doctor visits and hospital stays. Each quarter, an average of 80 percent of bert's big adventure children and family members return to attend the reunions. Each reunion offers a full meal and several activities to each family member in attendance. If the event requires an entry fee, bert's big adventure also covers that cost. There is no cost to the family for attending any reunion.   when a child in the foundation passes away, the foundation pays the cost of the funeral. In 2014, there were 2 funerals.

This program provides emergency safe shelter in a boarding situation or foster home, as well as any needed veterinary care, for animal victims of domestic violence while their human guardians seek safety themselves. The goal is to reunite pets with their families once a new safe living arrangement has been established. We maintain a 24-hour crisis hotline and work actively with family violence programs and law enforcement throughout the state.

They sustained their tropical forest agroecosystem since 200 BC by living in harmony with nature.  Due to shrinking earthly resources, the outside world is closing in on them and taking their timber, communal lands, and destroying what they''ve protected for subsequent generations since the beginning of time. There are 3.5 million acres of forests and jungle in Mondolkiri Province, Cambodia targeted by Chinese, Vietnamese, Malaysian, Thai, and other outside interests in collusion with corrupt Cambodian officials. 95% of these Montagnards are illiterate, they''re highly marginalized by the Cambodian Gov, and although the poorest people in Southeast Asia, they don''t want handouts and welfare.  All they want is an educated leadership to peacefully ensure protection of their resources while integrating equitably in the global economy.MISSION:  Mitigate global climate change by providing the indigenous ethnic minority Montagnard highlanders of Cambodia with an educated leadership to stop the destruction of their tropical forest agroecosystem by predatory development.Create the educated leadership from amongst their homeless child population. It will consist of 30 college graduates and 1,200 secondary school graduates providing a ratio of one to every five families and averaging 12 per village, cumulatively amounting to 4% of the rural Mondolkiri Province population.Provide graduates with further training in advocacy, human/gender rights, governance, environmental and cultural preservation, land rights, public health, and teachers ed. Employ 171 graduates in a village development and education program. Establish a community based organization for the balance of the educated leadership to engage in advocacy, pro poor market development, and to reduce illiteracy and improve public health.					There's no other program like this in the world.  See Paupers To Champions link at www.cambodiacorps.org.We have 130 secondary school students in our child's shelter on the northeast frontier.  This aspect of our program needs to expand rapidly.Twenty shelter graduates attend universities and reside in our Indigenous Student Center in Phnom Penh.  These graduates will provide the upper tier of the educated leadership for the Montagnards of Mondolkiri Province.

Frankie and Andy's Place	http://www.frankieandandysplace.org	(678)9362771	EIN 47-5260905	653 Gainesville Highway	Winder	GA	30680	USA	Animal Protection & Welfare, Animals	Frankie and Andys Place is a unique combination of senior dog shelter and emotional healing center for troubled humans. A beautiful log cabin, nestled in a picturesque Barrow County woodland setting, Frankie and Andys Place is home to a small number of gentle, loving senior dogs who have been cast aside by their humans and yet who still have many valuable gifts to share ..... These gifts of sympathy, time, reassurance and unconditional love are then shared with troubled humans in an atmosphere of calm and acceptance to help them mend.  Frankie and Andys Place ....... a healing collaboration between man and his best friend.	Long before the cabin had even been delivered, Connie Woofford contacted me to ask about our plans for Frankie and Andys Place as she had read about it on our Facebook page. She wanted to know if we would be interested in taking senior dogs to the Adult Day center in Winder, where adults of all ages but requiring supervision, could go to give their carers a respite for the day. I told her then that we would need to wait until we were up and running to check this out; last Thursday, due to her dogged persistence, she and I went to meet the folks there and introduce them to our mission and the tour de force that is...ERROL FLYNN! When we got there, it was after lunch, and we toured the facility, met the staff, and were able to meet some of the visitors.  One older gentleman, who introduced himself as Chuck Norris, ( you can only imagine how long he and I traded pretend ninja kicks....it was too much fun, honestly) wanted to hold Errol Flynn because he reminded him of his childhood dog, Trixie.  Of course, we heard him say this a few times, but both Connie and I were struck by the emotion it evoked in him....how simply touching this four pound ball of love seemed to happily transport him back to halcyon days. Another fan of Errol was a sweet lady who isn't allowed to have dogs at her care facility, but missed having the touch and love of one in her life. But for both Connie and I, the most unbelievable moment came when a young lady, who was quadriplegic and sitting in a wheel chair with her head tilted back, unable to speak or move her hands, was asked if she would like to meet Errol. She looked at him, their eyes met, we lifted her hand to gently stroke Errol, and her face lit up like a Christmas tree.  She started to laugh with such genuine glee, her whole face shone like a golden light, her mouth was so far open in a smile, the carers were floored! You see, she had not been feeling well when she arrived that day, and they had been concerned for her.  We lifted Errol to her neck and allowed him to nuzzle her gently, and she purred with delight. She cannot make a coherent sound, but she laughed! She truly laughed!  Folks, if these dogs do nothing useful ever again, what we saw on that day, with that young lady, made every single thing worth it. Errol Flynn, this little four pound dynamo, walked into a room, owned it and made everyone feel better. He spread the love like Gandhi, touching hearts everywhere he went, allowing himself to be passed from one person to the next, hugging and snuggling his way into their hearts. 15 people became balls of mush at his very presence. Because of confidentiality guidelines, we are not allowed to post pictures yet, or give names; we are hoping that will come soon.  We will be visiting, at this our second adult day center location, there every week starting on Monday, and I cannot even begin to thank Connie for the work that she has done to get this going.

The beauty and serenity of this environment combined with the wisdom and empathy of some of our working dogs has brought comfort and relief to a number of humans dealing with anxiety, fear, self-harming issues and bipolar disorders. All under the watchful eye and guidance of an experienced mental health professional. This shelter provides a home like environment, furnished comfortably, with sleeping quarters for the dogs, but also a main living area where they can come together and mingle with their carers and work with whoever needs them.

Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning (LGBTQQ) youth remain under attack. As we all know, and are constantly reminded, those who are willing to bring harm to young people not only sprout up daily, but the predators have a very strong network of constant support and solid protection.   YouthPride is a safe, supportive development and resource center where youth can actually feel, and be, safe and secure.  At YouthPride, LGBTQQ youth are free from bullying, free from ridicule, and free from predators. At YouthPride we believe that LGBTQQ youth are just as important, just as deserving as their heterosexual counterparts.  YouthPride continues to offer counseling, social services, computer usage, nightly discussion forums, HIV testing, and recreational programming. All services are FREE, client-centered, and, quality driven. None of YouthPrides services have strings attached.   YouthPride prevented 22 suicides in 2012. Additionally, 63 youth were matched with stable, safe housing.  YouthPride is asking you to be a GUARDIAN of LGBTQQ youth. Support YouthPride in continuing to protect LGBTQQ youth. Support YouthPride in providing a truly appropriate, healthy environment for LGBTQQ youth.  Its easy to sit on the sidelines and express outrage about mistreatment of LGBTQQ youth with no outcome. It doesnt matter if you are gay or straight. Be meaningful. Do something good. Stand firm. Be a Guardian.	LGBTQ Youth Ages 13-24		Atlanta Metro Area	Discussion Groups  For youth who realize they are gay, lesbian, bisexual, questioning, or have gender issues, there are few havens. Many adults in schools and religious institutions either deny that gays and lesbians exist or condemn homosexuality outright. LGBTQQ youth often feel ashamed and vulnerable in the very places where they should feel the safest.  YouthPride feels offering weekly discussion groups is one of the most valuable services it can provide. All groups are facilitated by trained adult and youth volunteers and operated according to a set of rules developed by YP Staff, Board of Directors, and Youth. Every group begins with a review of group rules. All information exchanged during meetings is confidential.

We strive to be a dynamic leader in the production and development of contemporary theatre in the southeast. We passionately connect our audiences to accessible and relevant plays that are new to our region. We also cultivate diverse new artists and audiences for contemporary theatre through innovative artistsic development, education and outreach programs.					During the past year, horizon served over 38,000 people, with our season of atlanta, southeast and world premieres of contemporary plays (260+ performances) and our artistic development and education programs. Mainstage plays produced included the world premiere of third country by suehyla el-attar (commissioned and developed through the new south play festival with support from the map foundation), the southeastern premiere of the drama every tongue confess by nationally known and award winning african american playwright, marcus gardley, the atlanta premiere of the comedy, the book club play by karen zacarias, madelines christmas by jennifer kirkeby and shirley mier (a family series production) and the santaland diaries by david sedaris. Third country received the 2013-2014 gene gabriel moore award for playwriting from the suzi awards. Horizon garners attention on the nation scene as a center for development of new plays and writers from our region. Our new south play festival, which just completed its 17th year, develops and produces new plays from, for and about the contemporary urban south, with an emphasis on plays by women, writers of color and writers based in the south. We have developed over 50 new works and the festival has been hailed by creative loafing as the place that finds and defines southern plays. This year horizon theatre focused on the development and world premiere production of third country, a commissioned work that highlighted and explored the immigrant and refugee population in clarkston, ga. Third country played to strong audiences, made many strong community partnerships and was awarded best new play by the suzi awards. We workshopped three new plays, all commissioned by horizon theatre: a plus by sean lewis about public education; freed spirits by daryl lisa fazio, a comedy set in historic oakland cemetery; and the seed planters by gabrielle fulton about the legacy of women activists in the civil rights movement. Our education and outreach engages young audiences, families, and developing artists with theatre that speaks to their lives. Programs include our family series (plays that combine adult professionals with amateur children on stage for high quality, low cost family programming), new south young playwrights contest and festival (competitively selected intensive for high school and college age writers to develop skills in writing, critical thinking and creativity), and apprentice & intern companies (training for college and post-college early career professionals). We hosted classes and camp stardust for children in collaboration with our education partner atlanta childrens theatre. This year, horizon also continued to work on the partnership it initiated between five theatres, the atlanta intown theatre partnership, an organization designed to support and leverage the collective strengths of five mid-sized non-profits theatre in atlanta. Horizon continued to take an active role in the stewardship of a large start-up grant of this new non-profit support organization for the five theatres.

Caleb Foundation - Save Life With Pennies Inc.	http://www.savelifewithpennies.org	18887881740	EIN 45-5614340		Lawrenceville	GA	30043	USA	Education, Food, Food Programs, Health, Health Support, Nutrition, Student Services	Our mission is to provide hope and resources for those who are underprivileged.	Throughout the year, the organization will sponsor underprivileged children in Ethiopia.  Any child or family, who has been affected by AIDS/HIV, domestic abuse, poverty, or any handicapped child, or child with a handicapped parent, qualifies for our sponsorship as long as funds are available.  To date we have sponsored 201 children in Ethiopia.  Our goal is to provide medication, nutrition and education to those who are in need.   In our Education for All program, our primary focus is on underprivileged children aged 5 to 6 years old.  Primary school education in Ethiopia has two cycles; one from age 7 to 10 years (grades 1 to 4) and one from age 11 to 14 years (grades 5 to 8).  Secondary education also has two cycles from age 15 to 16 years (grades 9 and 10) and from age 17 to 18 years (grades 11 to 12), leading up to the national exams. The government of Ethiopia pays the monthly school fee for both primary and secondary school. However, there are the annual school registration fee and the cost of school uniforms and school supplies that are not paid for by the government of Ethiopia. Therefore, during the primary school education and secondary school education, our foundation can help underprivileged students by paying for their annual school registration fee, school uniforms and school supplies.  The main challenge that underprivileged parents are facing is with children who are younger than 7 years old.  Since the kindergarten school system is privately owned, the underprivileged parents are unable to afford the monthly payment to involve their children in the early education system.  When these children start their primary school at grade 1, they are at a disadvantage compared with children whose parents can afford early education in kindergarten.  This affects the underprivileged children both mentally and psychologically.  In 2015, Education for All program, we were able to help 59 underprivileged kindergarten students to graduate from a private school.    Caleb foundation believes in the old English saying, Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.  One of our main plans is to make a permanent change in underprivileged families.  Therefore for our Food For All program, we picked 23 single mothers, who are struggling to provide food to their children, to start a small business with only $1,000.00 Ethiopian Birr for each, which is equivalent to $50.00 US dollar for each family.  By doing so, the mothers were able to provide food for their children for the whole year.	children and families affected by poverty, diseases, and domestic violence.	219 Children in Ethiopia	USA and Ethiopia	The specific purpose of Caleb Foundation  Save Life with Pennies is to support children and families affected by poverty, diseases, and domestic violence.

We offer education assistance to youth via our creative writing courses, teen book clubs, back to school clothing drive, as well as mentoring to "at risk" teens through our trouble to triumph and job shadowing programs. To date, thomf has mentored more than 1,300 youths on anger management, resisting peer pressure, and proper study habits.					Creative writing - fiction, screen, and stage. For at-risk youths who dream of being a writer, the hearts of men foundation's eight-part art of commercial fiction gives them a glimpse of a writing career and the life of a writer. Students are immersed in creative exercises that stretch their ability to write, envision possibilities, and overcome writer's block. The students are able to participate in provocative class discussions that validate our writing processes. Thomf believes the tips, techniques, and advice that our published writers and educators provide to our students are invaluable as these students discover the right niches for their work. During this fiscal year, thomf trained 86 young writers at its tucker recreation center campus in tucker, ga. Thomf also taught media courses on screenwriting and stage plays. We trained our students to write compelling screenplays that are impossible to stop reading, vividly cinematic, properly formatted, and realistically producible. Our screenwriting courses guided our students in creating characters, building plots, shaping scenes, sharpening dialogue, and, of course, peddling their scripts. For stage plays, we taught how to choose a good story, dramatize it, and structure it to retain the interest of a theatrical audience. During this fiscal year, thomf's students participated in the production of the "dark child" video. All of our media courses were held at our tucker recreation center campus in tucker, ga.   triumph - man-up, pen 2 pencil, and ged. The hearts of men foundation is proud that it has touched more than 1,400 youths in weekly mentoring programs and that it has redirected many previously incarcerated youths to college campuses. The at-risk students in our trouble to triumph program have been incarcerated, expelled, or suspended from traditional schools. Our program begins with man-up (men accepting neophytes and uplifting pupils). Man-up uses seminars to instill anger management and to role play in proven methods of resisting destructive peer pressure. For our successful graduates, we redirect them to partners who then provide additional opportunities to complete high-school diplomas (our ged option) and continue into college (our pen 2 pencil option). During this fiscal year, thomf mentored 56 at-risk youths in man-up. All triumph training took place in or around juvenile detention centers. Consequently, the budget for triumph was mainly for fuel and maintenance on a van provided by the dekalb county department of recreation.   lifestyle - food, clothing, shelter, medical, and entertainment. Typical at-risk youths in any of thomf's programs do not have all the basic necessities that traditional teachers take for granted. Our students can enter our classrooms hungry, shoeless, and wearing ragged clothing. Some don't have basic toiletries. Almost none has pen and paper. And some really appreciate an opportunity to kick back in safety with their peers and enjoy entertainment such as a group movie rental. Consequently, our major lifestyle expenditures for 106 students this fiscal year were food ($4,203), clothing ($1,840), shelter ($1,620), entertainment ($103), and medical ($25). Thomf spent none of its contributions on traditional expenditures such as salaries, capital funds, or capital equipment. We depended on our donors' vision and generosity to underwrite 100% of our youth programs. We believe our programs are making small, incremental improvements in the lives of our principal customers: young, under educated, overly streetwise, black youth. We also believe that our various programs are scalable, and that with good management controls and great volunteers, our youth programs within the hearts of men foundation can reach a larger audience.   the hearts of men foundation helped produce the "dark child" video as a literacy exercise.

MissionFish is a social enterprise of the Points of Light Institute, representing another form of how we support people's power to change the world. It does this by enabling people to sell or purchase products through eBay to benefit the nonprofit causes they care about. MissionFish has raised more than $125 million charitable dollars for over 15,000 nonprofits worldwide.  A Convergence of Now Our collective network- now the largest in the nation - manages millions of volunteers and 50,000 volunteer driven community impact projects annually around the country. We are unleashing the power of people to solve problems and build communities. We are generating ideas, telling the story and creating new tools for change-making.  Why Now? Once in a generation, a seismic shift occurs that fundamentally transforms our civic landscape. In the world of volunteerism and civic action, that moment is now. Cultural shifts are opening new avenues to address the challenges of volunteerism. Across America, technology-driven social networking and mobile technology are redefining the nature of interaction, shaping a new culture of communication. There is a resurgence of interest in the inner workings of government, schools, community and social change. There is a new energy around the idea of individual and collective exchange to create value and meaning that results in safe, connected and healthy communities. People are starting to ask how they can be involved and what they can do.  What We Do We ensure that there are volunteer and community participation opportunities for people through the country and increasingly, around the world. We engage individuals, corporations, nonprofits and government institutions to incubate, develop and mobilize collaborative citizen leadership, thus creating innovative, actionable solutions that can be replicated across the world. We empower individuals to create real-time community solutions which drive systemic change.

The objective is to encourage innovative programs that empower children and youth around the world to work individually and collectively to solve environmental problems in their neighborhoods and communities. The focus is to educate and inspire children to become great stewards of the planet and live eco-friendly lives. Through environmental education, we believe that children can achieve a better understanding and appreciation for the world in which they live.					Grants are awarded to public schools and nonprofit organizations that serve youth in grades k-12 for hands-on environmental education projects. Grants are given based on the positive environmental impact that should result from the proposed project, the ability for the project to be sustainable over time and the project's effectiveness in using an investigative approach and student direct learning. Through the grants awarded, students have the opportunity to repair damage to ecosystems in their communities and in many cases prevent further deterioration. The students become more connected with their school and community surroundings while gaining the skills needed to apply what they learned in the classroom to situations in their everyday lives that require critical thinking and interpersonal skills.

In the past year we served 4,636 individual women and children.		Below is a brief summary of each of the programs offered to our guests:   The Critical Needs Program, the most utilized service we offer each day, provides the basic necessities that so many of us take for granted. Shelter from the elements, meals to ease hunger, clothing, hygiene items, shower and laundry facilities, phone and mail services, MARTA transportation pass distribution, and childcare items like diapers, formula, and baby food are just some of the needs filled by this program. In 2010 through our Critical Needs Program, we served 30,305 breakfasts and 38,598 lunches, distributed 206 household and food pantry bags, had over 8,000 visits by the women and children to our clothing closets, and distributed countless numbers of hygiene items. In addition, we purchased 2,200 round-trip MARTA passes and 630 7-day MARTA passes to assist our guests with safe travel to and from job interviews, doctor appointments, and access to other off-site services.   The Medical Care Program is on-site four days a week. Crucial to life on the streets is our guests health. There were 2,220 medical appointments with our on-site nurses in 2010. We are able to offer flu shots, immunizations, back to school check-ups, mammograms, podiatry services, and healthcare advice to our guests. On-site counseling for mental health issues is also offered at the Shelter. In addition, our services provide for the purchase of prescription medications for our guests. Nutrition and hygiene classes are also offered along with parenting classes. We partner with professional volunteers who conduct hearing, vision, dental exams, and other testing services for our guests.      The Job Readiness Program includes assistance with resume writing, interview training, customer service skills, and self-esteem building workshops. The Atlanta Day Shelter offers assistance and stipends for women to go back to school or complete the GED certification courses. In the fall of 2010, 19 women entered college with an education stipend from the Atlanta Day Shelter. In addition, the Shelter assists guests in the procurement of legal documents needed for employment or schooling. Often our guests might secure an interview, but find that they lack the appropriate identification needed to secure the position. Each birth certificate we purchase in the state of Georgia costs $15 (out of state birth certificates range from $20-$35); while a legal identification is $5. In 2010, the Atlanta Day Shelter purchased 153 state of Georgia birth certificates, 111 out-of-state birth certificates, and 109 legal identifications. The Job Readiness Program also assists guests with the fees associated with transferring their out-of-state nursing licenses to the state of Georgia so that they may pursue a position in the field of nursing in Georgia.  On average, our job counselors meet with 45-55 women on a daily basis. Along with this program, the Computer Training Program offers on-site staffed training courses such as Introduction to Computers, Intermediate Word, and Excel. In 2010, 285 women graduated from the training courses with certificates of completion that helped make them more competitive in the job market. The Job Readiness Program has been a mainstay of our organization since 1990, offering 20 years of successful and effective job placement services and skills training to our guests. In the past year we placed our guests in 127 full-time positions and 18 part-time positions.    The Housing and Social Services Program provides our guests aid in finding and maintaining housing. Our trained Social Service Counselors meet with women to find emergency nighttime housing placement when they first arrive at the Shelter. Our counselors also assist with finding support for guests suffering from addictions or physical disabilities. In order to support the women as they find housing, we offer $100 for use towards rent or utility bills and deliver housing starter kits to guests complete with some of the basic necessities needed in a new home. Guests are also directed towards additional resources such as furniture banks and thrift-store donation centers.     The Children and Youth Program provides a safe, clean, and nurturing environment for the children at the Atlanta Day Shelter. Last year, we served 1,265 children from newborn to 18 years old. Mothers rely on our childcare facility and youth programs when they are in computer training courses, job placement oriented classes or interviews, and our other programs. Our Youth Programs are designed to educate, enrich, and empower our younger guests. Among the educational opportunities we offer to the children are early education classes (ABCs, numbers, colors, and shapes), story-time in our on-site library, food and nutrition classes, supervised computer classes for pre-teens, and hygiene instruction. Our staff and volunteers work to ensure that each child in our program realizes how important they are and what possibilities their lives hold.

Rebuilding lives is our passion.	Elks Aidmore has provided services to Georgias at-risk youth, like foster children, for over 75 years through a wide range of programs. Starting in the 1930s, Elks Aidmore provided services through clinics for youth who suffered from physical disabilities. This work led to the creation of the Elks Aidmore Hospital in Atlanta, which served the population until 1976. In 1977, Elks Aidmore changed its mission to focus on foster care. For the most part, Elks Aidmore has been self-sustaining and has received little assistance from public or corporate organizations.  Since 2007, half of GAs providers have closed their doors, but Elks Aidmore is fully committed to providing services to children that are in foster care. Four years ago, Elks Aidmores board made a major decision to reduce services, while researching foster care needs in Georgia. The outcome of the reorganization was to expand services beyond residential care for young ladies. This decision was made to meet the need generated by the countrys economic recession and the growing population of youth and families that need specialized services. The vision was the beginning of Elks Aidmores expansion, which included creating a transitional plan, hiring staff, and completing state applications to expand in target service areas. Current services are focused on providing youth and families with the necessary skills and resources to help heal their hearts, restore their hopes and rebuild their lives. These services include:  - Residential: 141 acre campus based program in Conyers Georgia offering safe housing; education; GED and vocational training; individual, group and family therapy; health and wellness classes; life skills development; job skills development and a preparation for independent living curriculum. The center operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, 365 days per year, serving youth between the ages of 12-21.  - Transitional Living: Campus-based and community-based apartment living for youth transitioning from foster care to independence; support services are provided during the transition period. The program is designed to meet the merging and independent needs of young adults between the ages of 18 and 21.  - Therapeutic Foster Care: Thoroughly screened and highly trained foster families are used to meet the specialized needs of foster youth, from ages 4 to 21, in a family setting. Youth in Therapeutic Foster Care receive the same services available in the residential programs, combined with a wrap of services offered through the Community Based Alternatives for Youth initiative.  - Community Based Alternatives for Youth: A non-residential program designed to keep high risk youth from ages 4 to 18 in their families and communities. The program wraps services around youth and families, using natural and informal family and community supports.  Elks Aidmores work is important because Elks Aidmore works to rebuild lives that have been impacted by various degrees of abuse and neglect with a goal of reducing the homeless and incarceration cycle for former foster children. In 2012, over 220,000 hours of services were provided to youth under these various programs. Since 1977, Elks Aidmore has provided over 16 million service hours to Georgia families.  Elks Aidmore is a founding member of Multi-Agency Alliance for Children (MAAC), and its CEO serves as the board president. MAAC is a collaboration of 7 agencies (Creative Community Services; Devereux Georgia; Elks Aidmore; CHRIS Kids; Georgia Baptist Childrens Homes & Family Ministries; Hillside; and, Twin Cedars) that work together to provide placements and wrap-around supports to children that are in foster care who require a higher level of care.
