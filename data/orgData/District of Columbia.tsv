Humane Society International	http://www.humanesocietyinternational.org	(202) 452-1100	EIN 52-1769464	1255 23rd Street Nw Suite 450	Washington	DC	20037	USA	Animal Protection & Welfare, Animals	Through the generous support of our donors and the compassionate engagement of our advocates, humane society international (hsi) extends the work of the humane society of the united states around the globe to promote the human-animal bond, protect street animals, support farm animal welfare, stop wildlife abuse, curtail and eliminate painful animal testing, confront cruelty to animals in all of its forms and respond to disasters with life-saving and rescue activity wherever it happens.			(companion animals) hsi is campaigning against the legal and illegal trade in ten million or more dogs destined for human consumption, amidst mounting concerns for human health and animal welfare. Hsi's work with the soi dog foundation to target border regions between thailand and vietnam where rabies is an issue. In regional efforts, chinese activists have, with hsi's support rescued thousands of dogs from meat traders' trucks in china. Hsi sponsored its annual world spay day in february. More than 600 event organizers around the world held events to spay or neuter thousands of animals. Ten dogs rescued from the streets of sochi, russia, the site of the 2014 winter olympics, are now in the united states and adopted out, thanks to the care and efforts of the povodog animal shelter in sochi and humane society international and our emergency placement partners. Hsi continues to support large-scale street dog sterilization programs in bhutan, india, bangladesh, the philippines, latin america and the pacific. Hsi's disaster program ended its response in haiti, responded to a fire disaster in chili and assisted animal sanctuaries in west africa threatened by the ebola outbreak.   (wildlife) last year, poachers killed at least 35,000 african elephants, a surge widely attributed to rising demand for ivory in china and other places. Hsi worked to persuade countries to destroy stockpiles of seized ivory to raise awareness about the elephant poaching crisis (china destroyed 6. 1 tons and hong kong 29. 6 tons). Hsi has long advocated that japan stop whaling in both the southern ocean and the north pacific, where japan says it is carrying on a scientific program. In 2014, as a result of a long term hsi strategy, the top united nations court (ijc) ordered japan to end antarctic whaling. The icj (international court of justice) ruled that japan's whaling activities do not qualify under the exemption for research whaling. Hsi and the government of vietnam are working together to reduce rhino horn demand and consumption in that country. The campaign has already reached over 10 million vietnamese and reduced consumer buying of rhino horn according to a national survey. In an historic world trade organization (wto) ruling, the european union ban on the seal product trade was upheld, with hsi exerting its influence through an amicus brief submitted to the wto appellate body. An appeal from hsi/india to jet airways resulted in implementation of a ban on the carriage of shark fins aboard its planes. Other airlines are following with bans of their own.   (farm animals) hsi is working in mexico, brazil, costa rica and many other countries to end the lifelong confinement of breeding sows in gestation crates. We're asking multinational food retailers who are already phasing out gestation crates in the united states to extend their crate-free policies to latin america and beyond, and petitioning food companies, local restaurants, supermarkets and producers to also adopt more humane practices. Hsi worked with arcos dorados (largest mcdonald's franchise in latin america) to gain their commitment to use "crate-free" pork. Global food giant heinz announced animal welfare improvements in its sustainable sourcing policy. The company, which had already pledged to work with its suppliers globally to find solutions to reduce the use of battery cages, committed to ensure that 20 percent of its eggs are cage free by the end of 2015 in its north american operations. Heinz's move is a result of discussions with humane society international.

(HCS) is a non-profit 501(c)3 organization founded in 1972 to provide comprehensive housing counseling, training, advocacy and housing opportunities for low and moderate income home buyers, homeowners and tenants; to help them to achieve successful living in healthy, safe and affordable homes.  Our goal is to prevent homelessness and increase access to long-term housing opportunities by providing the skills, self-esteem and empowerment necessary within families and communities.  Further, HCS works to build the individual and group capacity for economic, physical and social development of homes, neighborhoods and communities.   	HCS believes in a bottom-up approach to community services and believes that by training and educating our clients, they will be better equipped to gain control over their own lives and environments.  HCS stresses that counseling is merely a conduit for improved conditions; and therefore supports, participates in and advocates for increased development of affordable housing.  HCS places additional priorities in removing barriers for groups without adequate access to services such as immigrant, Spanish speaking, handicapped, homeless and elderly populations.  	 	Through a comprehensive delivery of services, HCS prevents homelessness; strengthens the abilities and self-esteem of individuals and communities to prevent problems from recurring; empowers individuals, families and communities to take control of housing and community development opportunities; develops affordable housing opportunities; ensures that families secure access to social, economic and other services and programs in order to prevent deterioration and improve family and community structures; and prevents the stress on family and community structures caused by overpriced, unsafe and overcrowded housing and the lack of housing opportunities.

COUNSELING/SOCIAL SERVICES:  The goal of this component is to reduce the stress on individuals and families caused by substandard, unsafe and overpriced housing.  This is implemented through comprehensive housing counseling and social service referrals.  While HCS assists households with an immediate housing problem, the ultimate goal is to assist clients to anticipate and avoid future problems and become self-sufficient.  Counseling entails intensive one-on-one sessions and closely monitored client actions. ADVOCACY:  The goal of this component is to work on behalf of clients to assist them to secure safe, decent and affordable housing.  HCS assists clients in learning their rights and responsibilities and in securing services and opportunities.  An objective of this service area is to prevent and fight discrimination in housing, prevent the loss of affordable housing, and to rectify unfair and inadequate treatment.  HCS assists persons who have economic, language, age, educational and physical barriers in securing good and affordable housing. Advocacy entails monitoring clients through a legal battle, purchase process, rental process, foreclosure or other crisis.  HCS offers special assistance to Spanish speaking clients and maintains an active relationship with other bi-lingual organizations.   TRAINING:  The goal of this component is to assist people to develop skills necessary to meet their own housing need.  HCS offers workshops and courses on all housing issues, providing step-by-step instruction and informational workbooks to be used as ongoing resources.  DEVELOPMENT:  The goal of this component is to provide technical assistance, counseling and training during the conversion process to coop or condo.

HOMEOWNERSHIP TRAINING AND COUNSELING PROGRAM:  This component is designed to prepare first time homebuyers for making important decisions through a firm understanding of what the purchase process and homeownership entails.  HCS has developed a comprehensive program that reduces property deterioration and foreclosures and improves financing opportunities.  The program starts with previously "unbankable" tenants, and prepares them for home-ownership, providing training and technical assistance during the process and offering follow-up counseling and training.

The Project on Government Oversight, Inc.	http://www.pogo.org	202-347-1122	EIN 52-1739443	1100 G Street NW Suite 500	Washington	DC	20005	USA	Civil Rights, Government & Public Administration, Public Finance, Taxation & Monetary Policy	The Project On Government Oversight (POGO) is a nonpartisan independent watchdog that champions good government reforms. POGO's investigations into corruption, misconduct, and conflict of interest achieve a more effective, accountable, open and ethical federal government.	Some recent examples of our work are:  A) Partnered with IAVA to help Veterans. As concerns of mismanagement and deception within the Department of Veterans Affairs mount, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA) and the Project On Government Oversight (POGO) entered into a partnership to protect VA staff who come forward with information about agency wrongdoing. As part of the effort, the organizations have launched a secure website, www.VAOversight.org, where VA employees can get in touch with POGO and IAVA. The effort combines IAVAs deep knowledge of the VA system with POGOs experience working with whistleblowers to expose federal wrongdoing.  In an effort to stem the tide of negative publicity, the Inspector General of the VA has subpoenaed POGO in an attempt to find out who the whistleblowers are. POGO has refused to allow the government to learn the identity of the brave people who have come forth to alert the public of its misdoings.   B) Received  Journalism Awards. POGO won in June 2014 the Dateline Award for investigative reporting from its local chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists for its project on lax security at U.S. embassies overseas. It also won a business journalism award for its reporting on efforts by former employees of the Securities and Exchange Commission to influence regulations.  C) Increased transparency around drone program. After POGO signed onto an amicus curiae brief in 2013 authored by EPIC in NY Times v. DOJ supporting release of the classified legal analysis justifying the controversial targeted killing drone program, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of increased transparency. The Court found that after senior Government officials have assured the public that the program is lawful and that . . . advice establishes the legal boundaries, it can no longer claim that the document is exempt from FOIA.   D) Elected Chair of the Civil Society Sector of the USEITI.  POGO Executive Director Danielle Brian was elected the chair of the Civil Society sector of the US EITI), a Federal Advisory Board composed of civil society, industry, and government members. In that role, POGO has helped organize outreach efforts to provide residents of communities directly impacted by extractive industries to have a voice in the crafting of transparency commitments that have been presented to the international EITI board by the U.S. Secretary of the Interior. The outreach is being conducting across the country from Alaska to New Orleans, involving impoverished communities including Native American tribes, Appalachia, the Gulf region, as well as Pennsylvania lands where hydraulic fracturing is being conducted.  E) Closed Revolving Door Loophole at the SEC. Thanks to efforts by POGO, the SEC decided to close a loophole in the ethics rules that allowed some senior SEC personnel to lobby the agency immediately after leaving instead of staying on the sidelines for a year or more, as employees at other federal agencies must do. The change in the rulesrevoking a longstanding exemption for some SEC officialsis a rare stand against the revolving door at an agency that has long blurred the lines between the regulators and the regulated.  F) Removed Officer Unfit to Oversee Whistleblowers. A November 2013 POGO letter to Secretary Hagel asked for the removal of Major General Patton from his post as head of sexual assault prevention due to an investigation that found him guilty of violating the Military Whistleblower Protection Act. The letter resulted in news coverage of the issue and over 2,500 letters to the DoD from POGO supporters. A mere four weeks after POGOs letter, the Pentagon announced Major General Pattons plan to retire. A congressional staffer close to the issue told POGO that the impetus for Pattons retirement was the unwelcome attention from POGO.  G) POGO Recommendations on Contracting Reform featured in New York Times Editorial. In a very harsh critique of federal contracting rules, the New York Times editorial board cited POGOs recommendations as a solution to the current practice of contracting out vast swaths of government work indefinitely  with little or no attempt to develop the needed technical and managerial expertise within the government or to enforce labor standards  which has created a bloated federal-contractor sector in which the public good is often subservient to profit.  H) Strengthened Protections for Military Whistleblowers Signed into Law. Thanks to efforts by POGO, Congress has passed protections for military whistleblowers and victims of sexual assault against unfair retaliation which were signed into law by the President. This new law will help protect service members who make the difficult and brave decision to come forward and report sexual assault or other misconduct. POGO fought hard for passage of these reforms to upgrade the disgracefully broken whistleblower protections for our troops.   I) Enforced Defense Contractor Rules Regarding Purchase of US-Made Products. POGO helped to expose that the Defense Department hasnt been following the mandates for purchasing US-made products and instead was illegally supplying our troops with boots manufactured in China. POGO urged Congress to call for a DoD Inspector General (IG) audit into the DoDs compliance with existing domestic preference laws, including the Buy American Act and the Berry Amendment. As a result, in August 2013, the DoD IG announced a preemptive audit, stating that it anticipated that legislation was forthcoming.	The United States	A.

Openstreetmap is a web wiki project to create a free and open map of the entire world, built entirely by volunteers surveying with gps, digitizing aerial imagery, and collecting and liberating existing public sources of geographic data. The information in openstreetmap can fill in the gaps in base map data to assist in responses to disasters and crises. In the same way that the openstreetmap data bridges the missing information, the humanitarian openstreetmap team (hot), acts as a bridge between the traditional humanitarian responders and the openstreetmap community. Hot works both remotely and physically in countries to assist the collection of geographic data, usage of that information and training others in openstreetmap.			Haiti:in the time since march 2010 that hot has been working in haiti, there have been six field missions and three months of continuous support. Additionally, hundreds have been trained in osm through workshops and data collection programs. As a result of these actions, openstreetmap has been put in the forefront in haiti. The openstreetmap data had been improved upon and strong capacities built in the un system, part of the haitian government and in the civil society. In the future, further improvement to the data will occur as well as updates to it as needed. In march of 2010, hot began to lead its first field mission to haiti to help responding organizations, government of haiti (goh) entities and civil society groups to use openstreetmap. There were two components to this: using that data and contributing directly to the openstreetmap project by adding the data themselves. Eventually this fostered the emergence of the community openstreetmap haiti (cosmha), a hatiain openstreetmap organization which seeks to continue the development of the openstreetmap community in haiti. Hot and cosmha together have worked with the international organization for migration and its partners in the u. N. System as well as the government of haiti to further development of the osm data. This program includes baseline (transportation, education, health, water and sanitation facilities), humanitarian (hurricane disaster shelters and cholera-response structures) and community mapping as well as capacity building programs. Hot has continued to be active in haiti through 2012, though primarily in a support role to cosmha. This support is additionally provided with grassroots united, another partner working in haiti. Activities consist of further advanced training, help in project design, as well as organizational and technical assistance in current projects. The eventual goal is for cosmha to be self-sustaining and not need the assistance of hot.   indonesia:base data serves many needs in humanitarian response and often responding organizations are scrambling to gather data because it is not readily available. The focus of the program in indonesia has been disaster risk reduction to help collect data and perform analysis before a disaster strikes. A team of local staff provide workshops in mapping tools including openstreetmap, qgis and inasafe for universities, ngos and government. The goal of these trainings is to provide disaster managers with better analysis tools to prepare contingency plans.   remote response and other general programs:the humanitarian openstreetmap team maintains a network of individual volunteers, partner ngos, and international organizations to collect data after an event. The scale of the response depends on the size of the event and the ability of hot to respond effectively. In prior years, hot has responded to the tsunami in japan, an earthquake in turkey, continued unrest in the ivory coast, and famine in somalia.

Inspiring Change. Improving Lives.   The Institute for Women's Policy Research (IWPR) conducts rigorous research and disseminates its findings to address the needs of women, promote public dialogue, and strengthen families, communities, and societies. The Institute works with policymakers, scholars, and public interest groups to sign, execute, and disseminate research that illuminates economic and social policy issues affecting women and their families, and to build a network of individuals and organizations that conduct and use women-oriented policy research. Key program areas include: Employment, Education, & Economic Change; Democracy & Society; Poverty, Welfare, & Income Security; Work & Family; and Health & Safety. IWPR's work is supported by foundation grants, government grants and contracts, donations from individuals, and contributions from organizations and corporations. IWPR is a 501 (c) (3) tax-exempt organization that also works in affiliation with the women's studies and public policy programs at The George Washington University.	IWPRs research fuels debate, informs policy and programmatic priorities, and improves womens lives.  IWPR's research has helped policymakers, advocates, community leaders, and the media separate myth from fact for almost 25 years. By providing rigorous and reliable data analysis, IWPR has worked each year to shine a light on misleading information and provide credible information on overlooked populations. For instance, IWPR's research has shown that: Hispanic women earn only 53 percent of what white men earn for full-time, year-round work.  African American women earn only 62 percent.  Women of all races earn 77 percent of what men earn for full-time, year-round work. Updated twice per year, IWPRs Gender Wage Gap Fact Sheet is used by advocates and policymakers to build support for passage of the Paycheck Fairness Act. Nearly half of private sector workers lack paid sick days. Businesses like restaurants, nursing homes, and child care centers are among the least likely to provide any paid sick days, putting the public at increased risk of contagion. IWPR's series of reports and testimonies on paid sick days have been used nationally and in individual states to support campaigns for paid sick days. The poverty of families headed by single mothers would fall by half if the wage gap were eliminated. IWPR's Equal Pay for Working Families report from 1999 was used to introduce pay equity legislation in the states. IWPRs work and experts are cited and appear regularly in almost a thousand media sources each year, including the New York Times, The Washington Post, USA Today, television news, and internet media outlets such as The Huffington Post.		Employment, Education, & Economic Change; Democracy & Society; Poverty, Welfare, & Income Security; Work & Family; and Health & Safety.

Goodwill of Greater Washington	http://www.dcgoodwill.org	(202) 636-4225	EIN 53-0196588	2200 South Dakota Ave, NE	Washington	DC	20018	USA	Goodwill Industries, Job Training	Goodwill of Greater Washington transforms lives and communities through the power of education and employment.	Goodwill of Greater Washington served almost 2,500 people in the Washington, DC region in 2010.	Greater Washington, DC metropolitan region	Donated goods: goodwill of greater washington's retail stores and donation centers are central to the fulfillment of goodwill's mission to provide jobs, job training and employment services for people with disadvantages and disabilities. In 2014, almost $32 million worth of gently used clothing, furniture, and other household goods were sorted, priced and sold in goodwill's 15 retail locations plus online, saving our customers hundreds of thousands of dollars on quality, low cost goods, while providing the revenue necessary to fund our critical job training programs. In 2014, over 1. 4 million transactions were made and some 638,000 people generously donated these goods, keeping 24. 3 million pounds of donated goods out of area landfills. Most computers are now recycled through the dell reconnect program resulting in the re-use of virtually every part and component. In 2014, goodwill of greater washington recycled over 427,000 pounds of computers and computer parts. Goodwill stores are also a source of mission fulfillment. We don't just provide job training to people with barriers to employment; we also employ them. Many of goodwill's more than 500 retail employees have overcome significant challenges and obstacles to find success in their work.   contracts: one of goodwill of greater washington's most successful business and mission fulfillment operations is its contract services division. In 2014, under the ability one program and commercial contracts, goodwill employed more than 200 people in its 13 contract sites throughout the dc area including the bureau of engraving & printing, the national gallery of art, senate office buildings, bolling air force base and the u. S. Geological survey. Approximately 80% of all the labor hours performed on these contracts are performed by individuals with significant disabilities. Goodwill provides custodial, grounds maintenance, and glassware cleaning services to government and commercial facilities. Goodwill offers its employees hope, dignity, and a future for themselves and their families.   workforce development: in 2014, goodwill of greater washington's workforce development division provided free job training, employment and other supportive services to more than 3,100 people within the washington, dc region at goodwill's four career centers and secured permanent employment for 370 program graduates. Those placed averaged a starting wage of $14. 35/hour. These critical services were funded through the revenue generated by goodwill's contracts operations, the donations sold at goodwill's 15 area retail stores, and through the generous financial support of our individual and corporate donors. The community demand for workforce development services continues to grow due to the recognition of goodwill's success in placing people who have been most challenged in finding employment on their own. The populations goodwill serves are very diverse and face a variety of barriers to employment. They may have physical, emotional, developmental or other disabling conditions; or they may lack an education or english proficiency. Many of the people goodwill serves are ex-offenders trying to rebuild their lives. Others, particularly women, have had difficulty in keeping steady employment due to the challenges of caring for dependents. The one consistent barrier faced by all of the people who walk through goodwill's doors is a lack of marketable job skills. That's why the workforce development division provides employability skills training (job readiness), job placement, occupational skills training, job coaching, and/or retention services. These services help individuals with disadvantages and disabilities enter or re-enter the workforce with confidence and dignity. Our primary goal is to match the skills, interests, and work preferences of our students to the needs of local employers who offer sustainable wages. This is accomplished through an individualized employment plan, mock-interviews, career assessments, internships, work trials, and other discovery strategies. In 2014, goodwill offered its applicants multiple job training and preparation options including a three-week career navigation program, a six-week unarmed security & protective services training in which participants can earn up to 9 college credits at northern virginia community college, and an extensive hospitality training program that led to the successful placement of almost 200 dc residents into jobs at the new marriott marquis, washington, dc. Goodwill of greater washington is also placing a greater emphasis on providing career enhancement and supportive services to its own employees - many of whom face similar barriers to the populations served through goodwill's job training programs. Goodwill's rise coaching program provides employees with access to community services and resources that can help them overcome personal barriers such as transportation, housing, financial management or childcare.	Goodwill serves anyone faced with a barrier to employment, including those with physical, emotional, development or other disabilities, as well as people trying to get off welfare, ex-offenders trying to rebuild their lives and veterans who deserve an opportunity after having bravely served their nation.

Our vision is of an African that is not dependent on aid, but on the resourcefulness and capabilities of its people.	What started as a small non-governmental organization has grown to become an international NGO working in three countries: Kenya, South Sudan and Somalia.   In 2003, we launched the largest unconditional cash transfer seen to date in Somalia, and emerged as leaders in a new field.   More than 2000 young people have benefited from the Pastoral Youth Leadership education program - 80% of whom are girls.   150,000 nomadic people have been reached by Camel Caravans and more than 150 students have been involved.   626 km of roads in Somalia were cleared in a 2008 project - improving access to market and goods.   592,774 people have benefited from Adeso's cash transfer programs.   96,600 people are set to benefit from Adeso's cash transfer work in Kenya.	Kenya, South Sudan and Somalia	Adeso is a humanitarian and development organization taht is changing the way people think about and deliver aid in Africa. We are a non-governmental organization in Africa working in a different way than most. We believe that development must come from within, not outside Africa communities. That it is African themselves who must determine Africa's future, and that while international aid has provided much-needed support, it often falls short of enabling lasting change at the grassroots level. We want to change this, and our strong bonds with communities mean we are uniquely placed to do so.   For over 20 years, we have worked hand-in-hand with African communities to prevent, manage, and overcome situations that adversely affect their wellbeing - whether environmental, social, economic or otherwise.   Regardless of where we work, our approach is the same: we help vulnerable communities through partnerships and shared decision-making. Our field teams hold regular community meetings, and find a way for every group to have a voice. This often means creating venues for women, and calls for dedication to capture the concerns and thoughts of local minorities. After all, long-term solutions can only be found when everyone has a voice, and a place in decision-making. It's not the easiest way, but in our experience it's the best.   We do what's needed, where it's needed, working across four program areas: - Developing skills for life and work - Reinvigorating the economy - Providing humanitarian aid - Influencing policy  We currently have programs in Kenya, South Sudan, and Somalia.

For more than 80 years, AZA and BBG (boys and girls chapters respectively) in communities around the world have been providing exceptional leadership programs and Jewish identity enrichment, shaping the lives of 250,000 alumni who are among the most prominent figures in business, politics, academia, the arts and Jewish communal life. Now, more than ever, BBYO offers innovative opportunities for teens to connect with one another, serve their communities, navigate the college admissions process and travel the world, providing each participant with a network of lifelong friends, a perspective which adds value and meaning to life and a shared commitment toward strengthening the Jewish future.			Inspired by our past and motivated by the needs of the future, BBYO is committed to reaching Jewish teens in unprecedented numbers. This commitment comes at a critical point, as the Jewish community is struggling to connect young people to their heritage and history. Fewer and fewer Jewish teens are engaging in Jewish life following their b'nai mitzvot, and one study shows that by the time Jewish teens reach their senior year of high school, less than 30% are involved in any formal or informal Jewish experiences. As a teen-led, pluralistic organization, BBYO is uniquely positioned to reverse this trend and to ensure a more secure Jewish future by using new approaches and emerging technologies to capture the Jewish teen market in ways that were once unimaginable.   Key to the organization's success has been a highly effective leadership model operating on the local, national and international levels through a fraternity/sorority-based chapter structure. Formerly affiliated with B'nai B'rith, in 2002, BBYO was restructured as an independent international organization. While still capitalizing upon its leadership development programs, this move to independence affords BBYO the opportunity to forge a new direction and adopt a much more expansive and transformational approach to engaging Jewish teens.   BBYO now offers a broad array of social, political, spiritual and cultural opportunities. Jewish teens are encouraged to create and lead their own communities through local chapters and BBYO's unique online network - www.b-linked.org. Once connected, they have access to a variety of resources to help them through the college admissions process, take part in community service projects, travel to Israel and around the world and communicate with their peers.

We are the U.S. voice of the worlds largest federation of grassroots environmental groups, with a presence in 75 countries. To accomplish our mission, Friends of the Earth is working at the nexus of environmental protection, economic policy and social justice to fundamentally transform the way our country and the world value people and the environment.	For a relatively small organization, Friends of the Earth has an impressive legacy. Through our more than 45-year history, we have provided crucial leadership in work that resulted in landmark environmental laws, precedent-setting legal victories and the exposure of political and corporate malfeasance.  Recent accomplishments 	Keeping fossil fuels in the ground. In early 2016, we won a major victory in our campaign to keep fossil fuels in the ground when the Obama administration announced it is putting a moratorium on new coal leasing on public lands. This big win will help keep our public lands safe from fossil fuel extraction and could signal a new era of putting the American people ahead of fossil fuel industry profits.  	Blocking approval of a dangerous pipeline. Friends of the Earth led the effort to expose corruption and pro-oil bias in the State Departments review of the Keystone XL tar sands oil pipeline. Our work (and that of allies) generated pressure on the Obama administration, forcing it to hit the reset button in 2012 and order a new review of the pipelines potential environmental impacts. As of January 2016, President Obama had denied the permit for the pipeline to proceed.  	Keeping GMO seafood off grocery store shelves. Thanks to work from Friends of the Earth and allies, more than 60 major grocery store chains, including Safeway, Kroger and Whole Foods, have made commitments not to sell genetically engineered salmon. Together the companies comprise 9,000 individual stores across the country.  	Reducing air pollution from ships. In August 2012, after working for nearly a decade to reduce air pollution from ships, we were rewarded for our efforts when the Emission Control Area (ECA) went into effect for North America. The EPA expects the reduction in smog created by the new rule to improve the health of people living near the coasts and save thousands of lives. Since then, we have worked to strengthen and protect the ECA by intervening in the state of Alaskas attempt to challenge the rule.  	Opposing the first GMO apple. In 2013, thanks to our campaign against the GMO apple, McDonald's and Gerber have confirmed that they have no plans to sell or use it. The Arctic Apple would be the first GMO apple on the market.   	Forcing climate impacts to be considered when the government lends money. In early 2012, we successfully held a World Bank proposal at bay to exempt a new lending program from 25 social and environmental safeguards and policies. As a result of our advocacy, and that of our allies, today, projects with the highest social and environment risk are excluded from this new program.  	Protecting Puget Sound from ship dumping. In 2012, we achieved a ban on cruise ships dumping wastewater while docked at the Port of Seattle. The ban will protect the people and marine habitats of Puget Sound.		Outreach & membership program - the outreach program educates members and activists as well as the greater public through online action alerts, print and online advertising, mailings and quarterly newsmagazine (to donors), monthly e-newsletters, as well as social media sites like facebook, twitter, youtube, and flickr. The team also seeks opportunities to educate the public through tv and radio interviews.   climate & energy - the climate & energy team promotes clean energy and conservation and fights to end our dependence on dirty, harmful sources of energy including coal, oil, nuclear, and biofuels. Current campaigns seek to prevent the extraction of tar sands oil and its transport through the u. S. , to phase out our use of dangerous nuclear reactors, and to end federal incentives for the production of corn ethanol and other biofuels that raise food prices while harming the environment.   economic policy - also known as "economics for the earth," the economic policy team aims to create a more environmentally sustainable and socially just world by transforming financial and economic systems. Activities include efforts to end subsidies for polluting industries, making polluters pay for the damage they cause and encourage investments in clean alternatives. It works to alter lending practices at large financial institutions that fund polluting activities and harm communities in developing countries. The team also seeks to educate the public and policymakers about the environmental dangers and undemocratic nature of trade agreements, such as the trans-pacific partnership. During fiscal year 2014, the team engaged in efforts to raise awareness of the need for campaign finance reform, an attempt to prioritize the voices of voters over corporations. This team also works to address the root causes of forest destruction through its campaign against landgrabs, forests and finance, and its work to challenge forest carbon offsets.

Ste 410	Washington	DC	20036	USA	Health, Specifically Named Diseases	The Lupus Foundation of America, Inc. (LFA) is the foremost national nonprofit health organization dedicated to finding the causes of and cure for lupus and providing support, services and hope to all people affected by lupus.			Public information and education: the foundation continues to increase awareness and understanding of lupus and its impact on health through public awareness campaigns, media relations, online and social marketing and aggressive outreach efforts to corporate and community partners. This year, the foundation's website, lupus. Org, exceeded six million visits, meeting a growing demand for information about lupus. In addition, with more than 235,000 likes on facebook and 24,000 followers on twitter, the organization has the largest social media presence dedicated exclusively to lupus. The foundation continued to see tremendous growth and interest in signature awareness campaign activities during may-lupus awareness month. During that month alone, the foundation secured 36 media stories, generating more than 15 million television impressions. Story placements included cnn, huffington post live and costco magazine. Visits to lupus. Org increased by 5 percent compared to the previous year, and, over the course of the month, more than 23 million facebook impressions were generated. In addition to these important strategic initiatives, the foundation continued to engage celebrities to support the cause and enhance the foundation's ongoing communications programs and signature events.   research: the foundation's national research program continues to attack problems that, for decades, have plagued the acceleration of lupus research and understanding of the disease. The foundation aggressively pursues strategies to increase federal, state and industry support for robust medical research efforts, facilitates strategic collaborations to address issues that are critical to progress, and provides greatly needed direct financial support to researchers through its privately-supported, peer-reviewed research grant programs, supporting scientists who are seeking a cure for lupus. Since 2009, the foundation has been implementing specific initiatives to tackle barriers to new, safe, effective and tolerable treatments for lupus. In that effort, the foundation has created an online portal that trains health professionals on instruments used in clinical studies and has spearheaded an effort to create a new, simplified instrument to assess disease activity in the clinic and in clinical trials. In 2014, the lupus foundation of america partnered with the foundation for the national institutes of health (fnih) to support a new five-year initiative that will accelerate the ability to develop new medicines for lupus and other diverse and complex diseases. The foundation continues work on a project to pool clinical trial data (de-identified) provided by participating biopharma companies. This project continues to grow each year. Findings were presented at major scientific meetings of medical organizations and federal agencies. In 2014, the foundation launched lupus science & medicine. Owned by the foundation and published by bmj, a respected global provider of evidence-based medical knowledge, lupus science & medicine is a peer-reviewed, open access, online journal that provides a central point for publication of basic, clinical, translational and epidemiological studies of all aspects of lupus and related diseases. It is the first lupus-specific open access journal in the world and was developed in response to the need for a barrier-free forum for publication of ground-breaking studies in lupus. In 2014, the foundation provided new funding to award research grants that address issues of critical importance for people with lupus, including expanding our understanding of pediatric lupus, specifically in the area of pediatric lupus nephritis biomarker research, as well as through a new mechanism called lifeline. The lifeline grant was established in response to the current lupus research funding environment and the potential decline in scientific momentum and loss of current and future lupus investigators. The foundation also awarded summer fellowships to students, launched and awarded the second lupus insight prize in partnership with two other lupus organizations, and for the second year, bestowed its career development award. The foundation also supported research through its advocacy efforts. These efforts led to the following accomplishments: - secured an additional $5. 5 million, for a total of $32 million, to support the national lupus patient registry conducted through the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc), becoming the largest-ever lupus research study. - successfully advocated for the continued support of lupus research through the department of defense (dod) peer-reviewed medical research program, which in 2014 awarded three lupus research grants totaling $3. 4 million. To date, the dod has provided $17. 4 million for lupus research, including funds for a study that led to the development of the first diagnostic test to help physicians determine a diagnosis of lupus. - secured an additional $2 million, for a total of $6 million, for the lupus initiative, which launched in 2013 to train more doctors on recognizing the signs and symptoms of lupus and to facilitate earlier diagnosis.   network support and services: the foundation provides capacity-building services, strategic support and on-site consultation to its network of chapter affiliates, field offices, support groups, and other interested partners to serve the needs of lupus communities across the united states. In 2014, the foundation provided on-going organizational development support and training to chapter ceos, staff and board members, including individualized capacity-building services, leadership of national advocacy activities (as well as training for state advocacy initiatives), leadership development through our leadership institute and specialized trainings for support group facilitators. A new program was developed to train qualified individuals to become support group facilitator trainers, to increase the foundation's capacity to provide this important service across the network. In 2014, 19 new trainers were certified through this program. The foundation also provided tools and materials to aid the foundation's 21 chapters and more than 267 support groups, serving hundreds of thousands of people across the united states. The foundation continued to provide on-site and remote interim executive leadership support for chapters that experienced a ceo transition, including providing leadership throughout the search process. Additionally, in 2014, the lupus foundation of america walk to end lupus now events brought together nearly 70,000 individuals in 60 cities across the nation to learn more about living with lupus, to increase awareness of the disease and to raise funds for the cause in their local communities.

Landmark cases include:      Kpadeh, et al. v. Charles McArthur Emmanuel, a.k.a. Chuckie Taylor (2010)  After his conviction of torture and related crimes in criminal court, Human Rights USA pursued civil action against Chuckie Taylor - son of the former President of Liberia Charles Taylor and head of his fathers security unit. The suit was filed on behalf of five of his victims, seeking reparations and damages. In May 2009, Human Rights USA secured a major victory, winning a default judgment, and in February 2010 U.S. District Judge Adalberto Jordan awarded Human Rights USAs clients an incredible $22.4 million in damages. This amount recognizes the grave violations Human Rights USAs clients suffered, and will allow them to address the financial burdens they face, including past and ongoing medical expenses, physical and psychological harms, lost wages, destroyed property, and other damages inflicted by Chuckie Taylor and his forces. The next step is to enforce this judgment, to ensure Human Rights USAs clients receive the reparations they are owed.      USA v. Roy Belfast, a.k.a. Chuckie Taylor (2008)  Human Rights USA submitted three amicus curiae (friend of the court) briefs in the first-ever U.S. criminal prosecution brought under a 1994 law holding that anyone on U.S. soil, citizen or not, can be charged and tried for torture committed anywhere in the world. Human Rights USAs briefs helped government prosecutors convince a Miami jury to convict Chuckie Taylor of torture and related crimes and to sentence him to 97 years in prison.       M.L.C. v. Gonzales (2008)  A young woman named M.L.C. was forced into marriage and sexual slavery in China in order to pay a debt her abusive father owed a powerful local administrator. After being beaten violently and locked in a room for three days with no food or water, M.L.C. was forced into a betrothal ceremony, assaulted by her new husband, and imprisoned once more. She escaped and fled to the United States where she filed for asylum. Her claim was initially rejected by an Immigration Judge, but after the Second Circuit Court of Appeals remanded her case to the immigration courts, Human Rights USA represented M.L.C. in a new hearing before the Immigration Judge, and she was granted asylum in August 2008. Her case was an important affirmation that victims of forced marriages deserve asylum protection in the United States.       Xiaoning v. Yahoo! Inc. (2007)  Human Rights USA was the first group to file a lawsuit against a major Internet service provider for human rights violations, holding the U.S.-based Yahoo! Inc. liable for its role in providing the government of China with Internet user identification that resulted in the arrest, jailing and torture of two prominent journalists and human rights and democracy activists. After several high profile Congressional hearings focused on the companys complicity in human rights abuses, Human Rights USA won a settlement on behalf of the victims families. In the wake of Human Rights USAs successful lawsuit, Yahoo!, Google, and Microsoft signed onto a voluntary Code of Conduct developed with human rights groups and corporate responsibility experts  the Global Network Initiative  in which each company pledged to uphold the fundamental human right to freedom of expression and to conduct their international operations accordingly. Recently, Google has moved to put its words into action by shutting down its search service in the Chinese mainland due to reports of hacking and censorship.  Other firsts:      Human Rights USA was the first group to successfully sue a sitting head of state (Hun Sen of Cambodia) in U.S. courts for human rights abuses committed abroad.       Human Rights USA represented a woman and her young daughter from Nigeria fleeing the practice of female genital mutilation (FGM). In a groundbreaking decision, the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals held that FGM is a form of torture under the Convention Against Torture, which justifies relief from deportation to mothers who seek to protect their children from this practice. Other courts have since followed suit in recognizing FGM as a form of torture and grounds for protection.      Human Rights USA was the first U.S.-based human rights group to report regularly to the United Nations on U.S. compliance with the major international human rights treaties.		Human rights usas legal action has an immediate impact on our clients lives, and a broad impact on u. S. Law and policy. As a result of our direct services, amicus briefs, mentoring, and counseling, more people now have asylum in the united states from forced marriage and human trafficking. This work on behalf of refugees has established asylum as a viable form of protection from forced marriage and trafficking; our new handbook for lawyers representing asylum seekers aims to make this protection more widely accessible. In 2010, the federal courts upheld domestic human rights enforcement, setting a binding precedent that human rights violators can be prosecuted, tried, and convicted in the united states for the crime of torture. Survivors of torture from liberia now have confidence to rebuild their lives because the u. S. Citizen responsible for the horrors they endured will be in prison for the rest of his life. In 2010, we worked with 20 survivors of human trafficking, taking legal action so they can see the persons responsible for coercing them into modern-day slavery held accountable. We choose these cases because they provide important assistance for these individuals, but also because they make a lasting impact on u. S. Laws and policies that assist many more people than our clients.

We pursue this mission through our public health & safety, international, national security and human rights, environmental oversight, and corporate and financial accountability programs. Gap is the nation's leading whistleblower protection organization.			Public health / whistleblowers o gap began the representation of a north carolina poultry farmer and purdue contractor who had allowed outside filming of his facilities to show the inhumane animal treatment and conditions at purdue. The explosive story broke nationally at the end of 2014 with a blistering column by nicholas kristof of the new york times. O gap advanced our investigative efforts in 2014 by continuing to conduct on-sight and in-person interviews with usda meat inspectors from around the country. Gap continued to help lead the fight against the usdas modernization of poultry inspection rule (himp). We took action by using anonymous affidavits from meat and poultry inspector whistleblowers which disclosed to the national media the serious public health threat the rule poses to the integrity of our food. While gap and coalition partners did successfully stall himp, the usda finalized the rule in the summer of 2014 after providing a few minor concessions. In october 2014, gap joined consumer and worker rights organizations in filing a joint amicus brief supporting a lawsuit that challenged the new rules. The brief relied heavily on whistleblowers statements stemming from our investigation into federal meat inspector concerns. O in 2014, gap challenged idaho and utah "ag-gag" laws through amicusbriefs presented to courts hearing legal complaints against the laws. O at the 2014 whistleblower summit on national whistleblower appreciation day, gaps food integrity director amanda hitt was featured exploring ag- gag laws and how whistleblowers are increasingly facing criminal investigations and prosecutions. Ms. Hitt also spoke at yale law school at a conference which examined the impact of ag-gag laws on freedom of speech, health, food safety, consumer advocacy, animal welfare, and the environment. O in 2014, building off of our critical work with meat inspectors, we designed and distributed a survey to over 4,000 usda meat inspectors and queried inspectors on issues such as: himp efficacy, food safety, humane handling, and worker safety. The results were combined with meat inspector reports detailing work-related illness, environmental hazards, and food safety concerns to inform our most comprehensive white paper in 15 years. O in 2014, gaps food integrity campaign (fic) continued to develop gaps reputation as the go-to source for news media covering issues involving food integrity. By expanding beyond traditional notions of food safety and incorporating aspects of food integrity, we were able to tackle issues related to the use of animals in agriculture and the plight of workers in the industry. During 2014, we contributed significantly to multiple media outlets, including: hbo, cbs, market watch, al jazeera, 60 minutes, pbs, politico, austrian and german public television, tri-states public radio, food poisoning bulletin, canton daily ledger, slate magazine, food safety news, and takepart, for example. Gap fic staff also wrote daily blogs which continued to gain in popularity. Many of our blogs attracted the attention of potential whistleblowers and reporters eager to learn more about our insider stories. We also gained more visibility by providing online blogs for websites such as the huffington post.   corporate & financial accountability o during 2014, gap continued to receive serious requests to investigate whistleblower concerns and expanded our corporate and financial accountability efforts by litigating both ongoing and potentially new whistleblower reprisals cases, and investigating current and new confidential whistleblower allegations of bank and financial wrongdoing. We also identified public interest allies, found ways to work in coalition with them, and adopted several important confidential test cases. O during 2014 gap identified and directly challenged corporate resistance to new protections gap helped develop now covering over 80,000,000 corporate employees who previously had only minimal legal protection, including: corporate attempts to criminalize whistleblowing; corporate challenges to provisions requiring the reinstatement of whistleblowers after favorable department of labor investigative rulings but before the adjudication of the cases at a hearing; corporate attempts to force chilling agreements on departing employees and gag settlements on whistleblowers; and banking industry challenges to whistleblowers who, under the new law, are now allowed to use confidential corporate documents as evidence to prove their cases. We also actively worked to try to counteract the federal governments ineffectiveness in regulating, addressing and reforming financial and banking corruption as revealed by whistleblowers. O also in 2014, on the fourth anniversary of the passage of dodd-frank, gap teamed up with law firm labaton sucharow to lead a large national coalition to outlaw gag orders used to silence corporate and banking whistleblowers and combat retaliation they so often endure. Joining us in this critical effort were more than 250 organizations with nearly two million members. We demanded that the sec establish a strengthened whistleblower program. Our petition received immediate prolific coverage in the new york times; the wall street journal; the washington post; bloomberg law; inside counsel; american lawyer; compliance week; law 360; value walk; and corp counsel. O gap and our broad coalition of organizations also submitted a non- rulemaking petition demanding the sec: launch a series of public hearings to discuss the problem of workplace retaliation and ways to increase reporting; create an advisory committee on whistleblower reporting and protection; and engage in appropriate rulemaking to clarify and strengthen whistleblower protections.   national security & human rights o in 2014, the department of justice continued its criminal prosecution of increasing numbers of whistleblowers under the espionage act. Five out of gaps six national security agency (nsa) whistleblowers were criminally investigated: two were charged with crimes, tom drake and edward snowden. In 2013, as result of gap client edward snowdens disclosures which led to his exile in russia, the american public learned that the nsa has conducted, and continues to conduct, wholesale surveillance of u. S. Citizens through a secretive data-mining program. Snowdens decision to release documents to selective media was based on his scrutiny of the treatment of nsa whistleblowers drake and other gap clients/former executive-level nsa employees william binney, ed loomis and j. Kirk wiebe -- who endured years of criminal investigation and whose homes were invaded by swat teams after they raised their concerns to their immediate bosses, up the chain of command, to the department of defense inspector general. In 2014, gap continued to tell their stories in the media about their substantive concerns, the reprisals they have suffered, the assault on civil liberties, and the inadequate remedies available for those who raise national security concerns. O gap visited over 25 congressional offices to provide briefings to staff and members about gap client/nsa whistleblower edward snowdens revelations. O in 2014, gap and five of our nsa whistleblowers made presentations to the peace and civil liberties oversight board to make recommendations about reforming intelligence agency practices and operations. O gaps national security and human rights director jesselyn radack, and gap clients/nsa whistleblowers tom drake and william binney testified before a german bundestag investigation committee to provide testimony for its globally-significant investigation into the nsas mass surveillance operations. Gap stressed to the committee that what we know about the nsas invasive and ineffective mass surveillance operation is only available because of whistleblowers.

By teaching students to express themselves through the art of playwriting, YPT develops students language skills, and empowers them with the creativity, confidence and critical thinking skills they need to succeed in school and beyond. YPT honors its students by involving them in a high-quality artistic process where they feel simultaneously respected and challenged and by engaging professional theater artists in producing student plays for the community.  VISION  Young Playwrights Theater seeks to create social justice by providing all young people with the opportunity to realize the power and value of their own voices.   A nationally recognized leader in arts education, YPT proves the benefit of the arts in the classroom by demonstrating the direct and positive impact of an active, arts-integrated process on student learning, and strives to close the academic achievement gap by increasing equitable access to arts education for all students. By offering the opportunity for creative self-expression, YPT encourages students to take ownership of their education, their choices and their futures. YPT shares student-written work with local, national and international audiences to provide a window into young peoples lives and promote respect for young artists. By experiencing their work brought to life for their communities, students realize their ability to affect the world around them.		Public and Public Charter Schools in Washington, DC and the great DC metro region.	The following programs and productions offer young people the opportunity to share their words with the world while nurturing a new generation of artists: The In-School Playwriting Program enhances student literacy, creative expression and collaboration through the art of playwriting.  For over ten years YPT has integrated the learning of a creative writing process into the English, Humanities and History curricula of D.C.P.S.  During 14 in-class workshops, led by professional artists, students explore the mechanics of language, drama and self-expression, culminating with each student writing their own 10-minute play. Each year YPT has further developed and refined its process and several schools throughout the District now rely on YPT to provide its holistic learning process as a means of enhancing student literacy, communication and creativity in the classroom.  The In-School Playwriting Program culminates in YPT?s annual New Play Festival, which gives students the opportunity to actively participate in the arts by selecting the most interesting and dynamic work written by students each year and producing a professional staged reading at a local regional theater.   The After-School Playwriting Program strengthens students? community engagement, collaboration, and conflict resolution by exploring a theatrical process as an ensemble.  This year YPT will teach acting, directing, playwriting and design in after-school programs throughout D.C., partnering with the Oak Hill Juvenile Detention Center, Ferebee-Hope Elementary School, The Perry School, D.C. Scores, Kid Power, Asian American LEAD and Freedom Youth Academy.  Each of these programs will culminate with a public performance of student-generated work at the end of each semester.  In addition, having created a student-run theater company at Bell Multicultural High School during summer 2006, YPT will again train approximately 20 students at Bell throughout the year during after-school hours, from 3:30 to 6:30 p.m., meeting three times per week, in acting, directing, design and playwriting, and culminating in student performances of original work at the end of each semester for family, friends and peers.   The Express Tour (formerly Youth or Dare) shares the work of young playwrights with their greater community in order to create a dialogue that can engage, entertain and educate.  During this eight week performance series, our fledgling playwrights play an integral role in the development and production of their work as they polish their scripts with a dramaturge, attend rehearsals, and offer input to the actors and director who will give life to their words onstage.  Seeing the final product of their writing develops their self-esteem and creates positive interaction within the community.  The tour targets under-served audiences, providing many of these patrons with their very first professional theater experience.  As YPT continues to partner with local DC theaters, including Woolly Mammoth, Discovery Theater and GALA Hispanic Theater on Special Projects and performances, its expanding programs and productions are attracting new national partnerships and opportunities to showcase the talents and voices of D.C.?s inner-city youth for a national audience. Currently YPT is partnering with the Smithsonian Institution on two new shows, African Roots/Latino Soul and American Rice, both of which will be written by D.C. public school students and produced by Discovery Theater. YPT will also collaborate in 2006-2007 with the White House and the Kennedy Center on the creation of a new play on students? experience of the White House, to be produced by the Kennedy Center in 2008.

The RFK Center will assist WOZA in filing a petition to the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights (ACHPR). Recently, the RFK Center secured a $10,000 U.S. State Department grant to provide security and a new office for WOZA. In addition, the RFK Center will help digitize WOZAs extensive handwritten archives.  Advocacy:  The RFK Center continues to urge the UN to include human rights monitoring in its Western Sahara mandate. In 2010, staff members helped gather an international coalition to file a written submission to Moroccos Universal Periodic Review. The RFK Center brought Aminatou Haidar to the U.S. where she met with members of the United Nations and the U.S. government in preparation for the vote on the mandates renewal. In June 2012, the RFK Center presented its submission to the Council in Geneva. In August 2012, Kerry Kennedy led a delegation of human rights experts to Western Sahara and Morocco.  The media attention given to this mission resulted in several attempts to tamper with our website, traced back to Morocco, and a threat of kidnapping Ms. Kennedy (not substantiated).  Global advocacy efforts: Through the RFK Centers persistent advocacy work, the U.S. State Department has called on the Dominican Republic government to end these discriminatory policies. The U.S. State Department has consulted with the RFK Center, created a federal working group, and empowered the UNHRC to open a field office in the country. Organizing: Since 2007, the RFK Center has led a coalition of U.S.-based human rights groups working on nationality and migration rights issues in the Dominican Republic and arranged several congressional briefings, monitoring trips, and conferences. Most recently, the October 2011 Dominican Republic advocacy week enabled the U.S. government to demonstrate its public support to the cause and encourage the Dominican government to open a productive dialogue with the RFK Centers coalition.  Cases of Ins Fernndez Ortega and Valentina Rosendo Cant: The RFK Center works to pressure the Mexico government to transfer cases of military abuse of citizens into civilian court. In 2011, two cases such cases were successfully transferred to the civilian Attorney Generals office. In both of these cases women were raped and tortured by soldiers; the cases had languished in military jurisdiction for almost a decade. RFK Center secured a precedent-setting decision by Mexicos supreme court giving victims of military violence the right to try their cases in civilian court.  Press coverage: The RFK Center uses its resources to bring substantial press coverage to Tlachinollans emblematic cases and arrange regular delegations to the area led by Kerry Kennedy.  Protection: The RFK Center pressures the state government to ensure basic protections for Tlachinollans work. We helped restore an office that had been closed since 2009 following to the murders of two indigenous defenders and attracted representatives from numerous embassies and NGOs to the opening. We organized the state government to provide police protection for the office during business hours.  Release from arrest:  The RFK Center intervened when Mixtec human rights defender Maximino Garcia Catarino was arbitrarily imprisoned and subjected to false charges in 2012. In response to our campaign, Maximino was granted unconditional release by a Guerrero tribunal after two months of detention.		The RFK Center has a successful history of collaborations with NGOs, universities, legal clinics, and the media on behalf of oppressed communities.  It has six programs, whose goals are: o	To create genuine partnerships with courageous human right activists around the world and help them achieve their goals over a six-year period (Partners for Human Rights) o	To create change by introducing students an innovative curriculum, based on courageous human rights defenders, now used by over 500,000 students worldwide (Speak Truth To Power) o	To work with fiduciaries and investors to factor human rights, environmental degradation,  and governance (like corruption) concerns into their calculation of risk (Compass) o	To support investigative journalists and authors who bring light to injustice (RFK Book and Journalism Awards) o	To develop a presence in Europe for advocacy, STTP, and human rights training (RFK Europe) o	To help develop effective policy for adjudicated youth transitioning to freedom (Juvenile Justice Program)

Earth rights are those rights that demonstrate the connection between human well-being and a sound environment, and include the right to a healthy environment, the right to speak out and act to protect the environment, and the right to participate in development decisions.   ERI's mission is to protect humans and their natural environment from abuses occurring in the name of development. Specifically, we:   1) INVESTIGATE, MONITOR AND EXPOSE human rights and environmental abuses;   2) INCREASE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY of governments, transnational corporations (TNCs) and International Financial Institutions (IFIs) as they undertake investment and development activities;   3) PROTECT INDIVIDUALS AND COMMUNITIES working to defend the earth; and   4) ENSURE BIODIVERSITY, conservation and ecological integrity.			ERI's Burma Project: EarthRights International is one of the only organizations to assemble on-the-ground information about the human rights and environmental situation inside Burma. Since 1995, ERI has worked inside Burma to monitor the impact of the military regime's policies and activities on local populations and ecosystems. Through training, grassroots organizing, and setting up networks, ERI's staff has gathered a vast body of valuable, rare information about the state of the military regime's war on its peoples and its environment. We then share this information with the world, so that international efforts to isolate the regime and bring about democracy in Burma are strengthened. For example, ERI has twice made submissions to the International Labour Organization (ILO) about the persistence of forced labor in Burma. Despite the ILO's efforts to encourage the SPDC to end the practice of forced labor, ERI's submissions, which include numerous interviews with villagers, show that SPDC troops still use forced labor and are collecting labor and portering fees.   The EarthRights Schools: The EarthRights Schools train local human rights and environmental activists in Southeast Asia. The innovative, year-long program combines rigorous academic study, participatory learning, and fieldwork. Each ethnically diverse class of students divides their year of training between classroom and field sessions.   Litigation: EarthRights International's litigation seeks to provide remedies for earth rights abuses around the world. Working in partnership with other legal organizations and private lawyers, we are litigating several cases on behalf of victims of earth rights abuses, and we have filed amicus curiae ("friend of the court") briefs in several other cases. We seek to apply domestic and international law to hold corporations and others accountable for their actions, often using the Alien Tort Claims Act (ATCA), which allows lawsuits in federal courts for violations of international law.  EarthRights Campaigns: ERI coordinates netowrks of diverse activists and organizations, and builds coalitions between human rights, environment, and labor NGOs. In addition, EarthRights leads strategic alliances between international NGOs and local communities in solidarity campaigns to stop projects that threaten indigenous peoples' rights and their environment. For instance, in 2003, ERI began working intesively with Sarayaku, an indigenous community in the Ecuadorian Amazon, to resist oil development in their territory. This struggle pits an indigenous community of some 1,000 people living in primary rainforest against two multinational oil companies, the Ecuadorian government, and the IMF. ERI provides logistical support, media outreach, and NGO network contacts to ensure that Sarayaku's voice is heard in the media, in corporate boardrooms, and in international forums such as the Interamerican Commission on Human Rights.

National Schools of Character serve as models and ambassadors of effective character  education. They hold staff development trainings at their sites and are  available for consultation and mentoring.

The National Schools of Character receive  a small grant to help with outreach. This develops a communication network that allows the schools to share best practices and mentor others.	The move to bestow NSOC recognition on all schools and districts that  reach a standard of excellence is the result of a year-long study by  State Schools of Character coordinators, CEP consultants, Blue Ribbon  Panel members, and CEP Board members.

Applicants that do not receive the NSOC award will receive feedback to  help them develop an action plan for attaining the award in the future.	The purpose of the NSOC awards program is to inspire all schools and  districts to pursue a path to excellence in character education.

As religion scholar Dr. Martin E. Marty has commented,   religion and politics inevitably intersect . Politics, by dealing with proposals for the common good, inevitably touches on people s basic ideas about what is most important in life.  For most Americans, this means drawing religious understandings of reality and human purpose.   From Christian to Muslim to Jew to atheist, and every faith in between, we are all influenced by a personal acceptance or rejection of religious principles, and by the decisions, dictates, and functioning of government.  Instead of competition, conflict, and ill will, which often develop, these most two fundamental elements in the daily lives of human beings should be in cooperation and dialogue.  The Institute on Religion and Public Policy is building bridges between religion and policy to advance a more constructive, peaceful future.			The Institute on Religion and Public Policy conducts research on issues relating to religion and public policy in both the domestic and international policy arenas.  The Institute sponsors lectures and conferences, as well as publishes books and other materials, to exchange and appropriate ideas on the importance of remaining active in and aware of the ever-developing relationship between religion and public policy.  The Institute on Religion and Public Policy also provides leadership in motivating public interest and action in areas of concern to the religious and public policy communities.

It is no longer soldiers who bear the brunt of war. Studies reveal ninety percent of all casualties in modern conflicts are civilians, the majority of them women and children.

Just Foreign Policy	http://www.justforeignpolicy.org	(202) 448-2898	EIN 56-2587092	4410 Massachusetts Ave, NW #290	Washington	DC	20016	USA	International, International Human Rights, International Peace & Security, Promotion of International Understanding	Just Foreign Policy is an independent and non-partisan mass membership organization dedicated to reforming U.S. foreign policy through coordinating the broad majority of Americans to advocate their interests and values.  Although just foreign policy will focus exclusively on foreign policy, we appeal directly to Americans for whom foreign policy is not a primary concern.  We have seen through the Iraq war that unnecessary military actions can undermine civil liberties and democracy at home, and can be used to remove pressing domestic issues from the political agenda to the detriment of the great majority.  During the Cold War, the United States spent trillions of dollars on an arms race with the USSR, as well as wars such as Korea and Vietnam. Yet we were able to create Medicare, Medicaid, and enact large enough increases in Social Security to drive the poverty rate among the elderly down from 35 percent in 1959 to less than 12 percent by the end of the era. But for a number of reasons-fiscal, economic, and political-our current circumstances are very different.  For example, at the height of the Vietnam War in 1968, the U.S. gross federal debt was 43.5 percent of our economy and falling. Today it is over 67 percent and rising. Maintaining our current foreign and military policy and possible large increases in military spending (for example if we have an arms race with China, whose economy will be larger than ours within a decade) will lead to serious declines in U.S. living standards.  U.S. foreign policy therefore threatens to impede-perhaps as never before-the country's economic and social progress. It has become extremely important to the lives of all Americans, and we cannot afford to leave it in the hands of the "experts" without influence from the public.  Eventually the United States must move towards a more multilateral approach to foreign relations-one that relies less on raw U.S. military and economic power and more on international law and treaties, co-operation, and diplomacy. Our goal is to accelerate this transition through education, organization, and mobilization of concerned citizens.			Public information campaigns - through education, organization and mobilization of concerned citizens, just foreign policy provides the public with accurate and balanced information on foreign policy issues. The public information campaigns focus on promoting a more multilateral approach to foreign relations, one that relies less on raw u. S. Military and economic power and more on international law and treaties, cooperation, and diplomacy. During 2014, the campaigns included promoting diplomatic engagement with iran, a diplomatic solution in syria, the removal of u. S. Troops from afghanistan, an end to the blockade of gaza, cuts to the u. S. Military budget, transparency in the u. S. Drone program, and an improvement in relationships with leaders in latin america.   fiscal sponsorship: other worlds creates educational materials that are free for public use regarding topics about international social and economic issues that affect food and agriculture, development, human rights, women's right and disaster response. The educational material is created from other worlds' own research, analysis, experiences, and innovations from countries around the world.

Cato Institute	http://www.cato.org	202-842-0200	EIN 23-7432162	1000 Massachusetts Av NW	Washington	DC	20001	USA		The mission of the Cato Institute is to increase the understanding of public policies based on the principles of limited government, free markets, individual liberty, and peace. The Institute will use the most effective means to originate, advocate, promote, and disseminate applicable policy proposals that create free, open, and civil societies in the United States and throughout the world.	Cato Institute 2008-2009      In 2008, the Cato Institute delivered authoritative research and practical policy proposals across a range of public policy issues, broadening the bounds of the debate while championing the timeless values of individual liberty, limited government, free markets, and peace.  Whether appearing in print or television media, testifying before legislators or submitting briefs to the Supreme Court, Cato scholars are constantly working to ensure that individuals remain free. Catos wider educational efforts are aimed at rejuvenating a culture that cherishes and defends constitutional rights.      HIGHLIGHTS 2008      Cato chairman Robert A. Levy may not own a gun himself, but thanks in large part to his work, millions of Americans seeking to own a firearm for purposes of self-defense can do so. The long, heated debate over the meaning of the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution has been decided: Americans have the right to keep and bear arms.  On June 26, 2008, the final day of its 20072008 term, the Supreme Court decided 5-4 in D.C. v. Heller to strike down the District of Columbias 32-year-old ban on handguns, the most restrictive in the nation. The decision unequivocally affirmed the right of individual American citizens to own firearms.  As the New York Times wrote on the day after the decision, D.C. v. Heller reached the court as the result of an assumption by the Cato Institute, a libertarian policy organization here, that the time was right to test the prevailing interpretation of the Second Amendment.  Levy has also worked to challenge the constitutionality of the bailout, arguing that it violates the Constitutions separation-of-powers doctrine in an October Legal Times op-ed.          When Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae collapsed in September 2008, it came as no surprise to scholars at the Cato Institute.  They had long pointed out that the government-sponsored mortgage giants, which had 11,000 employees and $5 trillion in mortgages in 2008, were on unsustainable footing and would ultimately need to be rescued at taxpayer expense.  They expected, then, that when Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae collapsed, the $5 trillion in debt was simply added to the federal governments balance sheet.  Cato adjunct scholar Arnold Kling, formerly a senior economist at Freddie Mac, described the collapse of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae as the most avoidable financial crisis in history in a 2008 Cato Briefing Paper. And he argued that Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae should be partitioned and sold, not held under federal control.          Of course, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae were only part of the problem. Affordable housing initiatives such as the Community Reinvestment Act and changes in policies by the Department of Housing and Urban Development effectively coerced banks into making loans to borrowers who would otherwise not have qualified.  The Federal Housing Administration was also complicit, loosening down-payment standards for such borrowers.  Lawrence H. White, F. A. Hayek professor of economic history at the University of Missouri-St. Louis and a Cato adjunct scholar, ably summarized the results in a 2008 Cato Briefing Paper, concluding that these poorly chosen policies distorted interest rates and asset prices, diverted loanable funds into the wrong investments, and twisted normally robust financial institutions into unsustainable positions. A bubble in the housing sector had taken hold.      The housing bubble was further stoked by Federal Reserve easy credit policies.  Cato senior fellow Gerald P. ODriscoll Jr., former vice president at the Federal Reserve Bank of   Dallas, showed the effects of keeping the federal funds rate artificially low in a November 2008 Wall Street Journal op-ed.  Alan Greenspans Federal Reserve had kept the interest rate at 2 percent or below for three years between 2001 and 2004, which, when adjusted for inflation, meant the real federal funds rate had been negative.  Or as ODriscoll put it, people were being paid to borrow and they responded by borrowing irresponsibly.  At the same time, the subprime mortgage market ballooned from $190 billion in 2001 to $625 billion in 2005.      With the financial sector in dire straits, the federal government initiated a sweeping plan to reshape the financial sector in October 2008.  The push, led by Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson, called for a massive $700 billion Troubled Assets Relief Program. Cato scholars argued that the federal government should not be allocating such massive sums to prop up failing firms, and that the contraction of the financial and mortgage-related sector is necessary for the economy to return to health.  In fact, this was the second time Americans were being asked to funnel $700 billion to causes favored by the Bush administration.  The total cost of the Iraq war to date had been approximately $700 billion, too, pointed out chairman emeritus William A. Niskanen and Catos director of information policy studies Jim Harper calculated that each American is liable for about $2,000 of the bailout.  Although TARP ultimately passed, with taxpayers once again being asked to foot the bill, the analysis by Cato scholars has been vindicated by the programs subsequent mishandling.       In a Marketplace commentary, Cato research fellow Will Wilkinson argued that public works spending, which represents the majority of outlays in the proposed stimulus package, would take years to come online, and thus even by its proponents own terms did not represent a stimulus at all.  During a December 21 C-SPAN appearance, Chris Edwards, Catos director of tax policy studies, pointed out the sheer magnitude of the package, and what it meant for the future.  Even without a stimulus package, the government had already incurred an unprecedented trillion-dollar deficit for the fiscal year, and certainly couldnt afford spending another trillion, he argued.  With entitlement spending for Social Security and Medicare ramping up because of changing demographics, Edwards warned that if a stimulus package is passed, America may never have another balanced budget again.  In one month, Cato scholars published articles opposing the stimulus or were quoted in 22 major newspapers, and appeared on 31 national television programs and 49 radio programs.  The writings of Cato scholars were also featured on several prominent blogs, including those of Harvard economist Greg Mankiw and news pundit Michelle Malkin.      The efforts to oppose the spending bill came to a head with a full-page ad featuring economists who oppose the stimulus, placed by the Cato Institute with generous special funding from Cato Sponsors.  The ad begins with a quote from President Barack Obama claiming that all economists agree on the need for a stimulus package to revive the economy, a talking point repeatedly echoed in the media.  Declaring With all due respect / Mr. President, that is not true, it was signed by over 300 economists, including Nobel Laureates Edward Prescott, Vernon Smith, and James Buchanan.  The ad was published first in the New York Times, and soon after in the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, the Los Angeles Times, the New York Post, the Chicago Tribune, the Philadelphia Inquirer, the Washington Times, the National Review, the New Republic, college newspapers across the nation, and more.  On the same day the ad was making a splash, the Wall Street Journal featured an op-ed by Cato senior fellow Alan Reynolds pointing out that the stimulus represented a massive, long-term transfer of resources from the private to the public sector.       These are troubling times for advocates of individual liberty, limited government, free markets, and civil society.  But as William A. Niskanen, distinguished senior economist at the Institute put it in a November Forbes commentary, this is no time to despair.  Rather, supporters of the free market can stand and fight.  Cato scholars will continue to point out the flawed reasoning behind policies that aggrandize the government at the expense of the market.  And they will continue to point out that government is not the solution to our ongoing economic woesit is the problem.      The 2008 Milton Friedman Prize for Advancing Liberty was awarded to Yon Goicoechea, leader of the student movement in Venezuela that successfully prevented Hugo Chvez from seizing broad dictatorial powers.  Under Goicoecheas leadership, the student movement organized mass opposition to the erosion of human and civil rights in Venezuela and played the key role in preventing Hugo from becoming an unchallenged lifetime ruler over Venezuela.  Although Chvez has succeeded in reversing the decision, Goicoecheas vision of optimism, tolerance, and modernity breathed new life into efforts to defend basic freedoms in Venezuela and elsewhere where freedom is threatened around the world.      In preparation for a new administration in the White House, 2008 saw a major push to win the broader publics support for remaking the American health care sector.  But Cato scholars were there every step of the way, pointing out that increasing the governments role in health care would only add to the sectors problems, and arguing instead that the only way to make health care increasingly better and more accessible is to put consumers in charge of their health care dollars and decisions.      Critics of the U.S. health care system often point to other countries as models for reform.  They point out that many countries spend far less on health care than the United States but seem to enjoy better outcomes, and they argue that the United States should follow the lead of those countries and adopt a government-run, national health care system.  But as Cato senior fellow Michael D. Tanner argued in a March Cato Policy Analysis, The Grass Is Not Always Greener: A Look at National Health Care Systems around the World, all health care systems worldwide are wrestling with the problems of rising costs and access to care.  Moreover, in countries weighted heavily toward government control of health care, people are most likely to face waiting lists, rationing, restrictions on physician choice, and other obstacles to care.  Tanner therefore concluded that none of those nations represented a useful model of reform.      In the thick of a presidential race, Tanner published the Cato Briefing Paper, A Fork in the Road: Obama, McCain, and Health Care, which served to guide policymakers through the reform proposals of both major-party presidential candidates.  Tanner concluded that both plans left much to be desired, though Obamas plan for a single-payer system was particularly flawed. .     Catos director of health policy studies Michael Cannon pointed out in the peer-reviewed journal Forum for Health Economics and Policy that health savings accounts allow people greater sovereignty over their health care spending decisions and are an easy way to achieve a more market-friendly, and thus, more efficient, health care sector.  In Medical Licensing: An Obstacle to Affordable, Quality Care economist Shirley Svorny argued that medical licensing fails to protect consumers from incompetent physicians, but does raise substantial barriers to entry, making health care more expensive and less accessible.  Svorny called for states to eliminate professional licensing and leave education and credentialing to the private sector and the courts.  In an October Los Angeles Times op-ed, she pointed to the success   of convenience clinics emerging at CVS pharmacies, Wal-Mart, and Target as a model for affordable, effective health care.       Here in the nations capital, K-12 education costs a staggering $24,600 per pupil per year, as Andrew Coulson, director of the Center for Educational Freedom, pointed out in an April Washington Post op-ed.  That figure was about $15,000 per pupil per year higher than the one bandied about by the teachers unions, and more importantly, about $10,000 higher than the average cost of D.C. private schools.  One promising proposal to reform American education begins at the state level: Public education tax credits reduce the state and local taxes owed by anyone who pays for the private schooling of an eligible child.  Therefore, parents can claim credits for their own childrens education costs, and other taxpayers (including businesses) can claim credits when they pay for the education of someone elses child, either directly or by donating to a nonprofit scholarship-granting organization.  After publishing model education tax credit legislation in December 2007, authored by Center policy analyst Adam B. Schaeffer, the Center followed up in 2008 with a generalized tool that can be used to compute the legislations fiscal impact on any state.  Together, these publications have bolstered interest in education tax credit programs around the country.      At the Cato Institute, scholars work to show that government intervention is not only ineffective and inefficient but that unwarranted government power poses a threat to the cherished rights of life, liberty, and property.  Cheye Calvo didnt know it at the time, but the large box sitting on his porch on that fateful day in July was filled to the brim with marijuana.  Calvo, the mayor of Berwyn Heights, Maryland, had become the victim of a sophisticated mail-based drug smuggling operation.  Soon after that, he became the victim of a no-knock paramilitary-style SWAT raid, one that saw his front door blown open, his wife and mother-in-law handcuffed and interrogated, and his two defenseless, black Labrador retrievers shot dead.  Calvo came to the Cato Institute in September to tell his story and to argue that no-knock raids are an inappropriate tactic for drug investigations.  Calvos appearance at Cato led to significant traction both of his story and his message, with spreads in the Baltimore Sun, the Washington Post, and the Washington Examiner.  More important, it brought the issue of the latest, chilling tactic in the drug war to the publics attention.      Our criminal codes are so voluminous that they bewilder not only the average citizen, but even the average lawyer.  Our courthouses are so busy that there is no longer time for trials.  And America now has the highest per capita prison population in the world.  In the Name of Justice, edited by Timothy Lynch, director of Catos Project on Criminal Justice, consulted with Americas leading legal experts to produce a critical examination of American criminal law.          Efforts are afoot to regulate the Internet, efforts that risk stamping out what has become a focal point for innovation and new ideas.  These self-styled net neutrality proponents have legitimate concerns backed up by good arguments, but in calling for greater government control over the web they reveal a glaring omission in their reasoning.  In the Cato Policy Analysis The Durable Internet: Preserving Network Neutrality without Regulation, Timothy B. Lee, a Cato adjunct scholar, spells it out for them: government regulation has long-term, unintended consequences.  Federal regulation has already frustrated competition in network industries like railroads, airlines, and trucking; public utility regulation of the Internet would be no different, grinding innovation to a halt, ceding control to the federal government, and slowing growth in the speed and reach of the greatest communications network yet invented.  Noting that Lee takes    his opponents seriously, Techdirt.com hailed the effort as the paper on network neutrality that any policymaker needs to read.      Plans to create a de facto national identification card using drivers licenses are a growing threat to the liberty, autonomy, and privacy of American citizens.  Catos director of information policy studies Jim Harper worked tirelessly to stop such plans in their tracks.  In May 2008, the statutory deadline for implementation of the REAL ID Act passed without a single state coming into compliance with the law.      Harper also outlined the many defects of electronic employment eligibility verification in the Cato Policy Analysis, Electronic Employment Eligibility Verification: Franz Kafkas Solution to Illegal Immigration.  In a national EEV system, database errors, data-entry errors, and increasing identity fraud would send thousands of law-abiding American citizens to federal government offices pleading for the right to work.  If such a system were somehow made fully workable, mission creep all but guarantees that it would be used to give the federal government direct regulatory control over many aspects of Americans lives.  Importantly, administering a system like this would need a national ID system like REAL ID to make it work.      During the spring and summer, Harper actively countered the Department of Homeland Securitys promotion of the E-Verify program at Capitol Hill briefings, on major television, and on the Cato@Liberty blog, helping to prevent a head of steam from developing behind bills to make E-Verify a national requirement for all employers. As a result, E-Verify was extended as a voluntary pilot program, but that is a far cry form the nationwide employer mandate expected to pass just a year ago.       In June, Cato published The Cult of the Presidency: Americas Dangerous Devotion to Executive Power, by Cato vice president Gene Healy, who argues that the Framers vision of the chief executive was far more limited and he urges a return to their vision: an executive acting within the limits placed on him by the Constitution, tasked with enforcing the law, checking Congress when it violates the Constitution, defending the country when attackedand little more.  George F. Will described the book as brilliant and the years most pertinent and sobering public affairs book.      In 2008, Cato scholars uncompromisingly dissected the failures of neoconservative defense and foreign policy projects.  Grounded in sober insight, Cato scholars have argued for a policy of peace, respect for other nations, and realism about the policy aims of foreign governments.      Overthrow Saddam? Be Careful What You Wish For. Thats the title of an op-ed by Ted Galen Carpenter published on January 14, 2002, fully 14 months before the invasion of Iraq.  Although overthrowing a cruel dictator such as Saddam Hussein might be gratifying in the short run, wrote Carpenter, it would leave the United States responsible for the political future of a fragile, fractured nation in the longer run.      That op-ed wouldnt be the first time Catos long-serving vice president for defense and foreign policy studies proved prescient.  In the 2008 Cato title Smart Power: Toward a Prudent Foreign Policy for America, that op-ed appears alongside pieces arguing that NATO expansion will lead to frictions with Russia, and that the American drug war will lead to significantly increased violence in Mexico.  Smart Power calls for an end to Americas vast array of security commitments around the world, or as Carpenter puts it, the crazy-quilt pattern of U.S. security commitments and military interventions.  And it calls for a leaner foreign policy, one that reassesses Americas current commitments in light of the core interests of the United States.  Andrew J. Bacevich, author of The Limits of Power, called Smart Power simply superb. . . . [Carpenter] surveys the wreckage of the Bush era and illuminates the way ahead.       In a February Policy Analysis, Learning the Right Lessons from Iraq, Cato foreign policy scholars Benjamin H. Friedman and Christopher Preble, and MIT professor Harvey M. Sapolsky took aim at those who argue that success could have been achieved in Iraq with more troops or a different president in charge.  The real lesson of Iraq is that although the military gives us the power to conquer foreign countries, it does not give us the power to run them.  Because there are few good reasons to take on missions meant to resuscitate failed governments, the most important lesson from the war in Iraq should be a newfound appreciation of the limits of our power.  The study was disseminated widely and was republished in a popular textbook The Use of Force: Military Power and International Politics, 7th edition.      Among those who failed to learn the lessons of Iraq are those calling for a surge in Afghanistan.  In an April Christian Science Monitor piece, Dont Pull an Iraq in Afghanistan, Friedman argued that preventing the creation of terrorist havens in Afghanistan does not require the establishment of a peaceful, centralized state there.  Moreover, accomplishing such a feat is beyond the capabilities of the United States.  Absent this goal, the push for a surge of U.S. or NATO forces in Afghanistan makes little sense.      In a December article in the National Interest, Carpenter pointed to another complication: drugs.  Afghanistan is the worlds leading supplier of heroin, with opium sales accounting for about 35 percent of Afghanistans GDP. U.S.-led efforts to stamp out that trade destroy the livelihoods of the already abjectly poor and encourage natives to join forces with a resurgent Taliban.  Carpenter recommends that U.S. officials keep their priorities straight and focus on rooting out terrorism, a point he made again at a Capitol Hill Briefing, Global Terrors Central Front: Pakistan and Afghanistan.  Foreign policy analyst Malou Innocent addressed the frightening phenomenon of the Talibanization of Pakistan.      In the Cato Policy Analysis Cracks in the Foundation: NATOs New Troubles, Stanley Kober, research fellow in foreign policy studies, says the longstanding North Atlantic Treaty Organization is beginning to fracture.  Its members, sharing the triumphalism that underpinned U.S. foreign policy after the Cold War, took on burdens that have proved more difficult than expected, and, increasingly, they are failing to meet the challenges confronting them.  In Afghanistan, NATO forces are relentlessly under siege by the Taliban, and popular support among member nations for staying there is badly flagging.  Kober pointed out a number of other problems as well: NATO expansion, which has strained the alliances capabilities; the proposed deployment of antiballistic missiles in Poland and the Czech Republic; and a potential flashpoint in Kosovo, where the Albanian majoritys insistence on independence could divide alliance members.           After 15 years at the International Monetary Fund, Cato adjunct scholar Jean-Pierre Chauffor filled a book with the insights he has gained about worldwide economic development in The Power of Freedom: Uniting Human Rights and Development, published by Cato.  In the book, Chauffor criticizes the emphasis placed on positive rights by international development organizations.  As he puts it, when the Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaims a human right to adequate housing, while paying only scant attention to the negative right to property, it has things backward.  Property rights come first.  They allow for the security of ones home.  They also allow for the security of ones business and livelihood, certainty in recouping   ones investments, and the makings of a productive economy that can deliver adequate housing for the citizenrynot to mention health, wealth, education, and a clean environment.      At a Cato Policy Forum in March, development economist William Easterly surveyed decades of evidence on the effectiveness of international aid to developing countries.  He reported that such efforts, at best, produce no effect on local living standards.  At their worst, because such aid typically flows through local leaders who are then able to distribute it to cronies and enforcers first, aid makes people worse off.          Since the federal government began counting in 1820, more than 73 million immigrants have legally entered the United States to settle and begin new lives.  Today, immigrants continue to fill niches in our labor market, at the high and low end of the skill spectrum, while softening the demographic effect of declining birthrates.  Daniel T. Griswold, director of the Center for Trade Policy Studies, personally visited the editorial boards of major newspapers in Chicago, Dallas, Fort Worth, Phoenix, and Los Angeles in 2008 to discuss the importance of immigration reform.  In addition, the Center hosted a Capitol Hill Briefing, featuring Sen. Judd Gregg (R-NH), on raising the caps on H1-B visas in the context of high-skilled immigration.  In June, it hosted a Cato Book Forum featuring Wall Street Journal editorial board member Jason Riley, who spoke on his book Let Them In: The Case for Open Borders.       Finally, the Center for Trade Policy Studies launched a powerful new interactive web feature that allows users to access and analyze the trade voting record of any member of Congress spanning more than a decade.  Users can access the feature directly at www.freetrade.org/congress.       From newsrooms, YouTube, books, and op-ed pages, to talk radio, conferences, research reports, and special website features, Cato has responded swiftly, effectively, and innovatively.  Here are some highlights of Catos commitment to outreach in 2008, with results that reflect the tremendous dedication and energy of Cato scholars, staff, and supporters.   2008 Media Overview Major television appearances: 555         Major radio interviews: 453 Major op-ed placements: 587            Citations in print articles: 2,282 Editorial mentions: 53      In 2008 the Cato Institute installed its own television studio, enabling Cato scholars to appear live on cable, network, and local news program, as well as on international news outlets. The studio also makes it possible for scholars to make consecutive appearances on multiple networks.   Cato strategically expanded its outreach through new media outlets and technologies, rapidly increasing its presence and the reach of its research to a broad range of new audiences, young and old.  The focus of this outreach includes a continually expanding list of blogs related to politics and public policy.  Social networking sites, once the domain of college campuses, have rapidly become an everyday component of the mainstream media and policy worlds. Facebook, one of the social networking giants, now has a Cato presence and page, with over 5,000 users (and growing) sharing, viewing, and discussing Catos work and outreach in online  forums.  Cato also expanded into Twitter, a micro-blogging site that is one of the fastest growing ways to reach national journalists, think-tank scholars, politicians, and everyday citizens.  And in 2008 Cato created its own YouTube channel bringing Cato videos and research to a diverse range of new audiences.      With nearly 600 major op-eds appearing in 2008, Catos perspective on major issues reached millions of readers worldwide.  Key op-eds included:      Alan Reynolds on the economic downturn, Financial Times, January 2     Edward H. Crane and Robert A.

This diligence and innovation played a major role in Catos website seeing a nearly 25 percent increase in web visitors for the year, and in Catos being honored with a WebAward by the Web Marketing Association for outstanding achievement in website development.   With the launch of Cato on Campus as both an independent site and a portal to Catos main site, Cato is now connected with thousands of college and university students worldwide, providing writings and research from the best contemporary and historical minds on individual liberty, limited government, economics, free markets, history, law, philosophy, and political science.      The popularity of Cato Daily Podcasts continues to soar.  There were nearly 2.5 million downloads of podcasts in 2008 alone.  Due to their popularity and content, many of Catos videocasts are now widely viewed on YouTube, where Cato now has its own channel, youtube.com/catoinstitutevideo.      With more than 6,000 attendees in 2008, Catos highly popular public forums featured leading authors, columnists, scholars, and political leaders.  They have been filmed by Voice of America, Bloomberg TV, and CBS News, and are regularly broadcast on C-SPAN and other news networks.  Speakers at forums in 2008 included columnist George Will; former U.S. senator Chuck Hagel; Governor of South Carolina Mark Sanford; Said T. Jawad, Afghanistans ambassador to the United States; Jon Tester, U.S. senator from Montana; and Robert B. Laughlin, Nobel Laureate in Physics.      Catos City Seminars in 2008 were held in New York and Chicago, drawing nearly 600 participants.  The events featured presentations by Jeffrey A. Miron, senior lecturer in economics at Harvard University; broadcast journalist Tucker Carlson; Charles Murray; and Chip Mellor, president and general counsel, Institute for Justice.      With more than 150 participants, Cato University 2008, Freedoms Campaign in the 21st Century, provided attendees with a highly compelling series of lectures, workshops, and special sessions on the prospects for and threats to freedom in the United States and around the globe.    Selected Books and Publications 2008      Through advertising, outreach to reviewers and reporters, author appearances, and online outreach, we have been aggressively increasing Catos book sales.

Friends of the World Food Program	http://www.wfpusa.org	202-530-1694	EIN 13-3843435	1819 L Street, NW Suite 900	Washington	DC	20036	USA	Food, Food Programs, International, International Development, International, Foreign Affairs & National Security, International Relief	World Food Program USA is a nonprofit organization that builds support in the United States to end global hunger. WFP USA engages individuals and organizations, shapes public policy and generates resources for the United Nations World Food Program and other hunger relief operations.	We are the 17th largest donor to the World Food Program, including government donors.	Worldwide	School Meals: School meals programs involve just what the name implies  providing meals in schools. The idea is simple; the impact is significant. Serving food at school not only helps alleviate hunger among the worlds poorest children, it also helps get them into school, providing them with an important key to a better future  an education.  Focus on Women: WFP is committed to using its policies, programs and actions to promote womens empowerment as a key to improving food security for all.  Food for Work: WFPs food for work programs offer food as payment when people go to workbuilding roads, bridges, hospitals, schools, ports and other essential elements of their communities infrastructure. Meanwhile, food for training programs provide food for those who participate in projects that teach a skill, such as sewing or gardening, or offer education on nutrition and health issues.  Purchase for Progress: P4P aims to give small-scale farmers access to reliable markets and the opportunity to sell their surplus crops to WFP at competitive prices. By purchasing crops from local farmers, the program helps them increase their household incomes  a critical component in solving hunger and poverty at the very core. Buying locally also helps WFP distribute food more quickly to those who need it most.  HIV/AIDS: Families who have been affected by the virus often cite food as their greatest need. That is why WFP distributes food to both HIV/AIDS patients and their families. In 2008, WFP provided assistance to 2.4 million people affected by HIV/AIDS. WFP ensures that good nutrition is an integral part of every care package delivered to a person living with HIV/AIDS.  Emergency Response: When emergencies strike, WFP is first on the ground helping people. Whether in the wake of a natural disaster or in the midst of conflict, WFP responds with life-saving food and logistical support. With field offices around the globe and pre-positioned emergency food stocks, WFP is able to deliver food virtually anywhere in the world with as little as one days notice.   Nutrition: For every operation that WFP undertakes, it has to establish what type and quantity of food people need. Its not just a question of providing food, but also making sure what arrives is nutritionally appropriate to address the problem at hand.  Procurement: WFP's procurement offices are based at the Rome headquarters, with teams around the world, and are responsible for securing the food, goods and services needed to support the agency's mission to solve the problem of global hunger.  Food Security Analysis: Before intervening in a country, the first priority for WFP is to analyze the food security situation of the population. WFP's food security analysis work is commonly known as VAM (Vulnerability Analysis and Mapping) and is carried out by 120 analysts around the world.  Logistics: When the areas needing food are not accessible by road, rail or river, other methods are brought into play. An emergency may require a cargo drop from aircraft or a helicopter airlift, but there are other options too. Locally engaged porters, as well as teams of elephants, yaks, donkeys and camels are also used when necessary.	Hungry people in 73 countries around the world.	90 million people

Amazon Conservation Association	http://www.amazonconservation.org	202-234-2356	EIN 52-2211305	1012 14th Street NW, Suite 625	Washington	DC	20005	USA	Biological & Life Sciences, Environment, Forest Conservation, Natural Resources Conservation & Protection, Water, Water Resources, Wetlands Conservation & Management	The mission of the Amazon Conservation Association is to conserve the biological diversity of the Amazon Basin.	Accomplishments:  1. ACA established the worlds first conservation concession, a long-term contractual partnership between the national government and a non-government actor, whereby the civil society actor manages state-owned lands for conservation purposes. ACA protects these 360,000 acres from illegal loggers and slash-and-burn farmers.  2. Since 1999, the Brazil Nut Program has grown to protect over one million acres of tropical forest through community-based conservation. ACA has provided technical support to more than 420 Brazil nut harvesting families and helped obtain voluntary Forest Stewardship Council and organic certifications for dozens of concessions.  3. ACA's flagship field station CICRA at Los Amigos extended its run as the most active research site in the Amazon basin. More than 100 researchers representing 39 different research projects visited the station and seventeen researchers received $75,000 in scholarships from the station in 2008. More than 450 researchers have studied at Los Amigos since its inception.  4. Wayqecha, our state-of-the-art biological research station in Perus cloud forest hosted 41 active research projects in 2008, and continued to protect 1,450 acres of cloud forest. In 2007-2008, 239 species of orchid were inventoried at Wayqecha, indicating that orchid diversity in this area is much higher than predicted.  5. Establishment of the first indigenous conservation concessions managed by the Wachiperi Haramba Queros nation. ACA provided technical support to the Wachiperi throughout the process of applying for the concession, designing its management plan, and preparing the concession application for the Peruvian forest service.		Our Programs ACA focuses on scientific research, the direct protection of critical habitats, sustainable use of natural resources, and environmental education and training for local stakeholders. Our programs include:  Brazil Nut Program: Brazil nuts are a natural forest product whose harvest guarantees income for Amazonian people. ACAs Brazil nut program supports over 500 Brazil nut harvesters to ensure a sustainable livelihood while protecting their forest resource through technical support, training, and certification. Through this program, ACA has ensured the legal protection of a million acres of forest, enabling wildlife to travel safely between protected areas.  Los Amigos Conservation Concession: In 2001, ACA established the world's first private conservation concession in the Los Amigos River watershed. The Los Amigos Conservation Concession protects 360,000 acres of old growth Amazonian forest at the base of the Andes in southeastern Peru, bordering Manu National Park.  The Los Amigos Biological Station: The Los Amigos Biological Station, commonly known as CICRA is located at the confluence of the Madre de Dios and Los Amigos rivers, adjacent to the Los Amigos Conservation Concession. Since 2004, CICRA has been the most active research station in the Amazon Basin, hosting an average of 25 researchers and assistants per day.  Wayqecha Cloud Forest Research Station: In 2005, ACA created Peru's only permanent research center focused on Andean cloud forest ecology and management. This 1,450-acre research center, called Wayqecha, is located in the buffer zone of Manu National Park near Cusco. Here ACA provides scholarships to an average of 15 university students per year to study local biota, ecosystem interactions, and the impacts of climate change on the forest.   Wachiperi Haramba Queros Conservation Concession: In 2008, ACA, in collaboration with the Amazonian Haramba Queros native community, established the first conservation concession in Peru run by an indigenous community. Through support from ACA, the Wachiperi are now successfully ensuring protection of their water supply and continued access to medicinal plants as well as preserving space for their cultural traditions to flourish.  Sustainable Micro-Enterprise Development: ACA works in Cusco and surrounding regions to identify livelihood alternatives for local communities that support land conservation. These projects include the production and marketing of sacha inchi (the Omega 3 oil-rich Incan peanut), production of essential oils and dyes from native plants, agroforestry, and textile production.   REDD Enterprise & Fire Control: The heart of this Cusco-based initiative is reforestation of degraded lands with economically valuable Andean plant species. The cultivation of these species reduces deforestation pressure on the cloud forest by providing an alternative income to local communities. The project includes a strong scientific component, extending research on fire frequency, forest degradation, and greenhouse gas emissions. Most importantly, the project is designed as a scalable REDD mechanism ready to implement in other tropical montane regions.  Los Amigos  Tambopata Corridor:  The Los Amigos-Tambopata (LAT) Corridor Initiative was launched to conserve one of the most important areas for biodiversity conservation in the world, a 519,000-acre area of rainforest in the Peruvian Amazon. It preserves forest cover and biological connectivity by creating a mosaic of conservation areas and sustainable economic activity zones from ACA's Los Amigos Conservation Concession to Tambopata National Reserve, ultimately linking Peru's Manu National Park to  Bolivia's Madidi National Park. This initiative is the centerpiece of ACAs efforts to reduce the environmental impact of the Interoceanic Highway.  Environmental Education and Training: ACAs experienced staff shares innovative conservation tools and practices with local organizations and communities. Our field stations, CICRA and Wayqecha, have become centers for educational trips by local schoolchildren as well as leading training sites for local and international university groups. This focus on training reflects our conviction that saving the greatest forests on Earth requires supercharging a new generation of South American scientists and conservationists.  Conserving the Pampas del Heath, Bolivia: Located in northern Bolivia, the Pampas del Heath are among the best-conserved Amazonian savannas. These natural savannas are home to rare and threatened mammals like the maned wolf and the marsh deer, which are vanishing from the surrounding forest. In the Pampas, ACA monitors flora and fauna, studies fire ecology and traditional indigenous management, and works to ensure the long-term survival of savannas in and around Madidi National Park.

International Justice Mission	http://www.ijm.org	(703) 465-5495	EIN 54-1722887	Po Box 58147	Washington	DC	20037	USA	International, International Development, International Human Rights	The mission of international justice mission is to protect the poor from violence by rescuing victims, bringing the criminals to justice, restoring survivors to safety and strength, and helping local law enforcement build a safe future that lasts.			International justice mission's field operations respond to a vast and devastating category of need: violence against the poor. In the developing world, violence is an everyday threat for the poor. Nearly 36 million people are estimated to be held as modern-day slaves. The international labour organization estimates that human trafficking for sexual or labor slavery generates profits in excess of more than $150 billion annually for traffickers and slave owners, and unicef estimates that nearly two million children are exploited in the sex industry. The land rights of women are violated on a massive scale worldwide, leaving widows and other vulnerable women unable to care for themselves or their children. In many countries, perpetrators of this abuse against the poor face virtually no recourse, despite clear laws against the violations. The rule of law should offer protection to vulnerable people, but, according to a united nations report, more than 4 billion people live outside the protection of the law. Ijm is addressing this crisis by ensuring access to rule of law for the poor through the provision of individual casework services and in collaboration with government partners to reform the justice system. Ijm attorneys, investigators, social workers, community activists and other professionals work in 11 countries throughout africa, latin america, south asia and southeast asia. Ijm protects the poor from violence by partnering with local authorities to:-rescue victims-bring criminals to justice-restore survivors-strengthen justice systemsijm combats slavery, sex trafficking, sexual violence against children, police abuse of power, property grabbing and citizenship rights abuse. By collaborating with communities and governments, ijm serves individual victims of violence and pursues dramatic improvements in the justice system to protect all people vulnerable to the crime. Ijm's unique model to drive maximum-impact, long-term change is called justice system transformation:phase 1: collaborative caseworkijm partners with local authorities to rescue individual victims of a specific crime, bring criminals to justice and restore survivors. By taking on individual cases, ijm also works to strengthen the justice system. Phase 2: system reformijm continues collaborative casework, and launches intense, collaborative projects that aim to dramatically improve the justice system's response to the targeted crime. By using what they have learned through scores of individual cases, ijm teams design projects that will help fix what is most broken in the justice system. Phase 3: sustain gainsijm monitors and evaluates results and continues to support local government partners. At this point, the justice system can be counted on to effectively protect poor people from the targeted form of violence. In 2014 ijm and ijm-trained partners brought tangible relief to 4,376 people and provided aftercare services or trainings for thousands more. Each victory represents the tenacious work of ijm's frontline team of attorneys, social workers and investigators-work that continues long-term as survivors heal and rebuild their lives with the assistance of ijm aftercare, and as ijm attorneys pursue justice in court processes that can take years. In 2014 ijm and ijm-trained partners worked with local authorities to bring freedom to 2,668 forced labor slaves, and ijm assisted local authorities in rescuing 258 victims of sex trafficking. Ijm helped restore property to 361 impoverished widows and orphans. Ijm teams helped to protect 135 child survivors of sexual assault around the world and ensured 44 innocent men and women were set free from prison in kenya. Ijm also ensured 904 hill tribe members were granted the thai citizenship to which they are entitled-reducing vulnerability to trafficking and other forms of violent oppression. Ijm legal teams worked alongside local law enforcement to ensure the arrest of 372 accused perpetrators of violence against the poor. A total of 165 perpetrators were convicted of their crimes-men and women who believed they could act with impunity simply because of their victims' poverty. Ijm conducted police trainings and community- and church-based trainings throughout the developing world, equipping vulnerable people, community leaders, and law enforcement with the knowledge they need to protect themselves and their communities from violent oppression. These figures encompass ijm's casework in 18 field offices. They do not include the results of two casework alliance partnership offices in south america.   building a movement: ijm seeks to fuel a global justice movement and advance its mission by drawing the world's attention to violence against the poor, expanding the number of people and institutions engaged in the fight for justice, influencing leaders in all sectors to become champions for protecting the poor, and equipping christians to joyfully serve in the work of justice. The ijm institute for biblical justice equips christian leaders and influencers with theological foundations for combating injustice. Ijm's church mobilization team helps church communities engage in the justice movement, both in local communities and globally. More than 330 churches around the u. S. Are deeply invested in ijm's work and building justice ministries in their own communities. In 2014, more than 88,600 people heard ijm's message and connected with ijm through forums, conferences and churches in the u. S. Ijm student mobilization supports a growing "justice generation" of students serving as new leaders in the fight for international human rights. Working with college campus chapters and high schools across the u. S. , ijm's programs empower students to leverage their talents and energy to fight slavery and other forms of everyday violence against the poor. In 2014, more than 98,000 students advocated for justice with ijm: thousands signed petitions; student leaders from more than 50 schools participated in our northstar student leadership conference; and students from more than 150 schools, 40 states and eight countries took a stand for freedom. Ijm's government relations & advocacy team engages grassroots advocates in supporting u. S. Government policies that will combat violence against the poor. Ijm has provided thousands of individuals and groups with concrete tools for sharing about everyday violence and mobilizing policymakers to help end it. In 2014, more than 54,000 advocates took action by signing petitions or postcards asking their elected officials to stand up for the poor. In ijm's field offices around the world, community relations teams work within their own cities to spread information on legal rights and help the poor pursue justice through police and local courts. In places like india and the philippines, media and local churches are taking hold of the vision and empowering communities to seek justice in new and exciting ways. In india, nearly 135,000 people are now praying for justice regularly through information provided by ijm. By raising awareness of the issue of violence against the poor, ijm brings allies from all walks of life into the struggle to protect the poor from violence. Ijm's work has been featured by outlets such as forbes magazine, the washington post, the times of india, the guardian, the new york times, the new yorker, foreign affairs, "the today show," "the oprah winfrey show," "dateline nbc," msnbc, cnn, bbc world news and national public radio, among many others.

National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy	http://www.thenationalcampaign.org	202-478-8500	EIN 52-1974611	1776 Massachusetts Ave, NW Suite 200	Washington	DC	20036	USA	Children & Youth, Children & Youth Services, Public & Societal Benefit	Our mission is to improve the well-being of children, youth, and families by reducing teen and unplanned  pregnancies.			Media - reaching teens, young adults, and parents through entertainment and digital media is one of the organization's priorities. On the entertainment media front, the campaign has developed partnerships with more than 100 major entertainment media leaders and with every major television broadcast and cable network most popular with teens, their parents, and with young adults as well. Over the years, campaign messages have appeared in television programs, magazines, and websites seen by tens of millions of people. The media program also relies heavily on reaching parents, teens, and young adults through digital websites, social networking sites, and mobile technologies. In addition, games are developed to affect teens' and young adults' sexual attitudes, knowledge, and behavior. A series of evaluation studies, including a 2014 study crediting mtv teen pregnancy reality shows with one-third of the decline in the nation's teen birth rate, suggest this work is helping the campaign meet its mission. On the digital front, we use all forms of new media-including websites, social networking sites, mobile technologies, and games-to positively change teens' and young adults' sexual attitudes, knowledge, and behavior in positive directions. The campaign's digital media and entertainment media programs work closely together to get messages to our target audiences through our entertainment media partners' digital outlets. Our award-winning properties-including thenationalcampaign. Org, stayteen. Org, and bedsider. Org-attract more than 9 million visitors annually. As part of the media program, the campaign received donated radio and televised public service announcement airtime, internet and print advertising space, and donated supplies.   communications - the communications program works to keep the issue of teen and unplanned pregnancy in the public's mind, to communicate the campaign's messages and ideas, and to produce and market campaign products. The program works in three primary areas: press relations, publications, and the web. The campaign develops, produces, and disseminates a wide range of materials from influential research to posters, postcards, public service announcements, and a host of cutting-edge digital activities, including the annual national day to prevent teen pregnancy and #thxbirthcontrol efforts. The campaign has distributed well over 10 million materials, and campaign messages, research, and staff have appeared in more than 10,000 newspaper articles and have reached millions more through appearances on television and radio.   partnerships and special initiatives - a key part of the campaign's work is to forge strategic partnerships with other organizations that will help advance the campaign's mission. In addition to working with groups in the field, the campaign makes a concerted effort to partner with influential groups in other sectors. For example, the campaign works with education groups (including the american association of community colleges), medical groups (including the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists), faith groups (including nueva esperanza), groups focused on child welfare and juvenile justice (including the national council of juvenile and family court judges), and other leadership groups (including sigma gamma rho, a major african-american sorority). In essence, its partnership work is largely guided by the following: there are numerous large sectors and programs (many of which receive immense amounts of public funding) that engage and interact with thousands of high risk teens and young adults every day. Although these sectors and programs deal with the consequences of teen and unplanned pregnancy, most do little to include pregnancy planning and prevention in their work. The campaign works closely with some of these influential groups to modify this equation and include pregnancy planning and prevention in their programs and services.

Many of these families have traveled long distances and face extended stays in our area. The Houses make it possible for families to stay together during a time of crisis, and for parents to focus on their sick child without having to worry about how or where they will sleep or eat. In addition to having their basic needs met, families also draw strength from having the opportunity to share their experience with other families in similar circumstances. In our Houses these families find a warm, understanding, and supportive refuge. Parents and other caregivers also spend many hours at the hospital with their children. The Ronald McDonald Family Room  at Children''s National Medical Center is a quiet haven within the hospital where parents and other caregivers, often anxious and overwhelmed, can go to rest and regroup. The Ronald McDonald Care Mobile , operated in partnership with Georgetown University Hospital, helps to ensure that under-served children in our community have access to quality medical care. Finally, through our Grants and Scholarships Programs, RMHC is pleased to be able to support other local nonprofits with programs that benefit children and to provide college scholarships to young adults helping them to reach their full potential.	The new Washington, D.C. Ronald McDonald House opened its doors in December 2010 and serves patients from Childrens National Medical Center, MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, National Rehabilitation Hospital and several other area hospitals.  The 26-bedrooms House includes common family and support areas, a family kitchen and dining room, a family library and computer room, a family laundry room.   Our newest Home-Away-From-Home also offers special isolation suites for our most immune-compromised patients.  Ronald McDonald Houses are supported by volunteers and staff, but more importantly, the Houses continue to be a quiet refuge where families in similar circumstances can support and comfort each other.  The original Washington Ronald McDonald House opened its doors in June of 1980, and was the sixteenth House to open in the six years since the program began.  Over thirty years it was a  home-away-from-home for more than 14,000 families of critically ill children.  Although the nearly one hundred-year-old Spanish colonial had served our purposes well, it no longer met the space or functional needs of our growing number of families.  In 2006, a Capital Campaign was launched to raise funds to build the new House located on 14th Street NE.	Parts of Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, and all of D.C.	Ronald McDonald Houses: RMHC of Greater Washington DC operates two Houses, one in DC and the other in Northern Virginia. The Houses provide a "home away from home" for the families of seriously ill children who have traveled to this area to receive treatment at local hospitals.The DC House serves Children's National Medical Center, Georgetown University Hospital, Walter Reed Army Medical Center, and several other area hospitals. The House in Northern Virginia is located on the grounds of INOVA Fairfax Hospital. Since opening their doors, the two Houses have together served almost 17,000 families.Ronald McDonald Family Room: Located in Children's National Medical Center, the Family Room is a place of respite where families can go to have a cup of coffee, read, check email, or just rest - away from the often stressful hospital environment but just steps from their child.Kids Mobile Medical Clinic/Ronald McDonald Care Mobile: Operated in partnership with Georgetown University Hospital, the care mobile is a medical clinic on wheels providing care to uninsured and under-served children in DC.Outreach Program: RMHC provides grants to other area non-profits with programs that benefit children.In addition, each year RMHC awards scholarships to area high school seniors for their freshman year of college. Funding for our outreach programs is derived solely from donations made annually on World Children's Day. All other funds raised from the community are used for Ronald McDonald House programs and services.							
Violence Policy Center	http://www.vpc.org		EIN 52-1571442	1730 Rhode Island Ave Nw Ste 1014	Washington	DC	20036	USA	Crime & Law, Gun Control, Health	Each year, firearms kill nearly 30,000 Americans--more than all other household and recreational products combined.  Yet firearms are virtually exempt from federal health and safety regulation.  The overarching framework of the VPC's research, education, and advocacy efforts is "guns as consumer products" and the need to hold the gun industry's products to the same health and safety standards that virtually all other consumer products must meet.  The VPC's twin goals are to aid the general public's understanding of firearms violence as a public health, rather than solely a crime, issue (the vast majority of gun death is not felony related), and to use the VPC's research and public education activities to shape public policy while involving individuals and organizations from affected constituencies--consumer, youth, domestic violence, civil rights, faith, and public health--in a national movement to reduce gun death and injury.			The VPC conducts research and educational activities on violence and related issues, including:  the impact of firearms violence on specific populations, such as youth, women, and minorities; the link between firearms availability and rates of mortality and morbidity; and, the increasing lethality of weapons marketed by the firearms industry to the civilian population.  VPC research shapes public debate and guides policymaking.  Some highlights resulting from the VPC's work include:  dramatically reducing the number of illegitimate gun dealers in the U.S.; terminating a federal program that re-armed convicted, often violent, felons at taxpayer expense; passing the Domestic Violence Offender Gun Ban, which bans gun possession by individuals convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence crimes; first identifying the threat posed by gun shows as a source of criminal gun trafficking; and, working to protect the legal rights of the victims of firearms violence and defective firearms.  The VPC is also a leading resource for the press and is cited hundreds of times each year in leading publications and news outlets.  At the state and local levels, VPC state-based studies looking at such issues as murder-suicide, female homicide victimization, black homicide victimization, and other violence-related issues increase public awareness and focus press attention on gun violence in areas of the country where policy issues regarding gun death and injury are less often addressed.  At the same time, the VPC works with national and local organizations with interests beyond gun control to build the broadest possible base of support for violence prevention.

Climate (energy & arctic): greenpeace is campaigning for a rapid and just transition to a clean energy economy. Our world is hotter now than it has been in two thousand years and, if current trends continue, by the end of the century the global temperature will likely climb higher than at any time in the past two million years. The arctic is warming faster than the rest of the globe and is experiencing some of the most severe climate impacts on the planet. In the u. S. , coal-fired power plants are the single largest source of global warming pollution. The expansion of u. S. Coal exports threatens to become the country's single largest new source of carbon pollution.

Destructive fishing and over fishing are among the most significant threats facing the world's oceans. In addition to wreaking havoc on fish populations, destructive fishing practices harm marine birds and mammals, coastal fishing grounds that many communities rely on, and deep water habitats that are essential for many species to survive.

Ancient forests are home to two-thirds of all plant and animal species found on land, and millions of people rely on them for survival. Forests also store vast amounts of carbon in their trees and soil, which is released into the atmosphere when they are burned or cleared.

We apply this mission especially to youth-at-risk in the D.C. area.    The skills of auditions call for the same skills that job interviews require.  Directing actors is the same as supervising employees.  Coordinating tasks of actors and stage crews require the same organizational skills required in assigning jobs to employees.  Paying performers brings in the business principles of accounting.  Promoting shows is in line with marketing principles of selling any product.  Managing a theater company requires the same skills necessary for running a corporation.  Abstinence from sex, drugs and violence increases a young persons' chances for success in theater as well as in life.  ACTING is simply the ACT of communicating, i.e., using facial expressions, body language, and articulation to send a message that causes someone to ACT, reACT, or take ACTion.      According to recent police department statistics, cited in the Washington Post (S. Weichselbaum, 7/24/03), "eighty percent of DC's homicides occur East of the River and parts of nearby northeast Washington."  This rate is comparable to the rate of drug arrests and teen sexual activity, which is considerably high across the city.  Our programs use the lure of the performing arts to open youth to alternative after-school activities as well as lessons in alternative behavior that encourage abstinence from sex, drugs, and violence.

Supreme court cases including mccullen, as well as hobby lobby, for which we created branding around not my boss business and mobilized more than 300 activists for two rallies at the supreme court during arguments. We also mobilized our supporters to take over 40,000 actions in the lead-up to the senate vote to support the not my boss business act; worked in concert with a wide range of groups (30+); and alerted our supporters as to how policymakers voted, asking them to say thank you or hold them accountable. We also worked to expose crisis pregnancy centers, fake clinics designed to mislead and prevent women facing unintended pregnancy from considering or accessing abortion services. A major project under this program was working with google to remove two-thirds of the misleading cpc ads that appear on the site and violated googles ad terms. Yahoo followed suit and announced it too would remove some ads for cpcs identified by naral. As part of our work on cpcs, we also produced a national report, comprising a written report, as well as a video detailing our cpc investigations. A key feature will be a microsite as well as information on what our state affiliates are doing about cpcs, with links to their work. We also work with our affiliates and chapters in 22 states on a variety of projects, including working with our colorado affiliate to introduce proactive policy that would protect reproductive freedom, as well as collaborating with our massachusetts affiliate to organize and mobilize 1,500 people after the mccullen ruling. At the campus level, we had almost 2,000 high-action activist shifts throughout the naral network in the 2014 academic year. Each of the nearly 2,000 activist high-action taker activities ranged from attending a meeting/training hosted by a naral affiliate.   support of california affiliate - the organization, naral pro-choice america foundation (naral foundation), has been operating in california on behalf of its affiliate, naral pro-choice california foundation (npccf), in recent years and has taken over their activities.

We invest in emerging women leaders -- pioneers of economic, political, and social advancement in their countries -- and build the capabilities, connections, and credibility they need to unlock their potential as catalysts of global progress.			Signature fellowships:vital voices' signature fellowships are programs that build women leaders' capacity through group training, mentoring and targeted follow-on support, and peer-to-peer exchanges and networking. Throughout these programs, vital voices fellows crystallize their vision for change to make an impact in their communities and beyond. Vvlead fellowship: in 2014, vital voices kicked off the second year of a three-year fellowship program with initial funding from the uk government's department for international development. Vvlead fellows, who work across sectors to end violence against women, end forced/early marriage, and increase women's economic empowerment, participated in online and in-person interventions. These included peer learning exchanges, trainings, networking opportunities, challenge grant opportunities, and peer mentorship, all of which are based on the results of a needs assessment that fellows completed when chosen for the program. In 2014, vital voices selected its second cohort of fellows, increasing the total number of fellows to 206, with participants ranging in age from 21 to 82 from over 55 countries in the global south. As part of the core vvlead program, vital voices managed an online learning platform and organized in-person programming for 8-9 fellows in ghana in march, mexico in june, and nepal in august, and for 62 fellows in south africa in november. Each in-person program engaged fellows from across the globe to participate in activities to connect, learn, and collaborate. These four-day programs included fellow-, consultant- and staff-led trainings; facilitated networking and action planning sessions; incorporated site visits; and fostered group dialogue about critical issues facing women leaders across the globe. Vv grow fellowship: the vv grow fellowship is a highly competitive one-year accelerator program for women who own small-and medium-sized businesses in latin america and the caribbean, the middle east and north africa, and sub-saharan africa. The program includes customized business skills training, technical assistance, leadership development, and access to networks to grow their businesses and increase their leadership impact. Through global and regional online and in-person interventions, fellows focus on strategy and long-term business value paired with action-oriented plans. They amplify their role as leaders in their businesses and their communities to ultimately create jobs, stimulate long-term economic growth, and produce wider social benefits. In 2014 vital voices partnered with women who own small-and medium-sized businesses through the vv grow fellowship to help them achieve their business growth goals, and a total of 64 women from 31 countries in the 2014 cohort graduated from the program. Vital voices and a team of consultants and external experts refined a global training curriculum developed in 2013 for the 2014-2015 vv grow fellowship, which was then tailored to achieve learning objectives based on the diverse needs across regions. The curriculum included modules on executive financial management, leadership, networking, business planning, and understanding your market. The 2014-2015 fellowship involved an intensive participant selection process; online training; three regional, in-person trainings; and individualized growth services and support to address the unique needs of each fellow's business. In october 2014, three four-day regional, in-person trainings were held in amman, jordan; buenos aires, argentina; and dar es salaam, tanzania, where 20-23 fellows worked with expert trainers and vital voices staff to build their knowledge, skills, and networks and make progress toward their growth goals. With the support of vital voices staff and trainers, fellows established one- to five-year business growth goals and action plans to achieve them. Through the growth service and support phase, vital voices staff connected fellows to resources and support to meet their unique needs and achieve their business growth goals. Vv grow mentoring: the vv grow mentoring program pairs women owners of small-and medium-sized businesses with corporate executive mentors. For six months, mentors and mentees work together to define and make progress toward short-term business growth goals. The program incorporates mentoring best practices from partner organizations in 10 countries and facilitates individualized business advice, confidence building, and networking opportunities. Through the program, the mentees amplify their role as leaders in their businesses and communities to ultimately create jobs, stimulate long-term economic growth and produce wider social benefits. In 2014, the citi foundation and the walmart foundation funded the completion of program pilots in five countries that began in 2013: argentina, egypt, el salvador, kenya, and nicaragua. A total of 157 mentees, all women business owners, were paired with corporate executive mentors for a six-month, one-on-one mentoring relationship. Global freedom exchange: the second annual global freedom exchange, a vital voices and hilton worldwide partnership, provided a dynamic educational and mentoring opportunity for emerging and established women leaders who are on the forefront of global efforts to prevent and respond to child trafficking. The global freedom exchange brought together a select group of 18 women ngo leaders from 10 countries around the world to participate in a two-week fellowship program. The program took place in november and spanned three us metropolitan areas: washington, dc, new york city, and dallas, texas. Activities included opportunities to meet with government officials, to discuss best practices with ngo leaders, to provide donors with knowledge about funding needs and the best mechanisms for support, and to learn about collaborative approaches to working with local law enforcement. This program provided participants with specific knowledge, skills, and relationships that benefitted their professional development, their respective ngos, and the communities they serve. The program also provided sub-grants to support the work of five fellows in their home countries.   activating the network:the programs that activate the vital voices network facilitate ongoing engagement with the women leaders with whom vital voices partners and support their deep-rooted commitment to "paying it forward. " these programs promote advocacy, foster an enabling environment for women's leadership, and ignite and organize top leaders around key issues. Supporting public advocacy regional competitiveness (sparc): in 2014, vital voices conducted the sparc program, the third year of a 4-year economic advocacy program. The sparc program works with partner businesswomen associations to advocate for an enabling economic environment for women. In 2014, vital voices provided expert consultations, advocacy and capacity-building support, and financial support to help qualified africa businesswomen's network partners strengthen advocacy skills and implement robust advocacy campaigns. Fortune/u. S. State department global women's mentoring partnership: through a partnership with the u. S. Department of state and fortune's most powerful women, vital voices gathered 23 emerging leaders from 17 countries across the globe to come to the united states for a month-long mentoring program. The program connected participants with fortune's most powerful women and their executive teams as mentors and included leadership and communication trainings, discussions with american women leaders about their personal and professional journeys, and networking events. In october, vital voices organized the international alumnae component in amman, jordan. The three-day training for 12 alumnae was designed to increase their capacity, equip them with new contacts, and strengthen the network of alumnae in the middle east and north africa region. Vital voices maintained the alumnae network through online and social media communication and engagement, connecting alumnae with grant opportunities and inviting alumnae to participate in other vital voices programs. Vital voices also deepened ties with former program participants by connecting them with other leaders in the vital voices network and advising them on their various projects and initiatives. Global ambassadors program: the global ambassadors program (gap) is a multi-year partnership with bank of america, in which women leaders who are at a tipping point of their professional, business, and leadership paths (mentees) receive mentorship, training, and opportunities for visibility from global ambassadors (mentors) who are global leaders in the business, nonprofit, government and social enterprise sectors. In 2014, vital voices organized the program in mexico, northern ireland, and poland. Each program engaged eight to nine mentees who received strategic support and guidance from their global ambassador mentors to identify action steps and to achieve professional goals. These week-long programs included one-on-one and group mentoring sessions and public forums to provide visibility on critical issues impeding women's economic advancement. Trainings ranged from communications to strategic planning, and financial management and fund-raising to crisis management and work/life balance. The global ambassadors program held in mexico in march focused on furthering the economic empowerment of women business leaders in the latin america and the caribbean region, from corporate executives to entrepreneurs who lead small and medium-sized enterprises (smes). The challenges facing the region include balancing macroeconomic policies, structural reforms, and responding to changes in the chinese and us economies. The global ambassadors program held in belfast, northern ireland, in may commemorated the 15th anniversary of the 1998 good friday peace accords and the vital voices conference where former first lady hillary clinton called for women's engagement as a means of affecting peace and prosperity. Mentees were invited from countries classified as being "post-conflict," "in-conflict," or "fragile states" to discuss how the peace process can further the economic empowerment of women business leaders and increase women's economic opportunities. Topics included best practices, lessons learned, and experiences of the transition from conflict to peace to prosperity. The global ambassadors program held in warsaw, poland, in september focused on addressing the ongoing needs and challenges facing women leaders engaged in business, social enterprise, and ngos in the eastern europe region - including poland, russia, and ukraine - as they navigate through the current political instability in this region. Qatar program: with support from humanity united, vital voices implemented a program in qatar to better inform and equip qatari women to assume leadership and advocacy roles prior to the unprecedented expansion and development leading up to the world cup in qatar in 2022. Vital voices worked with the mena businesswomen's network (mena bwn), which was established by vital voices in 2012, and other vital voices network members to convene a leadership circle of 15 influential women in qatar whose interests included human rights and human trafficking. The leadership circle recommended students researching and working on qatari women's engagement and empowerment, migrant worker welfare issues, and other social issues to participate in a one-day leadership training in november, during which 20 young qatari women were introduced to vital voices' leadership principles and to leadership circle and mena bwn members. Gender based violence emergency response and protection initiative: publicly launched in march 2014, the gender based violence emergency response and protection initiative is designed to address extreme forms of gender-based violence and harmful traditional practices around the world. With support from the us department of state's bureau of democracy, human rights & labor, the program aims to achieve the following three objectives: 1) provide emergency assistance to those facing extreme acts of gender-based violence (gbv) including harmful traditional practices; 2) provide advocacy, support, prevention, and technical assistance to gbv survivors and those working to address gender-based violence; 3) provide a focal point to improving gbv regional and international network coordination. The emergency assistance provides short-term grants for expenses that include medical expenses, psychosocial support or counseling, emergency shelter, relocation expenses, and livelihood. The gbv initiative has provided vital voices' extensive network of women leaders with information about the emergency assistance and how to refer survivors. In 2014, vital voices re-engaged members of the network by incorporating them and their organizations into the advisory council for the initiative, adding their organizations to the broader global network of gbv service providers maintained by vital voices. Preventing sexual violence initiative summit: in june 2014, vital voices brought ten network leaders from around the world to attend the global summit to end sexual violence in conflict, sponsored by the united kingdom's foreign and commonwealth office's preventing sexual violence initiative. The opportunity allowed vital voices to re-engage women and men leaders of the network around a global convening of activists working to end violence against women in conflict. Over the course of three days, the ten women and men attended sessions of their choosing, including the following topics: the documentation and investigation of sexual violence; women, peace, and security; survivor-centric responses; legislative frameworks; improving evidence collection; accountability; international protocols; prosecuting sexual violence; men and boys as victims; actions for enabling human rights defenders; reparations; and the role of faith leaders in tackling sexual violence. During the week, additional events were held as an opportunity to highlight more grassroots organizations and activists, giving the opportunity for two women leaders with the vital voices delegation to discuss their strategies for tackling sexual violence in south africa and liberia. The convening also provided the opportunity for some members of the vital voices delegation to engage with members of the us government, including private meetings with the ambassador for global women's issues, as well as media opportunities for other network members. Annpower: vital voices, in partnership with ann inc. , selected fifty young women from across the u. S. To participate in a training and mentorship program held in washington, dc for three days. Selected participants, who are rising juniors and seniors in high school, worked together to develop community projects and were advised by established women leaders from across the world. Vital voices managed the recruitment and application process, implemented the leadership training curriculum and encouraged ongoing mentoring relationships and peer connections amongst the  strategic investments:vital voices' strategic investments programs catalyze the visions of women leaders. By making strategic investments in them through targeted technical support, building their credibility and visibility in the community and globally, and curating a system of support from champions in the vital voices network, the strategic investments programs provide deep, individualized investment in women leaders who possess a clearly articulated and bold vision. Justice institutes: since 2010, vital voices has been investing in human rights leaders by co-implementing the institute model, which brings together judges, prosecutors, police officers, and representatives of both governmental and non-governmental victim services providers for multi-disciplinary trainings in their home countries. The innovative and interactive training model focuses on the investigation and prosecution of crimes of violence against women and facilitates the creation of a holistic and victim-centered response to such crimes. It is one comprehensive resource that vital voices is able to offer to women in our network who are tackling sexual violence and human trafficking in their home communities.

SWHR was founded in 1990 by a group of physicians, medical researchers and health advocates who wanted to bring attention to the myriad of diseases and conditions that affect women uniquely. Womens health, until then, had been defined primarily as reproductive health. Women were not routinely included in most major medical research studies and scientists rarely considered biological sex as a variable in their research.   SWHR advocates for greater public and private funding for womens health research and the study of sex differences that affect the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of disease; encourages the appropriate inclusion of women and minorities in medical research studies; promotes the analysis of research data for sex and ethnic differences; and informs women, health care providers, and policy makers about contemporary womens health issues through media outreach and periodic briefings, conferences and special events.		U.S.A.	Scientific - the society maintains a dialogue with the public and private sector research communities to educate them about the need for research in women's health and the study of sex differences. The society co-owns the biology of sex difference journal (to enhance the knowledge of sex and gender difference) and pays the salary of the editor in-chief. The society also sponsors the swhr isis fund for sex-based biology research to promote collaborations among scientists by supporting the development of interdisciplinary research networks. These networks address crosscutting questions in the biology of sex differences.   public education - the society seeks to educate women about the value of biomedical research and about the latest findings that could improve their health and about the differences that impact how diseases and conditions affect men and women. The society is the publisher of the savvy woman patient: how and why sex differences can affect your health.   policy and advocacy - the society seeks to increase appropriations for biomedical research into conditions that affect women and for sex differences research, to ensure both that women are included appropriately in clinical trials and that trial results (research findings) be analyzed for sex and gender differences, and to provide permanent authorization for offices of women's health in seven federal agencies. In addition, the society seeks to ensure appropriate funding for the offices of womens health at nih, hhs, and fda.

Earth policy institute (epi) works to provide a roadmap for saving civilization, which it calls plan b. It continues to refine this plan and to support it with the latest scientific data. Human behavior changes either in response to new information or new experience. Epi disseminates information to guide the process of change. Its goal is to generate visibility and to build public support for global action to stabilize climate, stabilize population, and rebuild the economy's natural support systems. The research agendathe research team has been mindful of environmental trends throughout the year. The first part of the year was dedicated to two plan b updates on plastic bags. The first, "plastic bag bans spreading in the united states," detailed that more than 20 million americans live in communities with plastic bag bans or fees. Along with a timeline on the short history of the plastic bag and selected dates of note, the team created a live google map of the 133 cities and counties around the united states with anti-plastic bag legislation. The second update, "the downfall of the plastic bag: a global picture," discussed some of the major initiatives around the world to reduce plastic bag use. It too included a timeline and live map. The pieces were referenced by numerous news sources including scientific american, salon. Com, ecowatch, native american times, emagazine, the portland press herald, north denver news, and investor ideas. Voice of america interviewed janet larsen in september on plastic bag ordinances in the u. S. And world. Another update that generated media coverage was lester's piece "can the world feed china" china has become a leading world grain importer, set to buy a staggering 22 million tons in the 2013-14 trade year. With lester's controversial history writing about china's food situation, the piece made waves in china and was picked up by a number of news services there. In the u. S. , it was redistributed on population media center's email list and posted on their website. It was also translated into hungarian. It also resulted in a speaking invitation at the woodrow wilson center in d. C. Subjects covered by data highlights included arctic sea ice in freefall, wind opening a lead over nuclear in china, solar panel production in china doubling, and geothermal power approaching 12,000 megawatts worldwide. Three eco-economy indicators were released on global temperature, wind power, and solar power. The indicator on solar power by j. Matthew roney was referenced in a post on the sinosphere blog of the new york times titled "china's solar panel production comes at a dirty cost. " also released were a number of fact sheets on the institute's main areas of interest. (see appendix a. ) in addition, epi's bike-sharing pieces from 2013 continued to attract attention. For instance, it was highlighted in the bloomberg article "china races ahead of the pack as bike sharing goes viral" and was also featured on the front page of the wall street journal in the article "city bike-sharing programs hit speed bumps. " our research was also referenced in the new york post article "bill could allow riders to pay for bike shares with pre-tax dollars. " the research team focused most of the second half of the year on completing the great transition: shifting from fossil fuels to solar and wind energy discussing the energy transition is complex undertaking, especially as new data are released almost daily. The great transition details many of the achievements being made by countries to a greater reliance on renewable energy, especially solar and wind energy. Plans are to deliver the book by the research team to the epi's publishers by the end of december with publication of the u. S. Edition in early march. The outreach effort it will take an enormous dissemination effort to guide the global transition to a plan b economy.

American Immigration Council	http://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/	202.507.7500	EIN 52-1549711	1331 G Street, NW Suite 200	Washington	DC	20005	USA	Civil Rights, Ethnic &  Immigrant Centers, Human Services, Immigration	The American Immigration Council (formerly the American Immigration Law Foundation) was established in 1987 as an IRS designated 501(c)(3),  tax-exempt, not-for-profit educational, charitable organization.  Our mission is to strengthen America by honoring our immigrant history and shaping how Americans think about and act towards immigration now and in the future.   The American Immigration Council exists to promote the prosperity and cultural richness of our diverse nation by:      Educating citizens about the enduring contributions of America's immigrants;      Standing up for sensible and humane immigration policies that reflect American values;      Insisting that our immigration laws be enacted and implemented in a way that honors fundamental constitutional and human rights;      Working tirelessly to achieve justice and fairness for immigrants under the law.  The American Immigration Council believes that the dignity of the individual knows no boundary. Our nation's moral and ethical values must be reflected in the way we welcome immigrants.		Nationwide	The American Immigration Council has four main program areas, the Legal Action Center, the Community Education Center, the Immigration Policy Center and the International Exchange Center. The Legal Action Center (LAC) of the American Immigration Council advocates for fundamental fairness in U.S. immigration law.

Street Sense	http://www.streetsense.org	202-347-2006	EIN 20-1297050	1317 G St Nw	Washington	DC	20005	USA	Homeless & Housing, Homeless Centers, Human Services	The mission of Street Sense is to empower the homeless and educate the public about issues of homelessness, utilizing a bi-weekly newspaper as the vehicle. Street Sense works to address the challenges of homelessness in a unique and innovative way  by providing a low-barrier employment opportunity for homeless men and women to earn an income and move toward financial self-sufficiency. Homeless vendors make a personal financial investment in the paper, purchasing each issue for 35 cents and selling the paper for one dollar, earning on average $45 per day. In addition to the economic opportunities afforded by Street Sense, the organization gives those facing homelessness a voice; about half of the articles in Street Sense are written by homeless and formerly homeless vendors.	Street Sense was established in August 2003 after two volunteers, Laura Thompson Osuri and Ted Henson, approached the National Coalition for the Homeless with the idea to start a newspaper as a means of empowering the less fortunate. On November 15, 2003, the first issue of Street Sense debuted with just a dozen homeless vendors selling 5,000 copies. Today, Street Sense has three professionals, more than 100 active vendors and nearly 30,000 copies in circulation each month. Street Sense is a member of the National Association of Street Newspapers (NASNA), which comprises thirty street newspapers across North America.   For Street Sense to be successful, vendors must be making improvements in their lives. Our most recent vendor survey indicates that 19% of responding vendors moved into housing of their own since coming to Street Sense and 21% began full- or part-time jobs. Nearly 100% of vendors reported improvements in their lives through reconnecting with family, obtaining drug or alcohol treatment or simply gaining a sense of pride and self-respect; the vendors attribute these successes to Street Sense. One vendor said of Street Sense, Its like a string of pearlsone good thing after another. Another vendor, commenting on the changes Street Sense brought to his life: An increase in self-esteem, residential stability, a stronger determination and focus for my life and the ability to start living my dreams.	Washington, D.C. Metro Area	We produce Street Sense, a 16-page bi-weekly newspaper, and provide it at a price below cost, to homeless individuals who then sell the paper and keep the proceeds to support daily survival and, ultimately, move them out of homelessness. Anyone can become a Street Sense vendor by attending a one-hour training session. New vendors receive a small supply of free papers to help them get started; established vendors make a personal investment of $.35 for each copy and then sell the paper for a $1 donation (many customers pay more).  The vendors are independent contractors who strategically choose their locations and the hours that they sell. Our most determined vendors sell up to 1,000 papers each month.The average Street Sense vendor earns $45 a day and sells papers for four hours each day. A subset of Street Sense vendors write, edit or lay out the paper, earning free newspapers.  The organization is increasingly focused on providing training to vendors to help them sell the paper successfully and arm them with the necessary skills to secure full-time employment. In January 2010, Street Sense launched a series of workshops focused on skill-building in the areas of sales, technology and job interviewing.	Our target group is the homeless population of Washington, DC. Currently, we have 102 active vendors. They are a racially- and ethnically-diverse group, including men and women and ranging in age from 20-70 years old.  Further we seek to educate the entire metropolitan area about the issues of homelessness, hunger and poverty.	Currently, more than 100 homeless vendors are earning an income, regaining a sense of dignity and moving on a path toward financial self-sufficiency through Street Sense. Many more are impacted by the organization each year.					
Family Research Council Inc	http://www.frc.org	(202) 393-2100	EIN 52-1792772	801 G St Nw	Washington	DC	20001	USA	Education, Human Services	Our vision is a culture in which human life is valued, families flourish, and religious liberty thrives.			Public policy --"a popular government, without popular information, or the means of acquiring it, is but a prologue to a farce or a tragedy. . . A people who mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives. " -- james madison, chief architect of the u. S constitution and u. S. Presidentoverview: when frc was established over 30 years ago, there were woefully few voices advocating for the primacy of the family at the national level. Liberal policy makers, activist judges, and much of the media and academia considered traditional moral values nothing more than the vestiges of a bygone era. In 1983, family research council was established in the heart of washington, d. C. With the mission to educate americans about the central role the family plays in the nation's well-being. Frc would serve as a strong rejoinder to those working to undermine the family and the judeo-christian values upon which our nation was founded and would demonstrate the veracity and efficacy of those values in contemporary society. Although frc has worked successfully to temper the previous policy of unrestricted access to abortion on demand, the tragedy of abortion-on-demand is with us. Liberal policy makers and judicial activists continue to assail the institution of marriage, and liberal special interest groups outnumber and outspend frc. With the expansion of same-sex "marriage" as well as obamacare becoming law, there has been a reduction of americans' religious freedom and conscience rights. Frc has become a leader in exposing this severe problem, and we will continue to do everything we can to defend americans' fundamental religious freedom. With faith that right makes might, as abraham lincoln once said, frc continues to advance a pro-faith, pro-family, and pro-freedom agenda with great effect. Frc's policy analysts develop research papers, legal briefs, and regular email publications on a wide variety of family issues. These include booklets, the bi-weekly social conservative review, opinion editorials, pamphlets, issue brief papers, lecture summaries, from the podium papers, and issue analysis papers. Some of the publications that we produced in 2014 include: "a clear and present danger: the threat to religious liberty in the military" (a list of events that reveal the threat to religious liberty in america's armed forces); "hostility to religion: the growing threat to religious liberty in the united states (documented accounts of hostility toward faith); several resources on common core including our brochure, "is common core good for america's students? "; lt. General jerry boykin's book, never surrender; "abortion funding and obamacare"; "christian faith and marijuana use"; "what science reveals about fetal pain," "population, abortion and food"; "sexual risk avoidance education"; "pornography and its consequences"; and "marriage, polygamy, and religious liberty. "frc's center for life and bioethics released three inspiring patient testimonial videos as part of our adult stem cells saved my life educational campaign, garnering over 1 million views. Check out stemcellresearchfacts. Org. A poll commissioned by frc and american values found that amongst republicans and republican-leaning independents, 82% believe marriage "should be defined only as a union between one man and one woman. "the supreme court's may ruling in town of greece v. Galloway was a pivotal victory for the free expression of faith in public places. Frc submitted an amicus brief on behalf of 49 members of congress and shaped the debate through a strong media presence. Frc's policy experts filed 7 amicus briefs this year. One of those supported the religious freedom of hobby lobby owners, the green family, and conestoga woods' hahn family, in their supreme court cases opposing u. S. Department of health and human services (hhs) secretary kathleen sebelius. The cases involved the hhs mandate that requires businesses run by religious owners to pay for abortion-causing drugs, sterilizations and contraception for their employees, regardless of the owners' religious beliefs. Thankfully, in june the u. S. Supreme court upheld religious liberty and protected the conscience rights of family businesses who object to being forced to pay for the coverage of sterilizations, contraception and drugs that have the potential to destroy an unborn child. Five of the other amicus briefs were submitted to appellate level courts arguing that the u. S. Constitution does not require any state to offer same-sex "marriage" or to recognize such unions from other jurisdictions. Frc led the way in sparking a national debate regarding the overall threat of common core standards and more specifically, the federal government's funding of it. The coordinated efforts of our departments led to thought-provoking policy papers and op-eds, a dynamic panel discussion featuring national experts, a family policy lecture, and multiple media appearances. These efforts have generated much public interest and established frc as a growing expert in the field of education. Frc's restore military religious freedom coalition brings together a broad base of expertise and resources. Our policy experts produced an influential report, "a clear and present danger: the threat to religious liberty in the military," and scores of op-eds. Our seasoned military experts, including marine veteran tony perkins and lt. Gen. (ret. ) jerry boykin, have urged military officials to address the threat through personal meetings and phone calls, letters and media interviews. Frc's efforts are paying off. Public awareness of this issue has exploded. Protecting military religious freedom has become a serious topic in hearings, briefings and legislative efforts on capitol hill. The pentagon and military leaders are falling back in line with first amendment rights, but we must and will remain on alert. And thankfully, our brave men and women in uniform have been empowered to take a stand for their rights and report abuses to their freedoms. Frc is one of the leading organizations employing many of the most influential marriage experts to defend the god-ordained institution of marriage. Senior fellow for policy studies, peter sprigg, made numerous tv appearances and authored a large number of compelling issue briefs and op-eds. Frc is a leading member in coalitions dealing with the common core public school curricula, pornography and homosexuality. Frc's marriage and religion research institute (marri) produces pioneering social science research that demonstrates the importance of traditional marriage and intact families for a strong society. The mapping america project makes this case in compelling fashion using federal surveys and providing detailed reports for policy makers, pastors and concerned citizens. Marri publishes the index of family belonging and rejection and various studies and policy papers such as "family intactness: influence on major state social policy outcomes, "marriage & labor slump," and the "effects of divorce. " marri was nominated to the bradley foundation impact fund, an elite group of programs for conservative donors to support. Frc's policy experts are frequently invited to provide a pro-life, pro-faith perspective in the media. They have also testified before legislative committees at the state and federal level, held meetings at the vatican, participated in the world congress of families, and represented frc around the world.   government affairs--the government affairs (ga) team plays both defense and offense on our issues in a bold and bipartisan manner. We're expanding frc's influence as the leading pro-family voice in washington, d. C. Our experts educate leaders in congress, the administration, governors, state legislators and our grassroots network, utilizing face-to-face meetings, expert testimony, presentations, briefings and email alerts. Ga defends the sanctity of human life and the institution of marriage, upholds religious liberty, opposes judicial activism, presses for tax relief for families, combats pornography in print and on the internet, supports parental choice in education, and speaks for the family throughout the world. In may, frc took up the cause of mariam ibraheem, a christian mother suffering in an over-crowded, disease-ridden prison in sudan with her newborn daughter and toddler son. Mariam was sentenced to 100 lashes and death by hanging for her "deserting islam and committing adultery" by marrying a christian man. Mariam's husband, daniel wani, is a naturalized u. S. Citizen, yet his numerous appeals to the u. S. Embassy for help were met with indifference. Frc quickly helped sound the alarm and was a primary force pushing for action in the media, on capitol hill and in the white house administration. It was a daily battle, and by god's grace, the relentless efforts of frc and our allies turned the tide in mariam's case. In may, frc's ga team launched a white house petition urging the obama administration to act on mariam's behalf. It garnered over 53,000 signatures. We also supported a house resolution calling for mariam's release. In june, tony perkins spoke at the "save mariam" white house rally with sen. Ted cruz (t-texas), rep. Trent franks (r-ariz. ) and other religious liberty allies. State department secretary john kerry finally issued a statement defending mariam. Throughout june, frc featured mariam's persecution daily in our washington update. Tony perkins met with the sudanese ambassador multiple times to plead mariam's cause. On june 23, mariam and her children were freed from prison! Yet, on june 24 they were detained at the airport while trying to flee sudan, for questions related to their travel documents. Frc launched a petition to secretary kerry calling for mariam's protection and safe haven in the u. S. On june 26, sudanese police released mariam and her children into u. S. State department custody. In july, tony worked with members of congress, the sudanese ambassador and sudanese officials throughout the month, pushing for mariam's safe passage to the u. S. We continued to highlight mariam's plight in our washington update and alerts. On july 22, tony testified before a house committee on foreign affairs subcommittee on religious freedom and mariam's case. On july 23, mariam was released and flown to italy with her family to meet the pope. And on july 31, mariam arrived safely in the u. S. At last! On september 27 frc honored mariam with our inaugural cost of discipleship award at the values voter summit gala, held in her honor. And in october, frc launched a fundraising effort to help buy a handicapped-accessible van for mariam's wheelchair-bound husband. In the end, frc was widely credited as being a leading force in winning mariam's freedom. We gathered over 53,000 signatures on our white house petition and nearly 22,000 signatures on our state department petition. Mariam opened her remarks at the values voter summit gala with the words, "god is good. All the time. " we could not agree more, and are honored to have played a role in this victory for religious liberty. But the real credit goes first to the lord.   communications--the mission of frc is timeless, but the way in which we communicate that mission must be constantly adapted to incorporate new technologies and reach new audiences. The communications department is responsible for the public image of frc; they interact on a daily basis with the press corps and ensure that frc's positions are clearly communicated and accurately represented. Despite attacks and outrageous labels from the left to silence our voice, frc continues to grow in influence and expand our visibility promoting the pro-family agenda to opinion leaders and the public through effective media strategies. One of frc's major media accomplishments in 2014 was exposing the religious liberty threat to hobby lobby's owners, the green family, and conestoga woods' hahn family. Conservatives in congress defending the green and hahn families relied on frc's communications expertise and media credibility to help navigate their public relations crisis. Working with our allies, frc successfully shaped the media narrative surrounding the hobby lobby case. Our message testing helped members of congress and other conservative groups formulate their press releases and statements. Frc's experts made a big splash in the media following the ruling: cathy ruse, frc's senior fellow for legal studies, spoke at a news conference outside the supreme court immediately after the court's decision. Her remarks were broadcast live by fox news, c-span and msnbc. Fox's "america's newsroom" invited cathy to discuss the ruling in depth. She also wrote a number one op-ed on the daily caller site and wrote an "opposing view" op-ed for usa today. Travis weber, director of frc's center for religious liberty, was invited to respond to the ruling on the esteemed scotus blog and published an insightful article on thefederalist. Com. Ken blackwell, frc's senior fellow for family empowerment, was interviewed by msnbc on the ruling. Multiple members of congress used frc's messaging in their press releases and speeches defending the green and hahn families' supreme court success. Along with our many allies, frc worked tirelessly for this victory, and we thank god for granting us success. In 2014, the frc communications team tracked nearly 15,000 media mentions of frc and our affiliates; frc staff made nearly 90 live tv and cable network appearances, plus 557,010 online video views; had over 300 radio hits on prominent stations across america; placed 234 op-eds in publications nationwide; and hosted over 400 members of the media covering the values voter summit. Frc's "washington watch with tony perkins," a daily one-hour radio program, reached 620 stations nationwide. The show allows us to cut through the media's filter and speak directly to concerned americans about how a biblical worldview shapes public policy. Tony has hosted dozens of members of congress as well as prominent conservative leaders, authors, and pastors, including rep. Steve scalise (r-la), governor bobby jindal (r-la), rep. Jim jordan (r-oh), reporter sharyl attiksson, rnc chairman reince priebus, jason and david benham, and mark levin. There were two values voter summits in fiscal year 2014. At the 2013 vvs, over 170 media members attended the event, including every major news outlet in the nation. It earned over 500 major tv mentions (up 130% from 2009) and over 70,000 mentions on social media (up 53% from 2012). Vvs was one of the leading topics in the nation on twitter. At the 2014 vvs, over 2,100 people attended and over 22,000 people tuned in online. It received over 71,000 mentions on social media. Its hashtag trended on twitter during the event. Vvs featured a dynamic line up of over 90 speakers and attracted over 400 reporters. Speakers included sen. Ted cruz (r-texas), gov. Mike huckabee, gov. Bobby jindal, sen. Rand paul (r-ky. ), and gov. Sarah palin, among others. The increasing prominence of the values voter summit affords frc a tremendous platform for educating americans about the values that have made our nation great for over 230 years. We continue to effectively reach, equip and engage the public via social media. We have seen an exciting increase over recent months with our social media campaign growing a network of well over 135,000 facebook friends for frc and 29,000 twitter followers. We are voicing truth and eternal values into the marketplace of ideas.   other programs: with vigorous representation before congress, the executive branch, and, when appropriate, the federal judiciary, frc pursues an active program of public education and awareness. In tangible ways, we are arming policy makers and the american citizenry with the power which knowledge gives. Frc holds numerous lectures and hosts conferences, garnering media attention from around the world. These events are subsequently edited and made available to our constituents on our website. Frc's church ministries team equips and mobilizes over 55,000 pastors, plus their millions of congregants; over 4,500 church-based culture impact teams, and over 56,000 prayer partners. In 2014, we expanded our "p3" pastors group to over 7,300. Each of these pastors commits to pray for the nation, preach christian citizenship messages, and partner with at least three other pastors. In may, frc hosted our 11th annual national "watchmen on the wall" conference in washington, d. C. Nearly 700 attendees from 41 states, puerto rico and nigeria gathered in washington, d. C. Where frc equipped and encouraged them to boldly stand for truth and morality in their churches. We had an inaugural national hispanic pastors briefing this year in phoenix, az which attracted over 150 attendees from a number of states. We translated the event and key resources into spanish, and 66 pastors joined our watchmen pastors network. Frc organized and led its 5th annual national call2fall on june 30, leading an estimated over 1. 74 million christians in prayer for our nation's spiritual revival and healing, based on god's call to repentance in 2 chronicles 7:14. Prayer and repentance on behalf of our nation remains a vital part of frc's mission. Over the last 30 years, many pro-family organizations have come and gone, but the challenges and pressures facing christians and other people of good will in the public square have remained great. With the faithful prayers and support of families dedicated to our mission, frc has weathered the storms of hostile administrations, softening economies, and unrelenting opposition from special interest groups. Far from maintaining a defensive position, frc has won numerous policy victories: the increase of the per-child tax credit, passage of the defense of marriage act, creation of health savings accounts, welfare reform, increased abstinence education funding, the passage of the partial birth abortion ban act, and the confirmation of judicial conservatives to the supreme court (to name a few). With a bold vision for growing the influence of family research council, we move ahead with great anticipation. Trusting in the providence of almighty god to guide and establish the work of our hands, frc exists to advance faith family and freedom in public policy and public opinion. May we be found ever faithful to our task.

By purchasing travel agency services and travel tickets for veterans' loved ones, Luke's Wings provides an immediate and invaluable service to the families of our men and women at arms. While individual donations may be made directly through our website www.lukeswings.org, Luke's Wings also encourages corporations to share in our thanks to veterans directly through corporate sponsorship and corporate donations.  The organization sponsors and organizes fundraising events in and around the Washington, D.C. area for this purpose, while also raising money for veterans' families by selling t-shirts, stickers, and wrist bands with the company logo.  Recognizing the difficulties families encounter as they make their way to their loved ones' side, Luke's Wings is prepared to partner with corporations to ease the burden on families and veterans during their visit.  Luke's Wings will purchase plane tickets for a family to travel to the Army Medical Hospital, then Luke's Wings may partner with a hotel and a theme park for free or discounted accommodations, meals, and entertainment.

This service helps ensure that every Veteran is always surrounded by loving family and friends during their final days and hours (and is never alone when they pass away). This allows them to say their goodbyes and allows them to reconcile their differences. It is a service we hold very dear to our hearts, as we know we are providing a final salute to the greatest generation that ever lived (our WWII Veterans) and those who should have been treated better all along (our Vietnam Veterans). In order to deliver this program, Lukes Wings has partnered with the Assisted Living Federation of America (ALFA) and their 300 partners to deliver this offer to over 300,000 veterans currently residing in senior living communities across the country.

In the organization?s early years our particular emphasis was on the desperate needs of animals used for experimentation. In the decades that followed we expanded the scope of our work to address many other areas of animal suffering.Today one of our greatest areas of emphasis is cruel animal factories, which raise and slaughter pigs, cows, chickens and other animals. The biggest are in our country, and they are expanding worldwide.Specific goals are:--Abolishing factory farms and achieving humane slaughter for all animals raised for meat. --Improving the housing and handling of animals used for experimentation and pushing for the development of animal research alternatives. --Ending the use of steel-jaw leghold traps and reforming other cruel methods of controlling wildlife populations. --Preserving species threatened with extinction and protecting wildlife in international trade. --Enforcing strict regulation of transport conditions for all animals. --Encouraging animal-friendly science teaching and preventing painful experiments on animals by students.			One of the main goals of AWI is the support of the "3 Rs,"  the replacement of experimental animals by alternatives, the refinement of testing to reduce pain and suffering when animals are still used, and the reduction of numbers of animals used in testing.   AWI's other goals include efforts to end use of steel jaw leghold traps, to protect endangered and threatened species, and to reform methods used to rear farm animals.  One of AWIs recent accomplishments was successfully fighting to maintain a moratorium on the commercial killing of whales.

Multicultural Career Intern Program	http://	(202) 939-7700	EIN 52-1263933	3145 Hiatt Pl Nw	Washington	DC	20010	USA		The mission of mcip and its public school affiliate, chec, is to strive to become a model professional learning community that respects and responds to the diverse needs of our under-served students by preparing them for the academic rigors of college and as leaders in the quest for social justice. A professional learning community is a collaborative academic environment in which the administrative staff and teachers in a school continuously seek and share learning and then act on what they learn. The goal is to enhance their effectiveness as professionals to benefit student education. The results of this research-based approach is that students experience decreased dropout rate and fewer classes "skipped", lower rates of absenteeism, increased learning that is distributed more equitably in a smaller sized school, greater academic gains than in traditional schools, and smaller achievement gaps between students from different backgrounds.			Teen parent and child development center - a national association forthe education of young children (naeyc) accredited program that is runby a team of certified early childhood educators and maintains a goldstar rating, the districts highest early childhood credential. Thecenter's staff meets the needs of infants, toddlers, and their teenparents by providing cognitive age-appropriate activities, casemanagement, and parenting classes for teen parents.

The daily rigor of the instructional program is interspersed with activities that promote health and wellness, communication skills and leadership development. Athletics, drama and dance are core components of the program. Additionally, as part of mcips mission to develop cultural ambassadors and leaders in the quest for social justice, select students are awarded the opportunity to travel abroad. The goal of this initiative is to immerse chec students in another culture and to expand their knowledge of the world around them. These travel opportunities are often themed-based with a focus on either the environment or a social justice issue. In addition, these students agree to host cultural ambassadors from the other country, in school and in their home. Hosting periods range from two weeks to two months. International visitors not only get to experience an american high school with its great multicultural makeup, but also get to live in an american household. The goal of this interaction is for students from both countries to know about each other and expand their cultural knowledge.   building trades - the bt program introduces students to basic carpentry, drafting, masonry, and the use of computer aided design (autocad) software applications. The development of visualization skills, sketching, and the use of software programs used in computer aided drafting are a main focus. High quality individual work, teamwork, cooperative learning strategies, and problem solving approaches are an integral part of the course material. In addition, an intensive week long follow-up course further develops skills introduced in the autocad/design and engineering class.   community organization program - chec was designed with the community in mind, by providing easy access to the community up to eighteen hours per day, seven days per week, for education, community meetings, entertainment, and sports events, without disrupting or interfering with school activities, providing a perfect blend of school and community. Community organizations provide contributions in support of various activities that benefit students and adults holistic, social, and physical development needs. The contributions towards this program are used in support of facility maintenance, security, av technical, and management oversight support. Events occurring after hours in the evenings and weekends benefit students and adults who participate in extracurricular activities such as dance, soccer, meetings, and special occasion activities. Delinquency prevention - this initiative encompasses two important programs: gang and substance abuse prevention and intervention and the parental involvement center.

The center regularly hosts workshops that inform parents about reform initiatives at bell bemulticultural high school and about emerging adolescent development issues. The staff also provides onsite counseling and home visits to students who exhibit disciplinary problems at school. Early college program an innovative and bold approach to leveling the economic playing field for college-ready and college-bound students of limited resources. It is based on the principle that academic rigor, combined with the opportunity to save time and money, is a powerful motivator for students to work hard and meet serious intellectual challenges. The program blends high school and college in a rigorous yet supportive program by compressing the time it takes to complete a high school diploma and the first two years of college. Approximately 80 high school students a year now take university courses on the campus of the community college of the district of columbia.

JUBILEE HOUSING INC	http://www.jubileehousing.org	202 299 1240	EIN 52-0986261	1640 Columbia Rd. N.W.	Washington	DC	20009	USA	Children & Youth, Homeless & Housing, Homeowners & Tenants Associations, Housing & Shelter, Human Services, Youth Development	Since 1973, Jubilee Housing has fulfilled its mission in the Adams Morgan area of Washington, DC of providing safe, affordable rental housing for people with low to very low-incomes. Jubilee Housing is more than bricks and mortar it is a context for people who are living in profound poverty to have the opportunity to rebuild their lives. It is a place where the basic human need for a home is met for those whose income levels have excluded them from most other housing options except living in a shelter,  which is certainly not home in any life-giving way. The housing offered by Jubilee enables more than 850 individuals and families to maintain a home in a supportive and caring environment. In addition to providing stable, long-term housing, Jubilee Housing also offers services that encourage its residents self development, self sufficiency and active participation in all areas of residential, community and civic life. Staff counselors work daily with residents by offering long-term support, crisis intervention, community building and referrals to Jubilees sister service agencies.		Washington, DC-MD-VA-WV	The primary focus of Jubilee Housing is to maintain affordable rents for low to very-low income individuals and families living in the Adams Morgan area of the District of Columbia. In contrast to most new affordable housing projects, which target low- to middle-income households between 40-60 percent of Area Median Income, Jubilee Housing holds rent at levels that are affordable for people earning 25 percent of Area Median Income. The majority of its budget is used to maintain rent affordability by offsetting the difference between rental revenue and the total cost of operations. Were rents to be set at a level that would sustain the total cost of operations, it would mean increases of more than 75 percent per household, an action that would be tantamount to displacing the vast majority of households into the suburbs, or worse yet onto the streets.   Resident Programs & Services are also a hallmark of the Jubilee Housing mission. Services include pro-active rent counseling, drop-in case management, a variety of resident empowerment and community organizing initiatives and preferential referral access to a broad network of social services (described in more detail in the Partnership section of the proposal).   In addition to supportive long-term housing, a new transitional living program called the Jubilee Initiative, now offers residents a highly structured path to financial self-sufficiency in three years. Growing out of increased resident interest in home ownership, it employs a financial literacy curriculum to help residents establish a working budget, eliminate debt, and accumulate savings to prepare the way for market level housing options, including home ownership. Currently twenty-one families are participating in this innovative program.  Resident organizing initiatives form in response to concerns that residents raise about various issues facing community life at Jubilee Housing. For instance, in response to public safety issues that have risen at and around the Ritz building, residents requested a meeting with staff to address their concerns. The meeting evolved into regular monthly sessions with the residents of the building to discuss ways to promote a healthier living environment. The process has led to the emergence of a Safety Coalition among neighborhood agencies including the police department, the Mayor's Office of Neighborhood Services and others. With the help of the Enterprise Foundation, meetings are facilitated so that resident leaders are identified and encouraged to take ownership in the process of improving conditions of the housing community.
