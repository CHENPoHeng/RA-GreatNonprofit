Our leader's club serves teens through high school where they receive leadership training and learn the importance of social responsibility and service to others. Our ymca is primarily supported by membership dues and program fees; school age child care, camp, swim lessons, youth enrichment programs. When people show demonstrated need, we afford them financial assistance gained from contributions from others so all can partake in the healthy lifestyles promoted at the y.

The Food Bank of Monmouth and Ocean Counties	http://www.foodbankmoc.org	(732) 918-2600	EIN 22-2622522	3300 Route 66	Neptune	NJ	07753	USA	Disaster Aid, Disaster Preparedness & Relief Services, Food, Food Banks & Pantries, Job Training	Our mission is to provide food for as many people in need as possible. To fulfill our mission, the FoodBank solicits, collects, stores and distributes over 5 million of pounds of donated and surplus, perishable and nonperishable food annually to more than 260 area food pantries, soup kitchens, shelters and other feeding programs. These agencies provide the food directly to children, elderly, working poor adults and families in crisis in their neighborhoods.This food helps low income families remain as self-sufficient as possible by allowling them to use their limited resources to pay for other basic needs, such as housing, medical bills, child care costs or transportation to and from work, while still being able to put food on the family table.  In addition, the FoodBank addresses the root causes of hunger by providing Culinary Job Skills Training for people in need of better paid jobs through its onsite kitchen, which also prepares hot meals for at risk children at a local after school program (a Kids Cafe). The Backpack Program provides food for the weekend to chronically hungry children at local schools. Our Mobile Pantry program, in partnership with the Salvation Army, provides emergency food to people living in areas that are not served by pantries.  The Food Stamp (now called SNAP) Outreach program provides eligibility information and application assistance to families eligible for this important national food assistance program.  The FoodBank welcomes community partners and volunteers from businesses, schools, civic organizations as well as individuals to help in all aspects of FoodBank operations.			Emergency food distribution- the core program of the foodbank is the collection of donated and surplus food in its warehouse and the distribution of that food to charitable agencies serving families in need in monmouth and ocean counties. The foodbank served 169 charitable agencies, which in turn operated a total of 295 different programs, consisting of food pantries, soup kitchens, shelters for homeless or abused persons, after school programs for children, and day and residential programs for low income children, the elderly and disabled. While some agencies pick up the food themselves, about 70% of all the food distributed is delivered directly to the agencies on foodbank trucks. Sources of donated food include local food drives and donations, national donations through feeding america, and government food such as the emergency food assistance program (tefap). The foodbank supplements donated food and products with specific food and grocery items purchased through a small bulk co-op program, as well as purchases made with funding from the state food purchase program. Mobile pantry program uses a specially outfitted beverage truck to distribute food directly to people at 16 sites each month, including housing authorities, trailer parks, union buildings, churches and other community sites where existing pantries are difficult to reach. The foodbank operates the senior food package program, also known as the commodity supplemental food program (csfp), which provides monthly packages of food, provided by the department of agriculture, to seniors living in low income housing sites. The backpack program provides backpacks of food, each with 4 weekend meals, distributed on friday afternoons to over 675 children identified by schools to be at high risk of hunger. The program operates at 25 schools throughout the school year. The foodbank participates in the summer food service program, sponsoring the provision of breakfasts and/or lunches to over 500 low income children attending summer programs at 14 community sites.   multiple benefits access program- the goal of the multiple benefits access program is to assist households to access benefits and resources that will help them build income and food security, and is provided at over 20 community partner sites each month. This program includes supplemental nutrition assistance program (snap) outreach, which assesses client eligibility and assists with application submission for food stamps. The volunteer income tax assistance (vita) outreach component provides free tax preparation for low to moderate income households during tax season, ensuring eligible households claim critical eitc and other tax credits. The navigator program provides public education about affordable health care at community events and one-on-one assistance in applying for health insurance under the affordable care act and medicaid/nj family care. The program also provides other forms of assistance including utilities application assistance, welfare and pantry assistance.   culinary kitchen program - the culinary kitchen program provides hands-on training in an onsite kitchen for underprivileged adults in need of permanent employment. The program helps men and women become self-sufficient by providing the skills they need to obtain better-paid jobs. The culinary kitchen program provides hot meals daily for 120 low income children at the monmouth county boys & girls club in asbury park and red bank. The community garden program is a community service run food garden, which harvests fresh produce for pick-up by local pantries serving families in need. Children's programs enable youth groups to visit the foodbank to learn about hunger, its causes, and solutions, or display their works in an art gallery depicting important social themes such as hunger and volunteerism. Volunteer program provides community service opportunities for businesses, civic groups, schools and individuals. Hunger awareness- the foodbank also promotes hunger awareness campaigns with the local media to educate the public regarding the problem of hunger.

Box 6068	Hoboken	NJ	07030	USA	Family Services, Homeless & Housing, Housing & Shelter, Job Training, Single Parent Agencies	Good counsel is a family for those in need, serving god who is the father of the orphan, defender of the widow, and who gives the lonely a home to live in (psalm 68). [see continuation on schedule o][continued from part iii] - our lord's call to serve the disadvantaged compels us to offer love, shelter and the opportunity to grow in self-respect and independence. We invoke the patronage of Mary, Our Lady of Good Counsel, to help us protect mothers in need and to love their children from the moment of conception.			Housing: offering your home to someone in need is a great act of charity. In fact, for christians, offering shelter is an expected corporal work of mercy. Especially if you are offering a bedroom to a pregnant mother who has no other place to call home. That is exactly what you do when you give a gift to good counsel because that gift becomes a sanctuary for that pregnant mother who has no one else. Like one mother who was told to get out of her house by her mother when she explained she was going to give birth and the father of her child already told her, "i don't want you to have that fetus. " [see continuation on schedule o][continued from part iii] - for those who gave during 2014, you allowed 230 mothers and babies have 43,368 nights of shelter in one of good counsel's 4 homes. Our occupancy rate for the year was 106%. Again we were more than 100% because every time there is a mother in a dangerous situation, literally on the street, or more likely in a domestic violence situation, whether a bedroom is available or not, good counsel staff will take in that mom and transform the living room, an office, or even a chapel into a temporary bedroom. Also, your support during 2014 allowed us to finalize renovations and hire staff to re-open good counsel's 5th home during 2015. If you have ever given to good counsel since our first mom and baby entered on sunday, march 10, 1985, you have helped serve, just in our homes, 6,230 women and children, providing more than 600,000 nights of shelter. More than 900 babies have been born to mothers at a good counsel home. There's more to good counsel than this, but this is the underpinning of our mission helping mothers and babies. Our homes are found in new york city, rockland and westchester counties in new york state and burlington county, nj. Mothers in need come from all over, literally throughout the united states, and some who were born overseas. How does one find herself in a good counsel home? Through hospital social workers or nurses; through people who hear a good counsel speaker at a banquet or an event or on t. V. Or the radio; through an online search; a doctor's offices; pregnancy centers or simply by calling good counsel's 24/7 helpline 1. 800. 723. 8331 or going to www. Goodcounselhomes. Org and sending an email. Inside a good counsel home all the corporal works of mercy are performed. Feeding the hungry: "i haven't eaten in two days," christy told sabrina, our intake worker, over the phone. "i'm starving and i have been looking for food that others are throwing away," the four-month pregnant woman quietly stated in an embarrassed tone. That night christy was having dinner, like a family member, at a good counsel table. During 2014 we served more than 25,000 meals to good counsel mothers and children. We do get some of our food donated and we share community meals at night but it is due to the generosity of you who support good counsel that everyone under our roof is feed. Giving drink to the thirsty: "angie loves her milk! " exclaims julianne her mom. "i think she goes through a gallon a day all by herself! "many of our babies drink formula but on average each good counsel home will consume 10 gallons of milk per week. That makes close to 2,100 gallons of milk per year! Clothing the naked: alicia was late arriving to good counsel in the bronx. Delores, then our house manager, stayed late to welcome her. Delores brought alicia into her new bedroom and told her to clean up before she would heat up some dinner for her. As alicia was in the bathroom showering delores noticed her shoes. They were very worn out and actually had holes in the soles. Delores thought it would be great for alicia to have some new shoes and so she searched all through the house in search of shoes that would fit but came up empty. Suddenly delores realized there was one pair of new shoes that would fit the new woman; the ones she wore. Gladly she gave them to our new resident. Visiting the sick: good counsel has a special home called daystar which is located on the grounds of st. Vincent's hospital in harrison, new york. The easy access to the medical facilities allows us to give special care to those who may be mentally ill or suffer from a substance abuse issue or both. Our special outreach to psychologically troubled pregnant women is one of the few in the entire country. Visiting the imprisoned: some women with a prison history or having outstanding legal issues come to good counsel. Sometimes there are outstanding warrants. Maybe minor offenses, but out of fear or not understanding, such offenses can be cause for imprisonment. Good counsel has advocated for mother's rights, particularly when she is close to giving birth or when it was clear she would benefit from prenatal care outside of a prison health care system. Of course, the good counsel continues to rectify whatever legal matters a mother may have. Thanks to pro-bono attorneys, particularly at the legal center for life of new jersey, many cases have been judiciously and appropriately adjudicated. Burying the dead: one of our most tragic events is when a good counsel mother miscarries or has a stillborn death. A respect for the dignity of each human person requires that we treat each life as sacred. Over many years good counsel has been blessed by many funeral directors who have offered complimentary services and churches that have opened their doors for masses and plots for burial. Grief shared is half grief, says an honduran proverb. "too many hospitals do not consider or offer a burial for a lost child," christopher bell stated following a recent funeral mass offered at st. Joseph's church in spring valley, new york for a baby named angel. "in the midst of the pain and loss we are prepared to be with a grieving mother and help her know that her child is being spiritually cared for as they make their way to the lord. " you may see and read more about good counsel's moms and babies at www. Goodcounselhomes. Org or by liking good counsel homes on facebook or finding our good counsel homes youtube channel www. Youtube. Com/user/goodcounselhomes  counseling:a typical definition of counseling: "advice and support given to help others with problems or to make important decisions. " a secondary definition is "professional guidance using psychological methods collecting personal history, comparing to others, and using various techniques including written tests. " both forms of counseling are commonly employed at good counsel. Every mom walking into a good counsel door becomes part of the family at her home. She begins a unique relationship with one case manager. [see continuation on schedule o][continued from part iii] - she will also have a mentor who is like her sister and can be any member of the staff. The mom may choose who is with her during her time of delivery. Every step of the way trained good counsel staff help each mom seek to uncover the struggles and strains which brought her to our doors. Good counsel mothers often report prior abuse, nearly 80%, either sexual, physical, or seriously emotional. Also, during 2014, some 20% reported having had at least one abortion. We know from other studies that this figure is largely understated. During the first month at good counsel each mom is guided to use online assessment tools to discover more about herself, her educational strengths and weaknesses and her vocational proclivities. Her case manager, along with her mentor and other staff will help her understand the assessments as well as constructively listen to the hopes and desires she has for the future. The case manager will officially meet each mother at least one hour each week. Other informal meetings happen as needed and usually more than once a week. Just the formal meetings totaled more than 10,837 during 2014. Additionally, more than half, about 56% of mothers received outside professional counseling. Given good counsel's open intake and ability to take in and assist for a year or longer mothers with great emotional, and often psychological challenges, seeing that of the 105 mothers who stayed 30 days or longer, their average length of stay overall was 12. 6 months. More than a third, 35%, made educational advances, and almost half, 48%, entered the work force. Also, it's most important to remember that every day a mother is in a good counsel home, she and her baby, before and after birth, is safe, eating well and encouraged to do the best she is capable. It's impossible to know and measure how much abuse and neglect is avoided or eliminated because someone is surrounded by a caring family, which good counsel strives to be for those in need.   life skills programs: a total of 702 life skills programs were received by good counsel mothers during 2014. Life skills help deepen a mother's knowledge and awareness of living a healthy, productive life. Life skills are presented formally in classes and individually as needed. Such areas as proper nutrition, child growth and development, health, and social skills are taught using specific outlines prepared for good counsel mothers. Personal finance is taught individually helping each mother develop her own budget. Spirituality is shared both formally in group meetings and individually as each mother desires and explores her relationship with god. [see continuation on schedule o][continued from part iii] - we share a loving, merciful, forgiving god who has brought us together to live for each other. Paid staff or professional volunteers, with expertise in each area, present life skills classes. Plus, mothers are able to take individual online classes in some of these topics. A minimum of three and sometimes four group classes are taught in each home each week.   in addition to programs already mentioned, there are other significant programs at good counsel, some of which have grown out of the needs many mothers and their children have expressed in our homes. Good counsel's intake staff operate a 24-hour-a-day, 7-day-a-week, helpline 1. 800. 723. 8331. Since beginning this national, toll-free helpline more than 33,200 people have received concrete help, phone counseling and support. During 2013 more than 3,400 calls were received. During 2014, some 3,522 calls came in, plus an additional 465 requests were emailed. Good counsel's website, www. Goodcounselhomes. Org is coming up high on google's rankings for "homeless and pregnant" meaning women in need from all over the country are asking for help. Good counsel is responding with added staff. Future plans will include additional online tools to automate help for mothers looking online in their geographic area, as well as an option to chat with a live person. Good counsel also operates a post-abortion counseling and referral network called lumina to help women as well as men and siblings suffering from past abortions. Confidential counseling is available through lumina's national, toll-free helpline 1. 877. 586. 4621 (1. 877. Lumina-1) or for information, please visit www. Postabortionhelp. Org good counsel stays in touch with mothers who leave through our exodus program, where former residents receive on-going counseling to ease the difficulties transitioning to independent living. Additionally, some single-parent families, not needing a good counsel home, still may receive good counsel staff assistance via outreach through our exodus program in a critical situation. Some 211 exodus and outreach families were assisted during 2014. During 2001, good counsel was one of the founders of the pregnancy services network of greater new york, a coalition of maternity homes and pregnancy centers in the ny, nj and connecticut area. The group meets regularly throughout the year. During 2013, good counsel also helped to form the national maternity housing coalition, a group of three dozen maternity homes throughout the u. S. Good counsel is represented on the leadership team of the nmhc and participates in regular conference calls, an annual meeting and conference all of which continue to bear much fruit in the way of sharing best practices and assisting new and existing homes.

Our goal is to give patients and caregivers a break from cancer so that they may continue to live full and rich lives during treatment, which better prepares them for life after treatment.	In 2011 we established "Elixir Movies and Music" programs at the University of North Carolina Medical Center's Radiation Oncology Department, at Robert Wood Johnson Medical Center in New Brunswick Oncology Department, and at Jersey Shore Medical Center.   We helped to establish a weekly "High Tea" at RWJ New Brunswick. Thanks to donations from Zojirushi and Tetley Tea, patients are being offered tea and cookies in their hospital rooms each week.  In February we launched our "Bridges to Wellness" program which provides an interactive introduction to complementary therapies such as yoga, massage, and mediation. Such therapies have shown to help manage the side effects of treatment and reduce stress so that patients and caregivers are better able to handle the impacts of cancer treatment.  We are currently raising money so that we may create the "Elixir Wish List," a place where patients and caregivers can list, for friends and family, items that would be helpful to them during treatment such as grocery delivery, lawn care, child care, a massage, a manicure, etc.	Cancer patients and caregivers nationwide	Movie and Music Program - provides DVD players as well as DVDs and CDs to hospitals and treatment centers.

An average of 1.2 million pounds of fresh produce is collected annually and distributed to 70 community organizations, feeding 7000 people weekly through New Jersey Farmers Against Hunger.

FAH also provides nutrition education to help recipients learn how to prepare healthy, budget-friendly meals using the fresh fruits and vegetables we provide.  Over 30 elementary schools are currently registered to receive garden beds, training, school pep rallies, and teacher training. Approximately 15,000 children are learning how food is grown and how to make healthy food choices while planting, harvesting and learning in their school gardens provided by Learning Through Gardening. Our initial donation of garden beds and supplies often grow into a community-wide effort involving school staff, parents and local businesses who see the value in teaching children at an early age to appreciate fruits and vegetables.   Nearly 200 farmers and agribusiness professionals have been trained through the NJ Agricultural Leadership Development Program which has been in operation for nearly 20 years. Class members commit to a two-year program and attend seminars and tours of farms, while networking with industry professionals.

CLF programs include Hope Binders, Hugs U Wear and Wish Baskets. Each program is designed to educate, entertain, raise self-esteem andbring a sense of joy into their challenging lives.			HOPE BINDERS - The goal of CLF's Hope Binder program is to improve a patient's level of health literacy. Pediatric oncology patients and their families are often overwhemed with the amount of medical and insurance information associated with a chronic illness such as cancer. The Hope Binder has 12 sections to reference and record, in their own words, medical information regarding the child's treatment. The binders also include an assortment of informational booklets regarding pain management and dietary tips, as well as, a 75 minute pre-paid telephone calling card to keep in close contact with friends and family. In 2009, CLF will have distributed over 12,500 Hope Binders to newly diagnosed patients within a network of over 160 hospitals throughout the U.S. A video, created by Cigna Foundation, illustrates the benefits of the Hope Binder for one particular patient and can be viewed on CLF's website www.clf4kids.org. HUGS U WEAR - CLF's Hugs U Wear program offers human hair wigs to young cancer patients who have lost their own hair due to chemotherapy treatments. The Hug U Wear is a 100% human hair wig that is sewn into a lightweight cap and comes with a detachable hat. The child can choose from several styles to help deal with the stress and embarrassment of hair loss. Hugs U Wear help promote a positive self-image to ease the transition back to "normal life." In 2009, CLF will have providedapproximately 3,000 Hugs U Wear to children in need. WISH BASKETS - Children diagnosed with cancer must endure long hours of boredom awaiting treatment, grueling chemotherapy sessions, and spinal taps. As a result, CLF provides Wish Baskets to help lift the spirits of these young cancer patients during a particularly difficult time in their lives. The baskets are filled with age appropriate items such as pajama bottoms witha matching pillow case, an MP3 player, individual games and a $50 Gift Card to purchase another wish item(s) of their choice. The Wish Basket program replaces CLF's Letters of Hope program and is designed to reach out to many more pediatric oncology patients. In all, CLF has helped to fulfill the wishes of over 9,000 children with cancer.

The Evergreens	http://www.evergreens.org	(856) 439-2030	EIN 21-0634485	309 Bridgeboro Rd	Moorestown	NJ	08057	USA	Human Services, Seniors, Supportive Housing for Older Adults	In the spirit of its episcopal tradition, it is the evergreens' mission to enhance the individual, social, emotional, spiritual and physical well-being of its diverse community.			Expenses incurred in providing a full continuum of services to elderly individuals including but not limited to residence, dietary, intellectual stimulation and activity, and health care. Organization's community benefit statement - in 1919, the evergreens was founded in bound brook, n. J. As a nonprofit retirement home through a generous gift to the episcopal diocese of new jersey by the henry lamonte family - a home on a five-acre site that accommodated 15 residents. When the evergreens moved to moorestown in 1949, the community expanded services to include long-term nursing care. The new facility consisted of 32 acres and a large home, now known as matthews hall, which remains at the center of the community's campus. This home was built in the 1920s for the johnson family, founders of the victor talking machine company, the predecessor of rca. The new facility provided rooms for 20 residents and an eight-bed infirmary. Through the years, buildings have been added, upgraded and expanded throughout campus to make the evergreens the community it is today. In 1990, the evergreens became an independent entity; however, it continued to maintain a chapel affiliated with the episcopal diocese of new jersey. In the same year, the community's tradition of delivering quality care progressed to yet another logical level of growth - offering active older adults an independent lifestyle through the construction of 200 independent living units (ilus) and officially becoming a continuing care retirement community (ccrc). The evergreens' campus continues to evolve and grow through the community's campus renewal project. Culminating years of strategic planning, this project calls for a multi-phase construction and renovation project - which began with the completion of the renovations to the community's kitchen/dining areas in 2010 and continued in 2012 with the grand opening of a new, state-of-the-art health care center. In 2014, the renovations commenced to update the community's ilu corridors - two floors have been finished, and the balance of work on the remaining hallways is due to be completed soon. Future plans, as outlined under the campus renewal project, include upgrades to the community's independent living common areas and recreational activities/services spaces. The evergreens strives to provide the highest quality service and care to residents, ensuring that residents can enjoy their individual lifestyles with dignity and respect in the most gracious of environments. With three lifestyle choices within one community - independent living, assisted living and skilled nursing care - residents at the evergreens are secure in the knowledge that they will receive quality health care, regardless of their changing needs. The evergreens works hard to provide the highest quality of care to its residents and has achieved this distinction consistently year after year. The community prides itself on being accredited by the commission on accreditation of rehabilitation facilities/ continuing care accreditation commission (carf-ccac), an honor held by a limited number of the nation's top ccrc's. In 2012, the evergreens was reaccredited for five years. Likewise, the community has been recognized numerous times by consumer reports in its nursing home monitor list. The community has also continued to maintain the highest possible rating - "five stars" - from the federal centers for medicare & medicaid services for the past six years, placing the community on the cms "honor roll" list. Among other awards and recognition, the evergreens has been named a best nursing home by u. S. News & world report and one of the best of burlington county by the burlington county times, both for multiple years. Additionally, the evergreens received a gold award from national mature media in 2014 for marketing direct mail design and was recognized as one of sj magazine's best of south jersey readers poll honorees in 2014.

Samaritan Healthcare & Hospice Inc	http://www.samaritanhealthcarenj.org	(856) 596-1600	EIN 22-2344036	5 Eves Dr Ste 300	Marlton	NJ	08053	USA	Counseling, Health, Health Care, Home Health Care, Mental Health	Samaritan is the preeminent provider of hospice and palliative (comfort) care, grief support, education, advocacy, and other life-enhancing services. We provide unparalleled services with respect, dignity and compassion for all people affected by serious, progressive illness or grief, contributing to the health and well-being of our patients, their families and our community. Guided by a deep sense of commitment and the ethic of human service, we provide care that is both life-giving and live-receiving through the incorporation of the philosophy, art and science of caring. Samaritan is an independent not-for-profit, non-sectarian organization serving people in atlantic, burlington, camden, gloucester and mercer counties who are coping with serious illness or grief.			Home/community care - people confronting a serious progressive illness are often plunged into unfamiliar, confusing and stressful situations. Spouses, adult children, and other caregivers are suddenly faced with medical decisions and financial and legal responsibilities for which they are often untrained and unprepared. These stresses can deprive them of the one thing they need most: time together. Samaritan home/community hospice care helps people find the time they need to focus on what's most important at this stage of life: the friends and family they want to be with, the feelings they want to share, and the words they need to say. The goal of samaritan's care is not to cure the disease, but to control its effects so that patients can spend their last days with dignity in the place where they live (home, assisted living or nursing home) and remain as comfortable, alert and pain-free as possible. Considered the compassionate model for people facing life-limiting illness or injury, the hospice philosophy offers a team-oriented approach to expert medical care, pain management, and emotional and spiritual support expressly tailored to each patient's and family's needs and family needs and wishes.   inpatient - the samaritan inpatient hospice center provides the comfort of short-term continuous samaritan care in a home-like setting for paitents whose pain, symptoms and special needs require a more acute level of hospice care than is recommended within the home. While in the inpatient center, you and your loved one will receive from samaritan staff the same services that you would in a home setting - plus the more acute 24-hour care your loved one now requires. The center's welcoming environment encourages families and friends to feel "at home" while spending quality time - whenever and for as long as they wish. Family members of all ages may visit 24 hours a day; family pets are welcome by appointment. A sleeper recliner in each bedroom allows a family member to spend the night at bedside comfortably.   as stated in samaritan's mission summary and our respective exempt purpose achievements, an important part of our comprehensive service to our community is the compassionate support for the grief that our patients and families experience. Samaritan provides such support on a regular basis through its center for grief support, where we provide bereavement, counseling, crisis intervention/debriefing, support groups and community outreach programs - all offering hope for tomorrow for those grieving today. Samaritan similarly serves the community through its transitions program, which serves community members who are coping with life-changes caused by their advanced illness but who are not yet ready for hospice care.

Seer Farms Inc	http://www.seerfarms.org	7324236197	EIN 80-0253767	PO Box 91	Jackson	NJ	08527	USA	Animal Protection & Welfare, Animals	Seer Farms is a New Jersey based 501c3 social services organization that provides animal care, resources, and support for pet-owning families in crisis. This safety net gives families facing domestic violence, financial turmoil, a health crisis, natural disaster, military service or other life crises time to restore their lives by caring for their animals until the family can be together again. Seer Farms provides for the animals on a temporary basis while the family deals with the crisis and reunites them once the family is able to care for their pets again. 	We do not believe that giving up precious animals during difficult times is necessarily best for the animals or their human companions. We believe that families in crisis need time to repair their lives and that they benefit from the emotional support they derive from their pet and the peace of mind that comes from knowing their animals are being cared for while they themselves overcome their life crisis. To help families recover, Seer Farms provides resources and support that enables a family to navigate the barriers to their own self-sufficiency. These resources and support are also intended to assist pet-owning families in pre-crisis planning and preparation; helping them mitigate the impact of their crisis on their care of their pets. 	Founded in 2008, Seer Farmshas a unique perspective on animals and their people, and how to keep them together as a family during difficult times.  Our Out of Crisis program fills an important void in the human social services and animal care services offered in the mid-Atlantic and beyond. Our origin and ongoing service reflects our commitment to families with companion animals and the animals themselves. Seer Farms is a safe haven, providing the lifeline of time and compassion to families in crisis and their companion animals.	When Seer Farms began in 2008, we were told over and over that we would be a dumping ground for unwanted animals. In the intervening years, our clients have proven those naysayers wrong. The families who seek us out have demonstrated a fairly stable 85% reunion rate.   Practically what that means is that we are approaching our 1,000th pet reunion.  More than 500 families have placed animals with us, worked diligently to get their lives resolved, and reclaimed their pets.   At any given time we are offering services to approximately 400 animals, representing nearly 200 families.	pet-owning families in crisis	Seer Farms' Out of Crisis program gives families facing a health crisis, natural disaster, financial turmoil, domestic violence, or military deployment time to restore their lives by caring for their animals until they can be together again.	more than 500 animals from 200 pet-owning families in crisis	Located at two locations in New Jersey, we serve primarily the greater New Jersey area although we have clients from all over the country

Box 791	Kenilworth	NJ	07033	USA		Mission Statement     M.I.N.O.R.T is a non-profit organization with an emphasis in restoring our youth for tomorrow to enable them to become positive leaders in their communities. M.I.N.O.R.T invests time, patience, love, compassion, understanding, encouragement, skills and knowledge in our youth. This allows each youth to see outside of their present situation in order to move forward in a world that is full of positive opportunities. This requires the right attitude and knowledge in order to obtain a positive future. Our youth are our future leaders, if we believe in them then they will begin to believe in themselves.  Our Goal at M.I.N.O.R.T is to make a big impact in the urban communities by starting with increasing our youths talents, leadership skills, strengths and turning their weak points into powerful ones so that they will move forward in the right direction. We understand that every child has a vision and a dream and that some dreams are crushed due to the lack of hope, faith and support.   No child ever wakes up and says, I want to be a drug dealer, gang member, prostitute or drug addict. Unfortunately, these situations take place most of the times due to peer pressure and/or the lack of love and guidance in their lives. M.I.N.O.R.T will help each youth to acknowledge some hidden talents within themselves in order to move forward from a negative situation into a positive one.   Our motto is, if you believe you can achieve, you can achieve what you believe.It starts with us first because its up to the adults to believe in our youth so that they can begin to believe in themselves in order to be our great leaders of tomorrow.

On July 6, 2008, the lives of Dena and Billy Sherwood changed forever when their then 13-month-old son, Billy Jr., was diagnosed with Stage IV Neuroblastoma, a very aggressive cancer of the sympathetic nervous system that most commonly occurs in infants and children under the age of five.   After witnessing the lack of research funding, the lack of treatment options and experiencing firsthand the devastating effects of childhood cancer on an entire family, in August of 2009, in the midst of their sons aggressive treatment, Dena and Billy founded Arms Wide Open Childhood Cancer Foundation.  Arms Wide Open Childhood Cancer Foundation is working closely with scientists, researchers and doctors at top cancer centers throughout the United States; who are pioneers in the pediatric cancer field, who are on the forefront of bringing many alternative therapies into clinic which could prolong the lives of children diagnosed with cancer until a cure is funded. Right now there are 40,000 children being treated for childhood cancer but research funding is limited as pharmaceutical companies do not see the efforts as profitable. Recognizing that children should not be viewed as a profit, but, rather, our investment, Arms Wide Open raises money for less toxic therapies and actual treatments these children so desperately need in order to survive.  The mission of Arms Wide Open is to fund less toxic therapies for children with cancer so they can have a better quality of life as they battle the disease and to give families hope by bridging the funding gap and making available potentially life-saving clinical trials that would otherwise not be available. Since its inception in 2008, Arms Wide Open has funded over 40 research grants and clinical trials.   Through its many programs, Arms Wide Open also helps families throughout the United States both financially and emotionally who are suffering hardship due to their childs diagnosis of cancer, providing them with support during the most difficult time of their lives.   Through their Emmy-Award winning documentaries and awareness campaign, The Truth 365, Arms Wide Open is committed to educating the general public on the truth about childhood cancer, raising awareness on a global level,  uniting the childhood cancer community, starting a national movement and giving children with cancer a voice so that they will see change in their lifetime.  Through Curefest USA, held in September in Washington, D.C. annually, Arms Wide Open has begun to unite the childhood cancer community, which has resulted in the start of a National Movement!	children with cancer and their families	Funding Research, Family Grants.

We are dedicated to funding global biomedical research into the causes, prevention, treatments, and cure for autism; to raising public awareness about autism and its effects on individuals, families, and society and to bringing hope to all who deal with the hardships of this disorder.			Research/science: the programmatic goals of the science/research program strive to improve the lives of people affected by autism today, as well as improve their future by advancing scientific research. The research focuses on diagnosis, treatment, service delivery and prevention. In 2014, autism speaks launched mssng (pronounced "missing"), its historic collaboration with google to create the world's largest genomic database on autism. The ambitious project will sequence the whole genomes of 10,000 families affected by the disorder. The result will be an autism research open source database containing extensive diagnostic information as it pertains to environmental, behavioral, and medical factors associated with autism. This could uncover various forms of autism and lead to individualized treatment for people living across the autism spectrum. A study co-funded by autism speaks found autism rates doubled among children whose mothers were exposed to high levels of particulate air pollution (smog) during pregnancy. The findings suggest an urgent need to revisit public health policies on pollution limits. In addition, autism speaks funded two major research projects to advance understanding of autism's gut-brain connection. The first explores the role of the microbiome (intestinal bacteria) in driving or relieving autism symptoms. The second focuses on chronic constipation, a serious problem for many people with autism. Research launched with an autism speaks trailblazer grant provided new support for the theory that autism symptoms can result from inflammation and cell distress. Based on those findings, the study's authors are developing and testing new autism medicines. Researchers, also funded by autism speaks, successfully field-tested a simple, practical method that non-specialists can use to screen for autism among schoolchildren in poor regions around the world. Such reliable yet easily administered tests are urgently needed in developing countries. A landmark study funded by autism speaks produced a comprehensive estimate of autism's costs to individuals, families and society. The lifetime cost of care averages $1. 4 million to $2. 4 million, depending on whether an intellectual disability is involved, and includes medical care, lost income, special education and residential supports. The yearly cost to society in the united states is $236 billion a year. This information is crucial for guiding public policy and planning services across the lifespan. In 2014, autism speaks spent $ 14,369,900 in grants and awards for new and continuing projects in the following categories: a. Special projects ($6,684,854) -- autism speaks-initiated projects aimed at addressing specific needs within the autism research community. Autism speaks staff work in conjunction with investigators to develop projects that may include improvements to research infrastructure, rapid responses to new and highly visible public health initiatives, or facilitating collaborations between investigators to address complex research issues from a multi-disciplinary perspective. In 2014, special projects included the autism and developmental disabilities monitoring network (addm), the preclinical autism consortium for therapeutics (animal model development), dsm-5 (diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, fifth edition) comparisons, and projects around early intervention. B. Treatment, basic research and dissemination projects. These include the autism speaks autism treatment network ($2,138,915), basic & clinical studies ($3,199,364), gi and neurobehavior studies ($383,967), trailblazer award ($100,000), and treatment studies ($743,013). C. Training grants, including meixner translational postdoctoral fellowships ($594,477) and weatherstone predoctoral fellowships ($525,310).   awareness, family services, advocacy: awareness is a cornerstone of the autism speaks mission. In its fifth year, autism speaks' global light it up blue awareness campaign reached new heights. More than 10,000 iconic landmarks, businesses, communities and homes in 136 countries united on world autism awareness day, april 2, to shine a bright light on autism. At a special lighting ceremony at the empire state building, autism speaks and sesame workshop, the nonprofit behind sesame street, announced an initiative to help communities "see the amazing in all children" and reduce the stigma surrounding children with autism. Autism speaks hosted its seventh annual world focus on autism during the united nations general assembly. As heads of state gathered in new york city, first spouses from asia, africa, latin america, europe and the middle east gathered for a forum that united the global autism movement. Hosted by autism speaks co-founders suzanne and bob wright, dignitaries heard about global strategies from dr. Liri berisha, former first lady of albania and president of the albanian children's foundation, and mrs. Ban soon-taek, spouse of u. N. Secretary-general ban ki-moon. Family services is committed to connecting and empowering individuals with autism and their families with resources to improve their quality of life today and into the future. Autism speaks continued to focus on safety in the autism community. Nearly half of those with autism wander. In partnership with the national center for missing and exploited children (ncmec), autism speaks responded to 150 wandering incidents. In addition, autism speaks established the swimming and water safety scholarship fund, which enables service providers to offer scholarships to financially disadvantaged people with autism. Nearly 1,500 swimmers benefited from scholarships. Throughout the year, autism speaks focused on increasing the housing and community living options for adults with autism and adolescents entering adulthood. A national town hall series brought them together with families, adult-service providers and government officials to discuss challenges and opportunities. Autism speaks also launched an initiative to develop housing and community-living policies and programs. The goal is to ensure diverse options by collaborating with a wide range of stakeholders. The autism response team, a group of autism speaks staff members specially trained to connect individuals with autism and their families to tools and resources, responded to more than 47,500 calls and emails, including nearly 4,000 in spanish. This marked a 55 percent increase from the year before. In 2014, autism speaks' state advocacy initiatives for autism insurance reform were successful in several states: utah; nebraska; maryland; washington; and the u. S. Virgin islands. Autism speaks' federal advocacy efforts resulted in the passage of the autism cares act, which authorizes $1. 3 billion in federal funding for scientific research. That includes, for the first time, a focus on issues surrounding the transition to adulthood. In addition, after a nearly decade-long campaign by autism speaks and its partners, the achieving a better life experience act (able) was signed into law. It is widely considered the most significant disability-related legislation since the americans with disabilities act (ada) of 1990. Able allows states to create tax-preferred savings accounts -- much like 529 college-savings accounts -- for people with disabilities, generally without losing eligibility for medicaid, supplemental security income and other benefits.

We elevate the level of understanding of Cancer.  ACF provides free clear, independent information and research to enable patients and their families to make smarter choices for Cancer treatment with an emphasis on dignity, functionality and cure. We have been doing this for more than 30 years.  We Inform, You Decide!  Cancer education is among the most important facets of surviving cancer. An individual who has been given a diagnosis of cancer and provided with information such as stage and possible treatment options desperately needs additional facts in order to make an educated, empowered decision.  Among some of the questions that must be answers are:  What does it mean to be at stage.? Do I need a second opinion? Is there more than one treatment option? Though the patients physician may make every effort to offer answers to offer answers to these questions, more often than not the patient is not able to hear the physicians information. Shock, disbelief, grief, and anger among other emotions take the place of rational thought when confronted with this diagnosis. Further, individuals have different learning styles an needs. Some learn by listening, others by reading, while others learn by talking things out. Some individuals can handle medical terms and concepts, while others must be provided the information in very basic language.  Regardless of how an individual receives and processes the information provided, the critical aspect is that the information be easily accessible, be offered repeatedly, and at the level at which the patient can grasp it. Cancer, much like any other serious medical condition, does not afford the patient the luxury of misinformation. We seek to eliminate misinformation by doing the research for the patient; seeks to decrease the precious time wasted in research and data collection by providing a clear understandable source of information; seeks to offer comfort and support by ensuring that the information provided is useful and offered in a caring respectful manner.	In just the last 8 years we have helped more than 12 million people find all the resources they need to fight cancer.	empower cancer patients with knowledge.	Online resources to educate, empower and fight cancer.

At Tabbys Place, cats who were once in desperate circumstances are cherished and provided with a joyful haven, the very best medical care, and lots of love. Our kitties come primarily from public shelters where they had once been scheduled for euthanasia.  This one-of-a-kind facility serves as:  1) An Adoption Center, finding loving homes for cats;   2) A Hospital, providing medical and surgical treatment for sick or injured residents;   3) A Hospice, providing palliative care and a warm, loving environment for chronically or terminally ill cats to live out their lives in comfort.   Tabbys Place does not turn cats away due to age, medical need, or lack of adoptability. It is, therefore, a safe haven for several older, chronically ill, or handicapped cats. These cats have special needs such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or blindness. At Tabbys Place, these cats are able to live full and happy lives with the medical care, love, and affection they deserve.   Tabbys Place  * Provides communal living environments for cats, with plenty of horizontal and vertical space for exercise and play.   * Provides outdoor enclosures for cats to enjoy fresh air and sunlight.   * Contains special group rooms for cats who are FIV+, overweight, or on prescription diets.   * Contains an in-house medical facility.   * Uses specialized materials to facilitate cleaning and encourage a disease-free environment.	To date, Tabbys Place has rescued nearly 800 cats from hopeless situations, placing 650 in loving adoptive homes.		In 2012 we continued our efforts at adding tnr (trap neuter release of feral cats) to our program, as we sterilized close to 100 cats in our local area. We also added an online help facility for people looking for help with their cats, primarily trying to find new homes. We hired a part-time employee to provide prompt help with each request. During 2012, we received and responded to over 1,000 requests. In 2011 we expanded our outreach into tnr (trap neuter release) for feral cats. Along with several small tnr projexts in the area, we began a collaboration with the nj state women's prison to manage the feral cat population on their property. The project is ongoing, but during 2011 we trapped and sterilized 33 cats and returned them to the prison grounds. In addition, we continued our primary work of saving cats from hopeless situations and adopting them to loving homes adopting 120 in 2011. In 2010 the organization reached a new high in public donations despite the harsh economic times the country is facing. For the second consecutive year the organization has operated profitably, the organization was able to obtain a used x-ray machine from a local friendly veternarian which has proven to be a much needed addition to our medical facilities. Lastly, in 2010 we saved our 900th cat from a hopeless situation. In 2009 we surpassed our 800th saved cat, continued on-going operations and made significant upgrades to our it. In 2008 we celebrated the 5th anniversary of operations in the new facility. We saved our 600th cat, grew our volunteer program and saw an 8% increase in donations. In 2007, we accepted several cats with rare diseases that we have treated with some success. This experience will not only help our practice but the practices of other feline practioners, we were able to increase our fundraising from 2006 by 50% and grew our development department with the addition of a development associate. During 2007 we hit the major milestone of saving our 500th cat. The year also saw our 400th adoption. We purchased a high- end dental machine that allows the staff to accomplish dental procedures more efficiently and thoroughly.   to provide an equipped facility in which to carry out it's exempt function.

YMCAs are at the heart of community life in neighborhoods and towns across the nation. They work to meet the health and social service needs of 16.9 million men, women and children.  Ys help people develop values and behavior that are consistent with Christian principles. Ys are for people of all faiths, races, abilities, ages and incomes. No one is turned away for inability to pay. YMCAs' strength is in the people they bring together.  In the average Y, a volunteer board sets policy for its executive, who manages the operation with full-time and part-time staff and volunteer leaders. Ys meet local community needs through organized activities called programs. In its own way, every Y nurtures the healthy development of children and teens; strengthens families; and makes its community a healthier, safer, better place to live.  YMCA programs are tools for building the values of caring, honesty, respect and responsibility. Longtime leaders in community-based health and fitness and aquatics, Ys teach kids to swim, offer exercise classes for people with disabilities and lead adult aerobics. They also offer hundreds of other programs in response to community needs, including camping, child care (the Y movement is the nation's largest not-for-profit provider), teen clubs, environmental programs, substance abuse prevention, youth sports, family nights, job training, international exchange and many more.  Organization: Each YMCA is a charitable nonprofit, qualifying under Section 501(c)(3) of the U.S. Tax Code. Each is independent. YMCAs are required by the national constitution to pay annual dues, to refrain from discrimination and to support the YMCA mission. All other decisions are local choices, including programs offered, staffing and style of operation. The national office, called the YMCA of the USA, is in Chicago, with Field offices in California, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Ohio, Indiana, Minnesota and Texas. It is staffed by 241 employees. Its purpose is to serve member associations.  International: YMCAs are at work in more than 120 countries around the world, serving more than 30 million people. Some 230 local US Ys maintain more than 370 relationships with Ys in other countries, operate international programs and contribute to YMCA work worldwide through the YMCA World Service campaign. Like other national YMCA movements, the YMCA of the USA is a member of the World Alliance of YMCAs, headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland.  History: The YMCA was founded in London, England, in 1844 by George Williams and about a dozen friends who lived and worked as clerks in a drapery a forerunner of dry-goods and department stores. Their goal was to help young men like themselves find God. The first members were evangelical Protestants who prayed and studied the Bible as an alternative to vice. The Y movement has always been nonsectarian and today accepts those of all faiths at all levels of the organization, despite its unchanging name, the Young Men's Christian Association.  The first U.S. YMCA started in Boston in 1851, the work of Thomas Sullivan, a retired sea captain who was a lay missionary. Ys spread fast and soon were serving boys and older men as well as young men. Although 5,145 women worked in YMCA military canteens in World War I, it wasn't until after World War II that women and girls were admitted to full membership and participation in the US YMCAs. Today half of all YMCA members and program members are female, and half are under age 18.

In 1987, the Tomorrows Childrens Fund formed a partnership with Hackensack University Medical Center to provide our children with the best possible care, in a state of the art, bright and comfortable facility.   Remarkable people like you, through donations and fundraisers, help TCF provide a warm, healthy and loving environment for children in treatment; a full scope of services to relieve families emotional and financial stress; the very best possible medical care; and funding for research on these diseases. All of which confirms our belief that through hope, hard work and heartfelt generosity, extraordinary things are possible.	The financial burden these devastating diseases place on families can be overwhelming, and the last thing any parent should have to worry about when a child is diagnosed with cancer or a serious blood disorder is money. At Tomorrows Children's Fund, we've learned that by lightening the financial load, we can help make this difficult time a little easier to bear. To this end, we strive to meet the needs of those who are financially overwhelmed with a full spectrum of services including, but not limited to: 	Assistance with mortgage, utility, car payments and transportation.  	Complimentary accommodations in furnished apartments near the medical center for parents whose children require lengthy hospital stays while undergoing bone marrow transplants or other extended treatments. 	Gift certificates from local supermarket chain stores for families in need of grocery     supplies.

Because of recent advances in the neurosciences, neuroimaging, and molecular genetics, psychiatry and its related disciplines are now poised, as never before, to more clearly elucidate the neuroanatomical and molecular pathways that are responsible for specific psychiatric diseases.  The scientific and clinical team of JBRF is organized around a common research aim: to advance the state of knowledge about this illness so that more effective treatments can be developed.	JBRF has the largest source of symptom data in the world from children affected by bipolar disorder.  Research based on our data has resulted in: a neuroanatomical model of the illness (the first for any mental disorder) a treatment approach and pilot study which has exhibited extremely positive responses the initiation of a treatment study approved by the FDA  a putative biomarker for the condition which may lead to the development of an objective diagnostic test for the condition. JBRF developed diagnostic screening instruments to meet the need for the early identification of bipolar disorder in children:                                        The Child Bipolar Questionnaire (CBQ) is a rapid, low-cost screening tool that has demonstrated a high degree of accuracy predicting various phenotypes of bipolar disorder as well as ADHD. The Jeannie/Jeffrey Illustrated Interview for Children is a screening instrument that makes possible the direct reporting of symptoms by a young child.  The comic-strip style illustrations promotes the child's willingness and ability to reveal mood states, fears, suicidal thoughts and/or hallucinations. The Journal of Affective Disorders: A dimensional approach to screening for pediatric bipolar disorder, January 2011, explores the efficacy of the CBQ.   The results of a JBRF study focused on establishing guidelines for differentiating early-onset bipolar disorder from ADHD were published in the Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology, (Jan 2011). The data from neuropsychological testing of 33 children with bipolar disorder and 22 children with ADHD-only demonstrated specific differences in the neuropsychological profiles. The MRI imaging on the subject children with bipolar disorder revealed a consistent abnormality in the amygdala.

Redefining success as using your gifts and talents for others.'	We began as grassroots. We slowly crept into the community with wristbands and attending events hosted by other organizations. Through play and relationship building we established a presence with the kids. Our ranges of ages are from 7th and 8th graders to college students.   From May until October we attended events and held our own events for our high school and college students. In June we designed character cards which are strong character traits that promote daily intentional shifts towards healthy habits.   By August we had designed a Find your Passion model that redefines success as using your gifts and talents for others, which essentially redefines failure as well. We were the largest team Color Run has seen across the country with over 250 runners. In September we created a line of surf shirts designed by our daughter and produced by Jetty life Surf Company.   Our daughter Emily received the Southern Athletic Collegial Community and Character award for her work with YCNBR. Our sales of distribution of free wristbands grew monthly to 1,000 per month with our year total of 12, 000.   We then experienced the devastation of Hurricane Sandy in our town and switched gears into storm relief. We ran one of our towns distribution centers for 3 months with a donation from a company that produced our shirts. We collected donations for another pending nonprofit until January 1st totaling over $30,000 and handled the distribution of those funds.   We then received a grant from Robin Hood foundation for $35,000. $30,000 for families, $5,000 for town events that incorporate a need with counselors present. Robin Hood stated our handling of the funds as exemplary and gave us an additional grant of $40,000.   So far we have helped over 90 families and the funds should be completely dispensed by July. We have taken no administrative costs or fees from any of the funds.    In November our daughter Emily was named a semifinalist in the Coach Wooden Citizen cup for the nation as a sophomore.   In February we began school assemblies in North Jersey and will continue until May of this year when our events begin again. In March we were on the Diocese of Trentons Catholic Corner and Emily was on the teen show Real Faith TV. We recently developed Five rules for a goal focused life and Filter words for decision making. That program can be used for all ages but was initially designed for 7th and 8th graders.    We are on the Prevention Coalition, the Monmouth County Suicide coalition and we are growing to help our local Alliance.
