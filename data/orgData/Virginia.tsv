Before GuideStar, donors lacked the information to initiate their philanthropy and follow the progress of organizations to which they give; nonprofits and their boards had no means to study and/or compare their own operating practices and results with those of similar organizations; and nonprofits, government agencies, and grants administrators suffered from the requirements of burdensome and duplicative reporting systems. By securing the collaboration of all of these audiences, GuideStar is now building the common, open information infrastructure required to eliminate these inefficiencies and ensure a more effective allocation of society's resources.		Anyone that wants information about charities.		All	Enabling Better Decisions:Through our free website, data services, and software products, GuideStar offers tools to help individuals and organizations make better, more confident decisions.

GuideStar creates value by using advanced information technology to make more information about nonprofits available to the public, donors, foundations, nonprofits, government agencies, and service providers. In 2014, GuideStar enabled users of www.GuideStar.org to obtain some level of information on more than 2.4 million tax-exempt organizations, including 8.6 million 990 images. GuideStar also increased the reach of our platform for updating Nonprofit Profiles, enabling nonprofits to share their organizations full and most up-to-date story. From 2008 through September 2015, more than 115,000 nonprofits have provided information about their programs, finances, and impact in their GuideStar Nonprofit Profile. More than 45,000 nonprofits have updated information within the most recent two years. encouraging charitable giving: the philanthropic sector relies on public interest in philanthropy and public trust in nonprofit organizations to encourage charitable giving. Guidestar builds public trust through its on-line distribution of data on the exempt and legal status, financial data, compensation practices and impact of nonprofits, and through information provided by nonprofit managers. This information is also made available to a vast network of other organizations, including community foundations (through the donoredge platform) working in the sector.   Encouraging Charitable Giving: The philanthropic sector relies on public interest and trust in nonprofit organizations to encourage charitable giving. GuideStar builds public trust through the nonprofit information it provides online.

Most of our dogs come from rural shelters in South and North Carolina. With limited resources, the shelters are forced to put down anywhere between 50% and 90% of the animals that come in the front door. We also partner with shelters located in Virginia and Maryland. Our organization provides pet adoption services to families located in Virginia, Washington DC, Maryland, Southern Pennsylvania and neighboring states. OPH does not operate a shelter or have a physical location. We rely on foster families who open their homes to give love and attention to each dog before finding a forever home. Through the foster care program, we are able to learn about each dog and their needs and we provide their potential and future adopters with this information. We believe in responsible adoptions and strive to work with each adopter to find a good match for their home and lifestyle. Operation Paws for Homes, a volunteer powered 501(c)(3) organization, is 100% donor funded. We receive no funding from federal, state, or county governments. As a result, we rely on donations and our adoption fees in order to save the dogs in need that join our rescue organization.Our goal is to fulfill the dreams of dogs who find themselves abandoned in shelters. Sadly, without our help, all of these adoptable animals would face almost certain euthanasia - usually within days or hours of arriving at the shelter. Each year we take in hundreds of wonderful animals who were left at shelters by no fault of their own. We work hard to unite them with forever families who will give them the life and love they deserve.

We are: transforming women from patients into informed medical consumers educating women on the importance and methods of early detection shifting this nations priority from just looking for a cure, to prevention and early detection.		Women		National	EARLY DETECTION FRAN VAN PROGRAM - Cancer Schmancer has discovered that there are many existing cancer-screening services for low-income individuals, the uninsured and underinsured; however, many of them are struggling to reach the people they have committed to serve, particularly women, because they just dont have the capacity to get the message out.  This is where Cancer Schmancer can have the greatest impact.  Because of our belief in collaboration to achieve a higher goal, we have built a model to partner with local, existing cancer screening services for women in need in order to reach and build capacity. (These partners are screening equipment transport vans, mobile cancer screening vans, or local clinics/hospitals, depending on the greatest need of each community.) As part of our capacity building, the Early Detection Fran Van program provides training to outreach volunteers who will help educate the communities and help women make and keep their screening appointments. This year, we are in the process of development and piloting this program in three cities, with an ultimate goal of development in cities across the US and eventually abroad. WE THE FUTURE - mobilizes the youth of this country to engage in community education and fundraising initiatives in order to support Cancer Schmancers programs and share the life-saving message of early detection and living healthily. www.CancerSchmancer.org/wethefuture

According to Islam, one sheep or goat equals one Qurbani; one cow, buffalo or camel equals seven Qurbanis. Qurbani meat is distributed in three different methods, the method chosen for a country is dependent on several factors including cost, availability of livestock, logistical issues and current situation of that country e.g. war, famine, natural disaster.

Organization For Autism Research Inc	http://www.researchautism.org	(703) 243-9710	EIN 54-2062167	2000 N. 14th Street Suite 240	Arlington	VA	22201	USA	Autism,Autism Research,Disabilities,Health	The Organization for Autism Research (OAR) was created in December 2001; it is the product of the shared vision and unique life experiences of its seven founders. Led by these parents and grandparents of children and adults on the autism spectrum, OAR set out to use applied science to answer questions that parents, families, individuals with autism, teachers and caregivers confront daily. No other autism organization has this singular focus.  The mission of OAR is to apply research to the challenges of autism.  OAR defines applied research as research that directly impacts the day-to-day quality of life of people with autism. It entails the systematic investigation of variables associated with positive outcomes in such areas as education, communication, self-care, social skills, employment, behavior, and adult and community living. In this context, it extends to issues related to family support, the efficacy of service delivery systems, and demographic analyses of the autism community.  OAR funds studies that address these issues, and uses knowledge gained from research to develop and disseminate resources that are relevant and responsive to the everyday experiences of the entire autism community.					Research: research encompassed the work of oar's scientific council as it pertains to the direction and selection of oar-funded research studies, funding research and general oversight of the research program.  information: informed and provided evidence-based resources for parents, families, educators, and other consumers in the autism community. The major components are: oar's web site, www. Researchautism. Org; the oaracle, oar's monthly e-newsletter; the "life journey through autism" series, consisting of eight community-friendly autism resource guides; the military families initiative, operation autism, www. Operationautismonline. Org; and the "autism in the school house" initiative.  education: formal structured educational forums and formats, such as conferences, seminars, and workshops on a specific topic or theme and web-based or printed materials designed along the same lines, and college/vocational scholarships for persons with autism. The primary vehicle is the conference-on-the-road program through which oar partners with selected autism organizations that host a conference to provide autism research and subject matter experts presenting on topics of high interest to the autism community. Oar conducted three in fy2015.	
Girls on the Run of Nova	http://www.gotrnova.org	7032733153	EIN 54-2026885	10560 Main St Ste 514	Fairfax	VA	22030	USA	Children & Youth,Education,Educational Services,Physical Fitness & Community Recreational Facilities,Sports,Youth Development,Youth Development Programs	Girls on the Run of Northern Virginia (GOTR NOVA) supports girls in developing the confidence and character they need to become strong, healthy young women. GOTR NOVA is one of the largest independent affiliates of Girls on the Run International, serving 5,000 girls each year across Northern Virginia. Since 2000, GOTR NOVA has directly served more than 50,000 girls.	GOTR NOVA uses pre- and post-program participant surveys to measure the impact of the curriculum on our participants. Findings from the Fall 2014 season showed that girls who began the program with lower than average pre-season scores on confidence in physical activity, self-worth, connection, character, caring, contribution and physical activity frequency -- as well as higher scores on sedentary behaviors -- showed statistically significant improvements from pre-season to post-season. This suggests that the girls who need the program the most are also the ones likely to improve their life skills as a result of participating in Girls on the Run. In 2013, GOTR NOVA worked with George Mason University and our research showed, with statistical significance, that after a season of Girls on the Run, girls have higher self-esteem, are more satisfied with their body size, exercise more, and feel a greater sense of support for exercise from their family, teachers and friends. Our study findings were true for all girls in the program and did not vary based on income, ethnic background, athleticism, or how many seasons they'd participated in Girls on the Run.	girls in grades 3rd - 8th	5,000 girls	Northern Virginia: Arlington County, City of Alexandria, City of Falls Church, City of Manassas, City of Manassas Park, Fairfax County, Loudoun County, Prince William County	A unique, experience-based after-school program which creatively integrates running.

Guatemala the most underserved country in Latin America for health and surgical care.  The typical rural Guatemalan has no experience with major medical care, has never left their cultural/language area, and frequently has no access to transportation.  Furthermore, the expenses associated with surgery far exceed their ability to pay.  It is our experience that almost all rural Guatemalans need assistance in order to take advantage of international volunteer surgical teams.  Partner for Surgery works to overcome discrimination that prohibits access to surgery; to educate and empower rural Guatemalans to initiate and advocate for vital health care services on their own behalf; to empower rural Guatemalans with good health, in order to promote equitable economic growth and emergence from a life of bare subsistence; to achieve maximum leverage through collaboration with Guatemalan and international NGOs.					Our programs include community outreach, youth empowerment through rural radio programs, screening and treatment for cervical dysplasia conditions, medical triage missions in rural communities, health education, and access to surgical care.  To those ends, we organize triage missions and recruit surgical teams from North America.  During each week-long triage event, volunteers evaluate approximately 600 individuals, and identify approximately 150 surgical candidates, who are then scheduled for future surgical missions.  Individuals who do not require surgery receive medical attention, if appropriate.  Once a surgical candidate is identified, we connect them with a surgical team over the next 1 to 4 months.  We arrange transportation; escort patients to and from the hospital site; provide personal attention, translation assistance and financial support; and serve as patient advocates.  We also provide housing and food for the patient and an accompanying family member.  Each patient is required to pay a portion of the costs, according to their resources.  Regardless of how small the amount, this approach engenders dignity, empowerment and responsibility.  We also provide surgical teams with all the in-country support they need including a fully equipped surgical center with 24/7 medical support staff.PfS holds a deep conviction that knowledge is the key to making informed decisions about one's health.  In that spirit, we devote significant resources to providing education to reduce the causes that give rise to the disproportionate need for surgery.

Roc Solid Foundation currently serves Virginia, Maryland, D.C., North Carolina and Tennessee.	Roc Solids flagship program, Play It Forward, has constructed dozens of custom playsets for children battling cancer throughout the country. During each project, the children and their families are taken out by limo for the morning, and when they return home, they are surprised with brand new wooden playsets in their backyards. While the concept is simple, its impact is far-reaching and immensely rewarding. Launched in 2012, the Roc Solid Ready Bag is given to parents who have recently learned that their child has cancer and will be undergoing a long series of treatments. The bag contains everything the family might need during an unexpected hospital stay, which often happens immediately after diagnoses, including a blanket, toiletries, pens, journals, coloring books, a preloaded debit card, quarters for the vending machines and an Amazon Kindle Fire. Re: Mission | Remodel is an extension of Play It Forward program, designed for pediatric cancer patients between the ages of nine and 18 or those whose living situation prevents Roc Solid from being able to build a playset (i.e. they live in an apartment or condo). Every kid's asked, "what do you want to be when you grow up?" Our When I Grow Up program lets children stricken with pediatric cancer fulfill those aspirations by pairing with a real life professional that shows them the ropes of their "dream job." From firefighters, to fashion designers; physical therapists to archeologists, we do all we can to inspire the courage to keep fighting. Because after all, growing up means getting better.

Health - general and rehabilitative- sierra leone is home to three non-governmental organizations (ngos) with healthcare projects, clinics, and hospitals supported by bread and water for africa (bwa): the united methodist church (umc), the faith healing development organization (fhdo), and christian health association of sierra leone (chasl). Combined, these three ngos provide care to more than 75,000 people every year, with a focus on general healthcare for pregnant, lactating women and children under five. (sierra leone has some of the highest maternal and infant mortality rates in the world). (see schedule o for continuation)in addition to $17,250 in cash grants to health care-focused projects, bwa provided in-kind donations to fhdo, umc and chasl: medicines, medical supplies, medical equipment, personal protection kits for ebola, ambulance, hygiene items and relief items valued at $6,904,659. This is aligned with our long-term mission to improve health conditions in under-served parts of africa and to ensure that the clinics we helped construct are able to continue to operate effectively and efficiently. Fhdo operates five clinics in various towns and villages throughout the country. This year, all five clinics benefitted from donated medicine and medical supplies. In addition to basic healthcare services, fhdo runs a feeding program for pregnant women and lactating mothers to increase their vitality and nutrition level. This year for the ebola crises in sierra leone, bread and water for africa has been, and remains, on the forefront in providing assistance to rev. Mambu as he continues his heroic effort to treat the sick by providing hundreds of tyvek suits and personal protection kits, hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of medicines and medical supplies, and $140,000 in cash grants to purchase emergency food supplies to make sure that more than 1,200 households across sierra leone receive all the basic food and supplies they need. In addition, in fy 2015, bread and water for africa funded the construction of waterloo primary school water well near to a local clinic; the water well will serve more than five thousand people living in the waterloo community including the nearby clinic. Chasl and umc have more than 120 members' hospitals and clinics across sierra leone with the mission of providing quality medical care to all patients and ministering to their physical and spiritual needs. In addition to providing inpatient care, surgery, obstetric delivery and newborn care, the hospital provides laboratory, ultrasound and x-ray services. Full-service outpatient clinics are operated six days per week along with a full malnutrition program in the area. In zambia, the kabwata orphanage and transit centre focused their efforts on building upon the past successes of its mobile clinic by preparing to open the permanent clinic in the kaweza district that had previously been funded by bwa. Much progress has been made in the past years, and the new clinic has been fully operational since march 2014. Additionally, because the government is providing doctors and other medical staff - as part of its new effort to improve its countrywide healthcare program - the clinic has been self-sufficient in its operations from the start. The new clinic has been a huge benefit to residents, some of whom would otherwise have to walk up to 24 miles to get basic and emergency medical care. Hope services (hps) and hope outreach foundation (hof) based in yaounde and buea, cameroon are the most recent healthcare partners for bread and water for africa. The objective of these organizations is to provide holistic care primarily in areas of medicine, psychology, social needs, and education. The health centers in yaounde and buea meet the needs of more than 45,000 people each year at little or at no cost to the patients. Additionally, hope services provides medical outreach to villages in the northwest region twice a year. The hps and hof programs are also currently addressing the health needs of yaounde urban refugees. This year, bread and water for africa provided a total in-kind support valued at $781,689 in medical equipment, medical supplies, hygiene items, and other relief items to continue support their healthcare mission in cameroon. In 2012, bread and water for africa established a partnership with haramaya university, which is located in the eastern region of the federal republic of ethiopia. This learning institution is comprised of ten or more colleges of different disciplines, including a college of medicine and college of health education. The haramaya university also has a campus clinic, community clinics and hospitals that provide educational and health services to a population of more than 50,000 residents. Through this partnership, bread and water for africa donated medicine, medical equipment, health care supplies, and hygiene items with a total value of $4,555,911 to haramaya university's healthcare efforts.  educational institutions and related programs:a key tenet of bread and water for africa's mission is that education is the future of africa. Educating africa's younger generation has been a priority for bread and water for africa since our founding. In our fiscal year 2015, we provided $252,000 in in-kind value of primary and secondary schools books to wolo university in ethiopia. (see schedule o for continuation)in addition, bwa granted in total $138,816 in cash grants to construct a primary school in cameroon and to support educational programs in kenya, sierra leone, zambia and zimbabwe while bolstering partnerships that have been helping children in these countries for over a decade. Fhdo's seven schools in sierra leone have been educating children in need for many years. In 2016, the first ever class that began their primary education at fhdo-run schools will graduate from secondary school, marking a great success for these educational programs and demonstrating the longevity of impact that an investment in local partners can yield. Bwa is looking forward to this landmark graduation and is honored to have been a part of this journey. The kipkeino primary school, founded by bwa's volunteer spokesperson phyllis keino, remains one of the top-rated primary schools in kenya, educating many orphans from the lewa children's home (lch) as well as other children from the towns and villages surrounding eldoret. The school currently has 420 students. As is the case with its partner organizations (lch and baraka farm) its reputation has made it a model of education in the region and for our other partners. It is a continuing source of pride for bwa to continue its enthusiastic support of the kipkeino primary school in 2015 by funding the school administrator's salary and upgrading computers. Bwa granted $76,766 to hope outreach foundation in cameroon for the construction of a primary school in buea, cameroon. The project is still under construction and is expected to be completed by december, 2015. The school will provide quality education for orphans and destitute children in addition to other students living in the community.  orphan care:many children in africa have been made orphans because of hiv/aids, preventable diseases, warfare, and social conditions that have pre-maturely claimed the lives of their parents. Without help, these children have little hope for future prospects of economic and social advancement, and sometimes even for survival. We are proud to support our partners' efforts to give these children a brighter future and thus granted $75,800 to orphanages in three countries this year. (see schedule o for continuation)in kenya, the lewa children's home is a model for the many other programs we support. The lewa children's home began when bread and water for africa's volunteer spokesperson phyllis keino took in four children whose parents - who had been good friends of the keino family - died in a car crash in the early 1970s. Today, the lewa children's home provides comprehensive shelter and care for 87 children on-site, and provides 126 additional children from surrounding communities with money for school fees and basic necessities like food and clothing. Over the years, phyllis has expanded her efforts by founding the kipkeino primary school and baraka farm, all within the same 500-acre complex, working together to make the community stronger. Bread and water for africa continued its enthusiastic support of the lewa children's home in 2015 with a quarterly grant funding used for the upkeep of the home and to provide operational daily support for the staff and children. The kabwata orphanage and transit centre (kotc), located in lusaka, zambia, was founded by angela miyanda to provide a loving, caring, secure and healthy environment for orphans in this country (though their efforts have since expanded operations to include community healthcare - see above). Most of the children taken in by kotc have lost their parents to the terrible aids epidemic in the country. The kotc children are provided quality nutrition, shelter, education, and skills training. 319 orphans and more than 2,000 other individuals benefit from these services, which bwa is proud to fund. As it continues down its path toward self-sufficiency, the centre has been developing an income-generating project in the form of a banana plantation and a vegetable garden, which is currently earning over $27,000 per year. The shinga development trust in mutare, zimbabwe reaches out to 396 children per year through their feeding and nutrition program and school fee support program. Given the desperate economic situation in zimbabwe (with an unemployment rate of 95% and per capita gdp of under $100), the shinga development trust's mission is to care for the neediest children. Shinga provided school fees, feeding program and foster care sponsorship to many children in the area. Shinga focused on developing a farm that will benefit the orphans feeding program in dora east and dora west since 2014. In addition, bread and water for africa is funding the construction of an orphans' house, which is still under construction. We look forward to supporting shinga's future farming project.  other programs

I also assist with neglect and abuse cases regarding any type of animal. The focus is on cats and farm animals/horses since this area is flooded with dog rescue groups and the kill rate at the nearby shelters for cats is near 100%. Also, we educate the community about disease/virus prevention, spay/neuter importance and animal care/health with our large online following and through brochures, flyers and posters.

Also, after years of insisting on an honest shelter system and teamwork, it is now required that the Wytheville Cat Shelter allows every cat that comes in to be photographed, posted online for people to see and share so that the cat has a chance at being reclaimed, adopted or rescued. If the cat is still there when their time is up, regardless of age, health, social ability, they are picked up by Misfit Critter Farm and given a second chance at life after being tested, vaccinated and spayed/neutered.

Middle East, West Bank, Lebanon	Core child program - nablus center: the tyo core child program offers non-formal education activities in art, health, it, music, english and sport for 4-8 year old children from the most disadvantaged areas of nablus, west bank (three refugee camps, old city and khallet al amood). Full-time tyo teachers develop the curricula with input from university professors, and a certified family therapist. All activities are designed to teach children self-expression, practical skills, and coping strategies in a safe environment. Youth volunteers are trained to support teachers in the classroom, providing positive role models for the young children. More centers are being planned for other disadvantaged areas of the middle east. Core program children come to tyo 4 times weekly during 10 to 12-week sessions totaling about 100 program hours per child. Art: a variety of arts and crafts activities provide a forum to explore topics like family and identity, offering an outlet for children to express their hopes, fears, successes and pain. English: international interns lead immersion classes to teach children basic vocabulary and expressions in english, offering a fun cultural exchange and a head start on their english studies in school. Health: activities related to nutrition, personal hygiene, self-esteem and identity promote healthy development of children's bodies and minds. It: the tyo curriculum helps children to become comfortable with the basic computing skills that will be essential to their academic and professional success. These practical skills also contribute to children's self-confidence and capacity to connect with others beyond their immediate community. Sport: individual and group activities teach children motor skills, coordination, teamwork and healthy competition. Sports class also provides a safe context for physical activity which most of our children have no other access to.  women's empowerment:because of their central role in the family and potential leadership for community change, woman are a crucial target for tyo. Therefore, tyo offers two interventions to support women: economic empowerment and mental/physical health and wellbeing. The women's entrepreneurship programs, with support from the cherie blair foundation and other leading organizations in nablus and lebanon,provide customized business development training, coaching, and confidence-building activities for high-potential young women to develop viable business plans based on their skills, education, and motivation to work. By starting their own business, participants generate income for themselves and other female employees thus improving the economic situation of families and the broader community. Specifically, the program addresses two factors that prevent women from doing business and earning a better living: access to information about demand in local and international markets and to sales outlets in those markets; and the business and personal skills required to launch and sustain a commercial enterprise. The project has four unique phases: 1. Selection of female business leaders, initial 4-day intensive training, and individual coaching and mentoring. 2. Production of business plans and linkage to finance. 3. Selection of 8 business plans to be incubated. 4. Futher training and support for business expansion, with particular focus on marketing, distribution, and subcontracting other women. Over the life of the project, 60 women - 20 business leaders and approximately 40 craftswomen and working women with talent, economic need, and the qualifications necessary to staff the businesses - will be engaged directly and 500 family members will be reached indirectly. The women's group provides basic knowledge about health and child development that,combined with self-confidence and other life skills, provides concrete benefits for these women and their families. Tyo offers educational and recreational programs for mothers that support their personal health and happiness, which directly impacts the family's welfare and multiplies the impact and sustainability of tyo's efforts.  youth development: over half of the population in the middle east, and palestine, is under the age of 25. Tyo is committed to engaging this important demographic, the leaders and parents of tomorrow. The tyo youth service learning program is the ideal means to do so, providing young people with a positive outlet for their time and energy as well as personal and professional skills for their future employability. Youth volunteer program - youth volunteers play a vital role in all of tyo's programs. Students from an najah and other local universities are trained in child development and facilitation skills, and oriented to tyo's mission. Then they work 8-15 hours per week alongside professional tyo teachers. For their service, volunteers earn academic credit and scholarship opportunities, as well as invaluable practical experience and training. These young people are an integral part of the tyo community, serving other members but also generating their own activities including community service projects, social events and academic networks. As well as its many benefits for participants, the youth service learning program provides tyo children with role models who provide positive, individualized attention in the classroom and beyond. An najah university (www. Najah. Edu) has offered a great deal of assistance in the establishment of tyo nablus and their students have been an invaluable addition to the tyo team. Its professors play an important role in the development of tyo curricula, and an najah students make up the majority of tyo's youth volunteer corps. We are grateful for an najah's ongoing support of and active participation in tyo's work.  community outreach: it is essential to tyo's success that we are accepted by and become a meaningful part of the local and global community. Locally, we invite all community members to open day events and collaborate with other organizations in nablus. Finally, we are honored to share our nablus constituents' story with the rest of the world through a variety of media and events around the world. The national children's museum (www. Ncm. Museum) in washington dc and tyo share a passion for engaging and empowering children. Ncm, like tyo, offers educational and recreational activities for children and families that inspire children to care about and improve the world. Through its interactive exhibits, online community, and unique national programs and partnerships, ncm is transforming the concept of a traditional museum by becoming a catalyst to inspire and empower kids to speak up, take action, and get engaged in their communities. International intern program: each semester tyo recruits highly qualified american and international interns to work and live at the tyo nablus center. Interns come from diverse academic and professional backgrounds, but all bring something unique to share with the nablus community. In 2011, tyo hosted international interns who worked full-time for 10-12 week sessions in cooperation with tyo local and international staff. Interns create enrichment classes for children, youth, and adults from refugee camps and other marginalized areas of the nablus community. Each intern develops and implements their own creative curricula throughout the session and monitors the development of their participants and the effectiveness of various activities and teaching methods. Intern programs may include classes in sports, drama, art, community english classes and weekend recreational activities.

The client is required to be employed, is offered support in furthering their education and assistance in life-skills, such as budgeting and parenting.

National Wildlife Federation	http://www.nwf.org	(703) 438-6000	EIN 53-0204616	11100 Wildlife Center Dr	Reston	VA	20190	USA	Animals,Anti-Fracking,Environment,Environmental Education,Wildlife Preservation & Protection	National wildlife federation's (nwf) mission is to inspire americans to protect wildlife for our children's future. Nwf has three strategic programmatic areas: a) iconic landscapes, b) healthy waters and c) vibrant communities. Through education, outreach and advocacy, nwf pursues solutions that reduce threats to wildlife and people. Nwf represents a diverse set of interests, made up of our vast network of affiliates, members and partners. Nwf affiliates are autonomous, nonprofit organizations that lead in state and local conservation efforts and partner with nwf on a wide variety of regional and national issues. Affiliation is a voluntary relationship between each organization and nwf, and there is only one affiliate per state or u. S. Territory. This diverse network of partners elects key members of nwf's leadership and sets nwf's conservation policy priorities through an annual resolution process. As in nature, we have strength in numbers and diversity. Nwf regularly works closely wi					Iconic landscapes: a centerpiece of nwf's strategy is protecting and restoring habitat throughout the united states to benefit wildlife. Nwf defends federal laws, protects and restores public and tribal lands, and works with local communities to protect, restore and sustain wildlife habitat. Nwf also works to provide guidance on scientific and sustainable fish and wildlife management. As an example, in the rocky mountain west, nwf's colorado and montana offices are our state affiliates are strong voices for public lands and work with partners, sportsmen, and outdoor recreationists to protect public lands for the wildlife that inhabits them and also for outdoor recreation for the public. Energy development in the west is a large area of concern and nwf and also works with energy companies to promote responsible energy development on public lands that addresses the potential impact on wildlife and their habitat. Some examples of success include: 1. We worked closely with the montana wildlife federation and other partners to achieve a stunning breakthrough for wild bison - returning 138 of these magnificent beasts to their historic range on assiniboine and sioux tribal lands on fort peck reservation in montana. 2. On may 21, 2014 president barack obama designated the organ mountains-desert peaks a national monument. The proclamation followed years of work by nwf, the new mexico wildlife federation, business owners, the public and local community leaders to protect the southern new mexico site that includes the quartz spires of the organ mountains, volcanic mountains and cliffs, box canyons, ancient rock carvings and historic ranching sites. The nearly half-million-acre area is home to a broad array of wildlife, including, mule deer, mountain lions, golden eagles and peregrine falcons.  healthy waters: nwf's focuses on regional efforts and leveraging existing relationships to address localized water issues. Nwf field offices sand affiliates regularly provide leadership and boots on the ground to support the efforts of coalitions dedicated to cleaning up america's waters. On the gulf coast, nwf is a voice for wildlife and a leader in gulf coast restoration after the bp oil spill. Through the texas living waters project, nwf works to ensure that texas has enough fresh water for people and wildlife, protecting coastal estuaries and groundwater. In the mississippi river delta, nwf's south central office is spearheading the gulf restoration efforts to curb wetlands loss and restore nature's first line of defense from hurricanes. In the great lakes, nwf's michigan office leads the healing our waters coalition that is working to modernize sewage treatment, clean-up polluted harbors, restore wetlands, and prevent unwanted, new species from invading the lakes. On the east coast, nwf's annapolis office leads the choose clean water initiative that addresses surface run off pollution affecting the chesapeake bay. Nationally, in february 2014, after years of persistent effort by tens of thousands of wildlife advocates and dozens of national wildlife federation affiliates, congress passed a new farm bill that provides huge wins for wildlife. The 2014 farm bill is a strong, conservation-friendly bill that supports healthy soil, clean water and abundant habitat for wildlife. It contains a substantial increase in funding to help farmers create wildlife habitat on working lands and important improvements for protecting our fragile native grasslands.  vibrant communities: the organization's education outreach and publication programs aim to reconnect children and adults with nature through programs such as: gardening for wildlife (encouraging schools, individuals, and communities to sustainably build and certify wildlife habitat), eco schools usa (pre-k-12 nature and environmental education programs), campus ecology and ecoleaders (young adult leadership and skills development), great american campout (encouraging individuals and communities to explore the great outdoors), national wildlife, ranger rick, and ranger rick jr. Publications (award winning magazines devoted to conservation and education). In fiscal year 14, nwf education programs reached nearly 7 million young people with high quality programming in conservation education, climate science, wildlife awareness, reading and nature play. Nwf is now in nearly 7,600 k-12 schools serving millions of students and 111,000 educators. This includes: 1. Adding 600 schools to the growing nwf eco-schools usa network -- eco-schools usa is part of the world's largest and most effective network of green schools. These are schools that devote their buildings, grounds and educational programming to environmental improvements and learning. Since 2009, nwf has been the official host and operator of the program in the u. S. In 2013 the number of participating schools increased from 2,600 to 3,100 (20% growth). Schools enrolled in the program saved $56 million in utility costs. 2. Adding 350 schools to our schoolyard wildlife habitat program -- schoolyard habitat program, now with 4,400 participating schools, is the largest school garden program in america. It supports school and educator efforts to develop wildlife and ecosystem education programs directly on the school grounds and provides children with opportunities to learn in outdoor classrooms. The program grew 9. 5% in 2013 3. 45% of the young people we now serve in our school programs are from racially diverse backgrounds -- nwf is a leader among national conservation organizations in reaching minorities and people of color through its programming. This is particularly true through our school programs due to focus on large urban school districts where american children are the most removed from nature. 4. Through nwf's trees for wildlife, children planted 20,000 trees at 100 locations -- the trees for wildlife program provides trees and educational programming to scout groups, schools groups and disaster-impacted communities. Since its inception, children have planted a total of 170,000 trees through the trees for wildlife program. 5. We helped 4 million kids get outdoors in nature on a regular basis - in late 2012, nwf announced its plan to have 10 million largely indoor-bound children to have regular time outdoors learning and playing in nature. Research shows that children who habitually stay indoors are less likely to care about wildlife and nature conservation as adults. We defined "regular time" as a weekly average of 90 minutes in natural spaces. By the end of 2013, we had achieved 3 million outdoor kids through our school and public agency programs. The schoolyard habitat program and the eco-schools usa program are particularly effective in helping students to spend time in natural setting learning about nature. These programs offer students and teacher the opportunity to create and use outdoor classrooms on schools grounds and encourage visits to local parks and nature centers. About one-half of the 3 million young people we helped reconnect with nature did so through these school-based programs. 6. We recruited 650 major urban and regional park agencies to help get kids outdoors. Most of these agencies provide field sports and indoor recreation centers as mainstays to their services. Nwf, working with the dedicated and enthusiastic support of the national recreation and park association, was fortunate to recruit 650 park and recreation agencies including: los angeles, chicago, baltimore, san francisco, st. Louis, washington d. C. And many others. 7. We signed up 10 new cities and towns for the nwf community wildlife habitat program -- nwf supports cities, counties and towns as they take steps to become local wildlife sanctuaries under our community wildlife habitat program. More than 120 locales, large and small (with a combined population of 10 million people in 25 states), have either certified or are working toward certification. A community undergoes a locally based effort to increase the number of certified backyard, schoolyard, and other habitats it has and to manage its lands and educate students and the public in ways that are supportive of habitat management and protection. 8. We helped certify 9,000 individual properties as habitats -- nwf's community habitat and garden for wildlife program and its habitat volunteers generate thousands of certifications each year. 9. We trained 1,000 habitat volunteers -- we recruit, train, and maintain a corps of habitat volunteers. Volunteers are essential to helping nwf achieve its habitat goals and obtaining 1,000 new backyard and schoolyard certifications each month. Nwf trains and deploys volunteers to help with its certified wildlife habitat programs. This includes communities, schoolyards, and backyards. These 2,000 volunteers contribute 60,000 hours per year and support hands on projects, holding tabling and communications events, giving talks to garden clubs and nature centers, helping educators, and advocating for wildlife friendly gardening and landscaping policies at the community level.

Until legislation passes in Congress designating a permanent museum in Washington, D.C., the NWHM promotes women's history through its temporary exhibits, special events, Cyber Museum, and online educational materials.					The nwhm held special events in washington and los angeles to make the public aware of its efforts for a national women's history museum and to raise money for the nwhm programs. These events brought together in excess of 750 individuals and thousands more were made aware of the need for the museum through publicity and social media. Also in partnership with george washington university, nwhm held four forums:-"game changers: american women & sports" - february 2014-"standing up for change: women & the civil rights movement" - march 2014-"new beginnings: immigrant women and the american experience" - october 2014-"breaking in: women & stem, then and now" - november 2014those attending the events were informed about some of the accomplishments of women in history and shared in the recognition of the achievements of several remarkable contemporary american women.  the building site program developed and implemented legislative advocacy in support of the nwhm's legislation (h. R. 863 and s. 398) to create a commission. Legislation passed congress and signed into law that will make recommendations of governance, operations, fundraising, and site location. The commission will be funded with private monies.  the nwhm website (www. Nwhm.

Carpenter's Shelter	http://www.CarpentersShelter.org	(703) 548-7500	EIN 54-1571849	930 N Henry St	Alexandria	VA	22314	USA	Homeless & Housing,Homeless Shelters,Housing & Shelter	Since 1998, Carpenter''s has been a leader in finding solutions to ending homelessness in the metropolitan Washington region. Four comprehensive and interrelated programs are designed to end homelessness (not accommodate it) for the 1,000 children, families and adults we serve each year. Our mission is to end homelessness through services, education and advocacy.  Open 365 days, 24 hours a day, Northern Virginia''s largest homeless program, Carpenter''s award-winning programs provide services ranging from meeting the basic needs of the chronically homeless to providing emergency shelter on freezing cold nights to keeping families together by providing temporary shelter and giving them the skills needed to return to a stable and productive existence to finally helping families remain self-reliant following graduation from the shelter.					Carpenter's offers four interrelated programs that reflect the diversity of the homeless community as well as Carpenter's efforts to fulfill the needs of the entire homeless population.  Its programs are: a DAYTIME DROP-IN SHELTER for the chronically homeless women and men; an overnight WINTER HYPOTHERMIA SHELTER; and 80-bed EMERGENCY RESIDENTIAL SHELTER; an AFTERCARE program for shelter graduates; TRANSITIONAL HOUSING PROGRAM; and an EDUCATION FUND (see descriptions below).Carpenter's day shelter, David's Place, is the only one of its kind in Alexandria, Virginia. Each year the shelter serves more than 200 adult men and women who do not, or cannot, utilize the residential services that are available.  Often these individuals are dually-diagnosed with mental health and substance abuse illnesses, and lack the social and personal skills needed to function in a structured environment.  David's Place offers a safe environment off of the streets, where our chronically homeless women and men can attend to their basic needs and participate in case management with programs such as health/substance abuse/mental health focus groups, HIV/AIDS awareness, art therapy and life-skills workshops.The overnight Winter Hypothermia Shelter provides a safe refuge for unsheltered children, women, and men to prevent illness, injury, and even death due to harsh weather.  Through this program we serve almost 300 individuals annually, including families with children.The Residential Shelter offers a comprehensive case management program that is goal-oriented toward self-reliance.  This program provides assistance with substance abuse and mental health disorders, life-skills and job readiness training, access and referrals to social services agencies and other partners and assistance with housing search.  The shelter also includes a Child and Family Services program for children and parents which ensures that all developmental, educational, medical and social needs of the children are met.  The residential unit operates 365 days a year, 24 hours a day.  Carpenter's serves over 300 homeless families and adults, including more than 105 children, who represent the working poor and families in crisis. The shelter assists in alleviating the crisis atmosphere and provides a supportive environment where healing and stabilization can occur.  Residents are required to have or be seeking full-time employment and all save 70% of their income.  Although there is no predetermined length of stay at Carpenter's shelter, most individuals stay between one to three months with families averaging at least six months.Our Aftercare Program continues case management and coordination of services for clients after their shelter stay.  The goal of this program is to prevent repeated episodes of homelessness. Carpenter's is committed to helping ensure that adequate housing options and resources are available to all residents leaving the emergency shelter.  In 2002, we began a Transitional Housing program, utilizing 2-4 off-site apartments for families and single adults.  This program is run in conjunction with our Aftercare program.Carpenter's believes that education is the key to self sufficiency. The Education Fund has awarded $86,000 in life-altering education related funds to Carpenter's clients for tuition, living stipends, computers and books.

It is about bringing the hope that comes from restoring dreams, helping people to take responsibility and enabling them to find  purpose. TCOH is all about raising up leaders both from the community as well as from the children.  The children are taught to respect the good in their own culture but to change what needs to be changed. Dr. Chacha (founder and president) tells the children, Your parents may have died but your dreams didnt die.  We are succeeding in raising up children who can take responsibility for themselves. They grow 90% of their own food and the older children take responsibility for the younger ones.	While the home for the children only opened in 2009, we have already seen the children growing into maturity. Some are now working for TCOH and others are pursuing their dreams in secondary school or in learning various trades. TCOH is effective because it isnt outsiders imposing their solutions but it is about local people working with the support of others to solve problems for themselves.	orphaned & vulnerable children	100 children in our children's home and an additional 300 in our primary school in addition to providing primary medical care and dental care through our medical center	Ntagacha, Tanzania	a children's home, primary school, community medical clinic, & hopefully soon, a secondary school.

Almost 28,000 tickets were issued to see legendary artists and exciting up-and-coming talents in a diverse array of musical genres with an average ticket price of $35. The theater was built from two restored 18th century barns and was a gift from our founder, catherine filene shouse.  each year, wolf trap education delivers high quality arts-learning experiences to more than 75,000 children and adults, locally, nationally, and internationally. At the heart of wolf trap's education outreach for more than three decades, the wolf trap institute for early learning through the arts (institute) is recognized nationally as a model for incorporating the performing arts into preschool and kindergarten curricula. The institute provides direct services to children between the ages of three months and 6 years and multiplies its impact through professional development for early childhood educators, parents, and caregivers. The institute seeks to address two primary concerns: (1) the school readiness of children who live in economically disadvantaged circumstances; and (2) access to effective professional development for teachers who work with these children. By integrating arts strategies into early childhood standards-based instruction, the institute enhances children's cognitive, physical, and social/emotional development, as well as literacy, science, technology, engineering, and math (stem) skills development. Each summer, wolf trap education serves nearly 20,000 children, parents, and other caregivers through wolf trap children's theatre-in-the-woods. Building on four decades as a beloved community institution, this program comprises seven weeks of performances with musicians, actors, and dancers at an outdoor venue situated in the woods near the filene center at wolf trap national park for the performing arts. This unique, family-friendly venue offers the perfect environment for lively adventures in music, dance, theater, and puppetry. Wolf trapeducation also manages the organization's internship program, a highly competitive program consistently ranked among the nation's best. Each year approximately 43 full- and part-time internships provide students and recent graduates with invaluable hands-on experience and connections in the administrative side of the arts. In addition to the internship program, wolf trap education oversees one year-long fellowship that is offered to a youngprofessional of color who has completed at least one year of graduate study or recently graduated with a master's in the arts or a related discipline. Wolf trap education annually acknowledges and awards the work and achievements of six outstanding performing arts teachers from school districts in the dc/md/va metro area through grants for high school performing arts teachers. At the center for education at wolf trap and on the filene center stage, wolf trap education offers field trip performances, classes, and master classes serving all ages that encourage lifelong learning through thearts.  the wolf trap opera company, created in 1971, is a highly regarded residence program for opera singers in transitions: our primary tier of filene young artists are established singers on the verge of professional careers; studio artists are talented student singers considering a career in the field. The company offers an opportunity for our nation's most talented young performers to experience the demands of a professional career in the performing arts. The company presents highly acclaimed performances at both the filene center and the barns. In 2014, the company selected 17 filene young artists (representing eight states and five foreign countries) who then performed in 10 barns performances (2 different operas and 1 recital) and 1 filene center staged concert opera with the national symphony orchestra.

We support the availability of all preventive health care options, including vaccines, and the right of consumers to make educated, voluntary health care choices.	NVIC's co-founders worked with Congress on the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, which acknowledged that vaccine injuries and deaths are real and that the vaccine injured and their families should be financially supported and that vaccine safety protections were needed in the mass vaccination system. The law set up a federal vaccine injury compensation program, as well as included legal requirements for vaccine providers to give parents vaccine benefit and risk information before their children are vaccinated; keep written records of vaccine manufacturer names and lot numbers for each vaccination given; enter serious health problems following vaccination into a child's permanent medical record; and report serious health problems following vaccination to the federal Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS).In 1996, NVIC realized a major goal when, after 14 years of public advocacy, the FDA finally licensed a purified pertussis vaccine (DTaP vaccine) for American babies. In 1999, the live virus polio vaccine (OPV) was replaced by the inactivated polio vaccine and vaccine strain paralytic polio cases were eliminated in America.Co-founders and members of NVIC have also represented consumers on the Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines, the National Vaccine Advisory Committee, the Institute of Medicine's Vaccine Safety Forum, the FDA Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, the Vaccine Policy Analysis Collaborative, and the Consumers United for Evidence-Based Healthcare, Cochrane Collaboration  U.S.In 1989, the organization held an International Scientific Workshop attended by pediatric neurologists, epidemiologists, neuroimmunologists, molecular biologists, bacteriologists and neuropathologists to evaluate the neurological complications of pertussis and the whole cell pertussis vaccine. In 1997, 2000, 2002 and 2009 NVIC held the International Public Conference on Vaccination, which brought together more than 500 doctors, scientists, health officials, lawyers, ethicists, journalists and parents from 34 states and five countries to the U.S. Capitol to present new scientific data about vaccines and diseases and discuss the biological mechanism of vaccine-induced injury, death and chronic illness. Since 1982, NVIC has reached millions of families and provided information about diseases and vaccines to thousands of parents, health care providers and other individuals around the world through our free NVIC Vaccine E-newsletter, website and social media efforts. NVIC also operates a Vaccine Reaction Registry, and online public forums on vaccine harassment and failures. In 2010 the NVIC Advocacy Portal was launched as a public service to provide support and information on changes in state vaccine policy and laws, which has created a grassroots network of activists engage to protect vaccine informed consent.	The National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC) is dedicated to the prevention of vaccine injuries and deaths through public education and to defending the informed consent ethic in medicine.	Last year alone NVIC responded with life-saving information to over 9,000 individuals  who contact us annually with questions about vaccines and disease.	The National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC) is a national charitable, non-profit educational organization founded in 1982. NVIC launched the vaccine safety and informed consent movement in America in the early 1980's and is the oldest and largest consumer led organization advocating for the institution of vaccine safety and informed consent protections in the public health system.	Since 1982, NVIC has operated a Vaccine Reaction Registry and provides the public with a forum to post vaccine harassment and failure reports to our website, as well as founded the International Memorial for Vaccine Victims.  NVICs website also provides to the public information on vaccines and disease to support informed decision-making, and many other resources which provide more information about infectious diseases, vaccines, and new research into healing therapies for vaccine related illness and disability. In 2010 NVICs Advocacy portal was launched to provide the public with analysis and legislative alerts on vaccine policy and law changes in each state and has since built a nationwide network of educated citizens activists to advocate for informed consent protections in vaccine law and policy.
