Missions trips - each year, several opportunities are available for individuals to travel to haiti to be a part of the on the ground work taking place in the community of morne oge, just outside of the city of jacmel. Those who join us on a trip to haiti will get to put their personal skill set to work to help further restore haiti's long term purposes. Trip members can work with construction teams on the building projects in process, work in the kitchens with the haitian cooks who prepare food for the feeding program, serve members of the community by providing training seminars on topics in which they have expertise (education, health and nutrition, character building and leadership, etc. ), work alongside our medical clinic staff, and have (see schedule o) an opportunity to interact with the child they sponsor and their family.   sponsorships/feeding program - mal-nutrition and lack of education are two of the biggest issues the youth of haiti struggle to overcome. Because there is no free public education in haiti, many haitian children are not afforded the opportunity for consistent schooling, and therefore grow up to be unemployed and unable to support themselves. In an effort to confront these two major areas of need, we have created the restore haiti child sponsorship program. This program allows donors to help a specific child by providing funds for school tuition, uniforms, and testing fees. In addition, the child is admitted to our feeding program where they receive a hot meal, beverage, and multivitamin each day. Other benefits include access to medical clinics, and in some cases extra (see schedule o) financial assistance for their families specific needs. Sponsors are also given the opportunity to connect personally with the child through photos, notes, and the opportunity to help provide school supplies or send a christmas gift each year. Many sponsors also choose to visit the child by going on one of our planned trips to haiti each year.   building project / earthquake relief - there are several building programs in progress in the community in haiti that we have adopted. Although long term we plan for these building projects to be more focused on facilities needed for the many programs in place, we are currently more focused on helping to rebuild homes for 17 families in our community who have been living in tents since the january 2010 earthquake. These concrete home are affordable, running between 6,000 - 15,000 usd depending upon the size of the home required for the family. Some of our sponsors have had the opportunity to help with fundraising to build a home for the family of the specific child they sponsor, allowing another connection point for the sponsor to the child. In addition to the homes, we (see schedule o) have helped to raise funds for the communities first medical clinic and the first pre-school in the area, both of which are now fully functioning and accessible to the members of the community.

Baptist memorial health care corporation's mission is to heal, preach, and teach. These are not just words, but something we do everyday with pride for our patients, our community and each other. A very important department within the baptist memorial health care corporation is corporate audit and consulting services. This department provides value-added services through financial, operational and compliance reviews of entities throughout the corporate system.

Approximately 110 people are served nightly, with a maximum of 54 women and the remainder are children. More than 50 percent of the people in the shelter are children. The shelter provides safe housing, nutritional meals and individual case management for up to 90 days. The case managers help the women turn their lives around. With a focus on finding permanent housing and/or employment, resources are identified and referrals are made to help overcome or manage mental illness, substance abuse, job loss and displacement. Immunizations will also be offered to the children. Baptist memorial health care began the process of a unified electronic medical record system with epic. The system will include one record for each patient that is accessible to all the patient's caregivers and to the patient. Baptist had the first ambulatory "go-live" date in january 2014 and the first hospital in march 2014. Baptist memorial health care and vanderbilt university medical center began an academic affiliation in october 2012. This academic affiliation will provide for new clinical research and academic education opportunites that are designed to enhance cancer programs.

More recently the term "sustainable development" has come to be understood as an oxymoron, like "military victory." What is needed instead is graceful economic descent to a steady state relationship with Gaia, such as pre-existed the rise of the "taker" culture, to borrow Daniel Quinn's term. We need to return to the garden, whence we came.  The philosophy of the Institute is that embedded and emerging memes that link human culture are not ethically neutral, but often have long-term implications for viability of natural systems, biodiversity, human dignity and our common future. The signs of the imbalance and disharmony in our choices surround and confound us. Ignored or misunderstood, they ominously portend great suffering and systems collapse.  Institute program areas over the past decades have included research into food and energy sciences towards the end of improving food security and reducing climate-altering dependence upon fossil and atomic fuels; using improved communications methodologies for demonstrations of alternative economic and social experiments; and multidisciplinary research into mechanisms for narrowing the gap between the developed and developing world without undue negative cultural and environmental impacts; moving us back to a common welfare social ideology that sustains and nurtures the natural world in which humans are just one of many citizen species.	The Institute's principal work in the late 1970s related to the transportation sector. Working under a series of contracts with the U.S. Department of Energy, The Institute performed groundbreaking work on concentrating photovoltaic arrays, low cost, long-distance electric and hybrid vehicles, and multi-fuel heat engines. This work led to the inception of the Solar Car Corporation of Melbourne, Florida and Groton Connecticut. SCC went out of business in the late 1990s, a victim, like the Tucker, of being too far ahead of its time. With a capitalization of less than $10 million, SCC lacked the financial ability to combat the conjoined forces of industry and government which quickly arrayed against it, despite a vastly superior product that correctly foresaw fundamental shifts in transportation demands.  A lasting contribution which the Institute made to our transportation future was to take the science of "hypercars" and place it firmly into the public domain. The Institute did this by parading its solar-powered automobile daily through the 1982 World's Fair in Knoxville, Tennessee, and by publishing its technological innovations in the open literature. Later attempts to patent and sequester the key technologies of solar-powered cars were defeated as a result of this contribution.  Other applications coming our of the solar car research included 1 kw solar (dish) Stirling and rotary turbines; direct current-powered compact air conditioning; solar powered electric watercraft; and trough concentrator arrays for solar water heating.  Taught by the leading experts in sustainable agriculture and carbon sequestration, our 4-week Carbon Farming course put all the pieces together to form a mosaic of ecological design to help rural businesses, farmers and householders produce safe and forward thinking products, and fresh organic produce, while putting carbon into the soil and shifting the trajectory of climate change back towards equilibrium. Our pilot Carbon Farming program is now accessible to all interested change agents through our special website, with open source powerpoints, video, audio, documents and blogs.   In 1994 we began the Ecovillage Training Center in Tennessee and since then have trained more than 60,000 people from at least 60 countries, many of whom have gone on to replicate the Center in their own regions. We were among the founders of the Ecovillage Network of the Americas, the Global Ecovillage Network, and the Eco-Earth Alliance.  We will still need a strong step towards putting a price on carbon, and for 15 years GVI has maintained an active presence at the United Nations, where it has consultative status, working with organizations such as the Global Ecovillage Network, TckTckTck, 350.org, and the International Biochar Initiative. Our seminal books, Climate in Crisis (1990), The Post-Petroleum Survival Guide (2006), and The Biochar Solution (2010) are international standard references. Our online resource library provides free access to the entire range of appropriate technologies for homes, communities and businesses.  In the 1970s the Institute began research into fast growing plant species that could serve multiple purposes even while providing residential building materials for an expanding world population. Our experimental hybrid poplar and chestnut plantations are now more than 20 years old. Our tree varieties, including Tennessee's own state tree, the Tulip Poplar are able to process wastewater and reclaim severely eroded landscapes. Today we have more than 20 varieties of temperate bamboo  growing at our Ecovillage Training Center, and more than 200 varieties under study at the nearby Earth Advocates Research Center for size, growth rates, temperature tolerance and other characteristics. We like bamboo as a cultivatible architecture. Only 500 square meters are needed to grow one house in one year, about the size of a typical U.S. living room.  The Kids to the Country Program at the Ecovillage Training Center is now in its 16th year in bringing underprivileged children from low income housing and homeless shelters to a summer vacation of horses, hikes and swimming holes.	All sentient beings	5000	Global	We are working with county government, the business community, local charities, and the public to create a resilient and ecologically responsive economic fabric that will endure the turmoil and chaos of The Great Change now underway.  Our Trees for Airmiles and Peace Thru Permaculture projects are planting trees in the desert, particularly in the war zones of the Middle East, but also in Mexico, Haiti, and the Caribbean Basin. We want to raise a Permaculture Army and equip them to plant 1 million trees per day.  Relocalization, Transition, and Financial Permaculture are different names used to describe a strategy to build societies based on the local production of food, energy and goods, and the local development of currency, governance and culture. Our main goals are to increase community energy security, strengthen local economies, and to dramatically improve environmental conditions and social equity.   As of 2006, through our Culture Change project, we have been participating in the emerging Sail Transport Network, returning coastal trade to wind-power with shipments of cacao, cassava starch, coffee and vanilla bean.   As we described in our chapter for State of the World 2010, Agriculture to Permaculture, improving soil fertility will enable farmers to once again produce the food consumed by a local population without fossil-fuel based inputs. As we have seen for the past four centuries, conversion of natural vegetation to cropland reduces soil carbon content by one-half to one-third. However, soil carbon loss can be reversed by agricultural practices that build up the carbon in soils by, for example, reducing the period of bare fallow, planting cover crops, and changing aeration of the soil (such as by no till, ridge till, or keyline planting). Adding biochar to this mix of strategies provides the potential to take the planet from 390 ppmv CO2 to 350, or even 250 ppmv, on timescales short enough to prevent catastrophic tipping points.

The food bank is one of over 200 certified members of feeding america, the nation's largest food bank network.					Community food partners - provided nearly 19 million pounds of food during 2015 (17. 5 million pounds in 2014) to over 450 not-for-profit agencies, including soup kitchens and emergency food programs. The middle tennessee's table program collects perishable and non-perishable food from more than 200 food donors, such as grocery stores, retailers, wholesalers and bakeries, which is then distributed to more than 450 nonprofit partner agencies such as low-income soup kitchens, domestic violence shelters, rehabilitation centers, and senior citizens' centers. These products include meats, produce, dairy, bread, bakery items and dry products. During 2015, the food bank distributed over 10. 3 million pounds of food (equivalent to more than 8. 6 million meals) under this program. (the food bank distributed 9. 8 million pounds equivalent to more than 8. 1 million meals in 2014). Also included in community food partners is the mobile pantry program.

We offer educational volunteer opportunities, including gleaning excess crops, on local farms to ensure all available food resources are being attained. We identify seasonal crops grown in large quantities in tennessee such as green beans, sweet potatoes, and tomatoes and innovate ways to supply surplus to middle tennessee communities and to surrounding sister food banks.

The program sourced over 1. 305 million pounds direct from farms in 2015.   project preserve - operates a unique program that distributes purchased product to local agencies and other feeding america affiliates. In addition, the program has a cook/chill operation, which is a method of food manufacturing that involves heating food, pumping the product into form-fill plastic bags that are heat sealed, then super cooled for approximately 45 minutes prior to freezing the product. It has utilized large amounts of donated ingredients that would have otherwise been wasted. Additionally, this operation produces tray pack meals for children's feeding, senior nutrition and partner agencies that do direct home distribution to clients in need. Another component of project preserve is custom product assembly for national distribution.
