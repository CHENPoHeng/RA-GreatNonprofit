Our goal is to empower young people with the gift of a consistent education to help them to leave the poverty behind!	EDUCATION 2017- RISING TO THE TOP IS UNDERWAY!  Each August our education program focuses on our students in a new way.  Last year is was Leaving Poverty Behind and this coming school year it will be about RISING TO THE TOP!  Our goal is to concentrate on our students and encourage them to do the best that they can be.  We will support them not only financially but emotionally and mentally as well with the motivation to raise their grade level to a new higher level!  With your help we can do so much more!  HFLW has focused on education for students of all ages helping with school finances because without resources many children are unable to go to school or continue education through the years.  Since our inception in 2008 we have done several projects helping with educating those living in poverty.  We choose a project, create a program and solution, fund raise and then fix the problem.  At an orphanage it was tearing down an old building and building a new one into a library and computer learning center for 64 orphans who other wise would not have access to school books or the outside world through the use of computers.  In 2014 we started a farm to sustain a day care center and their needs for their lunch program for the children who came for school and lunch.  The property was donated by a Kenyan family.  There are chicken and pigs, gardens planted with many different types of vegetables, banana trees, passion fruit, and avocado trees planted.  With the sale of eggs, meat, and vegetables it helps to pay for the needs of the day care center, along with providing food needs for the center, and employment.The year 2015/2016 we continued our sponsorship program for Kenyan students.  Some of the poorest secondary level students, and those orphaned are provided with the opportunity to attend boarding school and further their education.  This is an ongoing program year to year.  We increased the number of students we are sponsoring from 7 to 16 in the Ngong area a suburb of Nairobi.   With the increase of our donor dollars in Feb. 2016 our organization was invited to meet with a rural Maasai community in the border town of Loitokitok, adjacent to Mt. Kiliminjaro and Amboseli National Park.  HFLW chose to assist the five year old school with operating, and recreational supplies.  At the same time while here we introduced our Education 2016-Leaving Poverty Behind program to the community and was able to sign 9 students.  Our total students enrolled in our program is now 25.  Continuing in 2016/2017 plans have been made to build and support a new Pre-School in Kibiko, Ngong Kenya.  The land has been donated, architectural plans drawn but to begin construction we must now find the funding to raise the new buildings!   Please consider donating to this project for the future opening in January of 2017.	Students gain an education to alleviate poverty.	Last year, 2015/2016 we specifically helped with education fees for our 7 students enrolled in our Education 2016-Leaving poverty behind program, then added an additional 9 new students in the Ngong area.  With 2 students graduating we were able to secure them employment while waiting to attend higher ed.  Next we took on a Maasai rural school assisting with much needed supplies to operate properly, and added 9 new students from their community in Loitokitok.	Kenya, Africa	Full and partial Sponsorship for children in primary and secondary level of education.  We work with students at the University level, and those pursuing trade school education.   We provide opportunities to receive career goal guidance, workshops in job search and employment, and computer classes.  Each year students attend self esteem building & motivational workshops.   Last but not least we also fund raise so that we may have a Scholarship Program to help students in the US when they choose to attend college seeking career goals in the humanitarian sciences.

There are those who because of neglect and/or abuse arrive in dire need of care.  Some arrive ill.  Others are sold for almost no value at livestock auctions. There are many ways to describe "unwanted"!  Some are very much loved and cared for by their families.  (It is a family's life-changing event - like serious illness, or loss of job or home - that creates the need for safe placement.)  There are a number who lived in the wild until rounded up.  (A few arrived here pregnant, so their babies were born at the sanctuary.)  The mix includes former athletes (racehorses and veterans of equine competitions), riding horses, and horses that are untrained or never ridden.  Being older or having conditions that prevent them from being "usable" for riding may devalue their worth in others' eyes, but they are all loved and respected at Hacienda de los Milagros.	The number of direct beneficiaries (the animals) per year varies.  For many of our residents, HDLM is their forever home.  An animal may be adopted or pass on during the year.  New residents join the sanctuary as funding and space allow.  Needless to say, HDLM is generally a full house!  Current Residents (as of 1/12/2012) = 139 animals.  These include 127 equines:  30 horses, 89 burros, seven (7) mules & hinnies, and one (1) pony!  We also care for two (2) senior dogs and feline residents that include seven (7) feral barn cats and three (3) house/barn cats.		Visiting Hacienda de los Milagros is an experience!  We know that the animal residents truly enjoy it and we frequently hear from visitors that they are changed by the visit in unexpected ways.  People come from all over Arizona and from out of state.  The sanctuary has fans and regular visitors who know many of the residents by name.  If you are an individual or family interested in meeting the residents or someone interested in bringing a small or large group, we would love to hear from you!

On march 1 2015 we leased another 1100 square foot space from orchard square properties and opened another thrift store to sell mainly larger furniture and employ 4 more workers during the eight hour work day. We also added client/workers to the weekend shifts. This enabled us to add more people with disabilities to our supported employment workforce. In total between the thrift stores, snack shops and laser options we went from serving 39 clients to 47. Because we provide transportation to a large portion of clients, we purchased two used dodge caravans and one dodge stratus sedan. We did not receive the transportation grant we applied for this year from the city of phoenix so we will have to absorb all the transportation costs for the coming fiscal year.

Humane Society Of Southern Arizona	http://www.hssaz.org	(520) 327-6088	EIN 86-0112798	3450 N Kelvin Blvd	Tucson	AZ	85716	USA	Animal Protection & Welfare,Animals	Hssa is a nonprofit organization dedicated to the general welfare, sheltering and placement of animals; prevention of cruelty to animals and animal overpopulation; education concerning humane treatment of animals; and involvement in other animal welfare issues.					Shelter operations: receiving and adoptions as the trend has held steady for the last several years, approximately 32,000 pets in the tucson metropolitan area were homeless. The humane society of southern arizona accepted 7,308 stray and owner release pets. Our lost and found program helped reunite 313 pets to their owners and 6,001 found homes through our placement model. Our foster care program placed 1,777 pets throughout the year. Our live release rate (adoptable animals who found homes) in fye 14 was 96. 3%, the highest of any organization within arizona. This was an increase from last year's live release rate of 90. 5% offsite the humane society of southern arizona has had continued great success with its offsite adoption model of petsmart locations, retail and adoption centers at two local malls, and multiple community special events. Hssa opened the first retail and adoption center, pawsh, in 2009 at a central tucson mall. In july 2010 a second retail and adoption center opened up in an upscale mall on the central north side. The hssa retail stores carry a variety of merchandise for the new adopter and casual shopper. In fye 14, 1,704 cats, 1,070 dogs and 85 other animals (guinea pigs, rabbits, etc. ) were adopted into new homes from the offsite locations, 46. 2% of the total organization's adoptions (up from 39. 7% prior fiscal year).  humane education and cruelty prevention: the humane society of southern arizona's humane education programs give people of all ages and backgrounds the tools to make informed decisions about the appropriate care and treatment of animals. In fye 14 our humane education program reached approximately 3450 children through educational presentations and approximately 6000 more through our attendance of numerous community outreach fairs and festivals. -115 educational presentations to school and youth groups which include hssa shelter tours and community service presentations for children grades 3-12. -24 full days of camp for children between 6-14 years of age -5 animal cruelty education classes for adults -15 onsite hand-in-paw kids club events for children 6-14 years old -5 pet first aid classes -8 adult and child fairs/booths at local festivals and fairs for children, adults and families - such as educational booths at the ted walter day at old tucson studios, tucson festival of books, u of a children's festival, cox movie nights, bear essentials camp fair, and u of a bookstore children's story time, school based literacy programs, and more. Cruelty prevention programs were broadly employed by the humane society of southern arizona to address acts of violence or neglect directed toward animals. We have one part-time staff dedicated to animal cruelty investigations and who assists as a resource for all enforcement agencies in southern arizona (and frequently used as a resource from agencies throughout the state). This included field investigations; animal rescues of all sizes and descriptions; evidence gathering, the coordination of emergency medical services for animal victims and directing all cruelty complaints from the public to the appropriate agency for follow up investigation. He is also responsible for assisting with the formation of the metropolitan phoenix area animal cruelty task force, also known as apact. He has provided various trainings for investigators from different enforcement agencies throughout the country, including crime scene investigations. These organizations included arizona association of court reporters, law enforcement agencies in in cochise county, university of arizona law school, the animal law club at the university of arizona and training in florida to veterinarians from throughout the united states and several foreign countries.  spay and neuter clinic: the most direct way to prevent the homelessness and suffering of the pets in our community is to prevent pet overpopulation. The humane society of southern arizona's spay and neuter clinic performs low cost and grant funded spay and neuter surgeries for the public and rescue groups in southern arizona, as well as spay and neuter surgeries, special surgeries - some of which are life-saving - for hssa sheltered animals. In fye 13/14, veterinarians at hssa performed a total of 5,426 cat spay/neuter surgeries, 5,111 dog spay/neuter surgeries, along with 863 other surgical procedures for a total of 11,400 surgeries. The total number of pets seen for preventative services such as vaccinations, fiv/felv and heartworm testing rose to 15,805 (including shelter pets), a 30% increase over the previous fiscal year total of 12,135. This increase directly correlates to the overall live release number for hssa shelter pets. Vaccine clinics: we provided low-cost vaccinations to pets in our community through on-site and off-site vaccination clinics. We provided 22,837 vaccinations at our walk-in vaccination clinics and at time of spay/neuter surgery (including hssa pets being placed for adoption). In an effort of community outreach to address the increasing numbers of dogs infected with, and dying from, canine distemper, hssa held a series of 2 offsite vaccination clinics offering free distemper parvo vaccinations to the southern arizona community. In addition to the offsite clinics, all dogs who attended hssa campus clinics received free distemper parvo vaccinations through the month of june. Public service announcements as well as media spots highlighted the prevention aspect of pet vaccination to protect dogs, particularly puppies, from this fatal disease. Nearly 1,000 dogs benefitted from this unprecedented effort during the month of june. Trap, neuter, return: tnr for feral cats has become a large focus of the hssa's spay/neuter clinic's overall response to prevention of overpopulation. Feral cat surgeries were up 11. 75% for fiscal year 14 - nearly 34% of cat surgeries were feral cats. The humane society of southern arizona has historically been the only clinic to provide low cost and funded feral cat surgeries with no appointment or restrictions to the number of cats brought in daily by local colony care-givers and residents of the community. In-patient services: the hssa clinic provides critical and acute care for shelter pets who require special surgeries such as amputations, enucleations, or special treatments such as iv fluids, blood testing, cytology, etc. These special services enable shelter pets to recover from injuries or medical issues and have the opportunity for a second chance and a forever home.

We offer birds a stable and loving home for the duration of their natural lives. We do not sell or breed birds. We do not offer birds for adoption. Many of The Oasis birds come from other rehabilitation and/or adoption programs where qualified personnel determined it was not in the bird's best interets to be placed in private homes. Some of our birds have "special needs", are physically handicapped or challenged requiring unique living or feeding situations. Several have been bounced from home to home, often being physically and/or emotionally abused and have simply become too fearful of people to be companions to people any longer.  A number of The Oasis birds are "retired" breeders, or other birds originally imported for production purposes, which, due to age, infirmity or temperament often would be facing euthanasia.Because many of our birds are not interested in or are incapable of human interaction, they are housed with the same or similar, compatible species in non-breeding pairs or small flocks in large outdoor flights.					Provide permanent sanctuary, placement, and care to companion birds for whom no other options exist. We offered 147 birds a forever home in 2014. With natural attrition of our population, we currently care for 790 parrots.

The Arizona Animal Welfare League & SPCA (AAWL & SPCA) is the largest and oldest no-kill shelter in Arizona. We are a no-kill shelter in that we do not euthanize animals except for the rare occasions when it is in the best interest of the animal to do so, usually from untreatable medical conditions. AAWL & SPCA is a registered 501c3 non-profit organization, tax ID 23-7149453. All donations are tax deductible to the extent allowable by law. AAWL & SPCA rescues, rehabilitates and re-homes more than 5,000 dogs and cats that are abandoned or that have been surrendered by their owners. We do this primarily by rescuing them from other shelters in Maricopa County where they are likely to be euthanized due to the lack of time and resources to care for them. At any one time our shelter will hold 140 cats and 190 dogs. We also have a foster parent network of approximately 90 families who provide care and shelter in their homes for puppies and kittens that are too young to be adopted, and those animals that are recovering from medical procedures or that need socialization before adoption. All pets offered for adoption have been spayed or neutered; micro-chipped and are current on all vaccinations. Any medical treatments needed, including surgeries, are provided by our medical team and all animals are evaluated by our behavior department. Learn more about our Phoenix veterinary services and animal clinic.   AAWL & SPCA not only adopts companion animals into loving homes, we also hold a leadership position in the community in education and animal welfare issues. Please review our Education section to learn about all of our programs (including our school holiday and summer camps) and don't miss our extensive dog and obedience training classes. Background The Arizona Animal Welfare League (AAWL) was founded in 1971 by a group of concerned animal lovers. This group was led by Amanda Blake, best known as "Miss Kitty" on the television program, Gunsmoke. Starting out on a small scale, concerned volunteers adopted rescued cats and dogs from foster homes. In the late 1970s, the organization built its first shelter. By the mid 1990s, the AAWL & SPCA began rescuing animals scheduled to be euthanized by the County, and, after rehabilitation, made them available for adoption to the community. Over the past 42 years the organization has grown from adopting a handful of animals each year to a full service animal welfare organization and leader in innovative behavior training, medical care, adoption, education and community outreach programs. Today our shelter has an onsite veterinary clinic, kennels with a separate cattery, a training center and a freestanding infirmary. In 2005, the Arizona Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) merged into AAWL. The new organization was renamed the Arizona Animal Welfare League & SPCA (AAWL & SPCA).

The program worked well in being able to coordinate the services between screening, counseling, education in behavioral health, and the physicians in the agency's primary healthcare clinic when they tested positive for hepatitis c and needed follow up medical care. This program highlights the importance for coordinated treatment efforts in order to receive the best whole health outcomes for members. In serving a diverse community with diverse needs, valle del sol clinically and culturally competent staff continued to provide outstanding quality of services. Medical assistants were hired to serve behavioral health members by integrating the total health approach. This integration of services provided a continuum of care that bridged the gap many members previously faced in trying to coordinate their healthcare needs. Several staff completed their bachelor or associate degrees, which allowed them to expand their scope of services. In addition, a number of staff received their independent license in social work or counseling. With this license, they were able to train and supervise new counselors seeking licensure status. The increase in independent licensed staff also helped expand behavioral health services through additional insurance panels in order to give more individuals in the community access to services. In several audits conducted by funders to ensure quality services, the adult services program received scores above 90 percent, which were above the established thresholds of 85 percent. In an audit conducted for adult behavioral health services, the agency received a record high score off 99. 13 percent. These scores are a reflection of the adult services team of dedicated culturally competent and experienced professionals. An adult services functional improvement assessment was conducted with 1,311 members. Based on global assessment of functioning diagnosis, 75. 3 percent felt they were improving or stable.  building on the theme of "inspiring, engaged, responsible leaders statewide", valle del sol continued to raise the bar for excellence in its six hispanic leader's development programs. Recruiting emerging leaders from communities such as yuma county, pinal county and tucson, the hispanic leadership institute (hli) continued to build the next generation of latino leaders. Hli continues to be an incubator for a new generation of leaders who graduate with improved critical thinking, networking and advocacy skills. With more than 1,000 graduates, valle del sol's hispanic leadership institute is truly the premier latino leadership development program in arizona.

True stories - Mission Accomplished       Dear Barbara, my husband and I attended one of your conferences a few years ago shortly after my sister in Los Angeles had been diagnosed with multiple myeloma.  It was the best thing we could have done.  It was very informative and so well organized.  We sat with a group of women during lunch whom shared their experiences with multiple myeloma and from them we learned who their doctors were.  We passed this information on to my sister; she then made an appointment with one of those doctors (at Mayo) for a consultation.  As a result she was more able to make a decision about her treatment.  Thanks to you also, she continues to be doing well, feeling well.  Just want to let you know we are happy that we attended your conference and wanted to share this with you.  Sincerely, Doris March 2016         A new patient, who heard me (Barbara Kavanagh) speak on Fred Taylor's Radio program, never attended a myeloma meeting. He was so excited at the conference to meet other patients and the wonderful faculty.

Furever Friends Rescue is a 501(c)(3) corporation that has been designed to answer this question.  As a result we are helping to reduce the number of intakes and euthanasia in Maricopa and Pinal Counties by helping people with life changing circumstances find new homes for their beloved pets.   Individuals facing assisted living, nursing homes, hospice or those dealing with the death of a loved one now have an option:  to relinquish their pets to us directly where they will be put up for adoption bypassing public intake.  When space permits we take animals from public intake facilities to help reduce the number of animals euthanized.	We received our non-profit status on Feb 1, 2012 and since that time we have taken in over 835 animals and adopted out over 773.  Each of these dogs or cats have been vetted which means they are spayed/neutered, up-to-date on their vaccines and our cats have tested negative for feline leukemia and feline immunodeficiency virus.  We will also take dogs and cats directly off the euthanasia list at the County facility when we have space and don't have enough animals that meet our stated mission.	Our target demographic is anyone wanting a pet and anyone who needs to relinquish a pet due to issues of illness or aging.	The individuals who must part with their pets are direct beneficiaries as are the people who adopt those relinquished pets.	We are currently operating in the state of Arizona but believe that our mission is one that would resonate nationally.	All of the animals we take in are spayed/neutered either by us or the owner which helps to lower the number of unwanted pets in the area.  The financial burden of this falls upon the rescue and the veterinary bills are paid from the adoption fees charged.

Gabriel's Angels	https://www.gabrielsangels.org/	602-266-0875	EIN 86-0991198	727 East Bethany Home Road Suite C100	Phoenix	AZ	85014	USA		Gabriel's Angels mission is to deliver healing pet therapy to at-risk children, nurturing their emotional development and enhancing the quality of their lives forever.		Gabriels Angels serves children from infant to 18 years old residing in crisis nurseries, domestic violence shelters, homeless shelters, group homes for teens and residential treatment centers.  We serve all children equally without regard to gender, ethnicity, income level or other factors.  Gabriels Angels estimates that 35.5% are Hispanic, 31.7% Caucasian, 21.6% African-American, 7.8% Native American, 2.7% mixed ethnicity, and 0.4% Asian or Pacific Islander.  Although we are not provided with family economic information from our partnering agencies, we believe that most would be classified as low to extremely low income.  Arizona statistics on children residing in foster care indicate the average reimbursement per child per year is $13,334. We also know that nearly one in five (21%) of Arizonas children live in poverty with 10% of those living in extreme poverty. Sadly, issues of abuse and neglect often accompany this socio-economic factor.	14,600	Arizona - Maricopa, Pima, Pinal, Cochise and Yavapai Counties	In order for Gabriels Angels to provide services, it is vital to have trained therapy teams.  Therapy Teams are volunteers consisting of a handler and pet.  Therapy Teams must first complete an evaluation, conducted by an independent agency, the Delta Society or Therapy Dogs, Inc.  To successfully complete the registration process, the animals must pass a health examination and provide proof that inoculations are current.  Finally, the Team must pass two evaluations; one that assesses the handlers control over their pet and one that assesses the animals temperament and obedience skills.  Gabriels Angels supports our potential volunteer Teams through this process, but is not involved in their training, evaluation, or registration.  Once the Team passes the evaluation they are registered with the Delta Society or Therapy Dogs, Inc.  All fees are paid by the volunteer.  Teams complete this process prior to being accepted as a Gabriels Angels Pet Therapy Team.    Before a team is assigned to a partner facility, the handler must clear an FBI fingerprint/background check, provide verifiable references, and attend Gabriels Angels Orientation/New Team Training.  In this training, volunteers are informed of polices and procedures, plus are coached on the particular behaviors of the age group with which they will be working.  Since all of our Teams work with children who are in crisis, it is necessary to prepare them for what they will experience.  The Therapy Team is then assigned to a partner agency.  This placement is dependent on the request from the facility, availability of the volunteer Team, personality of the owner and the personality of the Therapy Dog.  As we strive for a permanent placement every time, this matching process is not taken lightly.  The new Team is accompanied by a Gabriels Angels Volunteer Coordinator for the first one or two visits.  Team visitation is typically on a consistent bi-weekly schedule. Bi-weekly visitation seems to match volunteer and pet availability the best. However, Gabriels Angels goal is to provide weekly Pet Therapy visitation at each facility; therefore a minimum of two Teams are needed at each facility to insure weekly visits.  When the Pet Therapy Team visits, dogs are on leash and wear a Gabriels Angels purple vest.  Handlers tell us consistently that donning the vest creates a change in their dogs behavior; they know they are going to work.  Much like an assistive dog for a person with a disability, these dogs truly work with the children, often spending the rest of the day in well-deserved repose.  The therapy visit is relatively unstructured, following a Montessori-based educational belief that children will convey what they need to accomplish during the visit.  For example, children might brush the dogs teeth, allowing children to draw the parallel between this activity and self-care needed to maintain personal good health.  Or, children might observe that the dog is panting, an indicator that a drink of water might be needed.  A water bottle and bowl appear and children are encouraged to provide a drink for the dog.  The children are learning to recognize a need in another and respond positively in filling that need.  Or, as a final example, children are taught how to give a command, such as sit and reward the dog for obeying the command.  How empowering for an abused child to tell a 100 pound dog to sit and be obeyed!  An abused child feels they have no control in their life; working with the therapy dog helps children begin to develop a sense of confidence.  After the team has some field experience, the handler returns for in-depth training for the ACT (Animals and Children Together) Learning Project.  ACT was developed as a result of an independent evaluation of our Pet Therapy visitation effectiveness on impacting the key behaviors needed for abused children to develop socially.  The activities that are engendered in this project help our volunteer Pet Therapy Teams reach children on a deeper level.  Included in the training, which lasts between three and four hours, are modules that help the volunteer understand the emotional effects of child abuse, the core behaviors being impacted, and the important role volunteer teams play.  Volunteer Teams are introduced to and trained on the effective use of over 25 engaging activities they may employ on their visits.    The ACT Program is leveled in an age-appropriate manner.  Noahs Tails is geared towards infants to children age 5; Pennys Pals for 6 to 12 year olds; and Gabes Gang for teenagers. Each ACT activity bag contains an instant camera.  Handlers are trained to catch the children doing something good and snap those photos.  For children who have grown to believe that they can do nothing right, these photos are extremely valuable in providing tangible images that they can and are capable of doing right and well.    In addition to our ACT training, we work closely Social Work schools to offer training to our volunteers on the CPS system and the circumstances to which many of these children have been exposed.  This training helps our volunteers better understand the behaviors and needs of this children as well as the importance of consistent Pet Therapy visits.   Gabriels Angels provides consistent Pet Therapy visits at 107 partner agencies, 83 in Maricopa County and 24 in Tucson.  The average visit lasts anywhere from one to one and one-half hours.  Ideally, the Therapy Team works best with groups of 10 to 12 children.  There is no cost to the participating agency to receive therapy visits for their children.  Partner agencies commit to the visitation schedule and provide assistance in program evaluation.    Clearly, it is vital for Gabriels Angels to recruit, train, reward and retain volunteer Pet Therapy Teams to maintain our current level of service and work towards meeting the additional demand. To accomplish these goals, maintaining service to existing partner agencies and strategically partnering with new agencies, Gabriels Angels has an immediate need for at least 170 additional Pet Therapy Teams statewide. We choose to invest in the development of our volunteer Pet Therapy Teams and are proud that our volunteer to staff ratio is currently 13:1.

The idea came to founder John van Hengel when he was volunteering at St. Vincent de Paul serving dinner to those in need.When a mother stated that soup kitchens and grocery store dumpsters were the only way she could feed her children, the concept of a food bank was born, wherein individuals and companies with excess money and food could deposit it, and those in need could withdraw it. Mr. van Hengel approached his local parish, St. Marys Basilica, with his vision and was given $3,000 and an abandoned building. The idea became a reality, and in gratitude, he named his nonprofit organization St. Marys. Inspired by his accomplishments, cities nationwide began opening food banks to feed those in need.Today, St. Marys Food Bank is one of the largest food banks in the United States. We are proud of the impact it has had on Arizonaand the world.	St. Mary's Food Bank has distributed more than 900 million pounds of food to the hungry of Arizona in its history.

Southwest Shakespeare Company Inc	http://www.swshakespeare.org	(602) 535-1202	EIN 86-0764708	Po Box 30595	Mesa	AZ	85275	USA	Arts & Culture,Theater	Theatre company to educate and entertain through performances of works of classical theatre					Students throughout the state of arizona attend full-length, unedited performances of professional classical theatre at the mesa arts center. The shows focus on opening up shakespeare's plays so that students experience them live, as they were meant to be, instead of by studying dry, lifeless texts. In an effort to reach as many students as possible, ssc provides special weekday matinee performances for each main stage shakespeare play and, in fact, has introduced over 140,000 students to the bard by keeping the admission price low (8 per student) and seeking underwriting for remaining costs from corporations, foundations, and individuals.  students who will be attending our weekday student matinees will have pre-show orientation workshops in their classrooms taught by one of our teaching artists and often accompanied by one of the shows actors. Another type of workshop is the opportunity to discuss the play with the actors and director after seeing it at the mesa arts center (mac) or talkbacks. We also offer backstage tours after the performance. Periodically, special customized workshops not relating to current shows are arranged on a one-by-one basis.  on the second saturday of every main stage shakespeare production, dr. Susan willis, dramaturg of the alabama shakespeare festival and professor at the university of alabama, teaches a daylong seminar on the play we are producing. These fun and interesting seminars are open to the public, free to season subscribers and usually full of educators who take what they learn back to their classrooms. Most of them earn 10 recertification hours from their respective school districts. This is yet another means by which we educate our patrons and make shakespeare more accessible.  there are schools and communities that cannot, for a variety of reasons, come to the mesa arts center to see our full-length productions. For these interested parties, we have developed a touring show of no more than 90 minutes that is generally performed by a cadre of eight performers. In addition to the performance itself, these actors often provide a workshop prior or after the performance giving the students more information about shakespeare, his life and times. Every season southwest shakespeare company produces a professional season of at least five classical plays for season subscribers and the general public that includes three to four works of william shakespeare and/or one to two works selected from the classical repertoire. These productions are produced using the finest local and regional artists and designers, augmented by nationally-respected professionals from around the country. Only the highest of standards are aspired to in these productions, in sets, lights, costumes, and other production values. Our company was named by get out magazine as best theatre in phoenix for 2005-6, and has received numerous arizoni theatre awards for excellence, including five best production of the year awards, and numerous "best actor" awards. These productions are produced under a lort-d letter of agreement with actors equity association.

Box 64877	Tucson	AZ	85728	USA		To assist and promote research-based, community-driven, sustainable development throughout the tohono o'odham nation.					Summer program: this program serves to engage youth in productive activities throughout the summer break. Prior to the existence of naaf the local residents of gu vo had already put in place a set of childcare programs to engage the youth in productive activities throughout the summer break. Naaf has built on that idea and expanded this service to incorporate children from the four communities in our educational, cultural, and fitness activities. This is a service to the parents as well, since it is not unusual to see them asking neighbors and friends to watch over their children. The program runs the entire months of june and july. Our classroom activities include math, english, stem activities, educational field trips around arizona, and o'odham classes. We also provide an arts & crafts session followed by physical education at the local health o'odham promotion program (h. O. P. P. ) facility. Our volunteers have received cpr training, which allows us to cover for the h. O. P. P. Manager in case of emergency.  virtual learning center: the high school drop out rate is among the highest in the district of gu vo for the tohono o'odham and for the nation as a whole. One of the barriers to education is the remote location of the communities. Naaf partnered with sunnyside unified school district in tucson and brought a virtual learning center (vlc) to the district. This vlc is a van that serves as a wi-fi hotspot. The van is outfitted with laptops and travels between the four villages, bringing education directly to the youth and communities. Youth who have dropped out of school are able to be re-engaged in a learning environment and register for online classes through an e2020 program. This program serves as a tool in educating the nation's most at-risk youth. Additionally, the vlc laptops are equipped with tutoring programs and academic support services. A subsection of the vlc is our early childhood reading program, tohono a'al. Through the vlc, children up to the age of five get ahead of the class through reading lessons before formal schooling even begins. The monitors of the vlc have been trained to assist users with these online tools. During the weekends, the vlc is also available to young adults who would like to work on obtaining their g. E. D.  the ged program was an initiative developed by the tohono o'odham department of education together with both the onestop and vocational rehabilitation programs based in sells. These programs seek to return people to the workforce by providing the qualifications they need to succeed in their jobs. Lack of permanent employment is a source of livelihood instability and over the last forty years the economy on the reservation has shifted towards employment in service sectors, particularly in public and tribal employment. Today service-sector employment accounts for more than half of all permanent jobs in the reservation and require a high school diploma or equivalent. Naaf was responsible for organizing the classes in gu vo, for obtaining approval from district council, and for providing a math and science instructor for the summer semester. Naaf staff was also vital in terms of promotion and advertisement of the program.  gu vo youth academic after-school program:community members and tutors from the district develop and manage the after-school program, which includes extracurricular activities designed to keep students scholastically engaged as well as physically fit. Students begin each daily session with study hour where instructors provide tutoring in reading, math, science, and even the study of computer programming and robotics. Stem activities take place every-other session. Arts and crafts classes are also part of the curriculum including painting, sewing, ceramics, and beading skills that are incorporated into the making of traditional tohono o'odham clothing, medicine pouches, jewelry, pottery, and holiday handicrafts such as cascarones. Also offered will be instruction in dance, pottery, cooking, language, and gardening. The idea is to teach students subjects such as math and science but also focus on the history and traditions of the tohono o'odham nation. The healthy o'odham promotion program (hopp) offers fitness clinics and wellness counseling to the students. In september of 2012, hopp was nationally recognized by the american diabetes association for its work towards prevention of diabetes and obesity (the second largest native american tribe, the tohono o'odham has the highest rate of adult onset diabetes in the world, with over 70% of its adult members having the disease).

Worked closely with the save the confluence coalition, a group of local navajo families, to fight the threat of the grand canyon escalade, a proposed resort on navajo land that would include a tramway into the grand canyon to the sacred site of the confluence of the colorado and little colorado rivers.  volunteer program volunteers donated more than 15,500 hours to the trust in 2014. These passionate conservationists traveled from across the united states to restore wildlife habitat, conduct climate change and grazing reform research, and help build renewable energy infrastructure on public lands and in native american communities across the colorado plateau.  north rim ranches 1. Continued to play a leadership role with the innovative research and stewardship partnership using science to support smart land management on the north rim ranches. New 2014 research projects include: --experiments to stop the spread of range-degrading invasive cheat grass -- monitoring baseline populations of birds and bats in vermillion cliffs national monument --restoring springs for wildlife waters and livestock use -- implementing first stages of multi-year study on climate impacts on genetics and evolution on focal vegetation species. 2. Completed a unique climate adaptation plan identifying specific impact areas on the ranches, with implementation to follow in 2015. 3. Planned for expanding our ongoing camera trap/wildlife movement project. Results will help us knit back together critical habitat for mule deer, mountain lions, bighorn sheep, and other animals that need large landscape connectivity.  landscape southeast utah (100) -we are leading a coalition of conservation interests to advance well-reasoned proposals and stand together against foolish schemes in what may be the best opportunity in a generation to protect wildlands in utah as a part of the bishop initiative for eastern utah public lands. We are advocating for new forest wilderness, supporting our partners efforts on new blm wilderness, backing sensible state land trades and working to ensure that climate disaster fuels like oil shale and tar sands remain in the ground for the sake of future generations. -interim administrative protections were realized in the la sal mountains near moab after a four-year effort led by gct to bring the watershed, wildlife, hiking and mountain biking communities together on a joint alternative for non-motorized trails. We reached a compromise that accommodates mountain bike use on some trails and leaves others for non-mechanized use, and the forest service largely adopted our agreement. This model is exportable to other fs areas where trail planning may begin soon. By settling issues over trail use, the politically powerful environmental and biking communities have laid the groundwork for agreement on new wilderness in the mountain range, likely coming as a part of the bishop initiative. -we won a major legal victory with our partners at the southern utah wilderness alliance that overturned large parts of the flawed bush-era richfield blm resource management plan (rmp). The landmark ruling found that blm failed to adequately consider environmental protections, failed to minimize the impacts of designated off road vehicle routes on resources and violated the national historic preservation act by failing to conduct on-the-ground surveys of cultural resources prior to designating off road vehicle routes. Five other rmps in utah are similarly flawed, and must be similarly rectified in the coming years. Canyonlands expansion (101) -we continued our efforts with our campaign partners to protect the greater canyonlands region as a new national monument. We generated new support from local interest groups and gathered footage and interviews for an upcoming short documentary on the history, threats and solutions for the imperiled and globally unique region. The short documentary is intended for the advocacy film festival circuit and three to five accompanying shorts are intended for internet distribution; all are slated for release in late 2014. All will help to raise the profile of the region so that the administration will act to protect greater canyonlands with a new antiquities act national monument by early 2017. Utah county bills (105) -we formed a new network of activists in 2014 in three working groups - wildlands/wilderness, dirty energy and water. We cultivated relationships with the sporting community, recreationists, business owners and community activists. We planned carefully on how best to tackle tricky organizing around polarizing issues in small communities; 2014 will see this effort put more fully in to action. Forest arizona forests (130) -we continued to lead within the four forest restoration initiative, finding agreement around remaining areas of contention, and negotiating formalized agreements, such that the first 1 million acre project can proceed without litigation -we continued to lead the development of an adaptive management plan and multi party monitoring framework for the first 1 million acre project area ut forests 131 -prepared with the wilderness society of a comprehensive sustainable grazing alternative for the grand staircase-escalante national monument scoping process for its first grazing plan environmental impact statement. -prepared a 2013 trust report shows that 99-100% of most types of plant communities in the monument are grazed. -prepared a 2013 report showing that the monument contains almost no functional exclosures to compare with grazed areas. -documentedconcerns for problem-solving meetings with the forest service on 23 individual livestock allotments. -submitted to the forest service of 400 photographs of common livestock-related resource problems for consideration in the upcoming forest service presentation of the same, pursuant to their 2014 initiation of amendment of their 1986 forest plans for grazing. -assembled approximately 300 photos of livestock-free lands by expert photographers for "what our forests could be" ; and a gallery show in salt lake city of 15 of the photos framed. -led five 6-day volunteer trips for over 40 volunteers for (1) assessing boreal toad habitat; (2) assessing beaver habitat; (3) fencing private inholdings as reference areas; (4) re-reading transects in two forest service cattle allotments for final decisions; and (5) training big deal botanists for documenting vegetation conditions in livestock allotments. -supervised four interns for field work: three whitman college interns (23 weeks combined) and a high school intern from a low-income oregon community (6 weeks). -submitted complete alternatives for five forest service grazing and vegetation treatment projects (environmental assessments under the national environmental policy act). -co-chaired the monthly meetings for the 3rd year of a large consensus collaborative process, the monroe mountain working group to develop recommendations for the restoration of aspen (including groundbreaking quantitative browse thresholds to prompt actions if thresholds are not met). -gave five powerpoint presentations on grazing monitoring and decisionmaking for groups in torrey and moab, ut; whitman college; and amazing earthfest (kanab, ut). Restoring beaver 133 -wrote and published a practical guide to living with beaver, with best management practices for resolving human-beaver conflicts -built flow control devices for retention of beaver at a state park, dixie nf, and a private ranch. -responded to 15-20 calls from udwr referrals, private land owners, usgs, division of water rights, blm, ranchers, conservation groups, and others for assistance with beaver conflict resolution, including live trapping, flow control device installation, tree fencing, etc. -live trapped pair of beaver from scofield conflict area, successfully quarantined at a wildlife rehabilitation center, safely transplanted to private ranch on upper range creek in the bookcliffs, in excellent historic beaver habitat area. -organized and led flow control device workshop in moab for udwr, water rights, and private landowners. -presented beaver best management practices ata utah riparian service team meeting, and a cross watershed network conference in new mexico -organized 180- registrant webinar "cheap and cheerful stream restoration - with beaver?

The core of Teen Lifeline is its Peer Counseling Hotline which provides troubled youth throughout Arizona the opportunity to access immediate help from a Peer Counselor 7 days a week, 365 days a year.  Teen Lifeline is the only Peer Counseling Hotline in Arizona and one of only 32 nation-wide.  Each year, Teen Lifeline receives more than 12,000 calls for help from youth ranging in age from 8 to 22.  Calls are answered by Peer Counselors who receive a minimum of 72 hours of training and are supervised at all times by a master's level behavioral health clinician.  The training and staff support allow these volunteers to confidently help other teens resolve problems ranging from school problems and relationship issues to suicide, dating violence, and being a victim of abuse.  By providing a free, confidential service, which is available to address any issues that a teen may be facing, Teen Lifeline helps prevent unresolved problems from leading a youth to consider suicide as an option.  In October 2003, Teen Lifeline received Crisis Intervention Program Certification through the American Association of Suicidology and was the first peer counseling hotline to receive such certification.  One of the core values of AAS is that every citizen has the basic right to necessary assistance in life threatening or other crises. This value reflects the basic philosophy that an active intervention must be done in life threatening situations.  AAS certification assures the community that the services provided by Teen Lifeline adheres to current, nationally recognized best practices standards of care, training and a commitment to quality improvement.	In 2013, Teens Lifeline received 12,757 hotline calls, an increase of 10.3% from 2012. This demonstrates that peer counseling continues to be a critical tool for troubled youth in Arizona. Our Community Education program reached over 36,000 people, providing awareness, education and prevention within the community focusing on various teen issues such as teen suicide, depression and grief. We provided services in 147 schools, 31 community and youth based organizations, 6 corporate business, and 9 conferences. Teen Lifeline has trained 73 new teen volunteers bringing our total to 106 active ten volunteers. All Teen Lifeline Peer Counselors complete the Life Skills Development Program before they can answer any calls.	Youth in Arizona.		State of Arizona.	The peer-to-peer hotline is a 24-hour hotline where teens can call to talk to teens and they can help each other make healthy decisions. Our Life Skills Development program trains the teens to answer the hotline, as well as teaches them skills such as communication, listening and problem-solving (along with other skills) that they will use throughout their lives. Our Community Outreach and Education program teaches teens how to deal with suicide and depression, grief and loss, stress and coping, and bullying. We also have presentations for adults on what to do if you believe a teen is suicidal. Most presentations are free of charge.
