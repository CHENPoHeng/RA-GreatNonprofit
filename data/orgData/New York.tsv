Animal welfare programs: in 2014, world animal protection successfully improved the welfare of millions of animals around the world, in communities, in farming, in disasters, and in the wild. We exposed the suffering of wildlife used for tourist entertainment with our new campaign aimed at keeping wild animals in the wild, educating over 473,000 people on the hidden cruelty behind elephant rides. We also convinced 23 international tour operators to stop offering elephant rides altogether. 2014 saw the completion of our sanctuary for rescued bears in romania, now a permanent home for 81 bears. And we protected 190,000 dogs from the senseless culling triggered by people's fear of rabies, by working with governments, partners and communities to deliver vaccination programs around the world. In 2014, 11 more bears in pakistan were rescued from the "blood sport" of bear baiting, whereby they are trapped, chained, and forced to endure attacks by trained dogs in front of a paying audience. They now live safely at the world animal protection-funded balkasar sanctuary. Seven bear owners have benefited from our alternative livelihood program and are now proud shop owners. They have all signed an agreement to never purchase another bear again. The number of bears used for bear baiting has decreased from 300 bears in 1997, when we began this project, to approximately 40 today. We protected marine animals from the threat of abandoned fishing gear, known as ghost gear, by working with partners to remove over 800 pounds of discarded gear, traps, lines and plastics from hawaii's big island and the new hampshire coastline. 2014 marked the 50th anniversary of world animal protection's work protecting animals caught in disasters. Our relief efforts following the devastation of 2013's typhoon haiyan continued in 2014; we have helped over 70,000 animals in the philippines following that disaster. We achieved critical change for millions of farm animals through our global partnership with nestl, the world's biggest food company. Nestl has committed to work with us to improve the welfare of the farm animals in its supply chain, which means the hundreds of thousands of farms that supply nestl with its dairy, meat, poultry and eggs will have to comply with higher animal welfare standards.

Brf made an incredible first commitment to phase out gestation crates for pigs in favor of more humane group housing over a twelve-year period.

Millions of children in developing countries with unrepaired clefts live in shame, but more importantly, have difficulty eating, breathing and speaking. Cleft repair surgery is simple, and the transformation is immediate. Our sustainable model provides training and funding to empower local doctors in 85+ developing countries to provide 100%-free cleft repair surgery in their communities.  We use the teach a man to fish model focusing on training local doctors to perform cleft repairs in their communities. Those doctors then go on to train other doctors creating a long-term, sustainable system.  Patients see their smile for the first time, parents cry tears of joy, lives and communities are changed forever.  As a result of our efficiency and with the support of our donors and partners around the world, Smile Train has transformed the lives of more than one million children by giving them the power of a smile -- that's roughly 350 surgeries a day and 128,000+ every year.  Join us and change the world one smile at a time.	Since its beginning in 1999 Smile Train has provided more than 1,000,000 free surgeries for children who would otherwise never have received it.	children suffering from cleft lips and palates	127,000+	85+ of the worlds poorest countries	Treatment program: free cleft surgeries - while our cost per surgery varies across the 85+ different countries where we have worked, our contribution per surgery can be as low as $250. This amount reflects the contribution per surgery that we provide our partner hospitals. They also cover a significant portion of each surgery as part of our cost-sharing agreement with our medical partners. Free medical equipment & infrastructure support - for many of our partners, access to safe operating rooms is their biggest barrier. Many struggle with old and inadequate equipment such as anesthesia machines and a lack of other equipment and supplies. Smile train provides financial support that has been used for everything from building new operating rooms to crucial safety equipment such as pulse oximeters and cleft surgical instruments and supplies including scalpels and sutures. All of these investments work to provide a significant number of incremental surgeries, but also result in safer and higher quality outcomes for children in need. Free ancillary treatment - every child with cleft needs more than just surgery. Often they also need orthodontic care and speech therapy. Where these services are available, we do everything we can to make them accessible to our patients. We pay for speech therapy sessions, orthodontic work and much more. Financial aid for poor patients - some of our patients are so malnourished they are not healthy enough to be safely operated on and are provided food for one to two weeks before surgery. Some of our patients are so poor they have no money to get to the hospital or to travel home after surgery. Sometimes they have no shoes and no money for food. We have special programs that give small stipends for these poorest of the poor. These expenses exclude $57,036,544 donated time and services from doctors, nurses, anesthesiologists, organizations, companies, other medical professionals and medical facilities and supplies.   public education program: every year, people in developing countries isolate or abandon their newborn babies because they don't know a cleft is a simple birth defect and not a "curse from god. " thousands of children with clefts are never brought to hospitals for treatment because their parents don't know clefts are treatable. Thousands of people in developing countries come to smile train for information on how to find a good cleft team and how to take care of their newborn babies with clefts. Through direct mail, websites, newspapers, radio, tv, public service announcements, documentaries, public relations, social media, etc. , we raise public awareness about clefts in developing countries and in the united states.   training program: smile train provides free training and education to cleft care professionals around the world. Access to education and training opportunities is critical to smile train's mission of empowering local medical teams to provide safe, high-quality cleft care. Over the past 15 years, we have provided support for more than 1,500 medical conferences and training opportunities to improve cleft treatment in the developing world. Smile train supports hands-on and workshop-based training opportunities to improve the skill level of cleft care professionals in the developing world. Recent initiatives have focused on supporting training programs for cleft care nurses and anesthesiologists, including the development of the smile train safe nursing care saves lives program in africa that has now been scaled and implemented for smile train partners around the world. Smile train is innovative in its approach to provide quality training to medical professionals worldwide. In the developing world, surgeons often do not have access to the latest innovative techniques and updated protocols for cleft surgery. Smile train partners have conducted over one million surgeries worldwide and lacking access to such resources can be a barrier to their continuing education and quality improvement. Smile train recognized this problem and since 1999 has distributed free virtual surgery training materials to 40,000+ medical professionals in 149 countries around the world. Smile train took this technology to the next level and recently released the first open-access, web-based, interactive virtual surgery simulator designed to enhance training for surgeons on how to repair clefts. The simulator links state-of-art surgical resources to the most remote parts of the world, and changes the paradigm of surgical training internationally. The simulator was distributed to 1100+ smile train partner surgeons worldwide. Since the launch of the simulator, smile train confirmed users of the system in more than 90 countries around the world, including places where over half the population lives below the poverty level and where the per capital annual income is less than $500 per year. Through this unique approach smile train has leveraged technology to change the course of medical education while also improving the lives of children born with cleft in the developing world.

These are the school memories that we all tend to vividly remember: good and/or bad. It is not surprising that these kinds of experiences shape learning and development.  However, school climate is larger than any one person's experience. When people work together, a group process emerges that is bigger that any one person's actions. A comprehensive assessment of school climate includes major spheres of school life such as safety, relationships, teaching and learning, and the environment as well as larger organizational patterns (e.g. from fragmented to shared; healthy or unhealthy). How we feel about being in school and these larger group trends shape learning and student development. Peer-reviewed educational research has consistently demonstrated that a positive school climate is associated with academic achievement, effective risk prevention efforts and positive youth development.    * 1 in 10 schools is a drop-out factory, a high school where only 60% of freshmen or fewer make it to senior year.   Measuring school climate reveals areas of risk for dropouts. A positive school climate increases student engagement (how committed a student is to their school), effectively reducing the risk for dropouts and violence.      * Nearly 50% of new teachers leave the profession by the end of their fifth year A democratic, safe and supportive environment (where all voices are honored) helps keep teachers happy  which increases teacher retention  a real problem in many urban schools. NSCC helps schools focus professional development training where it's needed most, so staff are better supported and engaged.      * Almost 30% of youth in the United States are estimated to be involved in bullying as a bully, target of bullying or both Results from NSCCs CSCI (and other research) shows that school climate directly affects academic achievement  when kids feel safe and supported, they perform better in school.      * 50% of the nation's unemployed youth are functionally illiterate, with virtually no prospects of obtaining good jobs A positive school climate is directly linked to improved academic achievement and provides students with the prosocial skills - like flexible problem-solving, teamwork and conflict resolution - that lead to life success.  Together We Can Turn These Statistics Around!  Mission Statement  NSCC's mission is to measure and improve the climate for learning in schools to help children realize their fullest potential as individuals and as engaged members of society. NSCC achieves this through:  * Advocacy and policy * Measurement and research * Educational services  Advocacy and Policy  Advocacy is a central part of NSCCs work through publications, resource development and educational outreach. NSCC also takes a leadership role in consultation and communications efforts to State Departments of Education, national educational organizations, policy makers and concerned citizens, and works closely with the the National School Climate Council, a group of policy and practice leaders.   Measurement and Research  NSCC has developed a research-based school climate survey that can be used as a needs assessment and springboard for school improvement planning. The Comprehensive School Climate Inventory (CSCI) has been used with schools, districts, and networks of charter schools across America and the Ohio Department of Education (ODE). NSCC continues to work with school teams across the country to effectively measure and improve school climate.   Educational Services  NSCC provides comprehensive educational support services to school faculty, staff, administrators and parents, which include: workshops, on-site coaching, and an annual summer institute. Topics include: measuring and improving school climate; breaking the bully-victim-bystander cycle; infusing social, emotional and civic learning into school curriculums; understanding diversity and respect for differences; and many more.

NSCC offers a variety of professional development programs and services to K-12 schools, educators and parent advocate groups		United States	Almost 30% of youth in the US (over 5.7 million) are estimated to be involved in bullying as either a bully, a target of bullying or both. Every seven minutes a child is bullied in the playground -- and 85% of the time there is no intervention. Bully-victim-passive bystander behavior is the most common behavior that undermines feeling safe in schools. It is critical that schools get the support they need to move from a culture of passive bystanders to a culture of upstanders -- community members who notice bully-victim behavior and learn to 'stand up' -- directly or indirectly -- and say "no" to this toxic behavior.BullyBust is NSCC's back-to-school bullying awareness campaign designed to help students "stand up" to bullying and become part of the soultion to end harmful verbal harassment, teasing and violence in our nation's schools. Engaging students and promoting excitement in this programis of utmost importance. Statistics show that cracking down on individual bullies is seldom effective, but a school-wide commitment to end bullying can reduce the problem by 50%. This past fall, NSCC launched a viral "Stand up to Bullying" YouTube contest within schools nationwide wherein groups of students have been able to sharetheir video messages, stories and words of support. The school prompting the best video will win a special symposium dedicated to bullying awareness.			
AVODAH The Jewish Service Corps Inc	http://www.avodah.net	212-545-7759	EIN 13-3914342	45 West 36th Street 8th Floor	New York	NY	10018	USA	Community Service Clubs, Judaism, Philanthropy, Public & Societal Benefit, Religion, Voluntarism Promotion	AVODAH: The Jewish Service Corps engages young people in direct work on the causes and effects of poverty in the United States. Participants in our service Corps program live out and deepen their commitments to social change and Jewish life through a year of full-time work at anti-poverty organizations in Chicago, New Orleans, New York, and Washington, DC. This work partners Corps members with service providers and residents in low income communities and equips our Corps members and alumni to emerge as lifelong agents for social change, whose work for justice is rooted in and nourished by Jewish values. After participants complete this intensive one-year program, AVODAHs partnership with American Jewish World Service provides a broad platform for long-term leadership in social change and Jewish life.				United States	See schedule ofounded in new york city in 1998, avodah is training the next generation of jewish leaders through its service corps, which places post-college young adults (ages 2126) in a year of full-time service at antipoverty organizations. During the year, corps members live together in an intentional community and participate in weekly educational programs designed to give them the skills and networks to prepare them to become leaders. Over the past sixteen years, avodah corps members across four cities (new york, chicago, new orleans and washington, dc) have directly improved the lives of 533,000 individuals and added an estimated $13 million in staffing capacity to 150 local antipoverty organizations. "avodah" in hebrew means "work" or "service", and the combined meaning can be understood as one's "life's work". Avodah's service corps program has led participants to a sustained commitment to working for justice. A recent survey, facilitated by outside evaluators, about how the program influenced the trajectory of participants' lives found that: - 75% (3 out of 4) say that their current job involves antipoverty or social justice work; - 92% say avodah set them on their current professional path; and - 85% say that avodah helped them find their place in the jewish community. There are close to 700 alumni living across the united states and other parts of the world and they have assumed leadership roles across the jewish and nonprofit communities - as professionals, lay leaders, clergy, organizers, activists and volunteers. Avodah alumni receive advanced leadership training, networking opportunities, and support to foster their development as jewish leaders. In addition to the program's transformative impact on participants, avodah also makes significant contributions to its nonprofit placement agencies and to the low-income communities it serves. As local antipoverty organizations face increased demand for services coupled with declining funding, avodah's high-quality, cost-effective staffing model offers agencies a real solution. In their placements, avodah corps members build the capacity of avodah's partner agencies to directly address many of the issues faced by poor communities, including limited access to healthcare, housing, food security, and educational opportunities. Avodah's partner agencies consistently report being able to offer their clients new and expanded services as a direct result of having an avodah corps member on staff. In 2012, approaching its 15th year and 500th service corps member, avodah began to ask how it could extend its impact and scale even further, and longer term, create organizational and financial efficiencies. To this end, in january 2014 avodah launched the avodah fellowship (the "fellowship"), a new leadership development program for professionals early in their careers working to address the causes and effects of poverty. Based on a curriculum grounded in jewish thought and learning, the fellowship provides mentorship, training, community, and networking opportunities to support emerging jewish professionals engaged in the antipoverty field, while integrating participants into avodah's extensive alumni network of social justice leaders throughout the country. To date, the fellowship has engaged over 35 individuals in 2 cohorts and has exceeded avodah's expectations. Evaluations completed by the first cohort include: - 100% reported a deepened understanding of how social activism and jewish life intersect. - 95% reported that the fellowship strengthened their connection to jewish values. - 95% reported that the fellowship strengthened their connection to jewish identity. - 82% reported better understanding the causes and effects of poverty. - 94% reported sustained/strengthened commitment to do work on economic and social justice.

Many of the participants had never performed in an opera before, and some did not have previous vocal training and/or could not read music. We successfully prepared each artist for performance, and many of the artists in turn invited their network of friends and family to the performance, resulting in a packed audience, many who were experiencing opera for the very first time.  We also target and work with Manhattan Valley residents and seniors specifically, and Harlem area residents who are interested in learning about the history and contributions of African-American opera singers and musicians.

Equal Justice USA Inc	http://ejusa.org	718-801-8940	EIN 26-1316408	81 Prospect St	Brooklyn	NY	11201	USA	Civil Liberties, Civil Rights	Equal Justice USA (EJUSA) is a national organization working to transform the justice system to one that heals and restores lives. Our work includes ending the death penalty, strengthening programs that help crime survivors address trauma and rebuild their lives, and promoting trauma-informed responses to violence that can save lives and help heal communities.	We are best known for 20 years of advocacy on the death penalty, during which we ended the death penalty in six states together with our state partners, organizing around some of the most egregious acts of violence addressed by our justice system. That work exposed us to the extensive trauma experienced across the system and shaped our analysis about the futility of asking a traumatizing justice system to carry out such essential functions as healing and community safety in the aftermath of violence. We worked with survivors who taught us about the unique trauma of losing a loved one to homicide, the extreme lack of services, and the ways that the justice system failed them. We worked with former wardens who carried out executions and taught us about the secondary trauma to corrections officers who are asked to do impossible jobs under the harshest conditions. Most importantly, capital cases uniquely must include a full life history of the defendant, so people on death row provide incredible case studies of the background of those who commit the most heinous crimes. Unsurprisingly, so many of them have a mountain of unimaginable, unaddressed trauma in their pasts.   The common thread of trauma among all of these actors  those inside the system and those impacted by it on both sides  presented a roadmap for future solutions in the justice system. In 2008 we began the process of expanding our vision and programs to make those solutions a reality.			National	We run three programs: (1) a campaign to end the death penalty, for which we are best known (2) a project to bring racial equity to victim services by helping groups that support crime survivors in communities of color to gain access to new resources and expand their reach, and (3) a Trauma Advocacy Initiative, which promotes a transformed vision for a justice system that is both trauma-responsive and restorative through local collaborative work with public health and criminal justice systems as well as national communications on a public health approach to the justice system.

Since the 1950s the Society has been known as Lollypop Farm, its name coming from the then popular Shirley Temple song  On the Good Ship Lollipop.    Lollypop Farm is committed to building lifelong bonds between people and animals through education, community outreach programs and the prevention of cruelty.  We envision a time when our community celebrates the human-animal bond; embraces the mutual benefits therein; and treats all fellow beings with care, compassion and respect.				Greater Rochester and five surrounding counties	As an open-admission animal shelter, lollypop farm accepts every animal who is brought to our facility; no animal is denied admission for any reason. Last year, over 8,400 animals from dogs and cats to rabbits, birds, horses, goats, pigs and more were surrendered or admitted to our shelter. While these animals are with us, our staff and volunteers strive to provide the highest quality care and enrichment. Our modern facility and meticulous standard operating procedures ensure cleanliness and minimize the spread of illness. Additionally, we provide high-quality food to all animals, while daily enrichment and training helps keep them mentally fit while in our care. To find permanent, loving homes for these pets, lollypop farm strives to provide an adoption experience that considers important details for finding the right fit for each adopter, such as a person's home, interests and lifestle. We then match those with an animal's social, exercise, and training needs. Our adoption counselors will work with prospective families to ensure happy, successful adoptions that last a lifetime.   our veterinary clinic evaluates and vaccinates all animals surrendered by their owners, seized from cruel or neglectful conditions or transferred from other animal welfare agencies. This important work is performed by a staff of three veterinarians, six veterinary technicians, and four veterinary assistants. Beyond basic care, animals are treated for common conditions and rare ones as well including skin problems, eye injuries, digestive issues, and lameness. Lollypop farm continues to combat pet overpopulation by spaying and neutering all dogs, cats and rabbits before adoption.   programs at lollypop farm help to address the issues in our community that contribute to pet overpopulation and the surrender of unwanted animals. Annually, lollypop farm reaches over 150,000 people in the community. S. N. I. P. (spay neuter incentive program) provides spay and neuter surgery for dogs and cats of income-qualified pet owners in our veterinary clinic. The low-cost service for applicants enables affordable access to veterinary services, and encourages responsible pet ownership. The service also reduces the number of litters surrendered to the shelter. Through our pet assisted therapy (pat) program, volunteers and their trained therapy animals visit facilities around greater rochester. These registered volunteer teams brighten the days of residents of nursing homes, hospitals, children's centers, mental health facilities, and facilities that serve individuals with disabilities. In recognition of the integral role pets play in many of our lives, lollypop farm offers a pet loss support group monthly for those grieving the loss of a beloved pet. The seniors-for-seniors program enables adopters sixty years of age or older to adopt dogs and cats six years of age or older by waiving the adoption fee. Lollypop farm is a proud partner in the pets for patriots program. This program is available to veterans, wounded warriors, and service members of all armed forces. To join, an individual must apply through pets for patriots at www. Petsforpatriots. Org. Once an individual is approved, they receive a membership id and may adopt a qualifying animal at lollypop farm for half the cost of the adoption fee. Lollypop farm's foster care program allows us to save pets who are more easily cared for in a home environment, including animals recovering from illness or injury, orphaned kittens and puppies, and cats and dogs with litters. Lollypop farm offers humane education for people of all ages, teaching people about respect, responsibility and compassion for pets and all living things through tours, scout badge programs, and school break and summer camps. Pet peeves, a completely free service for pet owners, offers advice and support to callers dealing with dog or cat behavior issues. The tips we provide for simple and more complicated pet problems help animals and their humans stay together. During puppy, basic, advanced, and agility classes, dog owners and their pets work together to become better partners. Training classes offer people and their pets a wonderful opportunity to improve their communication skills and prevent future behavior problems through positive, relationship-based methods. As one of the few humane societies nationwide that admits and adopts farm animals, lollypop farm is in a fortunate position to offer these animals a safe, caring environment while they await new homes, while also providing a unique experience to visitors.

The organization initially focused on the production of theater performances in vacant properties along 42nd Street in Manhattan. Durst began fielding many requests from artists asking to use the spaces during off-nights. Recognizing that the lack of affordable studio and presentation space was a great threat to sustaining a diverse, dynamic, and provocative cultural environment in New York City, Dursts vision was to find a way to connect artists and performers with untapped reserves of temporarily vacant commercial real estate.  In response to artists need for space, Durst gained access to other buildings on the same block, creating a strong presence on the block of 42nd Street between 6th Avenue and Broadway. chashama sponsored nearly 700 gallery shows and performances during its first five years.  In 2007, chashama expanded into studio spaces at the Brooklyn Army Terminal, 37th Street in Manhattan, and on 126th Street in West Harlem, and has operated with a strong presence in these neighborhoods ever since. chashama also programs exhibition, gallery, and performance spaces all over New York City, including Queens and the Bronx.  One of the flagship spaces of chashama  when we had many spaces along 42nd street in midtown manhattan. Now is the site of a through-block between the Conde Nast and Bank of America buildings where performances may be put on from our performances program  Since 1995 chashama has supported the work of over 12,000 artists in New York City through subsidized studio space, and free exhibition, rehearsal and performance space. We have brought cultural programming to neighborhoods throughout the five boroughs, including areas where the arts are not already well represented. In 2013 we programmed 150 public events in 21 venues, and supported 130 studio artists. In 2014 we are programming 26 venues, supporting 126 studio artists, and are on track to present a similarly large number of public events.   chashama connects artists with vacant real estate - redistributing the untapped resources available in our urban landscape by partnering with private and public property owners. By structuring a mission around this goal, chashama has become a major force in the NYC arts community by supporting the work of an increasing number of emerging artists every year.	artists	537 artists gain access to free and subsidized gallery, rehearsal and performance space	New York City	affordable work and presentation space.

Through rehabilitation, retraining and ultimately adoption, we make a profound difference in the lives of our own; as well as in those of community groups through education and care of the horses.  Sunshine Horses, Inc. is a non-profit adoption agency and rescue facility for horses located in Syracuse, NY. Founded by Kate Starr in 2003, Sunshine has found loving homes for more than 150 horses.  We specialize in retraining and rehoming retired Standardbred racehorses. However, Sunshine works with all horse breeds and prepares them for their forever homes.  Just as important to our mission of helping horses is our mission of helping people. Sunshine works with many different community organizations and agencies within the Syracuse area. Through youth and adult volunteer programs, we draw upon the strengths each participant brings to Sunshine and seek to provide personal growth and enrichment. Many program participants face unique challenges of their own, and can empathize and bond with our horses in a special way as they help prepare the horse for adoption. Sunshine has well over 150 committed volunteers that give love and care to over 25 horses. Many different breeds make up our Sunshine herd such as former Standardbred and Thoroughbred racehorses, Appaloosas, Warmbloods, Quarter Horses and Paints. Many of the retired Standardbreds come to us because they lacked the desire or skill to be successful on the track. Occasionally they have just become too old to race, or have an injury that prohibits further racing. Along with the off the track Standardbreds some of our horses have been surrendered, as their owners could no longer care for them, while others come from true rescue situations.  Once coming to Sunshine, all of the horses are rehabilitated and/or trained for different equestrian disciplines prior to their being adopted. Many of our horses are used to being driven, and adapt well to light carts and carriages. Others readily learn to accept a saddle and rider. We strive to give each horse the basics so that they may excel in any discipline or new career they might find. We work with them daily and try our best to match each ones unique qualities to the needs of a potential adopter.	Over 200 horses have found forever homes since our founding in 2003 We typically adopt out 20-30 horses each year Over 100 retired harness racehorses (Standardbreds) have been helped since our founding, including many rescued from slaughter At any given time, the total earnings of our horses waiting for forever homes typically exceeds $2 million.

EDUCATION: ETHEL's Foundation supports Native American Composers Apprentice Project (NACAP). Since 2005, ETHEL has been quartet-in-residence at NACAP, a project of the Grand Canyon Music Festival. Every September, ETHEL tours schools on Navajo and Hopi reservations in the Four Corners region to work with young Native American composers. The Foundation helps to support a range of residency activities by ETHEL to inspire and encourage younger musicians. These programs include lectures, workshops, performances and master classes at colleges, music schools and universities. Topics include improvisation, composition, and collaboration.  OUTREACH  ETHEL performs free and affordable concerts throughout the year. In 2009-2010, the quartet is featured at several free concerts in the outer boroughs of New York City as part of the acclaimed Carnegie Hall Neighborhood Concert Series. ETHEL also embraces new technology to expand audiences through initiatives such as ETHEL's Listening Library, an online archive where web visitors can listen to new music for free, increasing the composers' outreach and visibility. Material from the Listening Library will be the core of quarterly online podcasts that will introduce contemporary concert music to an ever-widening audience via the web.

Programs include scholarships for indigent children, improvement of public school facilities, training of teachers, establishment of pre-primary education opportunities, and programs for rural women that incorporate literacy, health education and income generation components.	Over the course of nearly a quarter of a century, ETC's work has benefited at least 15,000 people directly and countless more indirectly. Residents of the areas in which we have worked have benefited from:  (1) Improved public health conditions: ETC has constructed hundreds of sanitary toilets and offered public health training events for thousands of attendees. Chronic diarrhea and other bacterial illnesses are very common, and cause people to miss work and school, but these problems decrease significantly when people have and use sanitary toilets and begin to sanitize their drinking water, wash their hands more frequently, and keep their farm animals separately housed.  (2) Improved nutrition and food security: ETC has helped farmers increase their yields significantly, and learn to grow/raise a wider variety of more nutritious foods.  (3) Improved educational systems: ETC has improved schools both physically and in terms of the quality of education offered. Moreover, teacher job satisfaction and student attendance rates are higher, and student drop-out rates are lower, after ETC has worked in a given school compared to before, and compared to national averages.  (4) Increased household incomes: ETC has helped women gain the skills and confidence to start their own businesses. They also gain status in the community and are more willing and able to speak up for their own rights, advocate for community improvements, and participate actively in their children's educational processes.  A major reason for ETC's success has been that we involve the target population all along, from the planning stages through implementation and evaluation. The residents of our project areas know that their specific needs and situations are being addressed, and they feel a real sense of ownership of the activities and results. This is important for immediate success as well as for long-term sustainability: because the residents are so engaged, the benefits of the work endure long after ETC has left a particular area to begin working in a new set of villages.  In the immediate post-earthquake period, ETC responded quickly to meet villagers'  urgent needs for shelter, and to enable the construction of dozens of temporary classrooms. Looking ahead, ETC will be closely involved in the reconstruction of sturdier school facilities. We will also continue our usual programming - helping women to grow more and better food, and to earn more money, will be even more important than ever before as families seek to rebuild their homes and their lives!	marginalized and impoverished people, especially women and children,	about 2,000 residents of rural Nepali villages	Nepal	(1) Women's empowerment - including literacy training and entrepreneurial training (2) Children's education - including infrastructure improvement, sponsorships to enable impoverished children to attend school, and teacher training (3) Sustainable agricultural development - including provision of supplies and training to help small farmers (mostly women) grow greater quantities of more nutritious food for their families and as an income-generating activity  Please see our photo essays at http://www.etc-nepal.org/publications.php for more information about how ETC helps people to make better lives for themselves and their families.

March of Dimes Foundation	http://www.marchofdimes.com	(914) 428-7100	EIN 13-1846366	1275 Mamaroneck Ave Suite	White Plains	NY	10605	USA	Birth Defects & Genetic Diseases, Health	With the success of the Salk vaccine in the mid 1950s, the March of Dimes turned its focus on birth defects, low birth weight and infant death.  Over the past 68 years, March of Dimes' cutting edge research and innovative programs have saved millions of babies from death or disability.					Research & medical support the march of dimes funds research into the causes of birth defects, premature birth and other threats to babies' health as well as ways to prevent and treat them. The march of dimes consistently throughout its history has selected bold problems from conquering polio to preventing prematurity and has been successful through careful planning and execution to achieve our mission. The march of dimes also has developed partnerships to leverage its efforts together with those of other organizations. Since the start of our national prematurity campaign in 2003, rates of preterm birth have declined for 7 years in a row to 11. 4% and have reached a 16-year low. Since 2006, an estimated 210,000 babies have been spared the consequences of an early birth, and our country has saved at least $11. 9 billion in excess health care costs. We achieved these results through sustained leadership and a variety of partnerships. We opened four march of dimes prematurity research centers, the first one at stanford university in 2011, the second as the ohio collaborative in 2013, and the third and fourth in 2014 at washington university in st. Louis and the university of pennsylvania. These prematurity research centers take a unique team science approach to speeding up discovery of causes and preventions, drawing faculty not only from the medical schools, but from across the campuses, including, for example from schools of engineering. A total of five centers are planned, and the fifth has been approved by our board of trustees, but not yet announced. It will be announced in q2 of 2015. We led the drive to eliminate early elective deliveries before 39 completed weeks of pregnancy. This work includes quality improvement initiatives with over 100 prominent hospitals in 28 states. A peer-reviewed publication, the research for which was supported by and the majority of the authors were from the march of dimes, showed an 83% reduction in early elective deliveries from january through december of the same year among 25 hospitals in five states. This work also includes a national consumer education campaign called healthy babies are worth the wait. The description of the healthy babies are worth the wait pilot in kentucky is in press as volume 1 of the new peer-reviewed march of dimes series with elsevier as the publisher. This shows that there was a reduction in early elective deliveries in kentucky compared with surrounding states, and reviewers were highly complimentary of the march of dimes taking on a research project of this complexity in a "real world setting. " in 2012, the u. S. Dept. Of health and human services built on their approach by launching strong start, an initiative to improve birth outcomes. The leapfrog group, a nonprofit hospital quality watchdog, released results from the 2013 leapfrog hospital survey, which showed the rate of early elective deliveries (non-medically necessary c-sections and inductions before 39 weeks) dropped from 17% in 2010 to 4. 6% in 2013 at nearly 1,000 reporting hospitals. The joint commission has included the reduction of early elective deliveries as one of its five perinatal core measures, which will impact policies at all birthing hospitals in the u. S. Our research advances over the past 75 years are still improving health and saving lives of babies today. Polio once crippled tens of thousands of children, but thanks to vaccines developed with march of dimes support, this disease has been eliminated in most of the world. Newborn screening tests developed with funding from the march of dimes contribute to the detection of the recommended set of 31 serious but treatable disorders and save lives. The march of dimes national folic acid campaign led to fortification of grain products in 1998 with the b vitamin folic acid, and since then our nation has seen a 36 percent reduction in spina bifida, a birth defect of the spinal cord, and a 17 percent reduction in anencephaly, a very serious birth defect of the brain that uniformly results in death. Reducing preterm birth through our partnership with the association of state and territorial health officials (astho), health departments in every state, puerto rico and the district of columbia have set goals of reducing their rates of premature birth by 8 percent by 2014. Using the data from the national center on health statistics (nchs) of the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc), 16 states or territories have achieved their goals of 8% reduction through the 2013 data: alaska, arizona, california, colorado, delaware, district of columbia, indiana, massachusetts, nevada, new hampshire, new york, puerto rico, rhode island, utah, vermont, and wyoming. In 2014, 5 states earned an "a" on the march of dimes premature birth report card: california, maine, new hampshire, oregon and vermont.   public and professional education the march of dimes shares vital health information with the general public, women and professionals through the internet, educational booklets and public service advertising, many of which are provided in both english and spanish. The materials for the public are written in "plain language" and have won numerous awards. All march of dimes educational materials are strongly evidence-based and depend on the peer-reviewed medical and scientific literature, as well as on reliable sources, such as the centers for disease control and prevention, the american academy of pediatrics, the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists, and others. We led the publication of born too soon: the global action report on preterm birth, the first global estimates of premature birth, and recommended prevention and care strategies for the 15 million babies born preterm each year. Our global partners are now pushing forward to bring these lifesaving approaches to countries throughout the world. In 2014, we signed a memorandum of understanding with the international federation of obstetrics and gynecology (figo) to pool activities and resources of the march of dimes with the activities and infrastructure of figo in order to help reduce worldwide the rates of preterm birth. As part of this agreement, march of dimes and figo have contracted with the boston consulting group on a study to understand the drivers of differences in preterm birth across and within countries over time, on the basis of these findings identify opportunities to reduce preterm birth in high-income countries and, subsequently, selected middle-income countries and identify gaps in knowledge and implications for research. We are also working with the march of dimes global network for maternal and infant health in lebanon, malawi and the philippines to improve the health of adolescents and young women before they become pregnant and are planning for the 7th international conference on the prevention of birth defects and disability in the developing world to be held in dar es salaam, tanzania in september. World prematurity day continues to expand around the world, raising awareness about the serious problem of premature birth. Begun as prematurity awareness day in the united states, november 17th is now marked by activities in more than 80 countries with parent groups recruited to lead the efforts in many of these countries. For additional information on the foundation's prematurity campaign, please visit the following websites: http://bit. Ly/1d9inzm and http://bit. Ly/107xcvc  community services march of dimes chapter staff and volunteers invest time and resources in local programs and activities in all 50 states, washington, d. C. , and puerto rico, playing a vital role in improving maternal and child health in their communities, to enhancing and expanding services available to women and their families. Chapter staff and volunteers partner with local health agencies, community-based organizations, professional associations, hospitals, and others to determine the most pressing maternal and child health needs and to develop a multi-year strategic plan that will positively impact the health status of communities. Staff and volunteers then work to enhance and expand community services, and to improve systems of care for mothers, babies, and their families through advocacy, leadership educational programs and community grants. In 2014, march of dimes chapters awarded 554 community grants. Through its community grants and program services, march of dimes aims to: improve the health of mothers and babies through education on healthy pregnancy; prenatal care and other services to reduce the risk of premature birth and other poor birth outcomes; and support for families whose babies need specialized care in the newborn intensive care unit (nicu). Healthy babies are worth the wait community program is a march of dimes chapter-led partnership focused on decreasing preterm birth by improving the quality of health care delivery, increasing access to prevention services, providing education for pregnant women, perinatal providers and the greater community. Program partners work together to integrate clinical and public health interventions that are proven to reduce preterm birth. These interventions include: patient navigation/care coordination, hospital quality improvement to reduce early elective deliveries, group prenatal care, and smoking cessation, prevention of repeat preterm births and infection diagnosis and treatment. The march of dimes offers information and comfort to families experiencing the hospitalization of their baby and provides training for healthcare professionals in newborn intensive care units (nicus) through nicu family support. In 2014, nicu family support programs served over 92,000 families experiencing a nicu stay in 132 hospitals across the united states. Activities provided include parent-to-parent support, print and online education for families and innovative programs for parents, siblings and grandparents - all with the purpose of providing comfort and critical health care messages to families in crisis. To support hospital staff in their role, the program provided professional development trainings and resources for neonatologists, nurses and other clinicians to promote implementation of best practices in family-centered care. Hispanic outreach the increasing number of hispanic women in the united states, coupled with their higher fertility rates and increased risk of adverse birth outcomes, call for greater attention to their preconception, maternal and newborn health needs. To address these needs, the march of dimes offers numerous education and health promotion resources that reach millions of spanish-speaking women and families globally. In 2014, the march of dimes relaunched nacersano. Org, the foundations culturally and linguistically relevant source of maternal and baby health information for spanish-speaking hispanic community at large. The new mobile-ready site features hundreds of health articles, interactive tools, educational videos and other resources, including easy access to social media platforms where health information is also provided. The site reached more than 2. 4 million users in 2014 and had more than 4 million page views. In addition, the nacersano blog (one of the social media platforms) had 3,300 average views per day, a 42 percent increase over 2013 and the highest since its implementation in 2007. Hispanic advisory council the march of dimes created a national hispanic advisory council in 2014. This group of professionals advises the march of dimes on best practices for improving the health of hispanic mothers and babies. It also helps the organization to communicate the mission with the hispanic community for long-term engagement and help improve health outcomes. Pregnancy and newborn health education center since 1997, the pregnancy & newborn health education center (the center) has served women and their families by being the trusted source of accurate, timely information about what women can do to help themselves be healthier, to have a healthy pregnancy and reduce their risk of having a preterm birth. Through the center, march of dimes health experts offer one-on-one health education and support to women and families from around the world, in english and spanish. In 2014, the center answered 19,870 emails in english and spanish on topics ranging from preconception, pregnancy and prematurity to health advocacy, baby care and loss. The center also delivers education through social media platforms. The news moms need blog averages over 1300 daily views. Through daily outreach and monthly chats on the march of dimes twitter accounts; the center engaged over 25 million people with detailed educational content, and answered individual concerns as they arose. Fda and corn masa flour the march of dimes participated in a working group comprised of other health organizations and a company interested in fortifying corn masa flour and its related products (e. G. , tortillas and tortilla chips) with folic acid in the u. S. To prepare a food additive petition to the fda. This petition, which would allow voluntary fortification of corn masa flour with folic acid if approved, was submitted to the fda in april 2012. The march of dimes has since continued to work with the fda to address their concerns and questions regarding aspects of the information submitted in the petition. The march of dimes has funded an additional stability study to examine the levels of folic acid present in fortified corn masa flour and its related products over time. Such data would allow the fda to confirm that the folic acid is present at expected or appreciable levels in corn masa flour and its related products sufficient to achieve the intended effect of reducing neural tube defects in the u. S. This study is expected to be finished by end of 2015. Patient safety and quality the march of dimes is infusing patient safety and quality throughout its mission activities. This involves creating a "culture of safety" in these areas, based on teh features of high reliability organizations and natural accident theory. Nbs culture of safety and awards in november 2013, the milwaukee journal sentinel (mjs) published the first article in a series titled "deadly delays" in newborn screening. This article described death and disability that could have been prevented among babies whose newborn screening tests had been delayed, for example by being closed on weekends and holidays, and "batching" samples in hospitals over multiple days before sending them to the state laboratory. We published an op ed in the mjs one week later and a peer-reviewed commentary in 2014, both calling for a culture of safety in nbs. We convened a newborn screening quality improvement work group to share best practices to improve sample transit times and that group now includes representatives from 16 organizations, such as the american academy of pediatrics, american college of obstetrics and gynecology, american hospital association, association of state and territorial health officials and others. The work group meets 2-3 times per year either in person or by conference call. The march of dimes, in collaboration with the association of state and territorial health officials, began providing awards in 2014 to state health officials for specific policies and practices that improve sample transit times and we have made two awards to date.

The pharmaceutical industry spent $3.8 billion in marketing these medications to doctors and consumers. Do they have short or long term side effects? Are there alternative solutions that may be just as effective with lower risk?  Guided by a passion to educate and encourage patients to pro-actively inquire about the short and long term side effects of prescription medications before accepting them, MedShadow Foundation seeks to prompt discussion between patient and health care provider. This includes asking deeper questions of the physician or pharmacist, looking at the pros and cons of prescription drugs, and if appropriate, exploring other options. We encourage our readers to avoid blind acceptance of prescription drugs and become an engaged advocate in their own health and wellbeing.  In 2014 MedShadow Foundation Inc. acquired DES Action USA, a nonprofit advocacy organization that provides information and educational resources to individuals exposed to the harmful drug diethylstilbestrol (DES). DES Action has been the leading advocacy, education and support organization for all who have been affected by DES exposure since 1979. To find our more information about DES, please visit DESAction.org  MedShadow Foundation uses its website and various social media platforms to gather and post timely articles and news about medical conditions, side effects and alternative therapies. While we recognize that medications save lives and that many are absolutely necessary in treating chronic illness and in managing life-and-death situations, we also know that some are over prescribed and that accurate and complete information on side effects is severely lacking. Long-term effects are not studied before FDA approval. We hope to help fill this information void and encourage patients to do a risk/benefit analysis of the medications they are prescribed.  The MedShadow Foundation team consists of concerned consumers and parents, not medical professionals. Please do not substitute what is said on the MedShadow website for what is advised by your doctor or health care provider, particularly when dealing with serious medical issues.

Fount of Mercy	http://www.fountofmercy.org		EIN 20-8182596	Church St Station PO Box 3379	New York	NY	10008	USA	International, International Development	There are over 48-million orphans in sub-Saharan Africa. These orphans are left with few options. They are either left in the hands of an extended family member, are taken in by the community, or they are unfortunately abandoned on the streets. Poor nutrition, loss of education, vulnerability to crime, child labor, sexual exploitation, abduction and prostitution are realities too many orphans are facing. Traditionally in Africa, children live with an extended family member when their parents die. It is because of this tradition that Africa has been able to handle the orphan crisis with a modicum of survival. Today as the crisis has become increasing overwhelming, the traditional cultural safety net for orphans has persisted but has been greatly stretched and tried. Where extended family adoption is the best means of care, the new mouths to feed financially burden extended families. The combination of extreme poverty and AIDS has made it nearly impossible for the extended family to care for the increasing number of orphaned children. Grandmothers and widows are caring for six to ten children with limited access to any resources. Without assistance from local grass-root organizations these women and children are destitute. Why We Work With Grass-Root CBOs and NGOs?As Africa?s traditional means of orphan care has suffered, local African communities have responded. Africans who are committed to the care of orphans, have stepped in and organized their communities to respond. Through supplementing care, these indigenous grass-root organizations partner with their communities and these overburdened caregivers to provide free to low cost education, feeding programs, vocational training, access to healthcare and in worse cases foster care or residential care. While these grass-root Community-Based Organizations (CBOs) and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) are the lifeline of hope for their communities, they are nevertheless in great need of assistance. In order to meet the full need of their community?s orphan population they need support, encouragement and a helping hand to reach their vision.				Uganda

We also provide funding for research into Carcinoid Cancer and other Neuroendocrine tumors.	Needs Assessment Because neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are rare cancers with no celebrity spokesperson or widespread recognition, patients need to be their own best advocates in bringing the most current information available to their physicians.  As patients, caregivers and the medical community become more up-to-date regarding NETs, quicker diagnoses and more effective treatment of the disease will occur.  Survey data available from previous patient conferences suggests that educating NET cancer patients is one of the best methods of getting the most current data and information into the hands of the medical community. Recently a new patient was diagnosed by a dermatologist because of information passed to him by a NET cancer survivor.  Year after year, attendance at patient conferences demonstrate both the patients need for reliable information and the success that programs like the one proposed herein have met.

Seniors will be greeted by each performer at the beginning of the performance. Each performers mission is not simply to entertain the group, but to form personal bonds and tailor each experience to the taste, history, and emotional temperature of each and every senior in the group.  The singers will Serenade and encourage group participation in singing, clapping, or dancing to the music. Requests can be made as well! A focus on repertoire that is important to the group in a personal way allows for meaningful interaction between performer and senior, a mutual understanding of experiences that can lead to a greater sense of community and joy.  Discussion is always encouraged during the performance as well as time and attention given to the seniors to connect and interact with the performers and musicians after the performance is over. Our hope is that the experience that a group of seniors has on a particular day of the week carries through to the next six days and that, by undergoing a communal experience, internal relationships at the senior center can strengthen and grow. Social, physical, and emotional barriers can begin to break down. Ultimately, the project should foster a sense of hope in both the young and old. It should cultivate an enthusiasm for the future in whomever participates.

Hollaback!	http://ihollaback.org	347-889-5510	EIN 27-3199988	30 Third Avenue #800B c/o YWCA	Brooklyn	NY	11217	USA		Powered by activists around the world, our mission is to make public spaces safer for girls, women, and LGBTQ individuals.	Broken silences. More than 3,000 people have told their stories of harassment through our iPhone app, Droid app, and website, and over two million people have visited our website.  Inspired youth leadership. What started as a New York City-based initiative has spread to, as of December 2011, 48 cities in 15 countries with more sites to be added soon. Our 150 site leaders are young and diverse: 75% are under 30, 50% are under 25, 44% are LGBTQ and 26% are people of color.  Shifted public opinion. In total, Hollaback! received more than 500 media inquiries including the New York Times, the BBC, Washington Post, and NPR. In addition to this, we have 3,700 Twitter followers and 20,000 Facebook fans. When our site leader in Buenos Aires was threatened with rape by a prominent journalist because of her work with Hollaback!, 3,500 people from 75 countries signed an online petition to get him fired. Our efforts resulted in both Fiat and Lacoste pulling their advertising from the magazine, a public apology from the journalist and the editor, and ultimately the forced resignation of the journalist.  Engaged elected officials: On October 28, 2010 the New York City Council held the first-ever in the world hearing on street harassment. Hollaback! coordinated a standing room only group of women and LGBTQ individuals and subsequently fielded more than 200 media queries. This inspired local legislators in New York City to make a $28,500 investment in Hollaback! Enabling us to develop the infrastructure needed to report street harassment incidents to NYCs 311 information system -- truly establishing a powerful nonprofit and government partnership.  In recognition of our early success, Hollaback! has received a number of awards and accolades. The organization was named a finalist in the Green Mountain Coffee Revelation to Action competition and in May of this year, Hollaback!s Executive Director was named one of Womens eNews 21 leaders for the 21st Century. In addition, Hollabacks E.D. received the 40 under 40 award from the New Leadership Council, and the organization was selected as a Top 10 finalist for the Young Nonprofit Leaders of the Year Classy awards. The organization has also been named an Ashoka ChangemakHER joining such social change makers as Melinda Gates and Fran Drescher. Further, when feminist icon Gloria Steinem was asked, What women today inspire you and make you feel that the movement continues? Steinem responded: Emily May of Hollaback! who has empowered women in the street, literally [HBO live chat, 8/16/11].	Women, girls, and teens; women of all ages; women ages 16-22; LGBTQ individuals		global	At the core of our model lies the belief that movements start with people telling their stories  and they succeed with people taking action. Before the Internet age, there was only one mic, one podium, one speaker. But now, thanks to the proliferation of blogging and social media, it is no longer the loudest, wealthiest and most powerful who rule the airwaves: anyone with access to their local librarys internet portal can have a voice. At Hollaback!, we leverage technology to bring voice to an issue that historically has been silenced, and to build leadership within this movement to break the silence.  We work with women, girls, and LGBTQ individuals to document in words and pictures, and to literally indicate on a map, where they experienced harassment in public spaces. Doing this provides a forum for individuals to share their experiences and brings attention to this long-ignored issue.  Inspire international leadership: Much of Hollaback!s power lies in its scalability. To scale effectively, we train young women and LGBTQ leaders throughout the world to use their skills to build a grassroots movement focused on ending street harassment. We train in the application of technology as we also work to ensure that their actions are strategic and high-impact.  Shift public opinion: Our broad-based campaign is designed to reach the public at large by inspiring individuals to take action. We provide educational workshops to schools, universities, and community groups, and engage citizens through traditional and social media.  Engage elected officials: We present collected and mapped data to elected officials and policymakers in areas experiencing high incidences of street harassment and will engage legislators to work with our trained leaders to address street harassment in their communities.

Through their partnership with Indego Africa, women artisans generate income through product sales to meet their families basic needs now and develop job skills that enhance their long-term earning potential.	Currently, Indego Africa partners with over 500 women from across 13 partner cooperatives in Rwanda. Each woman survived unimaginable horrors during the 1994 genocide and has continued to lead a difficult life of poverty and struggle. Many are widows, suffer from HIV/AIDs and/or lingering psychological trauma, lack formal schooling or the means to enroll their children in formal schooling, and have inadequate food security, housing, and healthcare.

This amount often must feed and house their entire family, which includes an average of 5.5 dependents as many care for orphans and elderly relatives in addition to their own children.  Each year, IA conducts a robust annual social impact assessment, which compiles developmental data on our artisan partners that includes both quantitative metrics such as basic demographics, income, education levels, and food security and qualitative indicators such as in-depth self-perception. IAs female artisan partners have seen dramatic improvements in earned income, food security, access to water, access to schooling for themselves and their children, and bank accounts. Highlights from our fifth Social Impact Report include:  	Earned Income: In 2012, 76% of our female artisan partners earned more than $1.00 per day, compared to 7% in 2008.  	Food Security: In 2012, 74% of our female artisan partners reported that their families never ran out of food, compared to 5% in 2008.  	Housing: In 2012, 76% of our female artisan partners owned their homes, compared to 41% in 2008.  	Health Access: In 2012, 81% of our female artisan partners had regular access to medical care, compared to 26% in 2008.	artisan women		Rwanda	Indego Africas economic empowerment model consists of two core components: market access and education.

Developmental Stages: The Fiver children progress through the following four stages during their decade-long tenure, LEARN, TAP, LEAD and SERVE.  LEARN (ages 8-12) participants focus on developing self confidence and broadening their perspective with regard to goals and dreams.  TAP (ages 13-14) participants work on personal and academic preparedness for the journey through high school, the importance of giving back through community service, and lessons learned through team-building initiatives.  LEAD (ages 15-16) participants perform individual and group community service projects, participate in ethical decision-making and wilderness survival classes, develop leadership skills, and focus on college and career preparation.  The SERVE program (ages 17-18) is aimed at assisting with the final years of high school (college applications, financial aid, etc) and with the post-high school transition into college, job training programs, or careers.

Womens Project delivers compelling theater, innovative programs and electric events as the nations oldest and largest company dedicated to producing and promoting theater created by women.  Womens Project Theater, under the direction of Lisa McNulty, Producing Artistic Director, is the nations oldest and largest company dedicated to producing theater written and directed by women, who receive only 20% of the professional opportunities nationwide. Now in its 34th year, it has produced over 600 main stage productions and developmental projects, and published 11 anthologies of plays by women.   Recent off-Broadway productions include Catherine Trieschmanns Crooked, Liz Duffy Adams Or, Rachel Axlers Smudge, Sheila Callaghans Lascivious Something, and Lynn Rosens Apple Cove. In addition, Womens Project Theater develops new work in its Lab, a free two-year residency program for early to mid career playwrights, directors and producers. And each year, it hosts the Women of Achievement Awards, which pays homage to luminaries such as Laurie Anderson, Eve Ensler, Whoopi Goldberg, Estelle Parsons, Vanessa Redgrave, and Chita Rivera, to name but a few.  WomensProject.org				Global	Womens project theater (wp) was founded in 1978 by julia miles to address the significant under-representation of women in theatre and has since built a tremendous legacy. Throughout its 37-year history, wp has produced over 600 off-broadway and workshop productions, and published eleven anthologies of plays. Although even today women playwrights and directors severely lack parity in pay and opportunity with only 20% of professional opportunities being offered to women nationwide, the extraordinary women artists who have broken through the glass ceiling to grace broadway stages, win pulitzer prizes and innumerable other awards, have all first crossed the threshold at wp, including eve ensler, lynn nottage, maria irene fornes, pam mackinnon, suzan-lori parks, sarah ruhl, leigh silverman, paula vogel, and anna deveare smith, to name just a few. Wp accomplishes its mission to produce and promote plays written and directed by women through two fundamental programs. The first is wps main stage production series, which annually features three to four off-broadway productions written and directed by extraordinary women theatre artists. The second program is wps well-established lab, a two-year residency program for women playwrights, directors, and producers. Selected through a highly-competitive process, the lab provides members with a vital professional network, entrepreneurial and leadership training, free rehearsal space, and most significantly, opportunities for the development and production of bold new work for the stage. During 2013-2014, womens project theater celebrated its 36th season with a lively mix of mystery, tart satire, and dark humor. Offering audiences work that proved to be greatly introspective, this season included the production of three plays that grappled with the concept of cultural currency, and the allocation of value to art and history in america today. All three shows were produced by womens project theater at off-broadways prestigious new york city center stage ii (131 west 55th street, nyc), seating 150 persons. The season included:row after row by jessica dickey, directed by wp lab alum daniella topol, and starred rosie benton, erik lochtefeld, and pj sosko: trish deitch of the new yorker called row after row funny, sad, deep, and smart and noted that row after row is beautifully written and, masterfully acted. Row after row- featuring a cast of 3 actors- played to 3,027 audience members over 34 performances from january 15-february 16, 2014. The architecture of becoming by kara lee corthron, sarah gancher, virginia grise, dipika guha, lauren yee, directed by elena araoz, lydia fort, lauren keating, and starring claudia acosta, vanessa kai, christopher livingston, jon norman schneider, and danielle skraastad: lynnette nicholas of stage buddy called the architecture of becoming a dynamic work. Intriguing, mysterious, and insightful. The world premiere of the architecture of becoming played to 2,195 audience members over 24 performances from february 28-march 23, 2014. The most deserving by catherine trieschmann, directed by wp lab alum shelley butler, and starring veanne cox, kristin griffith, adam lefevre, jennifer lim, daniel pearce, and ray anthony thomas: charles isherwoood of the new york times called the most deserving a frisky new comedy! Pricelessly funny. Theatre reviews limited raved the most deserving is delicious & raucous! A brilliant script, inventive direction and impeccable performances! A hit! The most deserving- featuring a cast of six actors- played to 3,835 audience members over 36 performances from march 30-may 4, 2014. Veanne coxs performance as jolene garnered her a drama desk award for her ability to express the eccentricities, strengths, and vulnerabilities of a range of characters, and notably for her comedic flair. Wp has earned the reputation of producing exemplary work with depth and substance, including these recent hits: catherine trieschmanns the most deserving starring veanne cox, laura marks bethany starring america ferrera, nobel laureate elfriede jelineks jackie starring tina benko, and kristen greenidges milk like sugar starring tonya pinkins. The heart of womens project theater lies in the lab, a two-year residency program for women playwrights, directors and producers selected through a highly competitive, national application process. This season marked year two of wps 2012-2014 lab. Providing both professional development and leadership training, lab participants obtain executive coaching, make professional contacts, and receive training that proves invaluable to their development. With producers in the non-profit and commercial sectors responsible for selecting, guiding, and financing product for production, it is pivotal for writers and directors to forge strong relationships with them at an early point in their careers. Wps lab is the only program providing that essential networking opportunity. By demonstrating the depth, range, and substance of women artists, and by fully preparing women artists to become leaders, the work being done at wp continues to shape our cultural landscape for generations to come. The benefits of the wp lab extend well beyond the two-year residency. Having forged strong working relationships in the lab, both with fellow lab artists and outside professional contacts, lab artists continue to work together and with other brilliant voices in the artistic collective long after their official residency ends. Wps top priority is to achieve a standard of excellence for these artists, advocating for women by producing stellar work featuring extraordinary talent, written by women for everyone. As long as were celebrating the female factor in theater, lets tip our hats to the enduringly vital womens project theater, declared the new york times. Visit us at www. Wptheater. Org.

The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society	http://www.lls.org	(800) 955-4572	EIN 13-5644916	1311 Mamaroneck Avenue Suite 310	White Plains	NY	10605	USA	Cancer	The mission of The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS) is: Cure leukemia, lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease and myeloma, and improve the quality of life of patients and their families.  LLS is the world's largest voluntary health agency dedicated to blood cancer. LLS funds lifesaving blood cancer research around the world and provides free information and support services.  Our Key Priorities will ensure that: The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society helps blood cancer patients live better, longer lives.		create a world without blood cancers.		US / Canada	A) research programs: with advisory input from recognized biomedical research experts, lls funds exemplary projects across the entire research continuum relevant to improved outcomes for blood cancer patients, from basic laboratory science through clinical trials, and from investigator-initiated research to private-sector drug development alliances. Lls is deliberate and purposeful in finding and supporting research that is most likely to help patients as soon as possible. (continued on schedule o) to date, lls has invested almost 1 billion in research aimed at helping all blood cancer patients live better, longer lives. We will continue to support research through our innovative and integrated funding programs, until every patient has a safe and effective therapy. In fiscal year 2014, lls supported research in the u. S. , canada and 7 other countries with a total research disbursement of approximately 78 million. Research funding was distributed across all blood cancers. Our critical role lls programs accelerate relevant research outcomes by: - building a focused research work-force: assuring the next round of breakthroughs requires that young investigators be encouraged to work in blood cancer research fields. - turning discoveries into new therapies: fundamental new findings can be translated into safe and effective treatments that can ultimately prolong and enhance patient lives. - supporting synergy: large grants and contracts enable scientists in academia and the private-sector to collaborate, combining resources and expertise to produce more and faster advances. - filling a void: research projects that are high-risk and/or address rare cancers are less likely to be funded by government agencies or for-profit companies, but may provide important advances. - speeding new treatments to patients: partnering with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies can advance promising therapies through clinical testing, faster. Past advances made with lls research funding generous donors have helped lls support research that has already benefited blood cancer patients and many others. Advances include: - multi-drug therapies that are more effective than treatments with single anti-cancer agents, - bone marrow / stem cell transplantation and supportive care treatments for patients who relapse despite the best available therapy, - tests that distinguish specific characteristics of particular blood cancers for accurate diagnosis of cancer subtypes, and for "risk stratification" to select an optimal therapy. Targeted therapy research discovering the molecular abnormalities that cause particular types of blood cancer has been useful in diagnosis and risk stratification, and in new "targeted drug" development. Lls-funded investigators have helped advance molecularly targeted treatments that can selectively kill blood cancer cells versus normal cells. Many of these new treatments benefit not only blood cancer patients, but also patients with other diseases. For example: - gleevec is fda-approved for patients of all ages with chronic myeloid leukemia (cml), and is also approved for patients with one form of acute lymphoid leukemia (all), myelodysplastic syndromes (mds), myeloproliferative disorders and rare forms of stomach and skin cancers. Related drugs, sprycel and tasigna, are approved for patients who do not benefit from gleevec. One or more of these drugs are also showing promise for patients with various lymphomas, acute myeloid leukemia (aml), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (cll), and other cancers, including brain, breast, head-and-neck, lung, pancreatic, and prostate cancers, and patients with other diseases including alzheimer's, asthma and pulmonary hypertension. - rituxan was the first fda-approved, anti-cancer antibody drug, developed for patients with forms of b-cell non-hodgkin lymphoma (nhl). It is now also approved for cll patients and as a "maintenance" therapy for follicular lymphoma patients, and showing promise for patients with all and after stem cell transplantation. In addition, it is approved for treating patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis and two other types of autoimmune diseases. A related antibody drug, arzerra, is approved for cll patients and showing wider promise. - velcade, thalidomid and revlimid are fda-approved for patients with myeloma and are also helping some patients with hodgkin lymphoma and nhl. Krypolis was recently approved for myeloma patients for whom at least two prior therapies were insufficient. One or more of these drugs are now being tested for patients with t-cell and b-cell forms of lymphoma, acute leukemias, as well as aids-related kaposi sarcoma and brain, breast, colorectal, head-and-neck, kidney, liver, lung, ovarian and prostate cancers, and alzheimer's disease. - istodax, zolinza, dacogen and vidaza target small chemical, "epigenetic" changes. The first two drugs are approved for patients with peripheral t-cell lymphomas; the latter drugs are approved for mds patients. One or more of these drugs are being tested for patients with all, aml, cml, cll, myeloma and forms of nhl, after stem cell transplantation, and for patients with breast, brain, kidney, colorectal, head-and-neck, lung, stomach, prostate and ovarian cancers, melanoma as well as sickle cell disease and persistent hiv infections. - adcetris was approved in 2011, and in january 2012. It is an antibody- drug conjugate that combines an anti-cd30 antibody and the cytotoxic drug monomethyl auristatin e (mmae). It is an anti-neoplastic agent used in the treatment of hodgkin lymphoma after failure of autologous stem cell transplant or those who are not eligible for asct after failure of at least 2 mutiagen chemotherapy regimens. Adcetris was also approved for systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma with failure of at least one prior treatment. - gazyva is a humanized monoclonal antibody used as a combination treatment with chlorambucil to treat patients with untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia. It was approved by the fda in november 2013 and by the eha in july 2014. - imbruvica is an oral small molecule inhibitor agianst btk kinase. It was first approved by the us fda on november 13, 2013 for the treatment of mantle cell lymphoma patients who have recieved at least one prior treatment. On feb. 12, 2014 the us fda expanded the approved use of the drug to chronic lymphocytic leukemia (cll) patients who have received at least one prior treatment. Additionally, it received further expansion to treat 17p deletion in cll with or without prior therapy. - zydelig is an oral small molecule inhibitor that blocks the delta isoform of the enzyme phosphoinositide 3-kinase. It was approved by the fda in july 2014 to treat relapsed/refractory cll in combination with rituxan. It was also approved to use as a monotherapy for relapsed mantle cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. Other active research directions lls-funded researchers are also exploring other areas of research that hold promise for patients: - novel stem cell transplantation procedures: these include so-called "mini" transplants that use less toxic pre-transplant treatments and engineered donor cells that help reduce post-transplant complications, making these potentially curative treatments available to more patients. - immunotherapies: including antibodies, vaccines and engineered immune cells, these targeted therapies help a patient's immune system fight infections and kill residual cancer cells, prolonging remissions, and perhaps one day replacing toxic chemotherapies. - diagnostics: new technologies make it possible to characterize the abnormalities in individual cancer cases in molecular detail. This information can be used to help choose the best possible treatment for each patient, especially as more targeted therapies become available. - quality of life research: these studies increase our understanding of how specific treatments can cause debilitating side-effects, including late-effects, and which patients are at risk for developing these complications, so that they can be better managed or even prevented. Driving research to address unmet medical needs lls continues to solicit and support research focused on improving blood cancer patients' quality of life after today's curative therapies. Also in 2014, for the third year, lls actively recruited research proposals in six other underdeveloped research areas in which progress is likely to improve outcomes for patients with particularly urgent needs. New research is focused on: - development of novel therapeutic strategies for patients with non- cutaneous t-cell lymphoproliferative disorders - develop novel targeted therapies for cll patients, with real curative potential - develop novel treatment strategeies for mds and aml patients - develop novel targeted therapies for patients with high-risk myeloma - development of new-targeted therapies for indolent lymphoma patients - define genetic/molecular predispositions  b) patient & community services: an estimated 1,129,813 people across the united states (us) currently battle leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma. The leukemia & lymphoma society (lls) offers a free, comprehensive array of services to blood cancer patients and their families, volunteer caregivers and advocates, healthcare professionals and the public. (continued on schedule o) lls is committed to providing the most accurate and up-to-date blood cancer information.

Sun receives incident reports online, and through voice and text, from parents, youths, school staff and others, anonymously, if they wish. These reports are sometimes from individuals who are unable or unwilling to contact the police, often because of cultural differences or fear of repercussions, or because they believe that a particular problem does not rise to the level of police involvement. Reports may include suspicious activity and youth-related crime, or a request to identify a reputable resource to help a child. The information is transmitted to appropriate decision-makers in the nypd for their response, when necessary. 3. Sun maintains online, downloadable safety maps with locations and schedules of parent patrols, crossing guards, and police patrolled safety corridors on its website. 4.

OUR MISSION: Enrichment Audio Resource Services, Inc. (E.A.R.S.) is a 501(c)(3) organization. Our E.A.R.S. for Eyes program exists to provide free blind rehabilitation training to vision impaired older individuals so they can continue to live independently. The major elements of the program are: 1) an extensive ongoing community outreach effort which primarily utilizes direct-to-senior presentations at senior centers, housing facilities, etc.,  2) the use of audio taped lessons designed to retrain seniors to perform the normal daily living activities that have become extremely difficult due to vision loss, and  3) our toll free client support telephone center which does initial client intake and provides continuous client support.  2. HOW THE PROGRAM WORKS: The process is simple and unintimidating. An individual hears of our program through our community outreach efforts, places a toll free call to our client support telephone center, a telephone interview is conducted by a vision counselor, and appropriate lessons are sent to the individual, free of charge. Clients then receive follow-up telephone contact after receipt of lessons. No face-to-face instruction is utilized in the training program. This use of communication technology, combined with an extensive community outreach effort, is an innovative, effective, and cost-efficient way to provide blind rehabilitation training to a vast number of older individuals with vision impairments.  3. THE NEED: It is conservatively estimated by the National Center for Health Statistics that in the United States more than 7,840,000 individuals over the age of 55 suffer from severe vision impairment and blindness. The most recent analysis by the Association for Education and Rehabilitation of the Blind and Visually Impaired estimates that less than 4% of vision impaired seniors who need blind rehabilitation training actually receive such training. Therefore, only 300,000 of the almost 8 million vision impaired seniors in the U.S. are receiving blind rehabilitation training, leaving more than 96% or, 7,540,000 seniors without the benefit of training.  4. THE AUDIO TAPED LESSONS: There are twelve lessons which cover basic daily living skills such as cooking, eating without embarrassment, safely getting around your home, managing your medications, personal grooming and bathroom safety, using the telephone, etc. The audio taped lessons are designed to be used in the home with the aid of a sighted helper, like a family member, neighbor or community volunteer.

We save equines from slaughter, neglect, and abuse. Most have been passed from owner to owner, never knowing a herd or consistency.  When they arrive here, they are home. We provide each with the care, training, and space to recover, for however long they need. If a horse cannot recover, they live while they are comfortably able, and 'cross the rainbow bridge' with dignity and friends by their side. Our horses do not live or die alone. Working closely with our professional team of equine specialists, we make our decisions based on what is best for each horse and the sanctuary family. Our horses live in dynamic natural environments, in herd groups, creating vital bonds that are honored and protected.  While adoption is not our focus, select horses may be available to adopt, under a limited contract, to the right home. In addition, we educate horse owners and the general public about the wretched conditions many horses suffer, and how they can improve both the physical and emotional guardianship of horses. Rosemary Farm is 'Where horses get to be horses'.	Rosemary Farm has directly saved over 130 horses and indirectly helped with many more.

Using israeli solar energy, we provide electricity to power schools and orphanages, which allows students to study at night and to medical clinics to provide proper healthcare and refrigeration for storing medicines and vaccines. The solar panels installed in the villages allow for the production of energy to pump clean water deep below the ground in the aquifers, making it available year-round and eliminate water-borne diseases. Each water pump provides rural communities with over 20,000 liters of clean water per day. * using israeli unique technology, drip irrigation systems extend the growing season, preventing hunger and creating revenue generating possibilities. Our engineers have developed remote monitoring technology that detects system failures, and have trained local residents to repair equipment so that villages are never left in the dark or without water. Prior to system installation, residents create a business plan that is implemented by a village committee to support minimal annual maintenance costs. By the end of 2014, we completed 86 solar water and agricultural projects. Since our founding in 2008, we served at least 718,228 people across 6 countries: ethiopia, tanzania, malawi, the democratic republic of the congo, south africa and uganda. *the impact of clean water and power includes improved community health; entrepreneurial and other opportunities for women and children who no longer need to spend their days fetching water; running water improves sanitation; and the community is empowered by improved living conditions and the overall economic and educational opportunities made possible with the addition of electricity.

Not only did the beginning of 2007 see the unveiling of the report by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change but 2006 was the year of The Omnivore''s Dilemma and Fast Food Nation the movie. This conversation has only begun moving into the Jewish community and the bulk of Hazon''s work centers around the intersection of these issues as they intersect a traditional set of Jewish concerns around the health and sustainability of the Jewish community. On one hand, Hazon builds community, develops leadership and builds innovative partnerships around contemporary issues which affect the world as a whole, and on the other hand engages people within a pluralistic but distinctly Jewish context involving prayer, text, tzedakah and practice. Between these two tensions, Hazon ultimately reframes what it means to be Jewish in the 21st century.				National	Hazon is best known for a series of Jewish Environmental Bike Rides, in New York, Washington DC, and Israel which have raised over $2.4 million and given grants of over $1 million to Jewish environmental projects over the past six years. They bring together a remarkably diverse group of Jewish people, foster people's Jewish journeys, and inspire participants. This year, our 7th New York Ride attracted 320 participants, more than eight times as many as our first Ride in 2001, from a wide range of ages and religious backgrounds. Our DC Ride launched on Earth Day 2007 and we had nearly 100 participants. In May, we had 175 participants on our week-long Israel Ride, from Jerusalem to the southern tip of Israel. In 2008 we will be adding an Israel Hike along Shvil Yisrael, Israel?s National Trail. These health-promoting and Jewishly-inclusive bike rides and hike complement Hazon?s food work: Hazon is at the forefront of an emerging national movement at the intersection of food and Jewish life. Hazon's food programs include: Tuv Ha'Aretz, our Jewish Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) program; Min Ha'Aretz, a day school food curriculum; Food for Thought, an adult curriculum; JCarrot.org, an award winning blog on Jews, food and contemporary food issues with 500 unique users a month, and the Food Conference including chefs, farmers, educators, foodies, and food enthusiasts which attracted 150 participants in 2006 and 242 in 2007 with a waiting list of many more people eager to participate. The past year has seen demonstrable growth in Hazon's food work. In 2004 Hazon launched Tuv Ha'Aretz, the first Jewish CSA project in North America. Tuv Ha?Aretz began with one congregation in New York in 2004 and expanded to ten sites by 2007: Houston; New York City; Long Island, NY; West Orange, NJ; Washington, DC; Berkeley; Atlanta; Philadelphia; St. Paul; and Israel. In 2008, we will be up to 18 CSAs with new sites in: Chicago; Los Angeles; New York City; Lancaster; PA, San Francisco; Vancouver B.C.; Washington D.C.; and White Plains, NY. The partnering farmer is supported by a stable base of customers and members receive delicious, organic produce once a week from their synagogue or JCC for the entire growing season. Additionally, CSA relationships provide hands-on educational opportunities for families. Now encompassing an annual food conference for Tuv Ha'Aretz volunteers and sustainable cooking enthusiasts, a family curriculum for Jewish elementary schools, an adult food curriculum, and the JCarrot blog, Hazon is at the forefront of a new Jewish food movement.

There are more than 500,000 children in the foster care system in the U.S. and more than 1 million children who are not living with their natural parents. These children have been through great upheaval and trauma, without exception. So many of these children are living in shelters and group homes and too often are shuffled from one temporary home to another.  Many of these youngsters have been abused or abandoned, and in many cases, have never enjoyed the simple comfort of having a mother or father tuck them in at bedtime and read to them to encourage an early educational experience. They have fallen behind in their reading skills and no longer have access to books to read on a regular basis. They have been removed from school for months at a time with no continuation of their reading practice. Through the Pajama Program, we are contributing to a warmer, more loving and supportive reading environment for these special children.					We provide a steady stream of thousands of new books and pajamas to children in need across the country and to several countries around the world.  There are now more than 1200 Receiving Organizations. (children's shelters, group homes and temporary living facilities) on our list. Our pajamas and books arrive at each of these Receiving Organizations regularly. We receive emergency calls for pajamas and books on a daily basis and it is our goal to answer each request with pajamas and books for the children immediately.

Groove With Me, Inc.	http://www.groovewithme.org	212-987-5910	EIN 13-3919147	186 E. 123rd St. 2nd Fl.	New York	NY	10035	USA	Arts & Culture, Children & Youth, Children & Youth Services, Dance, Education, Youth Development	Groove With Me, Inc. is a youth development organization using free dance classes and performance opportunities as a tool to instill in the young women of East Harlem the leadership, pride, spirit of cooperation, creativity, joy and discipline needed to confront the adversity in their daily lives and throughout their future development. The program seeks to decrease teen pregnancy, truancy, crime, violence, prostitution, substance abuse and gang related activity by nurturing youth, building self-confidence, offering positive choices, and providing a safe place to go.  Groove With Me, Inc. is a community based organization that provides girls with access to girls-only after-school and summer programming. As a youth development program Groove With Me seeks to meet the developmental needs of our youth while building up their competencies. Our dance program is guided by the recognition that all youth need safety and structure, a sense of belonging, opportunities for contribution and leadership, and ways to develop positive character. At Groove With Me, girls develop positive peer relationships, participate in creative activities, feel a sense of purpose and personal power, and meet their own high expectations.  Only one quarter of youth programming in New York City is targeted at girls. While programming for boys and men exceeds that for girls and women in NYC, the increased risk for girls continues. A study by the New York Women's Foundation states that youth who are best able to negotiate the trials of growing up even in the harshest of circumstances often have an adult in their lives who provides sustained support, caring, and guidance. It is not poverty, as many believe, that is the greatest cause of substance abuse, teen pregnancy, and violence in women. It is lack of validation and knowledge of options. At Groove With Me girls find the support they need from adults who are role models and mentors.  Girls' access to after school activities is impeded by safety, household responsibilities, lack of programming targeting girls, lack of outreach by women role models, and peer pressure. Groove With Me addresses these obstacles by offering a large selection of class times and styles of dance that are separated into various age groups. Groove With Me, Inc. offers more than 35 dance classes for girls aged 4-18, six days a week, given by 40 volunteer dance instructors.	100% of seniors graduate from high school versus 60% in East Harlem.	Girls and young women ages 4-18 years-old who reside in East Harlem and the South Bronx	We enrolled 388 over the course of the year	East Harlem, NY	There are 35+ free weekly classes in hip hop, jazz, tap, ballet, theater jazz, Indian Dance, Latin Caribbean, creative movement, and modern.    In addition to our dance programs, Groove With Me offers a Teen Leadership Program to our high school girls. Through weekly meetings, writing assignments, and group activities participants learn what leadership means.  They then put that knowledge into action as they are given the opportunity to volunteer as teen teaching assistants for some of the younger classes at Groove With Me.  The young women of TLC become role models to our younger girls and are empowered to make a difference in the lives of others and in their community.
