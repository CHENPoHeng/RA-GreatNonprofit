We have found that in order for someone to transition from poverty, he/she must almost always have the love, encouragement and support that comes with the possession of committed, authentic relationships - unfortunately, the only relationships most of our friends in poverty know are broken relationships, destructive relationships, and service relationships. inCommon works to break down the dichotomy of "giver" and "receiver" and see communities and neighborhoods restored through mutual life transformation within relationship.We recognize the extreme importance and value of material assistance and programs (federal and private, national and local). However, we also recognize the need for healthy and long-term, supportive relationships in the lives of those we hope to serve. In this way, inCommon equips and assists the broader community in diving into a relationship with someone they might not ordinarily integrate into their lives.	The under resourced Park Avenue neighborhoods in Omaha, Nebraska.		Ford Birthsite, Columbus Park, Leavenworth District and Park East Park neighborhoods.	All of Mosaic Community Development's ministries are focused on building relationships with the impoverished and marginalized in our very own city. SupportWorks is a team approach ministry of small church-based groups or families, which exists to -transform communities through community by developing supportive relational networks that offer holistic care for the impoverished with the aim of ending chronic cycles of poverty and restoring lives. Life on the Brick exists as an entry to healthy relationships by providing food and clothing, which will bridge the gap and help address issues of homelessness. We can think of no more beautiful place to build relationships than over a shared meal around the table. Our goal is to break down the dichotomy of 'giver' and 'receiver', and celebrate life alongside one another. We share a meal every Monday night from 5:30-7:00pm. Park Avenue Community Collaboration is a diverse network of over 20 area faith leaders from 12 local churches and organizations focused on responding in relational service to pressing local needs and concerns. Each Saturday a different volunteer/church group provides a free lunch to the community, with the purpose of meeting practical needs and developing relationships among our Park Avenue neighbors. Together Forward: MCD works to partner with local churches to help mobilize them to connect with refugees in Omaha, in the hope of seeing these churches build relationships with the refugee populations and develop holistic ministries to serve one another. Since early 2007, local church Coram Deo has been serving the Burundian Refugee Community through Harambe (Kirundi for 'together pushing forward'). Each Sunday members of small groups pick up members of the Burundian community, fellowship together at church, then join one another at MCD for a home-cooked meal as they practice learning English through ESL and in the context of community.	We have spent a lot of time with neighbors and residents, serving over 20,000 meals to date!  We have also been spending most all of our efforts bringing the neighborhoods a central Community Center that will open in Spring 2011.

Tri Valley Health System	http://www.trivalleyhealth.com	(308) 697-1522	EIN 47-6028103	Po Box 488	Cambridge	NE	69022	USA	General Hospitals, Health	To improve the lives we touch by providing care of the highest quality throughout life's journey.				Tri valley health system operates a critical access hospital with an attached long-term care unit, three rural health clinics, an assisted living facility, a home medical supply store and an independent retirement center. The cambridge memorial hospital, a 25 bed critical access hospital, operates a full-time emergency room and provides emergency care regardless of the ability to pay. The emergency room had 1,083 emergency center visits this year. Through its integrated network of providers, tri valley health system provides emergency and non-emergency services to the communities it serves. It makes these services accessible to the communities through participation in government programs like medicare and medicaid and by offering assistance through the tri valley health system charity program. The tri valley health system charity program provides discounted and free services to patients who lack the resources to be fully responsible for the health care they receive. The charity program is designed to ensure the communities served by tri valley health system have access to needed healthcare services. The tri valley health system board of directors oversees services delivered under the charity care policy including assessing community needs, approving eligibility criteria and monitoring the effectiveness of the program in providing community access to medical care. Records are maintained to identify and monitor the level of charity care provided. These records include the amount of charges foregone for services and supplies furnished under its charity care policy and equivalent service statistics. The amount of charges foregone for services provided under the health system's charity care policy was approximately $54,000 for the year ended april 30, 2014. Total direct and indirect costs related to these foregone charges were approximately $37,000 at april 30, 2014, based on an average ratio of cost to gross charges. In addition, the health system provides services to other patients under certain government-reimbursed public aid programs. Such programs pay providers amounts which are less than established charges for the services provided to the recipients, and for some services the payments are less than the cost of rendering the services provided. The health system also commits significant time and resources to endeavors and critical services which meet otherwise unfulfilled community needs. Many of these activities are sponsored with the knowledge that they will not be self-supporting or financially viable.   tri valley has rural health clinics in arapahoe, indianola, and cambridge, nebraska. During the year, the clinics had 14,483 visits. The employed physicians are active in the community and provide support services such as attendance at community sport programs and medical directors for emt groups. They also offer educational programs for the local school systems and people in the community with programs such as our healthy in the heartland programs. Yearly the clinic provides "flu clinics" in which flu vaccinations are provided at reduced rates. Also, the clinics annually offer a "health fair" to the communities they serve. Health fair lab testing completed which normally would cost the patient $400 is reduced to a fee of approximately $35 (depending on tests requested).   tri valley health system's senior services programs include a long term care facility, an assisted living facility and an independent living facility. During the fiscal year, tri valley averaged over 24 residents a day in the long term care and 19 residents a day in the assisted living facility. By providing a continuum of care from independent, to assisted, to long term care, tri valley is encouraging community members to stay as independent as possible and assuring the patients/residents are in the appropriate location based on their level of care needs. Tri valley launched the "frog" program which is a free exercise program for the older generation that meets three times a week. The program is currently offered in arapahoe and cambridge because of the high utilization and request.
