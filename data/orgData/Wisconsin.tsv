Frederic Ozanam, a 20 year old university student, is considered the principal founder of the Society because of his leadership within a small group of similarly-minded students. Their model of visiting the poor of the Paris slums was adopted widely, reaching Milwaukee in 1849. St. Vincent de Paul "conferences," as the volunteer groupings are called, were established in several Milwaukee Catholic parishes. In 1914, enough conferences existed to form a "council." This allowed for legal incorporation and the ability to take on broader activities. Over the years, activities have taken the form of thrift stores, meal programs, shelters, and helping centers. These programs have been generously supported not only by the Catholic community, but also by other faiths and the broader community. Most programs, although professionally staffed, maintain a largely volunteer component. Professional staff assists volunteers through training and are available for consultation.

Within this project, we partnered with the city to apply for the national regional conservation partnership program grant. This grant would allow us to work with national programs to assist landowners within the watershed in implementing sustainable land management practices in order to reduce phosphorus levels in our rivers, lakes and streams. We continue to work diligently with both the town of oconomowoc and ashippun on the agricultural enterprise area; encouraging landowners to sign farmland preservation agreements; furthering the creation of a purchase of development rights program; and encouraging the town of ashippun to adopt farmland preservation zoning.

Our outreach strategies included working with landowners in the towns of oconomowoc, ashippun, merton, delafield and ashippun. We continued our monitoring program with newly trained volunteers, and conducted an invasive species removal work days. We received a generous grant from the pewaukee ski club to work on shoreline restoration at north lake that we'll kick off in 2015.   the sixth annual tpc "ride to the barns" a cycling event that highlighted local farms and local food was very well received and attracted over 425 cyclists.

With the assistance of an lta leadership grant, our website was entirely re-branded, we created a quarterly e-bulletin and a new newsletter format. Our carroll college intern created video's that we posted to our website on each of our projects. We continue to sponsor the chamber's winter market in oconomowoc, that attracts over 400 patrons per market in the winter months, where we were featured one month with a presentation. And we hosted tables of tpc information at the clean water festival event, the green team's market in wales, and adopted a night at summerstage, lapham peak.

In the past, 3RNet has not participated in fundraising so this is a new venture.  Currently, 3RNet is developing a new website, which will assist members and the populations they serve reach physicians and other healthcare professionals who may be interested in underserved communities.

The new website will enable better matching of candidates and communities, while being more effective at retention of those professionals.	As mentioned, 3RNet works towards improving access to health care in designated underserved areas.  These are primarily rural, although some members assist urban underserved communities.  Needs assessments in designated shortage areas define demographics of populations, which would include all ages, low income populations and different community health needs.

The website provides to members the number of registrations for a given period of time, sorted by various fields such as specialty, visa or citizenship status, source of learning of 3rnet, and others. Social media continues to drive traffic to the website. However, most new registrations come from sources other than social media. The 3rnet website remains the only secure, non-profit website that helps rural and underserved communities. "users" to the website are physicans, other medical providers, and health professionals seeking positions in rural and under-served areas in the united states. 3rnet currently have 45,675 active candidates registered on its website. Candidates have access to complete contact information for 3rnet members, community profiles, practice opportunities, and links to other valuable websites. Communities/facilities use the website to post practice opportunities and have the same contact information and links available to candidates.

Celebrating open spaces featured over 40 guided, educational outings on land trust-protected properties that had over 1,000 participants, including many children. The land trust also received a grant in 2014 from the land trust alliance to develop a comprehensive community engagement initiative to be launched in 2015 that will help to broaden the reach and increase the impact the door county land trust has throughout the county.

By targeting specific goals and forging strong partnerships, united way is tackling the root causes of critical local issues and achieving real, measurable results for children & education, housing for struggling families, independence for seniors and more.					Born learning goal: "children are cared for and have fun as they become prepared for school. " we have three major born learning strategies that are helping us achieve the goal that 80% of our 4-year olds are at age-expected development and ready to begin school by 2020: (1) home visitation, (2) play and learn and (3) developmental screening. We served 296 young children, and their families, with home visiting in 2014. Home visitation is in-home education and support to low-income parents of young children facing multiple risk factors to help them nurture their children. Our home visitation programs include the parent-child home program, welcome baby, and kinderready. In 2014, 86% of the children who graduated from the parent-child home program had skills that were kindergarten ready. We served 1,501 children and 1,271 caregivers at 14 play and learns sites in 2014. Play and learn sessions are weekly early childhood and parent enrichment programs that model for parents how to be their children's first teacher. The ages and stages questionnaire was administered in all home visitation and play and learn programs as well as through community partners. Our lead partners on these three born learning initiatives include access community health centers, center for families, children's hospital - community services division, and community coordinated child care. Academic success goal: "students succeed academically and graduate from high school, regardless of race. Our major initiatives in this area are tutoring and academic support programs at the elementary, middle and high school levels to help increase the graduation rate in dane county to 95% by 2020, with an interim goal of 93. 2% by 2016. To help all children succeed in school, the schools of hope literacy tutoring mobilized 697 volunteers to tutor 2,168 students at elementary schools in madison, middleton/cross plains and sun prairie in the 2014-2015 school year. Centro hispano is the lead agency partner on elementary tutoring. The result: 96% of teachers report volunteers contributed to increase in student skills. An independent evaluation of our madison program demonstrated that schools of hope students had an average of 19% higher reading scores than a matched comparison group, contributing to an overall 7% district increase in reading growth by 3rd grade and 11% by 5th grade. We are also working to help middle and high school students succeed in school and life. In the 2014-2015 school year our middle school tutoring initiative engaged 558 volunteers to tutor 1,315 students in literacy and math in the madison, sun prairie and oregon schools. Urban league of greater madison is the lead agency partner on middle school tutoring. Our high school tutoring program, achievement connections, recruited 246 volunteers to tutor 446 students in the madison and middleton schools in algebra and geometry in the 2014-2015 school year. Recognizing that students learn best when supported by their parents, more than 600 parents attended programs we organized to model strategies to help children be successful in school. In addition, we partnered with neighborhood, community and school-based programs to promote academic achievement and engagement and success in school, work and life for more than 2,440 youth, including big brother big sisters, boys and girls club, briarpatch youth services, by youth for youth, cambridge youth center, centro hispano, deerfield community center, east madison community center, goodman community center, kennedy heights neighborhood center, literacy network, lussier community education center, madison schools and community recreation, mcfarland community center, salvation army, simpson street free press, stoughton community center, the urban league of greater madison, vera court, the worker center and the ywca of madison.   healthy for life goal: "health issues are identified and treated early. " we have three main strategies in this area: (1) providing access to behavioral health services, (2) providing access to physical health services, and (3) providing access to dental services. Connecting people who have low incomes and are uninsured with health care and dental homes is a primary strategy and proven best practice. Health care homes provide a regular source of care that focuses on preventive care, managing chronic illnesses and reducing the need for hospitalizations or emergency visits. A top priority in this area is our work to identify and treat behavioral and mental health issues that keep children and youth connected to school, families and the community and on-track for graduation. During the 2014-2015 school year 2,661 sixth graders were screened for behavioral health issues and referred as needed for treatment. The face-kids program conducted 116 behavioral health groups for 691 students in 45 schools and 6 off-site locations in 8 dane county school districts. In addition, more than 4,450 students received mental health support and treatment through partnerships with agrace, canopy center, catholic charities, children's hospital - community services division (children's service society of wi), family services madison, and hancock center for dance/movement therapy. In 2014, through united way's support, 1,350 children received preventive and/or restorative dental care through school and community based partnerships. 1,813 children ages five and under received a well-child exam during the year, 125 children with adhd received medical and mental health care and monitoring in a primary care setting, and 775 diabetics improved the management of their disease as a result of being connected with a community-based medical home. United way of dane county's healthconnect premium assistance program allowed 875 low-income individuals to become or remain insured by paying their 2014 premiums for plans purchased through the health insurance marketplace. We partner with multiple health agencies including access community health centers, triangle community ministry, aids resource center of wi, american heart association, and community health charities.   basic needs goal: "there is a decrease in family homelessness. " we have four primary strategies to reduce family homelessness and the number of children in shelter by 50% in dane county from 2007 to 2015: (1) provide quality housing case management and eviction prevention, (2) increase financial literacy, (3) increase access to food, and (4) provide direct access to housing through housing first. Among the results of our work in 2014: (1) 2,345 families and individuals received case management to remain stably housed, (2) 3,401 tax filers were assisted in filing state and federal taxes yielding $3,790,546 in tax refunds, of which $1,515,179 were from earned income tax credits(eitc) to low-income individuals and families and 1,467 households learned financial literacy skills, (3) 8. 7 million pounds of food were distributed to 158,000 households, and (4) 163 families were stably housed in our housing first programs eliminating their time in shelter and improving potential for their children's' school success. Lead partners in this work include the community action coalition for south-central wisconsin, domestic abuse intervention services, the financial education center, and habitat for humanity, porchlight, the road home, second harvest of southern wisconsin, and ywca of madison, city of madison and dane county housing authorities.

The K12 years are formidable in that they are a very short time in which to instill the desire to learn and the need to know to find one's place in the world to contribute. The iterative, experimental, explorative nature of design needs to be part of every young person's schooling to allow for failure, reflection, evaluation and rethinking.

ABCDs One-to-One mentoring breast cancer support service is the foundation of its work. ABCD trains volunteers who have already experienced breast cancer to provide personalized information and emotional support to people now on a breast cancer journey. We call these volunteers mentors and the people they serve participants. Most participants are breast cancer patients, but mentor services are available also for family and friends  an increasingly popular support service.  Mentoring is not a support group, nor does it replace one if you would like that support also. Instead, it is One-to-One support provided directly to participants by volunteers who have been there. The support is personalized to participants experiences and concerns, whether they involve diagnosis, treatment, family issues, professional concerns, general anxiety  or all of these challenges.				PERSONALIZED ONE-TO-ONE BREAST CANCER SUPPORT CREATED BY WOMEN WHO UNDERSTAND ABCD: After Breast Cancer Diagnosis was founded by a group of women  led by Melodie Wilson  who realized that having breast cancer is about much more than biopsies, surgery and chemotherapy. Most of ABCDs founders are breast cancer survivors who discovered that the most valuable information and support came from others in similar life circumstances with similar experiences with the disease. Not everyone diagnosed with breast cancer knows where to find that kind of help. Thats where ABCD comes in.  Based in metropolitan Milwaukee, our services are available for free, anywhere, as long as you have a telephone.

Since 2009:      We've purchased over 120,000 lbs of Haitian green coffee beans, which translates into paying $360,000 to farmer cooperatives and their 5,000+ farming member families.      We've sold over 60,000 bags of our farmer's roasted coffee and over 10,000 lbs of our farmer's green coffee beans (to coffee roasters across the United States).

Currently, 11 of the 15 crane species are endangered or threatened.  The cranes, found on five continents, are adapted for life in wetlands and grasslands.  Destruction and degradation of these ecosystems throughout the world has had devastating impact on cranes and other wildlife.  ICF programs emphasize ecosystems conservation, by working with people at local and national levels to sustain short-term human needs while safeguarding long-term values of functioning ecosystems for wildlife and for people.					Icf headquarters center for conservation leadership - securing the future of cranes is dependent on conservation leadership at all levels, from using the charisma of cranes to inspire visitors to baraboo and the foundation's virtual worlds, to training key future leaders for international programs. The foundation's headquarters training center, staffed with experts in environmental education, field research, captive management, and conservation medicine, is supplemented by field opportunities with foundation programs in north america, africa, china, india, and southeast asia. Each year, we identify and train five to ten colleagues from crane regions around the world and twenty-five or more interns and volunteers. Intense, global networking efforts are focused on identifying, mentoring, and supporting crane conservationists and young scientists in key crane places around the world. The foundation communicates through diverse media about crane and habitat conservation efforts around the world to motivate people to conservation action.   east asia - east asia is home to five threatened crane species including the critically endangered siberian crane and endangered red crowned crane and supports the highest diversity of crane species (eight) of any region. Intense land and water development pressures due to rapid economic growth threaten wetlands of vital importance to crane survival in this region. This program builds on the strong cultural ties to cranes in east asia to engage people and policy makers in conservation of protected areas and their surrounding landscapes. The program also addresses the global impact china's development and resource use will have on crane areas around the world. Key conservation programs in east asia include securing cranes and their key wetlands in the amur/heilong river basin, sustaining viable wintering grounds for cranes in southeastern china, conserving black-necked cranes and their key wetlands in western china, national outreach in china, crane conservation in the korean dmz, and crane flyway conservation across east asia.   north america - the whooping crane is one of the rarest and most endangered bird species in north america. Whooping cranes face critical threats on their wintering grounds in and around aransas national wildlife refuge in texas, and along their long migratory flyway to their breeding grounds in wood buffalo, canada. Foundation programs focus on the conservation of the aransas-wood buffalo whooping crane flock, on establishing a separate flock of whooping cranes through reintroductions in the eastern united states, and on education and outreach to reduce threats to whooping cranes throughout their natural and reintroduced range. The foundation's north america program also includes long-term sandhill crane research aimed at developing cross-cutting strategies for crane management on agricultural landscapes, and captive crane population management and research.   sub-saharan africa and south and southeast asia: sub-saharan africa is home to six crane species, including four threatened resident species - endangered grey crowned cranes and vulnerable black crowned cranes, wattled cranes, and blue cranes. African cranes face many direct and indirect threats fueled by rapid population growth and extreme poverty in the region - grey crowned cranes are in serious decline due to capture for illegal trade and loss of vital wetlands, while wattled cranes are most threatened by large dams and water diversions. The foundation's conservation programs focus on the africa crane trade and global demand; restoring large floodplains for cranes, biodiversity, and ecosystem services; african cranes, wetlands, and community-based conservation; blue crane conservation on agricultural landscapes in south africa; african cranes, powerlines, and energy development; and monitoring and conservation planning. These efforts in africa have created global models for environmental flows and community-based wetland conservation. South and southeast asia - south and southeast asia is home to the threatened sarus crane, as well as wintering demoiselle, eurasian, and black-necked cranes. Strong cultural ties to cranes in india and vietnam provide unique opportunities to engage people in the conservation of these intensely settled landscapes using the sarus crane as a flagship species. The foundation has two key conservation programs in the region. For twenty-five years, the foundation has engaged in conservation of the mekong delta region, including a global model for community based wetland conservation at phu my. In india, the foundation is focused on sarus cranes and wetland biodiversity in the agricultural landscape of the upper ganges river basin.

Additionally, young people enjoy performing the creative work that their internships require, and as a result they are more engaged in the employability training experiences we provide. Our programs ask the Interns to explore who they are, where they come from, and what they believe, and they experience a real sense of pride in creating original pieces of art work.  21st Century Skills: ArtWorks programming is rooted in The Partnership for 21st Century Skills, which has emerged as the leading advocacy organization focused on infusing necessary workplace skills into education. This national organization brings together the business community, education leaders, and policymakers to define a powerful vision for education that ensures every child's success as citizens and workers in the 21st century. Each Lead Artist undergoes robust training in the 21st century skills to effectively integrate them into their art curriculum. All Interns who participate in ArtWorks programs are exposed to the 21st Century Skills during every work shift.
