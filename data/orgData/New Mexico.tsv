In order to maintain its independence, Think New Mexico does not accept government funding. However, contributions from individuals, businesses, and foundations are welcomed, encouraged and tax-deductible.	Think New Mexico is best known for its successful initiatives making high-quality full-day kindergarten accessible to every child in New Mexico; repealing the states regressive tax on food and successfully defeating efforts to reimpose it; establishing a Strategic Water Reserve to protect and restore New Mexicos rivers; expanding access to Individual Development Accounts to help alleviate New Mexicos persistent poverty; redirecting millions of dollars a year out of the state lotterys excessive operating costs and into full-tuition college scholarships; reforming title insurance to lower closing costs for homebuyers and homeowners who refinance their mortgages; streamlining and professionalizing the states troubled Public Regulation Commission; modernizing the states regulation of taxis, shuttles, and moving companies to promote job creation, business formation, and lower prices for consumers; and creating a one-stop online portal for all business fees and filings.

WildEarth Guardians	http://www.wildearthguardians.org	(505) 988-9126	EIN 85-0406306	516 Alto Street	Santa Fe	NM	87501	USA	Animals, Environment, Land Resources Conservation, Protection of Endangered Species	WildEarth Guardians is a non-profit, environmental advocacy organization whose mission is to protect and restore the wildlife, wild rivers, and wild places of the American West. WildEarth Guardians was founded in 1989 and has a long history of conservation successes protecting carnivores, ancient forests, rivers and other threatened landscapes and wildlife. The organization currently operates four major programs: Wildlife, Wild Places, Wild Rivers, and Climate & Energy. As of July 1, 2013 WildEarth Guardians and Wildlands CPR entered into a strategic merger that brings Wildlands CPRa twenty year old organization based in Montanaprograms and staff into WildEarth Guardians Wild Places program, a move both organizations believe creates a single entity better equipped to truly protect and restore threatened wild lands and wild life in the American West. Today, WildEarth Guardians has more than 25,000 members and e-activists, 74,000 Causes supporters, and over 9,000 Facebook likes, the majority of whom live in the 11 Western states. We now have offices in Arizona, California, Colorado, New Mexico, Montana, Oregon, and Wyoming.  WildEarth Guardians relies on a potent combination of litigation, education, scientific analysis, and public advocacy on behalf of the Wests threatened wildlife and wild places. Our new integrated 24 person staff includes lawyers, policy experts, scientists, ecosystem restoration experts, community organizers and fundraisers. Our 2013 budget is $2.6 million, which comes from diverse sources, including members and donors, foundations and government grants.	A few recent accomplishments include:   	Our historic, nationwide settlement with the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service reached in September 2011, which resulted in new endangered species protections for 54 species in 2012 alone, and will result in final decisions to secure endangered species status for 253 imperiled species in total by the end of 2016.   	In February 2013, spurred by legal pressure from WildEarth Guardians, the Public Service Company of New Mexico announced it will shutter half of the coal-fired San Juan Generating Station by the end of 2017. This Guardians victory will prevent more than 5 million tons of carbon dioxide from being released every year  equal to taking more than one million passenger vehicles off the road. 	WildEarth Guardians, as Wildlands CPR, spearheaded efforts to ensure the U.S. Forest Service addressed the ubiquitous threat of off-road vehicles to public lands, which lead to closing of 50 million acres of National Forest land to cross-country off-road vehicle abuse. 	WildEarth Guardians, as Wildlands CPR, convinced Congress to invest $315 million (to date) in the Forest Service Legacy Roads and Trails Program, which funds road reclamation and in turn protects drinking water supplies and endangered fish habitat across the American West.				Wild places: the american west is a place set apart with abundant public lands and remnant ancient forests, pristine grasslands, and wild headwaters and streams, which remind us of the spectacular richness that once epitomized this region. Wildearth guardians' wild places program protects public lands with a primary emphasis on national forests and bureau of land management lands. There are more than 300 million acres of public lands in the 17 western states, and our goal is to prevent their capture and destruction by private, extractive interests. Sadly, many of the diverse ecosystems in the west are in trouble. For example, the southwestern ponderosa pine ecosystem, the interior west's sagebrush sea, and fragile streams and wetland habitats are all considered endangered ecosystems. While advocating to end activities that threaten to destroy our public wildlands in the american west, we also work to ensure that they remain biologically intact and ecologically functional by actively restoring previously damaged lands, waters, and ecosystems. Our accomplishments mean not only greater protection for wild landscapes but also the wildlife, water and air that make them the treasures we cherish. 2014 specific accomplishments: --we succeeded in our bid to get the highest degree of protection for 200 miles of colorado streams and rivers that provide pristine habitat for the colorado river cutthroat trout. --our coalition work paid off when congress increased the budget for road reclamation and fish habitat improvement by 5 million (or 14%) boosting restoration of our national forests. --we completed the first voluntary grazing waiver on the gila national forest, giving wolves over 28,000 cow-free acres to roam. --we planted more than 100,000 trees and other plants on public lands to improve watershed health and wildlife habitat. --along with our partners, we reached an agreement with the forest service that will save imperiled wildlife and plants, keep clean air clean, and safeguard 1. 7 million acres of our public lands in utah from damaging oil and gas drilling.   river restoration: wildearth guardians balances our reform of public lands policy and protection of wild places with on-the-ground forest and watershed restoration. Active restoration provides opportunities for members and volunteers to give back to future generations and creates jobs in rural, land-based communities. Wildearth guardians is restoring fragmented forests and waterways polluted by domestic livestock and a legacy of logging roads. We've replanted native riparian vegetation on hundreds of miles of rivers and streams and removed barbed-wire fence that impedes wildlife movement. In collaboration with land management agencies and local contractors, we are rewilding large landscapes and wildlife corridors as well as restoring hydrological function. This work is part of a larger climate change mitigation and adaptation strategy. 2014 specific accomplishments: --planted approximately than 100,000 native trees and native forage species including: 102,000 bebbs, strapleaf, and coyote willow, 900 aspen, 400 cottonwood, 700 bog birch, 700 thinleaf alder, 200 chokecherry. --plantings covered 3. 49 miles of stream. --protected more than 3 miles of stream and 55 acres of riparian habitat from livestock use. --restored 30 acres of prairie grassland. --constructed 50 prairie dog burrows. --created 8 acres of wetland habitat.   wildlife: the american west hosts a dazzling array of native wildlife and plants, from the mighty black bear and grey wolf, to minute caddisflies, springsnails, and irises. The diversity of life in the region is a product of varied topography and a multitude of ecological niches that these native species call home. Wildearth guardians works to protect the vast spectrum of native species because they have an inherent right to exist, and because we, like most people, value wildlife, wildlands, and naturally functioning systems. With ecological function and biodiversity come amenities such as clean water, clean air, and natural landscapes to watch wildlife. From common species such as the coyote to rare creatures such as the black- footed ferret and lesser prairie chicken, the fauna and flora of the west form the very threads in the vibrant tapestry of life. We work to preserve that tapestry, rather than let it unravel. 2014 specific accomplishments: --for the second year in a row, we prevented a wildlife killing contest targeting wolves and coyotes from occurring on over 3 million acres of public land in idaho. --we secured endangered species act protections for key sagebrush sea species, including the gunnison sage grouse and lesser prairie- chicken. --after a decade of advocacy, we obtained endangered species act protections for canada lynx wherever the species roams in the lower 48 states, including the wilds of new mexico and colorado. --we filed suit to overturn flawed decisions denying needed protections to imperiled species including the wolverine and gunnison's prairie dog. --we helped generate over 1. 5 million public comments telling the u. S. Fish and wildlife service to keep gray wolves protected under the endangered species act.   climate and energy program: our vision is simple - a future 100 percent powered by renewable energy by 2035. To get there, the goal of our climate and energy program is reform that prioritizes energy efficiency and conservation, phases out fossil fuels, and embraces environmentally appropriate clean power sources. The tragedy of the gulf oil spill was a disturbing reminder of just how much we stand to lose by relying on fossil fuels. That's why wildearth guardians' goal has been and continues to be simple: to help clean energy take root by exposing the true cost of fossil fuels. 2014 specific accomplishments: --we defended the climate from coal mining in the american west, both spoiling plans for expanded mining on our public lands in western colorado and preventing the federal government from selling more than one billion tons of coal in the powder river basin of montana and wyoming. --we made it more difficult for the coal industry to pollute our air, successfully petitioning the federal government to limit toxic orange clouds produced from blasting at coal mines. --we forced utility companies in colorado, utah, and wyoming to either risk spending millions to upgrade their existing coal-fired power plants or instead invest in more affordable solar and wind alternatives or greater efficiency and conservation measures. --we thwarted fracking on 20,000 acres of public lands in the greater chaco region of new mexico and are gearing up to defend hundreds of thousands of additional acres in the west from the oil and gas industry's greed.

St. Vincent's mission is as follows: our healing ministry is to improve lives by providing excellent, compassionate healthcare to the patients and families we serve. We care for all the people of santa fe, northern new mexico and southern colorado, regardless of their ability to pay. Our vision is exceptional medicine, extraordinary care, every person, every day. In april 2008, christus health and st. Vincent regional medical center finalized the formation of a partnership that allowed st. Vincent to benefit from the resources of christus health's international 60-hospital system. St. Vincent is designated as a "sole community provider" by the centers for medicare and medicaid services (cms) and is accredited by the joint commission on the accreditation of healthcare organizations (jcaho). St. Vincent hospital is the only trauma center (level iii) in north central/northeastern new mexico. As the largest hospital facility north of albuquerque, new mexico and south of pueblo, colorado, st. Vincent has 268 licensed beds, 24 physician and outpatient locations, and 380 medical staff representing 54 medical specialties (85 employed physicians). In fiscal year 2014, st. Vincent hospital served nearly half a million individuals, including 49,824 visits to our emergency department; 9,645 surgery procedures; 11,150 inpatient admissions; 1,250 deliveries and 138,953 outpatient visits through the outpatient medical practices. St. Vincent hospital provides direct care services, including those provided by employed physician practices, to inpatients and outpatients, including indigent, medicaid, other payor classes and uninsured patients. St. Vincent's community benefit includes the cost of providing uncompensated care and services for patients with limited or no means to pay, government programs where expenses exceed payments, and non-billed services directed to improving the health and well-being of all members of the community we serve. St. Vincent hospital provides a full range of inpatient and outpatient services to the people from the communities it serves. It conducts its activities and serves all patients without regard to race, color, creed, religion, gender, orientation, disability, age or national origin. By collaborating with communities, schools, churches, businesses and other healthcare organizations, st. Vincent hospital has strengthened its role as a major provider of comprehensive, accessible healthcare services. These partnerships within the community have been a blessing by helping st. Vincent better serve those in need. These partnerships help to insure that the people of our community receive integrated health care and have access to an array of services that addresses the social determinants of good health. Additionally, our dedicated associates and volunteers play a significant role in contributing to improving the health and well-being of the community by dedicating their time to support community health activity. They help to build strong relationships between st. Vincent and other healthcare organizations and the community, nurturing christus' mission to meet healthcare needs and make a difference in the lives of others. Our employees work both inside and outside the walls of our healthcare facility and are committed to reaching beyond the traditional hospital structure to help our communities maintain good health. Among the general medical/surgery services offered at st. Vincent hospital and its employed physician practices are: day surgery, orthopaedics, neurosurgery, interventional cardiology and vascular surgery, cancer treatment center, cardiopulmonary inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation, sports medicine, diagnostic imaging services, wellness programs, occupational and speech therapy, respiratory care, inpatient behavioral health services, women's services and pediatrics, inpatient and outpatient laboratory services, diabetes care, sleep center, wound and hyperbaric care, specialized care to victims of domestic violence, and nutrition and dietary services. St. Vincent hospital provides a 24-hour emergency room that is open to serve all those in need of emergent care, regardless of their ability to pay.

All qualified physicians who are granted privileges to serve with us in our facility and outpatient locations must undergo a thorough and comprehensive credentialing process.   other government sponsored services in addition to the provision of charity care and other community services, st. Vincent hospital provides services to persons covered under government-sponsored programs, including medicare and tricare. The unreimbursed costs of these services are reported to the state of new mexico but are not included in reports prepared following catholic health association guidelines. Christus health, a member organization, provides services to persons covered under the federal medicare program, and in fact, this is the largest single payor classification of patients served by the health system. The payment rate for inpatient services is on a per-case rate, calculated based on the diagnostic-related group (drg) into which the patient is categorized. Medicare reimburses outpatient services based on its fee schedule.   community benefit reporting - charity care and medicaid christus health, a member organization, adheres to the catholic health association's a guide for planning and reporting community benefit (2012). Community benefit, reported as unpaid costs, includes both charity care and community services. To the limits of its resources, christus health is an institution of purely public charity; thus, the most tangible expression of christus health's charitable purpose is the provision of health care services to those persons who are unable to pay. This falls into two categories: charity care and unpaid government indigent care. In keeping with the mission, values, and vision of christus health, st. Vincent hospital provides charity care services in a manner that respects the dignity of the patients and their families. Charity care is provided without charge or at a charge that is less than the usual charge for such services. The determination as to the amount to be charged, if any, is made according to a patient's ability to pay as determined by established eligibility criteria. For uninsured patients whose economic circumstances place them at or under 200 percent of the federal poverty level (fpl), services are provided without any expectation of payment. No patient is refused necessary medical care based on his or her ability to pay. St. Vincent hospital provides direct care services, including those provided by employed physician practices, to inpatients and outpatients, including indigent, medicaid, other payor classes and uninsured patients, totaling approximately 185,440 encounters. St. Vincent hospital's community benefit includes the cost of providing uncompensated care and services for patients with limited or no means to pay, government programs where expenses exceed payments, and non-billed services directed at improving the health and well-being of all members of the community we serve. St. Vincent hospital is an active participant in new mexico's medicaid programs. Those programs seek to provide payment for health care services to individuals who meet certain financial and other requirements, which include evaluation of both assets and income. New mexico has accepted the opportunity to expand medicaid eligibility through the health care reform act. This will have a positive impact in promoting the ability of st. Vincent to provide care to this larger population.

Creativity for peace is the only organization simultaneously working with young palestinian and israeli women on collaborative leadership and peacemaking. Since 2003, 239 young women have participated in our program. They are 15-23 year-olds of muslim, christian, jewish and other backgrounds from israel, the west bank, and gaza. The entry point of our work is an intensive summer program in santa fe, new mexico that uses art and dialogue to introduce the story of the "other", foster understanding, friendship, and partnership, teach communication and self-awareness, and encourage advocacy for peace. In 2014, 16 young women attending our summer camp underwent powerful transformations from anger to compassion and pain to hope. Our work continues year-round in israel and palestine with workshops, seminars, small gatherings of girls by language and location, and follow-up meetings for specific camp years. Camper-graduates are expected to participate in our young leader training which takes place for six weekends throughout the year and focuses on the development of emotional and practical skills for leadership and peacemaking. In year two, leaders execute social-change projects of their choosing. More than 60 young women are training as young leaders, giving public talks in the united states and israel/palestine, working as junior counselors in our summer program, and participating as workshop leaders and in other capacities with our organization. Creativity for peace also awards a limited number of academic scholarships to young women in our program who have financial need and demonstrate extraordinary leadership. In 2014 four of our participants studying in ramallah, palestine; cyprus; and eugene, oregon received scholarships. Our programs have had a significant impact on americans as well, educating them about the conflict in the middle east and what they can do to contribute to peace. In 2014 thousands of people learned of our work through some 40 media appearances and talks in schools, universities, churches, synagogues, and community organizations. Young leaders facilitated two workshops on transformation conflict for young american women in new mexico and texas. Approximately 150 people volunteer with our organization year-round. Dozens of businesses and individuals contribute in-kind goods and services. Our young women are influencing others through presentations about their peacemaking work in the army, their communities, and in national and international venues, such as the united nations.

The interfaith community shelter is largely a volunteer organization that consists of 40+ faith and community groups and 2400+ volunteers. Volunteers serve in two different capacities in the night shelter. The core team is a rotating group of 5-6 trained volunteers who serve from 5pm to 9pm, seven days a week during the shelter season. They are responsible for providing oversight of all shelter operations, including registration of guests, security checks, luggage storage, bed assignments and work closely with the night program manager and paid overnight staff.

All services are free to our clients.				Santa Fe and surrounding area	In the past year bienvenidos outreach has seen a slight decrease in the number of food boxes distributed (15,921 for fy 14-15 vs. 17,943 distributed in fy 13-14) and saw a decrease in the number of lunches distributed in our lunch bag for the homeless project (15,303 for fy 14-15 vs. 18,468 in fy 13-14). Of these clients, there were a total of 663 families (1,844 people total) who applied for assistance with us for the first time. Food donations were down this past year again, primarily due to fewer large food drives by schools, churches and other establishments, but we were able to maintain our food distribution because of the variety food we purchased from the food depot at reduced prices using donations/grants earmarked solely for food purchases. Healthier food choices and reasonable pricing available through our food depot and an increase in healthy beverages from pepsi (low sugar juices, bottled water) allowed us to continue our smart breakfasts = smart kids project. Other projects include free clothing, house wares and books to our clients (there were 7,980 visits to our clothing room in fy 14-15), a decrease of 2,541 visits from the prior year. The christmas gifts project for children (378 children receiving 756 gifts) continues to be popular (numbers slightly down due to children who have gone above the age-limit for inclusion in the project). The decreases in the number of people we have helped can mostly be attributed to people moving out of the area and people who no longer need our services as they have found gainful employment.

Santa Fe Watershed Association	http://www.santafewatershed.org	(505) 820-1696	EIN 86-0996109	1413 Second St	Santa Fe	NM	87505	USA	Environment, Forest Conservation, Pollution Abatement & Control, Water, Water Resources, Wetlands Conservation & Management	The santa fe watershed association began in 1999 to protect the santa fe river and its watershed, and to restore the river as the heart of our community. The work of the santa fe watershed association is organized around the programs described part iii.					Restoration project: ojito de los arellanos is a large spring and wetland site found in connection with our site assessment of arroyos on the east side of dixon. This spring was formerly used for household watering by the arellanos and their neighbors in the village below, when good drinking water was at a premium. The treatments implemented help restore the natural hydrology of the site, filling in the gullies and raising the local water table.   adopt-the-river program 2013 marks the eleventh anniversary of adopt-the-river. The "adopt" program invites businesses and volunteer groups to care for the physical appearance of the river channel and corridor, and to serve as guardians of a particular river reach. The program is sponsored by both the city of santa fe and santa fe county, as well as through private businesses and individuals who "adopt" one of the 28 river reaches. The program also sponsored a "love your river day" (river clean-up) in february, a public clean up day.   outreach and education - through annual events, activities, and classroom programs, the watershed association helps our community become more aware of how the river interacts with the physical watershed (the land), the social watershed (all of us), and the biological watershed (animals and plants). In 2013, just over 1,000 public school 4th, 5th & 6th graders participated in the my water, my watershed program designed by our education staff. This seven hour program provides experiential, science-based curriculum that enables students to explore their watershed, learning about the complex relationships between living things and their environment. Students are taken into the upper watershed to see nichols reservoir, study macroinvertebrates in the river, learn the characteristics of a healthy forest, and visit an abandoned beaver lodge. Middle school students collect water samples twice a year to compare data with the water quality further downstream. We also held our summer programs, working with the city of santa fe summer youth programs. The day long field trips mirrored our curriculum taught during the school year. For many kids, this is the longest theyve been away from electronics and the first time theyre seen such a large body of water. Its also, often, the first time theyve been in a river.

We continued to teach students to train dogs to help our clients. Our student trainer programs encompass a varied spectrum of learning forums including classes in mainstream schools, after school and summer programs, and programs for children and adults with developmental, cognitive and physical disabilities. This work enriches our communities through building skills and inclusion within mainstream (50%) and at risk student (50%) audiences. We continued our highly successful "summer camp" programs in albuquerque and santa fe. These innovative camps are for mainstream children as well as children with disabilities, their caretakers, and/or their siblings providing an inclusive forum for learning. More than 150 youth participated in our classes during the year, each one learning important lessons in communication, empathy, patience, compassion, and selflessness. Adw placed three assistance dogs with clients needing help with challenges from ptsd, anxiety/depression, seizures, and mobility impairment. We expanded our capacity to benefit these types of clients by forming new collaborations with dog breeders, to obtain puppies well-suited to these varied tasks. Focusing on purpose-breed dogs has increased the success rate of finished dogs suitable to service dog work. Professionally trained courthouse dogs are working throughout the country inprosecutor's offices and child advocacy centers to assist crime victims and witnesses as they participate in criminal justice proceedings. Working with a legal professional (childrens' advocates, forensic investigators, or volunteers), the courthouse dog serves as a catalyst to help children relax, feel safe, and more effectively participate in the judicial process. Adw continues to collaborate with the national courthouse dogs foundation inthe placement of these highly-skilled dogs. In addition to providing on-going support and training for the six courthouse dogs previously placed in new mexico and arizona judicial settings, adw trained and placed six new dogs in southern nm and tucson, az. Trainings were provided for judical professionals in the care, handling and utilization of the dogs. Adw also has requests from several additional judicial districts for these amazing working canines. Each courthouse dog provides comfort and support to hundreds of children and adults in stressful courthouse settings every year. Adw continued to offer owner/self-training classes for clients needing help training their own dogs to assist with disabilities. Three clients obtained training classes from us during the period, and adw staff trainers worked with them to train their dogs for diabetic alert, ptsd/anxiety/depression support, and physical assistance. Student trainer program evaluations are conducted regularly with schools, agencies and families to assess student learning, recognize achievements and identify areas for improvement. Adw tracks client/dog teams continuously through a follow-up process of monthly staff review and annual surveys, calls and visits, medical reviews, trainer evaluations, public access testing/certification, and lasting client relationships. Adw also collects metrics of client satisfaction, dog service time, and client/dog team success, which are used for program improvements. This valuabledata on program success and areas for improvement is incorporated into program development on an on-going basis. The year was extremely fruitful for adw, meeting its goals, expanding services, working with existing collaborations and establishing newones, instructing new student trainers, and of course, providing the gift of life-changing assistance dogs to our clients. Students gained knowledge, assumed responsibility and developed a compassionate awareness of people with different abilities, while making concrete contributions to their community. Highly trained dogs were matched with grateful clients to assist with issues of physical mobility challenges, diabetes, ptsd, and more. Courthouse dogs, who touch the lives of many in their careers, helped children and adults cope with the extreme emotional challenges involved in the judicial process. We look forward to the future, starting new projects while maintaining ourlong-standing relationships, teaching new students to share in the joy of training service dogs for others, working to expand and improve our capacity to provide trained dogs to those who need them, and welcoming new faces to join us in our mission.

Imus Ranch Inc	http://	(203) 656-0700	EIN 13-3997308	Po Box 250	Ribera	NM	87560	USA	Camps, Sports	The primary exempt purpose of the imus ranch inc. Is to provide children with cancer or serious blood disorders as well as children who have lost brothers and sisters to sudden infant death syndrome, the experience of the great american cowboy.					The imus ranch is an authentic working cattle ranch nestled beneath a majestic mesa in the rolling hills near ribera, new mexico, fifty miles northeast of santa fe. The ranch was conceived and designed with the sole purpose of providing the experience of the great american cowboy to children suffering from cancer or serious blood disorders, and children who've lost brothers and sisters to sudden infant death syndrome. The ranch's objectives are to encourage in them a sense of achievement, responsibility and self-esteem, and to instill pride and restore their dignity as they become aware of just how much they are able to accomplish. Many have become convinced that because they are sick they are not normal. At the imus ranch they quickly discover that they can do anything any other kid can do. The ranch is a magnificent facility. Nearly four thousand acres with an old western town that rivals any movie set in hollywood. All the kids become part of an extended family living together in the fourteen thousand square foot main ranch house. . . A stunning adobe hacienda that is an architectural masterpiece. Their days are spent doing chores side by side with ranch ranglers and learning to care for and ride their very own horse. They round up texas longhorn cattle, herd and feed the sheep, the buffalo, the chickens, goats and donkeys, taking part in the dawn to dust rhythms of the ranch while developing an enriching bond with the animals that will last a lifetime. The imus ranch is totally and completely organic. They serve a strict vegetarian diet that can be accurately described as vegan in its food selection; no meat, no fish, no poultry, no dairy. Further, all ranch cleaning agents are non-toxic, biodegradable, naturally derived materials that are free of all known carcinogenic substances. In addition, no pesticides or synthetic chemicals of any kind are used in gardening, farming, or infrastructure and plant maintenance. During the year ended february 28, 2015, 20 children between the ages of 11 and 17 had the opportunity to experince life as a cowboy on the ranch, raising the number of children participating since the inception of the ranch in 1998 to nearly 1300. The ranch enjoys the support of the hackensack university medical center in hackensack, new jersey. This support is evidenced by the fact that each session, the medical center provides two well-trained professional child life specialists who are expert in dealing with children with serious diseases. These specialists are on call around the clock to assist children with every kind of need including comfort, advice, discipline and friendship. The medical center also provides doctors and nurses for each session. These physicians, nurses and a paramedic are also on the ranch at all times working side by side with the children and available to assist with any medical needs. It is the belief of those who created the ranch that when children suffering from these very diseases are exposed to the activities of programs like the imus ranch, it not only changes their lives, in many instances the experience can actually contribute to their healing. This belief is supported continuously by testimonial after testimonial from parents, children and other supporters alike, citing how the imus ranch experience has dramatically impacted their lives. The following quote from hamilton jordan, former white house chief of staff, is just one example: ". . . . I have been involved for 23 years with the nonprofit camp for children with cancer, camp sunshine, founded by my wife, have visted imus ranch for a week with children from georgia and have witnessed firsthand the profound impact of imus ranch on these children with cancer. . . . The parents of most of these kids who have been to imus ranch would tell you this was a life-changing experience for their sons and daughters and that a different more confident child came home. I am sure that some children, ready to throw in the towel and refuse addditional chemotherapy, come home with a renewed commitment to fight for their life. I believe that most of their parents would simply describe the value of their child's experience at the imus ranch as being "priceless. ""
