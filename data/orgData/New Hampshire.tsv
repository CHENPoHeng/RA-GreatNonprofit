The mission of the trust is to preserve and protect the rural character of the mt. Kearsarge/lake sunapee region for the public benefit through conservation agreements; stewardship of the conserved land; partnerships with private individuals, local governments and like-minded organizations sharing expertise and efforts in protecting land; and education of the people.					Land protection: aslpt has adopted a written conservation plan which includes a prioritized and comprehensive list of properties worthy of protection. Aslpt protects properties through both conservation easements and fee simple acquisition. Land protection includes review, evaluation and detailed research before proceeding with the protection of a property. Aslpt insures that every transaction is legal, proper and appropriate to the goals of the land trust. We compile baseline documentation detailing an accurate representation of the property and its condition at the time of its transfer. During this fiscal year, we acquired 6 conservation easements including our first easement in wilmot, bird nesting fields in springfield, agricultural fields in bradford, significant wildlife habitat in warner and in goshen, and an important wetland and recreational area in sunapee.   community relations and education: aslpt is proactive in building community relations and educating its members, landowners, conservation partners, citizens and government leaders. Our goal is to be recognized as the place to go for land protection expertise. We sponsor and offer conservation events/workshops/conferences aimed toward building close ties around town land protection issues, growth/development challenges, and concerns about land protection priorities. Additionally, our outreach efforts include hosting a conservation commission chairperson's roundtable discussion semi-annually to share information, resources and experiences throughout the region. We utilize a number of communication resources including printed newsletters, mailings, fact sheets, eblasts, a website, events held on conservation properties, speaking engagements to civic groups and neighborhood gatherings.   stewardship and monitoring:stewardship is the overall management and oversight of all ausbon sargent conservation easements and fee-owned properties. Stewardship includes, but is not limited to, monitoring and defending easements, record keeping, building landowner relationships, landowner, staff and volunteer education, rectifying compliance issues, considering reserved rights (approval or disapproval) and providing reference materials to landowners. Monitoring is the annual periodic property inspections by our trained volunteer monitors or staff, as well as the preparation of documents relating to the inspection and any subsequent follow-up. Monitoring serves as a regular reminder that the landowner is legally bound to keep the property in the condition as defined in the conservation easement. All monitoring reports are reviewed by staff and in the event of a compliance issue, aslpt staff carries out an investigation and works to resolve the issue. Monitoring is done by volunteers; however, our goal is to have staff visit 20 of these properties with the monitors each year. These visits vary in length depending on the size of the property and the restrictions on the property. We generally have a training session in early june for new volunteers and a refresher session for all easement monitors near the end of september. The training is approximately three hours and includes training indoors as well as a field visit. During these sessions we instruct the volunteers on their responsibilities when they are monitoring the property. We also keep the volunteers updated on any changes in policies we have in regards to monitoring.

Global Grassroots	http://www.globalgrassroots.org	603-643-0400	EIN 41-2156862	45 Lyme Road Suite 206	Hanover	NH	03755	USA	Civil Rights, Nonprofit Management, Women, Womens Rights	Global Grassroots is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that catalyzes ideas for social change designed by and for underserved women in post-conflict Africa. Our mission is to unite, empower and support relief of poor, distressed and underprivileged women worldwide.   Global Grassroots Academy for Conscious Change in Rwanda is a 12-18 month incubator offering non-profit management skills, leadership training, personal transformation practices, seed grants and high-engagement support that enables vulnerable women change agents to launch their own grassroots solutions benefiting women and girls. All of the ventures are locally-designed and operated by our graduates as self-sustaining, non-profit endeavors.	Since 2006, Global Grassroots has steadily built a track record of social impact in Rwanda. We have trained over 250 emerging change agents, who have launched 11 sustainable, civil society organizations, and we have a further 9 social ventures now ready for seed funding. Our teams are collectively serving 9,000 vulnerable women and girls annually, and touching a total of over 40,000 lives to date, including the children of venture beneficiaries and the audiences of their awareness work.	Global Grassroots works through grassroots networks and partnerships to identify among vulnerable women, the emerging change agents who are committed to transforming the lives of women and girls. Our participants include widows, genocide survivors, women living with HIV/AIDS, mothers with only a primary school education, and women living on $2 a day. We also welcome into our program men who are eager to combat the underlying issues affecting women and girls, and on average, approximately 10 percent of our participants are men. Our simple application requires that change agents form a team, identify their social issue priority and propose a solution to address that issue collectively. We target groups at the earliest stage of their idea development, and invite between 3 and 5 representatives of each selected team into our Academy for Conscious Change.		Rwanda	The Academy for Conscious Change The first phase of the Academy is a 40 hour intensive, interactive training course that accelerates the process of personal and societal transformation.  Our curriculum begins by investing in a personal growth process for each change agent. Our objective is to help these future change leaders expand their sense of self-awareness, develop tools for transforming oppression and suffering, cultivate compassion and initiate change responsibly. We believe it essential for future social change leaders to invest as much in inner transformation as they do in outer solutions, so that they may avoid the pitfalls of burn-out, abuse of power or pursuits that detract from constructive social change.  We share practices in meditation and breathing to support trauma healing, and promote self-care to alleviate stress.  Finally, by helping women map out their capabilities that can be leveraged for social change, we deepen their sense of agency, as they identify ways to make their own unique contribution.    Integrated with the personal transformation work and conscious leadership practices, the second part of our training provides all of the skills needed to create a plan for a viable social enterprise.  We begin by mapping social issue priorities and diagnosing core causes.  Project teams then enter an intensive venture design process to construct a mission and vision, operational plan, organizational design, budget, creative resourcing strategies, evaluation metrics, strategic partnerships, a code of conduct and communications strategy. Following the academic portion of the program, teams move into a three to six month phase of hands-on project development support to prepare for launch.  Our local staff works with each team to ensure that the project is designed to be self-sufficient, has measurable goals and objectives and will address a root cause of the underlying issue to create systemic change for women and girls.   Projects which meet our criteria for social impact and sustainability receive seed funding averaging $4000 for their start-up costs and a further 12 months of high-engagement support. These locally-designed social ventures are not small businesses, but are instead small non-profits driven by a social purpose to address a priority issue facing women, such as domestic violence, water access or illiteracy.  Evaluation metrics and ongoing assessment are incorporated into the operations phase to ensure the development of a strong organization.

Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests	http://www.forestsociety.org	603-224-9945	EIN 02-0222237	54 Portsmouth Street	Concord	NH	03301	USA		Since 1901, the Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests has worked to establish permanent conservation areas and promote the wise stewardship of private lands. Supported by 10,000 families and businesses, the Forest Society is the states oldest and largest non-profit land conservation organization.				New Hampshire	Property management: the society for the protection of new hampshire forests stewards 180 reservations totaling over 53,400 acres. In fy2015 we completed seven timber sales harvesting 10,800 tons of low-grade wood and 1. 28 million board feet of sawlogs. We restored over 50 miles of boundary line, completed a trail condition report on over 40 miles of hiking trails, and utilized the time of over 125 volunteers in trail and infrastructure maintenance and construction projects. At the rocks estate we harvested over 4,000 christmas trees and planted 6,000 new trees. We hosted over 60 groups for educational programming including bus tours and private tours. We saw over 700 visitors to the maple weekends plus 2 buses and 2 school groups. The forevergreen program with the local elementary school was well attended by all 7 classes. The littleton garden club and the ammonoosuc chapter of the audubon society met at the rocks throughout the year. Bretzfelder park saw a lot of activity on the trails plus 8 educational programs that had an average attendance of 25 people per program.   land protection: the forest society conserved 6,273 acres through 21 land protection projects across the state. Among the projects were 6 fee acquisitions totaling 635 acres and added to our reservations, 13 conservation easements totaling 2,296 acres on land owned by others and 1 project of 3,342 acres transferred to another conservation organization. In addition our staff monitored over 825 easements on more than 137,000 acres.   education, outreach and membership: key accomplishments include launching a pilot program providing educational content to the many school groups that regularly visit one of our newest forest reservations, mount major in alton, nh. We are actively engaged with school teachers in developing the mt. Major curriculum. Our nationally recognized land steward program trained 25 new volunteers-we now have a record 170 land stewards actively helping to care for our forest reservations. Overall we have 387 volunteers who contributed more than 7,000 hours. Our outreach efforts, focused on land conservation and wise use of natural resources including careful timber harvesting, reached thousands of readers, viewers and participants via field-based education programs, tours, annual lecture series, news releases, a regular feature column in the statewide nh sunday news, radio and television segments and special features, blogs, social media, e-newsletters and quarterly publication of forest notes, new hampshire's conservation magazine. In fy 2015 we also re-launched our new website, with particular focus on an online guide to our forest reservations to enhance public access and enjoyment of the conserved lands we steward.   policy: the forest society lobbies state elected officials in concord, nh and our federal delegation in washington. There are two staff members who allocate time to lobbying, and most of that time is spent lobbying state legislators on behalf of the forest society's position on specific pieces of legislation introduced. The state legislature meets from january to june each year and most of the time spent lobbying by the organization's staff is within these six month sessions. The forest society lobbies specifically on bills relating to forestry, water quality, air quality, land conservation, energy facility siting and growth management.

Many companies and organizations have established bridges with local schools to help ensure the future presence of a qualified work force, few programs have been developed on the national level.  One program that has, and has been very successful in its mission, is the national robotics competition of FIRST.  The FIRST conducts regional and national design competitions which demonstrate that engineering, math and science can be interesting, captivating and entertaining as a sporting event.		participants master skills and concepts to aid in learning science and technology through innovative projects and robotics competitions, while gaining valuable employment and life skills.		US and 80+ countries	The first robotics competition (frc) directly served approximately 72,500 high school students on 2,900 teams. Working with mentors, each team built a robot in six weeks from a kit of common parts, designing it to meet this year's game challenge, "recycle rush. " each team participated in one or more 2 to 3-day events at 109 locations, competing for awards for game scores, safety practices, teamwork and other qualitative achievements, stressing the values of cooperation and inclusion. Award winning teams participated in the annual championship event in st louis, mo. The frc program provided students with the experience of applying science and technology to achieve a specific challenge under a time constraint. (narrative continued on schedule o, pg. 149). This experience developed students' technical skills, teamwork and the ability to deal with the satisfactions and disappointments of a real engineering project. Participation in frc has inspired many students to go on to college, pursuing careers in science, technology, engineering, and math. Many frc coaches and mentors work in these fields and help the students develop bonds within their communities and connections to the workforce development pipeline. Students in the frc program are eligible for college scholarships through the first scholarship program.   the first lego league (fll) reached approximately 208,000 students aged 9-16, on 26,044 teams in more than 80 countries. This year's challenge was called "fll world class. " teams worked on game challenges using lego mindstorms technology, applying science and engineering to master complex missions to redesign how we gather knowledge and skills in the 21st century. In april 2015, teams from around the world met in st louis, mo for the fll world festival competition and celebration. The junior first lego league (jrfll) program served approximately 33,000 students aged 6 to 9, on 5,653 teams through a web-based game challenge called "jrfll think tank. " (narrative continued on schedule o, pgs. 149-150). Participation in fll and jrfll has engaged students in a comprehensive experience developing confidence in their ability to address serious issues, enhancing their education in science and math, and exposing them to a stem career. By progressing through each program and ultimately to frc, students gain a full suite of technical skills and ongoing encouragement, making it more likely that they will pursue careers in science and technology.   the first tech challenge (ftc) served approximately 44,000 youths from ages 12 to 18 on 4,445 teams. Like the frc program, ftc is a design and build experience but using a smaller kit and simpler game challenge. In this year's game, "cascade effect," each team built a robot and participated in a regional tournament. Ftc provides an experience similar to the frc program, but is more readily accessible to a broader audience of educators and students, in part because of its lower cost. The ftc experience simulates the excitement as well as the pressure of a real-life engineering project, developing not only the students' technical know-how, but also leadership, cooperation, ability to plan, patience, and teamwork. (narrative continued on schedule o, pg. 150). Like the frc program, ftc enriches the participating students' ability to deal with the satisfactions and disappointments of a real engineering project. The ftc experience expands students' interest in science, technology, engineering and math, and inspires many to go on to a higher education. Like the frc participants, students in the ftc program are eligible for some of the college scholarships through the first scholarship program. By progressing through each program and ultimately frc, students gain a full suite of technical skills and ongoing encouragement, making it more likely that they will pursue careers in science and technology.   the $118,030 of expenses and $3,345 of program service revenue reported are first place (fp) costs and revenue. Fp provided on-site research, testing, and evaluation of existing programs and hosted some training events and conferences related to program development and expansion. Fp provided local educators and students with hands-on learning opportunities during summer vacation and spring break. The first scholarship program attracted 180 colleges, universities, businesses, and professional associations. These organizations offered $22 million in college scholarships to first program participants. First provided guidance to high school students encouraging them to apply. Awards ranged from $500 to full tuition. The costs of the first scholarship program are included on form 990, part iii. The first volunteer program provided support to teams, coaches and our regional staff around the country by recruiting, screening and training volunteers who are needed for all first programs. An estimated 150,000 volunteers, including federally funded vista workers, provide much of the efforts behind first's programs. The costs of the first volunteer program are included on form 990, part iii. The following is the total cost, grants provided, and revenue from our first place programs.

Our primary purpose is to provide an affordable alcohol and drug free environment in which individuals and families can come together to learn and grow. We accomplish this through a series of sober dances, comedy shows, and other social events leading up to an annual four-day multi-cultural camping experience.   Through the barrage of media advertisements, both blatant and subliminal, society has come to associate recreation, professional sports, enjoyable living, etc. with the presence and consumption of alcoholic beverages and/or drugs. Examples include billboard ads, magazine ads, and radio and television commercials. We are trying to change societal attitudes like these through major events like the Half Moon Sober Festival.  Other organizations deal with the prevention of alcohol and drug abuse, and with the results such abuses bring; whereas we are promoting change at the core level. We are presenting an alternative to societys attitude and tolerance toward the necessary inclusion of these substances in order to have a full and enjoyable life by doing the opposite. We are putting on a festival that includes a sampling of societal events in a fun, educational, recreational atmosphere, without the presence or necessity of alcohol or drugs				New Hampshire

Cyprus Friendship Program	http://cyprusfriendship.org/		EIN 45-0666188		Wolfeboro	NH	03894	USA	International, International Exchange	CFP promotes peace and understanding by bringing together Cypriot teens from both sides of the militarized divide with future leadership potential, encouraging lifelong friendships among them, and extending these friendships to their friends and families.	The Cyprus Friendship Program is one of very few projects seeking to bridge the divide between the two communities on the island. It has a high profile in Cyprus and it is transforming the lives of the CFP teens, their families, and their friends. CFP friendships are being witnessed by students in schools and youth clubs across the island and by hundreds of friends of each participant via Facebook and other forms of social media. CFP teen pairs and their friendships, as well as new friendships between their families, are being prominently featured in newspapers and TV across the island. CFP is being given a weekly one-hour Friday night radio program that will be broadcast on major stations on both sides of the divide. And the CFP Graduation, which is held annually in October, which is attended by 400-500, is clearly the largest and probably most important regularly scheduled bi-communal activity on the island.

Word Radio Educational Foundation	http://www.wordradio.net	(603) 859-9170	EIN 02-0453691	Po Box 398	New Durham	NH	03855	USA	Religion, Religious Radio	To offer instruction and training in basic life principles based on the foundation of judeo christian tradition and morality through the medium of radio broadcasting.					Word radio educational foundation was organized to provide a platform to establish non-commercial educational christian radio broadcasting to communities within the reach of its radio broadcasting facilities which would proclaim the gospel of jesus christ and teach judeo christian principles for life. Word radio continues its outreach through wsew 88. 7 fm broadcasting from sanford, maine, to points in southern maine, seacoast and inner regions of new hampshire, and northeastern massachusetts along the i-95 corridor to boston. Word radio brings together its three other radio stations in a separate but similar format as community life radio, operating wrkj 88. 5 fm in gorham, maine, reaching into the westbrook-portland area, wmtp 91. 1 fm to the mount washington valley region, and has been able to upgrade wmek 88. 3 fm in kennebunkport, maine during this report period. Funding to support the ministry of word radio and its broadcasting outlets comes through the generosity of individual donors, participation by program producers, and partnerships with churches, ministries and interested businesses that share the goal of providing christian programming to their communities. A christmas gifts and year end giving campaign was undertaken again this year in november and december by on-air spots and updates with over $22,000 coming in from listeners response. Again this year we were able to conduct the fundraising effort without any disruption in broadcasting daily format by short daily reports of the funding progress. This method of conducting the fundraiser was gratefully appreciated and unique from most fundraising methodologies. As with last year a small percentage of our estimated listenership actually participated in the fundraiser. We are thankful for the few listeners who care enough to participate in our radio service funding to sustain our presence both for themselves and others. We continue to be thankful to a small base of regular supporters and many donors who respond when prompted by god to do so and we receive his provision through them. Because our listeners also support many of the programs heard on word radio and community life radio, their contributions help to continue the excellent biblical teaching heard each day on the stations. Because many program producers share back with the stations by returning a percentage of the donations directly attributable to the listeners of the radio stations, then there is again a broad base of supporters who give indirectly as well to the work of christian broadcasting heard on all of our stations. There is also a base of impact partners who participate in the financial support and includes churches, ministries and christian businesses who believe in the eternal effect of broadcasting the word of god over the airwaves. Throughout 2014 great effort was expended in radio engineering, fcc license applications, legal oversight, and construction activities for wmek, kennebunkport. The result was that the operational listening area was greatly increased in and around kennebunkport, kennebunk, biddeford and surrounding areas on 88. 3 mhz. Word radio added this year a second separately programmed format called, "community life radio" for wrkj, wmtp and wmek in addition to the original format referred to as "word radio" or "eighty-eight seven fm", airing on the 24-hour format of radio broadcasting presented by word radio via wsew. Community life radio - wrkj, wmtp, and wmek continues to be primarily religious, utilizing, for the most part, national programs produced by christian program producers and christian organizations and churches as well as more short features and a bit more contemporary christian music. The 24-hour format of wsew continues to be available for streaming on the internet. To reach the spiritual needs of listeners, biblical instruction continues to be abundant in the form of sermons, dramas and special programming from a variety of speakers and program producers. Many programs aired on all stations are evangelistic in nature, but all programs faithfully present the written word of god to the listeners of all word radio stations. To assist listeners in being informed about the culture and community, listeners have been treated to conservative, christian world-view talk shows on relevant subjects with opportunities for listeners to call in with comments and/or questions. This has included point of view radio talk show monday to friday afternoons aired live on wsew 88. 7 and by recording on wrkj-wmtp, in the market each weekday with janet parshall brings current events and many timely topics to the listeners who can also participate by calling on topics of their interest. Midday connection on wrkj-wmtp is aired each weekday afternoon bringing relevant topics primarily to women in the listening audience. Magazine format programs provided relevant spiritual and motivational topics for individuals and families alike, including dr. James dobson's family talk, focus on the family, haven today, and songtime usa. Saturday magazine format programs include building relationships with dr. Gary smalley , songtime usa from cape cod airing twice daily on both formats, and breakpoint from the charles colson center. World magazine continues to provide their weekly one hour program heard on all the stations at least once each weekend, and also has daily short feature news segments. Straight talk usa with host tom zimmerman is aired two times a week on community life radio providing to the listeners commentary about happenings in the state of maine and the nation. Inspirational music aired from 1 am to 5 am on wsew, wrkj and wmtp as an outreach to the working audience as well as the awake and awakening audience. Late saturday afternoons and evenings were devoted to music of varying genres, from christian oldies, to classic oldies, the pat boone show, bluegrass, a locally produced daily devotional and music program and contemporary indie style. Sunday programming included music for varying tastes, such as choral presentations by the national christian choir, the classic sounds of joy, the gaither homecoming and more christian oldies. Wrkj- wmtp aired a greater percentage of locally originated christian music than wsew during its broadcast day throughout this year. Locally produced music hour featuring the 'music of your life' aired on wrkj and wmtp each weekday morning. Due to the receipt of a financial grant last year, adt intrusion and video security was able to be installed at the remote transmitter sites of wrkj and wsew as well as the main studio site. The grant also made provision for wrkj to install a standby nautel transmitter which because of its superior operating characteristics and reliability is now being used as the main transmitter for wrkj. At the main studio an aging raid storage computer, named "audioserver" which holds and collects audio program files for distribution to other "play-out " computers has had an equivalent backup to its functionality installed. "audioserver2" is scripted to automatically function as "audioserver" when and if "audioserver" fails in the future. This is a great relief to our concern for the inevitable failing of our faithful 12 year old, gateway server. Wmtp, conway separated/ unique program delivery studio transmitter microwave link feasibility equipment experiments are on-going to determine whether wmtp can someday in the near future operate its own separate programming from its new durham studio to its transmitter site. This additional functionality will allow unique programming appropriate to mount washington valley to be broadcast separate from the programming provided to wrkj and wmek. Word radio exists firstly as the blessing of god and an answer of "yes" to a vision now over 40 years in the making. The 24x7 daily operations are fulfilled by its two founding visionaries who by experience and talent remain dedicated to the task of bringing uniquely formatted christian radio programming to the broadcast airwaves . In addition to dedication and talent, automation is greatly leveraged and made to sound as live and "well-done" as possible because the central root message to the public is the most important message that a human being needs to "get". Great caution and calculation is conducted in the operation of word radio stations to do as well as absolutely possible with the faithful delivery of the message and for financial efficiency because of those who put their faith and confidence in us to not waste their contributions.

For epilogos, community development means improving the quality of life in many areas, including health, education, housing, employment, water issues, energy and public sanitation. Epilogos is a nonprofit organization supported entirely by donations.					Housing*in 2014 a total of 55 students in kindergarten through grade 9 received financial support for their school costs, a sports uniform and a pair of gym shoes. This program developed support for needy students through the donations of international patrons from various countries* during the school year (from january until november) 77 high school students received school books and supplies, one uniform for regular classes and one uniform for sports and other basic needs. Thanks to the support of generous sponsors, the students will have support for all three years of high school as long as they continue to have good grades and follow the rules governing their deportment in school and outside of the school campus. * epilogos donates funds for a science teacher, a sub-director and a support teacher who helps students in math and computer skills at the largest school in san jose villanueva, the salvador mendieta school.   housing* epilogos worked with groups from the united states and canada who funded and constructed seven prefabricated houses for families in san jose villaneuva. The families pay up to 25% of the cost of the houses in monthly installments, according to their capacity to contribute. The funds collected are invested in other community projects. * epilogos worked with volunteer groups to fund and construct composting latrines for 4 families the groups had previously helped to build houses for. * roofing and siding material was purchased to have available for local residents to use for repairs during the rainy season. Residents are able to repair their adobe homes to withstand future rain, providing healthier and safer places to raise a family.   health* epilogos worked with a group from engineers without borders from duke university to complete the installation of two water tanks and a wash station that serves 100 families in an outlying village. Community members provided meals for the students and worked alongside the students in constructing the wash station. With these improvements families no longer need to walk the two miles to the river for water during the dry season. * 75 families received water filtration systems through epilogos. This project is designed to improve the general health of families throughout the municipality and to help those who have minimal resources to purchase purified water. The rotary clubs of el salvador help by paying for 50% of the filters and epilogos pays the other half of the costs. Recipients pay a small monthly amount toward the cost of the system. The funds collected from this project are reinvested in other community projects. * 2500 family size ecological stoves were provided to families with generous support from the rotary club of canada. These stoves benefit families of the municipality of san jose villanueva and help improve the health of those within the homes when used as instructed by the epilogos office. These stoves save on fuel (wood) and produce no smoke. Epilogos acquired three ecological stoves for small businesses who make pupusas or tortillas out of their home. Recipients pay a small monthly amount toward the cost of the system. The funds collected from this project are reinvested in other community projects. * the health clinic of san jose villanueva benefits from donations of basic medicines, small accessories, utensils, crutches, etc. These donations come down through many different groups of volunteers who come to visit and build houses, latrines, help out in the schools, etc.   * volunteers also bring clothing which is collected and then sold to villagers at nominal prices to raise additional funds in support of the community projects. Eplogos strives to be respectful of the dignity of the residents of the community. The clothing sale is a festive event that raises additional funds for community projects. Epilogos raised close to $5600 through the clothing sale and from funds collected from the "sale" of homes, cook stoves and water filtration systems. These funds were reinvested primarily in home repair supplies. * epilogos again supported sports in the community with soccer balls, soft balls and other equipment which benefits teams of both women and men. Much of the equipment was brought down by various groups who came to volunteer and to visit the town of san jose villanueva. * epilogos was invited to support a new arts and theater group founded by community members. The group serves about 100 young adults with the goal of steering them away from gang activity. Public performances are held on saint days and other community holidays. Epilogos is working with the group to acquire video production equipment and establish a web site.

Through the exploration of music as a language, the Walden School inspires students to develop a personal, creative voice within the context of an intellectual and artistic community.  The Walden School seeks to encourage broad thinking and active listening, teach delivery and acceptance of constructive criticism, plant the seeds of wisdom, and nurture a life-long commitment to creative expression, all resulting in the development of individuals who are capable of effecting positive change in the world around them.		Creative young people ages 9 to 18, music teachers of all kinds, performers, composers and improvisers	100	All	Founded in 1972, The Walden School has an international reputation for providing thorough and creative theoretical training for young musicians. Amid the spectacular natural beauty of southern New Hampshire and away from day-to-day distractions, students gather from all over the world to participate in an intellectual and artistic community of enthusiastic, dedicated peers, faculty, and staff.   Through a comprehensive curriculum that includes Musicianship, Improvisation, Composition, Computer Music, Chorus, and a host of other engaging courses, Walden students are offered the tools and guidance they need to express them through music. The Walden School is deliberately small, and a student to faculty ratio of 4 to 1 ensures that classes are geared to the individual student.  A dynamic Concert Series, collaborative Artist and Ensemble residencies, and weekly student Composers Forums greatly enrich the program.   Walden School faculty members are excellent musicians and teachers who are distinguished in the fields of composition, performance, arranging, folk music, ethnomusicology, pedagogy, scholarship, arts administration, and arts advocacy.  Over the last twenty-seven years, Walden students have been named prize-winning composers in national competitions including MTNA, BMI, ASCAP, and Delius competitions.  A great number of Walden School students have gone on to distinguished careers as professional musicians, and many are among America's most promising young composers.  The Walden School Teacher Training Institute offers professional development opportunities to help music educators sharpen their musicianship skills, enrich their teaching with imaginative activities, and more effectively guide the creative voices of their students.

We should be given the right to make the same decisions, and to have the same choices and responsibilities as anyone else. We should be allowed to make new friends and renew old friendships and be as independent as we are able. We should be able to live where we want to live and work where we want to work. We should also be included in society and not be singled out as being different. We will work to accomplish these ends in New Hampshire.    About Us:  People First of New Hampshire began in 1992 by citizens who experience disabilities. It is the only statewide self-advocacy organization led by people with disabilities. We support over eighteen chapters and groups across the state. Our work is focused toward bringing people together to speak-up about concerns and common issues. We provide a way for people to build skills to advocate for themselves. We promote empowerment and expect that people will become less dependent on others and find the strengths and skills within to take responsibility for their own actions.    Meetings:  The board of directors meet monthly and the membership meets with the board on a quarterly basis. Local chapters may meet one to two times per month. We hold regular workshops of a variety of self-advocacy topics, and, collaborate to hold an annual conference for young-adult self-advocates.   Goals:  People First of New Hampshire's #1 goal is to help close institutions across the world. The name of the goal is "Institutions: Close Them!  Activities related to this goal have included:  conducting a national survey to determine the worst institutions people are most concerned with so that our board could prioritize action; presented at the National Self-Advocacy Conference in Kansas City, Missouri in September 2010, Members of the board are planning to help other states that have institutions by writing letters to policy-makers, holding rallies, visiting people in other states. In order to do this, it requires travel funds.    Goals Continued:       People First of New Hampshire has a second goal to promote young adult self-advocacy to establish a new generation of members. The board sponsors regular workshops and an annual conference (just for young adults) for which funds are needed.       Young adult self-advocates have organized together to produce a video series called Changing Attitudes, Educating Others.
